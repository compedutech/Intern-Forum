Information Tech and Support",flingthing76,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/380oi7/low_gpa_2_years_experience_no_internship/,"Its the summer right now and I am looking for advice on how I can improve myself to get an internship. Current I have a 2.6 GPA and found that most companies require a 3.0. I went through a difficult time dealing with depression and have been trying since to get my GPA back up to that level. Besides that I have been working two years on campus as tech support in a team of 12 for the college and surrounding farms and extension centers. When I mention this to recruiters though I usually get shot down with a ""We want to see more extracurriculars and different experiences. "" I really haven't had time for clubs and stuff since I spend most of my time working and studying. I thought the job experience would get me a good head start though. Right now I am taking summer classes and doing some Security/Pentest experience on my own. Would anyone have any advice or guidance on how I can find more Information Tech Internships that will look past my low GPA?

Sorry for the weird title. Long story short, my plans for the summer got effed up because of personal reasons. Now I've got nothing to do for 3 months. I spent a couple of hours browsing through CDS listings, but almost none of them are nearby/I don't qualify for many of them.

I'm going to be a junior CoE with a relatively strong background in programming. I know it's pretty late, but I'm wondering if there's anything open at NJIT - research, internships, TA, etc. Unpaid is fine too; just need something to keep me busy tbh. Maybe some professor needs an extra researcher or something? I haven't received any emails lately about anything, just wondering if any of you know about any open positions or can give me tips/redirect me places.

Thanks."
380yy6,1,2015-05-31,I [23 M] am interested in starting a long distance relationship with an old friend [23 F]. Looking for advice.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/380yy6/i_23_m_am_interested_in_starting_a_long_distance/,"**Background (High school)**    
This girl transferred to my high school junior year and we hit it off literally from day one. We hung out in the same friend group every weekend and hung out on our own as well. We texted each other almost daily for the remainder of high school. She was so interested in me, I read the signs and her friends and my friends constantly made this evident. We never officially dated because I had some self confidence issues in high school (fixed that since then), but we were as close as it can get and were pretty much viewed as taken by everyone else (as corny as that sounds).  
  
I loved hanging out with this girl talking to her. I have never met someone who I could talk to so easily. We just clicked talking about silly things to really deep, personal things.   
  
**Background (College)**  
We went to college in different states, each had our fair share of short flings and relationships with other people, but nothing serious. We kept in touch throughout the years, but not as much as we used to. The last two years of college I was living in different states and countries all the time for study abroad and internships so we started talking less and less, probably every 2-3 months. Continually throughout college, I could go say 3 months without talking to her and then all of a sudden all I could think about was trying to get into a relationship with her. We'd pick up conversation more and more from then on and eventually get to a point where there was someone else or she didn't want to commit to it (especially considering I was often living really, really far away), understandable. Anyway, no matter how many flings I had with other girls, I just could not get the idea of getting back together with her out of my head. Like I said every so often, that idea kept coming back to me.  
  
**Current Situation**  
We both graduated college and took jobs in different states, about a 1.5 hour flight away from each other. She texted me out of the blue awhile back and invited me to come visit her (since she knows I am a travel junkie and we haven't seen each other in 4 years. We snap chat each other pretty often and talk every now and then since then. Again, I am considering trying to be more than friends in a long distance relationship.  
  
**What is different now than in high school**  
I have my shit together (not to sound conceited), I didn't in high school. I have a great job, I make good money, I'm fit, I have an exciting life that I am happy with and I want her to become a part of it. Another difference is that I travelled a lot in college and she couldn't, but really wanted to. I think this really changed my outlook on a lot of things, so this may have put a bit of distance between us since we can't relate as much from past experiences.  
  
Basically now I am very interested in her and I'm not sure if she has wrote me off for good or not. I also have high standards when it comes to the girls I'm interested in dating which I think plays a part in why I am so interested in her.  
  
**Looking for advice**  

1. Is this dumb that I keep thinking about getting back together with her? She was the first girl I cared so much about, people often say that it is hard to look past this when you don't have a lot of dating experience.  
  
2. How should I handle things when I go to visit her for a weekend? I'm also going to invite her to come visit me for a weekend before I go to visit her.  
  
3. My thoughts about getting back together are based off of the idea of her, but since we haven't seen each other in a few years I'm not sure how accurate that idea really is anymore.  
  
    
**TLDR**  
My friend [23 F] and I [23 M] were really into each other in high school, drifted apart in college, now I want to start a long distance relationship. Looking or advice in the above section. Thanks!

I am a 16 year old student in the Tampa area and I'm hoping to procure some internships this summer related to computer programming and design.

My skill set:

* Java (language I learned really well first)
* Objective C (I learned quite a bit of Objective-C 4 years ago however never really applied, started up again recently, getting to a point where I'm almost comfortable with the language) 


I've had many projects however I deleted many of them and don't have much to show for my efforts. I can tell you I've made programs related to Minecraft (client modifications, bukkit plugins), administration tools, various script tools for things like controlling computer functions, stock tickers, news tickers, RSS reader, experienced with networking, iOS applications, Cocoa mac applications, some java frameworks. Planning on learning some Spring.


So if ANY developer is looking for someone to intern them this summer, would love to have the chance. I'm not interested in pay or anything like that.

3811nq,3,2015-05-31,Me [22 M] with my roommate and ex-girlfriend [22 F] of 8 months. I need advice for handling arguments,hello258638,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3811nq/me_22_m_with_my_roommate_and_exgirlfriend_22_f_of/,"Hello /r/relationships,

I am in need of advice on how I can better handle a situation. It's really taking it's toll on me and I'm not sure what to do. I apologize if this isn't in the correct format or in the wrong subreddit, I'm new and not really sure where to ask (or even necessarily if there is any solution).

I moved in with my girlfriend in July. We had been dating 3 years and with my new internship far from home, I figured we might as well move down closer to the city. I wouldn't be able to afford all the rent, but for the first six or seven months I could afford it with the money from the internship and then she'd take over.

A little over one month in to the lease she broke up with me, telling me that she just didn't feel loved and wasn't attracted to me. Several days later she admitted to cheating on me very briefly with another guy prior to breaking up with me.

This was all very difficult for me to get past, and for the most part I think I was able to. We were friends before we got in to a relationship and I wanted things to stay that way, even if we weren't right for one another emotionally. I told her I wouldn't kick her out.

Once my internship was over, I was rejected an offer, but managed to get a job somewhere else (where I currently work). She was unable to pay the rent in it's entirety so I told her to pay 60% and I'd pay half. This worked for a couple of months.

I pressured her in to looking for a job while she was living with me but that and several other things led her to seek help and medication, as she was starting to have suicidal thoughts. I gave her a month off of nagging her to get a job and started to pay the full amount of rent again.

She had ever since been taking my car out to bars and friends houses and revealed to me a couple weeks ago that she's been sleeping with several men she's met through social media (though none in our apartment, my only condition).

Today we got in a large argument (as we have a lot recently), because she believes I don't do anything around the house (my chores are to take out the trash and scoop the cat's litter, but she meant I hadn't cleaned the house while she was out for the weekend). While I was angry she hadn't been doing the chores she promised to do, constantly forgetting them and yelling at me when I brought them up (sorry if this seems one-sided).

She says she wants to be my friend, but avoids me because we just argue to much (she's also angry I don't want to let her stay past August). 

I'm not sure what to believe. I'd like to be her friend, just like before, but she doesn't pay any rent (she says since she's never home, it's the same as if she didn't live there), she uses my car all the time (she says because I don't have friends, or a social-life, she just uses it when I don't need it; which isn't false, I really don't have a social network, work and masters program don't leave much time). But I feel so used and every time I try to bring it up, we get in to another argument. Is there any way I can get passed this way of thinking? I just want things to get better.


   
**tl;dr**: Live with ex-girlfriend. Feel used and can't talk to her. Anything I can do to stop the arguing?"
3813a1,1,2015-05-31,Isn't 30% of your income towards rent a little arbitrary? Doesn't scale matter?,Nokarot,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3813a1/isnt_30_of_your_income_towards_rent_a_little/,"I made a thread a few days ago asking about this.  People rightfully put me in my place on a few things, and I re-evaluated my budget quite a bit.  But, I'm still hung up on this 30% thing, and why people put so much faith in it when it lacks all sorts of case-by-case context.

I'm looking for my first big-kid job after a number of years working for less than minimum wage (a glorified internship, you could say).  There, I spent about 32% of my income on rent and had a surplus of ~750 per month (a cheap place to live thankfully).  With the salary of the jobs I'm looking for in a different city, all the math I'm doing suggests I could spend as much as 45% on rent and have an even larger surplus of ~1300.

Being as that I only really spend ~500 of my current surplus on myself (including food, utilities, entertainment, etc) I see it as an upgrade.  Here, I save 250 a month, which isn't much but it's something.  Living the same lifestyle (my own apartment, no roommates) with this other job, I'd theoretically be saving 800 a month.

With that said, I don't quite understand the foundation of the 30% rule, and why scale and lifestyles aren't considered.

Somebody spending 50% on rent making 50k will have a higher surplus than somebody spending 25% and making 25k.  Their taxes will be higher, so it's not nearly as significant as it  seems at first glance, but the surplus is higher nonetheless.  It's not like food is twice as expensive, or that you'll buy two new laptops nstead of one, if you make twice as much money.  Somebody who makes a million dollars a year can still live off $150 worth of food a month, if they really want to.

The only thing I see the rule being important for is for establishing your emergency fund: the higher your rent, the more money you'll need set aside, but I feel like that can have a cap and that skimping on quality living can do more harm than good.

So why, specifically, do they say 30%?  Why not 40%, or even 50%, if your lifestyle is such that the scale of your income can still support your needs and goals?  The number just seems so arbitrary to me.  Some people spend 40%+ of their income on booze, cigarettes, fast food, entertainment, transportation, and all sorts of other stuff that doesn't come in to play for my lifestyle.  So if I can bike/walk to work, cook for myself, avoid unnecessary expenses, and stay entertained with little more than an internet connection, is there anything inherently wrong with using a 45% rule instead of a 30% rule?

I understand that it's WISE to save as much money as possible, but why does the rule make it sound like it's required?"
38189e,1,2015-05-31,Hate where I'm at,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38189e/hate_where_im_at/,"I'm probably about to sound whiny and spoiled here, but I'm miserable.

In August I'll be leaving for California to start Law School, but until then I'm stuck staying with my mom in my podunk hometown located in nowhere Texas. I'd head out earlier, but since I'm staying in the school housing for law students I can't move in until around August the 11th. This also means that there is no point in getting an apartment or other housing elsewhere for less than 6 months or a year (especially considering money should be tight once law school in California starts kicking in). Long story short, I'm stuck here for a bit (and have been already for a little while).

I hate staying with my mom, I love her, but she's hard to stay with. I'm afforded almost no independence here, regular texts and calls asking where I'm at, coming into the room I'm staying in every ten minutes asking about me, etc etc. I know it's because she cares, but I'm feeling seriously suffocated here. There is only so much family time I can take before I start to go mad. I've talked to her about this, but she either doesn't listen or gets offended and I end up feeling like an ass for bringing it up. The fact that I'm solitary by nature does not help the situation. 

There is also my mom's boyfriend.

I really can't stand my mom's boyfriend. He lives with her right now and is literally ALWAYS at the house. He's just as bad as she is about not allowing me ten seconds to myself. Only he constantly talks about things I really couldn't care less about. He rambles on for ages whenever he talks to. I have never had a conversation with this man that I did not have to end because it didn't make me late for something else. I use the word conversation liberally here, because in reality it's more him talking about how he has to deal with difficult renters, fishing, or getting a bargain on a knife for 45 minutes while you nod, try to change the subject, then fail at doing so. Like oil and water me and this guy, I stay quiet enough about it because my mom seems to like him and to keep peace, but oil and water me and this guy.

The town I'm stuck in I'm not find of either. When I graduated high school everyone I knew left town. That was four years ago. No one came back. So I don't know anyone in town anymore, and from the culture of the place, I don't much want to. I've tried going out or getting involved in things, but the nightlife and recreation options are incredibly limited. I've always said there's something in the air here, it makes people unhappy, you get stuck in place, nothing's gained and nothing's lost, it's purgatory with pop-country music stations and overweight evangelicals. I know I'm only here for a little while, but all my anxiety, the drugs, all the unhappiness I thought of escaped from in high-school, all the ugliness and everything has just been right here waiting for me. It makes me feel like I didn't actually grow at all during the four years I spent at undergrad. I didn't feel that way until I came back home, now I'm feeling like I'm just getting sucked back down.

Compounded with all that are some real feelings of regret. I minored in Japanese language and also took a number of courses in Mandarin. I have however over the last year and a half let it completely lapse. I feel like I've forgotten so much of it. I spent a year studying abroad in Japan, completing my minor, and becoming pretty proficient, but after I came back I had almost no time to study Japanese. My classes during my last last year were incredibly difficult and between them and studying for the LSAT (practically a full time job on its own) I had no time to keep it in shape. Then came my internship in D.C. that was just as busy. I still would have done things the way I did, but it really eats away at me that I feel like I've forgotten so much Japanese and Chinese. These feelings are made worse by everything else. I used to be really into music and even played in a local band, but I let that lapse as well when things got busy for the year and a half when school, work, the LSAT, and internships just ate all my time away. Now I'm trying to re-learn these things, but it's so discouraging how much I've forgotten, and these depressed feelings kill my motivation.

I just feel completely stuck in a mire. I'm usually really type A, stable, driven, and a really pretty happy guy, but right now I just feel empty, if I'm filled with anything at the moment it's just venom. Thanks for reading, I just needed to whine some I guess. I'm not sure what to do to kick myself out of it,  I can usually pull myself up by my bootstraps, grin, bear it, and come out better and on top. I've made things happen in the past and I know this mopping around isn't going to help. I just can't seem to shake the bad feelings this time. Not having internet at all outside of my old phone is really causing some serious net withdrawals as well, especially when it's important for me to stay in contact with my law school leading up to my move in.

I'm in a bind. First day on the internship, I've forgotten my outlet converter at home (I'm from abroad, from the US). The folks at work have given me another laptop to use just in case, but I'm currently wondering if I can just use the power brick from the other laptop (because it has the right outlet head) to charge my laptop anyway. 

The ratings on the two bricks are:

**Mine:**

Input 100-240V ~ 2.2A 50-60 Hz 
Output 19.5V --&gt; 6.15A

**Theirs:**

Input 100-240V 50~60Hz 1.2A
Output 19V --&gt;3.42A

From my very basic understanding of electronics, I could technically use the one they gave me because the dongle from brick to laptop is the exact same, and I can just swap wires, but *the charge will just be a lot slower* than what my brick can manage.

And then even after that, if I happen to do something faster/cleaner than someone, the reply I often get is something along the lines of 'wow you did it faster. I must have really fucked up.'

There's another experienced (female) SE who's really good at what she does, and I've noticed that people are condescending
 towards her sometimes too.. (mocking her for little things)

Anyway, I was usually one of the stronger programmers in my classes and at my internships, so I think I have the skills to do well. Problem is, there's always some indignation and resentment if I happen to do something faster or correct someone. There have been several cases where they were wrong, and I said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because I should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.

So the question is, how do I get past that people who don't know me immediately assume I don't know what I'm doing, and how do I be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?

Next steps?,collegebootedme,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/381j6c/got_dismissed_from_college_after_my_first_year/,"I had a 1.9 GPA both semesters, and I'm beating myself up thinking about how getting a slightly higher grade in two classes could have kept me there. 

I sent an appeal letter a few days ago. To summarize, I was in a manipulative relationship most of the year, my family was going through getting my brother off drugs and keeping him from failing all his classes, I have family history of social anxiety and my dorm environment wasn't effective for being studios. Obviously I didn't blame my failures on these entirely, I take some blame too. 

I also pointed to my success in a campus campaign, all my past jobs, my high schools and my current internship to show that I was capable of what's being asked of me. 

My solutions are mostly to start going to counseling services, communicate my problem areas to all my teachers, and to use time between classes to do work (versus going to my dorm, I wouldn't live on campus so this isn't an option anymore.)

I have not told a single soul. I'm very embarrassed. This is not like me at all, and I'm not the type to admit I need help. 

I would rather not tell my parents until I get a decision back, because what my brother is dealing with right now is exponentially more stressful, and I want to know my plans before I make them worry about me too. 

What I'm wondering is: 

Would you think they would let me stay given my circumstances? 

This college is far from home, and my sister and I have already got an apartment from next year. Rent is too high for only one of us to live there. Is it reasonable to ask my parents to support me financially partially if I do not go to school, and work full time instead? 

When should I tell my parents?

What I'm hoping you all can help me do is come up with the best strategy for paying this off. After joining the sub i'd spent a few months and actually paid off my first credit card but unfortunately fell back in the hole because of irresponsibility.

I'm pretty new to this subreddit -- I stumbled upon it over at r/compsci and I can't believe how practical it is. Anyways, it's pretty simple. I'm planning on majoring in computer science at Vanderbilt University over in Nashville, and I want to make sure I'm taking all the right steps in order to eventually have a successful career in the cs field. What can I do regarding the following areas in order to be in good shape?

* Internships -- I'm planning to snag one summer after freshman year; does anyone know a relatively good starting company around the Nashville area/in general? Also, how are interns usually treated? I feel like I won't be able to contribute much but I'm a fast learner.
* Languages -- Right now, I only know a little bit of Python, HTML, CSS, and PHP. What are the most important languages to study so I can get a head start on them?
* Software engineering is my end goal. Glassdoor displays the national average salary for software engineers to be $90k. Is this really accurate? I see people on this subreddit working for $50-70k (even the ones not fresh out of college). 
* Side projects -- is it feasible to have enough free time to work on side projects? (On a related note: do employers care if you work on a personal project at work if you're ""caught up""/does this happen often?)
* Education -- What courses should I concentrate and focus on that will dominate most cs/se jobs? Database structures/algorithms/higher math? Is a bachelor's enough to enter the workforce? I don't really want to pursue a master's but should I? On another note, I plan to one day have a business -- should I get an MBA to make that easier?
* Work -- I've heard that software engineers usually lack a social lifestyle and are uptight... do you see this around your work? What I mean is, do people know how to relax, grab a beer, hang outside of work, etc? On a completely different note, how hard is it to ""rank up"" in the ladder? (Employee -&gt; Manager)

&gt; Documented prior education or training in laboratory techniques and methods requisite to conducting research.""


It has been two years since I have graduated, and am very nervous about the quality of my knowledge and skills.  Several of the skills are ones I have only read about and never done in practice.  I have only done PCR, DNA and RNA isolation and sequencing, and culture of cell lines a few times.  Those were in labs where I was given step by step instructions, and I don't know much beyond that.  I understand and remember the concepts behind some of them, but don't know much about the practice. 

What type of on the job training usually comes with these techniques? Do they expect me to be proficient? How much should I know when I go in for an interview? I would love resources if you have them.  Any advice to help in the interview would be great!

I also wonder what type of pay I should accept.  A quick google search shows an average pay of around $17-18 an hour in my area for Clinical Research Assistant.  But I don't know how accurate salary sites are.  I have no real leverage for negotiation, and my current wage is $12.39/hour.  

I want my position to pay me enough to begin supporting myself while I make car and student loan payments.  I want this position's wage to give me leverage when I move on in my career.  If you have any advice on wages in my area, or wage negotiation in this setting, it would be appreciated."
381ofv,8,2015-06-01,Weird internship situation,Princenomad,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/381ofv/weird_internship_situation/,"Okay, so I'm really just looking for some comments about this whole situation. 

So, starting about six months ago (December), I started talking to boutique agency in San Diego. Dialogue seemed good, and in January we had a very casual introductory interview. It went great. We had a good time talking, discussing the company, and what their objective was for interns in the summer.

Throughout the year, we kept in communication while I was in school. He asked me to keep him updated with what I was doing, so I sent the occasional email about the kind of stuff I'd been working on. When it came time to apply, he sent me the application two days before it was released on their site, which seemed like an awesome position to be in. After the application was sent, I got a form email stating that I had made it past the first round of applications and had to produce a video to show my ability to tell a story. 

Background: I got this on the 15th of May, saying the video was due the 25th for an internship that started on the 1st of June. 

Anyways, once I sent my video in, I got an email back saying that he thought it was awesome and that they would let me know their final decision on the 28th. I was stoked. They guy I've been talking to for 6 months said my video was great? That has to be a good sign, right? 

So the 28th (a Thursday) comes and goes with no response. On the 29th, I send him an email asking if I'd missed anything or hadn't received an email, to which he hasn't responded yet. Monday (June 1st) is supposed to be the first day of the internship, even though we had discussed that I wouldn't be able to start until the 15th because of when my university gets out. 

Is it just me being naive, or is it weird that I didn't get any feedback from this guy if I got the job? Should I continue to see what the situation is, or just ""accept"" my no response as the answer? It's been a huge bummer to see such an awesome potential job just fizzle out so abruptly. 

Either way, I'm looking for any response on the matter. Is ""no response"" a common response for people who didn't get a position? Does this response seem weird, or is this just how it is? Any response would be awesome. "

I'm moving to buckhead for the summer for an internship (at Yik Yak!). From what I've heard Buckhead is kind of an uppity neighborhood. It's been confirmed by the price of rent. 

Being 18, what's there to do around? I'm going to be pretty much making no money because of the cost of the apartment so I'm really just looking for things to do on weekends. Cheap local food? idk, like activities? 

Any other younger people subscribe to /r/atlanta? what do you guys do for fun? What are the good cheap restaurants you find yourself going to with your friends all the time? 

I guess I'll just try to use like tinder or something to find people to hang out with but if anyone's nearby and has any open spots in their friend group let me know cuz I'll probably be bored as hell for my first few weeks there. I have a car and I'm always willing to drive places if that's any incentive lol

thanks for any help! I've never lived on my own before (I go to community college so I still live at home) so I'm new to the whole being in a new place by myself and meeting new people thing haha"

It is also 4am as I write this because I am losing sleep over many things in my life right now.

So I guess I'll start at the beginning because that is a great place to start. So over the past fourteen years I have been going to the same summer camp, nine years as a camper and five years as a counselor. This is where my family is and by family I mean my friends who have become my family over time. I love this place more then anything else in the world. It has been my home and a place where I find comfort through anything, especially when I have a crohn's flare. Well last summer I met a girl on the kitchen staff who was from Mexico. She worked on the kitchen staff as part of her culinary schooling, sort of like a paid internship. Well we met at camp on one of our nights out at the bar and we both liked each other immediately. Me not being someone who has confidence especially talking to someone as beautiful as her had trouble introducing myself. So I went to the bar had a shot of tequila spoke to her friend for a split second to ask if she was with someone, she said no and I somehow got myself to walk over to her and say hi. This was something I just normally don't do I'm not the kind of guy who can just talk to any girl at anytime. Well we hit it off, both being a little shy and a bit drunk but we enjoyed each others company and talked, danced, and kissed. It turned out to be an amazing night and at the end of it I walked her back to her bunk kissed her goodnight and went back to my bunk.

Over the summer we started to talk to each other every day and I loved every moment of it and so did she. We walked around camp together when we both had time off we relaxed together and just smiled at each other for the rest of the summer. Over the fourteen years I had gone to camp this was the best summer ever. We grew closer and closer kissed had sex relaxed smiled cuddled and just loved each other. Neither of us had to speak just being close to each other was enough. Then the summer ended and she had to stay at camp for an extra week but when she came to New York I promised I'd see her again and we'd go out on a date.

So she came down to New York and we had the best day possible. I met her in Penn Station and from there we walked around the city saw a bunch of places got a bite to eat and then made our way to central park. We went to the central park zoo which was amazing and then saw street performers and just walked around the city holding hands. It started to rain and we ran under an overhang and as tv scripted as it could get we laughed then kissed and just stayed close to each other to stay warm until the rain passed. The day ended and she had to go but we would keep in touch because we loved each other.

So she went back to Mexico and I stayed in New York planning on seeing each other again this summer and we spoke everyday. Sending each other gifts for our birthdays and valentines day. We skype'd almost every weekend as much as we could and sent each other pictures and just kept our love alive. We planned our entire summer everything we would do. Counting down the days until we would be together again holding hands just Queen K and King B. Then in March I thought I would be back at camp but I got fired for expressing my emotions on getting demoted on Facebook. Of course I had to tell her, our summer, our dreams of being together again had just been turned upside down. So I told her and it was the day I believe we started to become distant. A couple weeks later I fucked up and missed a skype date because I was with my friends even though we had made a date for each other. I shouldn't have done that and I am still sorry now and I've told her that again and again. She had blown me off a couple times in a row and maybe I did it out of spite I don't know. All I know is I regretted it a lot and we haven't skyped to each other in months.

About two weeks ago she asks me if I am happy with us and I said of course I am happy but I also know that we would be happier if we are together which will be a problem this summer because I won't be at camp and she will. I will try to visit as much as I can around my summer job to make it work because I want to try my hardest to keep us together and our love together. She says to me that she thinks she can't handle us anymore and that work and school and keeping our relationship going is just too much for her. I could tell that it was hard for her and I understand and I saw that because she would message me less and less each day and not care what I had to say anymore. No more pictures no more skype barely anymore talking. We came to the conclusion we would see where it would go this summer and try to figure it out but she seems tapped out and she loves me she just can't do this anymore but at the same time she wants to. 

That same day I had sent her a gift with a card apologizing for my fuck ups telling her how much I love her and it had a dual time zone watch in it and some other things for when she came to New York. She finally got it and told me she loved it and loved me and I thought maybe we were going back to what we had. She posted her wrist with the watch on and said that she got it from NY. Not me not her boyfriend just NY and maybe I'm looking too much into that but that hurt and I haven't told her because I don't want to add drama especially now because shes going through finals and figuring her life out. Now I wait until she gets here to figure everything out while she is here but I don't know how to talk to her before she gets here. She barely answers me and yes I know shes busy but she doesn't even message me back sometimes. No more ""good night I love you"" texts back and forth every night just quiet distance. 

So I guess what I am asking is what should I do to get us closer again back to where we were. How do I use this summer to get us there and how can I talk to her before she gets here to start the ball rolling? Any help would be amazing, I love this girl and I just don't want this to end. We were both happy and I know we can be again.  

 


   
**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship that started in a summer camp and now we are back at our homes is becoming tough and we are becoming very distant. How do I make us get closer again before she comes back this summer and what can I do this summer to rekindle our love for each other?"

I'm a recently hired IT intern at a popular website at their HQ in New York. I'm gonna be a junior in college soon and I'm a consultant in training at my school's IT office. I'm very happy with my prospects but I have to admit that I don't really feel challenged or like I'm learning much; most of my job has just been Mac OS imaging and helping people set up computers. I'm a new hire and after speaking to my managers they basically told me to not expect to work too much or hard considering my not-so-stellar, but average pay. I always ask if there's any more stuff around that I could help with but my manager never has much lined up for me, even after asking for any additional tasks. My main gripe is that I feel like I have way too much downtime which I spend browsing reddit and doing other stuff whenever I'm done with any work that needs to be done. 

I guess what I'm asking for is if there's anything you guys can recommend I should study or familiarize myself with when I'm just sitting around on the computer, cause that's pretty much 80% of my job. I'm pursuing a CCNA cert but I would like to learn additional stuff. Is there something like a Code Academy version of IT stuff? I'm very lacking in coding knowledge and experience and have always assumed that those topics were more suited towards CS."

"" Dr. Melvin's Advice"" was a show that ran from 1995-1997 on public access. This show was on the public access channel for the following cities: Syracuse NY, Buffalo NY, Tampa FL, Orlando FL, Allentown PA, Lowell MA, Phoenix AZ, and Boulder CO. 

This show was about a doctor, Dr Melvin, giving children everyday health and safety tips in the form of skits. I watched the show as a kid and I used to think he dressed funny. He was very Patch Adams-esque. He had long brown hair, looked like he was in his early 30's, very tall, built more like a linebacker than a doctor, he was pretty tan, but his most striking quality was his voice, he was so soft spoken. Anyways, his show was very reliant on the children that appeared on his show since they were the bulk of the cast. There were only two ""constant"" adult cast members: Dr Melvin, and his male nurse, Carson. Carson always weirded me out as a kid, he was a nearly overweight man in his early 20's, he was pale, bald, had icy blue eyes, and his voice was very raspy compared to Melvin's. Carson also wore a more ""traditional"" medical outfit in contrast to Melvin's more ""fun"" doctor's outfit. 

I remember one of the last episodes. I was 4, it was mid October 1997. It was Dr Melvin's annual Halloween show. I was able to watch this episode after I contacted the studio that produced the episodes (I'll get to that later). 

The first skit featured Melvin and Carson going through a haunted house. Melvin would jump at every little scare, while Carson had a blank look on his face. They came to a carnival themed section and found a boy in tears, lying on his side. 

""If you go through a spook house and get too scared, do what this boy is doing. Find a place away from the people walking by, curl into a ball, and yell for help. A worker is bound to help you."" 

But after Dr Melvin finished his speech, the music in the scene got very loud. Then, a clown would come from behind a flap behind the crying boy, and he would scare him, causing the little boy to cry and scream louder each time. All while Melvin and Carson sat there, watching, the boy looked genuinely terrified. This happened twice before the scene switched to an unmasked clown patting the boy on the back and leading him towards an exit. 

The second scene started with Melvin and Carson walking down a sidewalk at night while kids in costumes ran around them. 

""There are lots of dangers on Halloween. One big one is that there are some people that may want to take you. They view you as a prize so they'll try to snatch you right up. If someone you don't know is trying to get you to go somewhere alone, find the nearest adult or yell for help. But if someone decides to take the prize for themselves, then you'll need to fight for your life. Claw, kick, punch, and when you are able to, scream the word 'fire' as loud as you can. Do anything to get away."" 

The scene switched to a little girl (about 12) in a witches costume walking down the street. Behind her, a blue windowless van quickly pulled up. What struck me as weird was that the van had cloth over it's license plate. Why would a van need one if they were just filming for the show? But anyways, the back door slid open, a very skinny man with incredibly large hands jumped from the van and on top of the girl. The girl began screaming and was pulling on the man's werewolf mask. He was grabbing her waist, trying to throw her into the van, but the girl threw a kick right into the guy's balls. He fell to his knees and the little girl sprinted away. Then, a man from off camera sprinted into view, he ran right at the man in the mask and threw a kick. But the camera began shaking and it cut to black before I saw anything connect. That scene was so intense. 

The third and final scene took place inside a kitchen. Dr Melvin sat at a breakfast bar while Carson was holding a pixie stick. He was wearing a classic ""dad sweater"". 

""Kids, you may have heard that some strangers want to ruin Halloween by giving poisoned candy to kids like you. But this is very untrue. The only poisoned candy given out has been from the victim's own parents. So don't show your parents this part."" 

The scene stayed with Melvin as he went over how to tell the difference between actually sealed and re-sealed candy for various types. After all of that, the scene switched to Carson pouring something from a vial  into the pixie stick, and him giving it to a young boy (about 9). The scene switched again to Carson tightly holding the same boy as he began to convulse and fake foam came from his mouth. This was the first time I saw Carson smile through out the whole episode. 

So there you have it, my favorite episode. So now do you remember Dr Melvin? Well if you do, then I'm about to ruin your childhood. A lot of people may know Melvin and Carson by different names: the Dream killers  of Orlando. Yes, ""Dr Melvin"" and ""Carson"" (real names: Frank Jackson &amp; Harold Preston respectively) murdered 11 children and 3 parents through out the whole time that ""Dr Melvin's advice"" was being filmed. How did I learn all of this? I'm an intern reporter, and my final report is a piece on something that affected our childhood! 

But to truly understand what these children went through, you need to know how they got their victims. ""Dr Melvin's Advice"" got their child actors through their newsletter (which I subscribed to). Every week, three subscribers would be picked to be the main stars in an episode. The children would be flown to Orlando (where the show was filmed), they would film, and then they would be brought to one of the many theme parks by the crew. Now there were over 45 ""main"" children, but only 11 killed right? What made them so special? Well all 11 of those children and the 3 parents were from either the Tampa or Orlando area. Frank and Harold did this so their deaths wouldn't be as suspicious compared to the children from other states. Plus, the killings would rarely take place near the set, but other places in Florida. BUT their ""signature"" was very closely related to their show. In fact, many of the more fatal injuries/situations on the show were pretty much re-enactments of their crimes! The ""dream killers"" would kill their victims, make it look like an accident, and replay the event on their show. They were sick fucking people. 

So how exactly did they get caught? Well, the same reason the 1997 Halloween special was one of the last episodes. The girl from the second segment on that episode was actually killed right after filming. Apparently during the filming of that segment, the actor playing the abductor (who remains unknown even today. Nobody fitting that description was ever on the show before) got too handsy on the poor girl, and her father was furious. He ran into the scene before it officially ended and beat the shit out of the ""werewolf man"". Well that night, the girl and her father were abducted from the studio parking lot and were drowned in a harbor only 4 miles away from the studio. 

So this event already had police eying the studio, but what was the final nail in the coffin? Well, the candy scene foreshadowed an event that would take place on that Halloween. Frank and Harold poisoned Frank's own niece. ""Luckily"" this crime was too close to home for the two men this time. Frank became the main suspect of his niece's murder, and was apprehended on November 5th, 1997. But Frank somehow must have known that this was coming, because he warned Harold, who fled the country that same night. Sadly, Harold still hasn't been found. 

When I talked to the studio about Harold, they told me that they think they know where he is. In France, three children and two adults have been killed in ways that paralleled exact ""accidents"" that happened on the show. Tiny details were discovered which led the French authorities to figure out that these deaths were homicides, not accidents. 

But even though French authorities have been looking for someone that fits Harold's description, they have come up with nothing. It's been nearly 20 years, more than enough time for Harold to change his whole  identity and  appearance. I tried to figure out how exactly a ""sidekick"" on an obscure public access show could afford to do all these things, but things weren't adding up. 

How exactly did Frank know that the police would be coming for him? Why would Harold go to France? His only family in Europe lives in Ireland. Why exactly were these killings not a big deal? I had heard about them, but only considered them an urban legend until a few months ago! I did some heavy digging and found out some crazy stuff. 

Two other hosts that worked for that same production company were criminals. A puppeteer who was a serial rapist, and an old ""aunt Jamima"" like cook who was convicted of killing 12 of her neighbors in a mass poisoning at her local block party. Why were criminals so attracted to this company? Well, all roads seemed to lead to the company's CEO at the time. A french national who had his own shady past. 

Brook LeGue, the owner of the production company, spent 5 years as a relief worker in Nigeria and the Congo. The town that he spent his first year with began attacking neighboring towns after he left. They said that they were trying to appease ""The snake God, Damballa"". 

LeGue ""somehow"" acquired an insane amount of wealth in Africa, and came over here in 1988 and created his own production company. Another thing to note is that each crime committed by his workers were in a ritualistic way (like Frank &amp; Harold killing and replaying it on their show). After Frank was arrested, LeGue killed himself 5 days later. The ""official"" report was that he was battling depression. But some say it was because he was afraid that some shady shit would be discovered. 

So why did the killings get no airtime? Well it's probably because in 1997, the production company was being assimilated into a certain Media monster who also was involved in Orlando. The merger was completed, the Mouse stole tons of show ideas, and the company was spat back out independently in 2005, under new management. 

But what makes this whole story ""creepy"" besides the fact that two men used their TV personas to murder children? Well this all happened in February. I did my piece on the killings on February 26th. On March 3rd, the production company and I both received and email from an unknown person. 

""Le médecin est en"" (The doctor is in) written 15 times. 

Since then, four more killings have occurred. But they've been too comically similar to the show to be a coincidence. One boy was found with a wig that matched the boy who suffered the same (fake) fate on the show. Since I know a lot, I've helped consult the French authorities since then. 

I wish that I could end this story with ""he was caught"". I wish that this story ended there, but I'm afraid we won't get to that point. The influence that LeGue had must still have some merit, as it still seems to be protecting Harold. But I want justice, I want the good guys to win this time."

1. Add any new user records from the membershipMGR file to the SCSM Groups and Members file

2. Put “not a member” in the Member Status column on the main file if there’s a user that’s no longer in the group from the membershipMGR file

3. If there’s a new group in the membershipMGR sheet that isn’t in the main file SCSM Groups and Members then add those records to the main file.

4. If there’s a group no longer in the membershipMGR file but it’s in the main file, then under the Group Status column, type in “Group Removed”.

I don't expect all of this to be solved by formulas, but if some of it could be done with formulas, that would be excellent (It's taken others 5-7 hours to do this manually and I don't have that much time). I can post some images of the workbooks if that would help.

This is going to be long because I'm a wee bit overwhelmed and don't know how much detail is required. There's a woefully subpar tl;dr at the bottom. Also, I'm brand new to reddit, so please be nice about formatting and the like.

I'm 23, and recently came into what is, to me, a large sum of money (thanks, grandpa). After paying off my student debt, I have $44,000 left over. I already have an emergency fund of $5300. It was $6,000, which is just under 3 months wages, but I had some medical bills this month. I'm hoping to replinish it ASAP.

Here are my financial needs/goals, ranked from most immediate to least immediate:

- I'm moving across the country in the fall (BC to ON). Some of my furniture has to come with me. I don't drive, and I won't know anyone in the city I'm moving to, so I'm going to have to hire inter-city movers who can drive across the country and unload stuff into my new apartment for me.

- I'm going to graduate school for a year in the fall (eight months in the city, and then a four month internship that could be there or somewhere else, and will likely be paid). The program is ""fully funded."" I don't have an official dollar amount yet, but I do have a minimum, and it should be enough to cover my tuition and my rent, and food for eight months.

- I will likely have to move again after my graduate schooling is completed. The field I'm going into is a lot of contract positions, and there aren't a lot of places to work in my field in the city I'm going to grad school in.

- I grew up poor, mostly due to my parents' poor financial planning. I've been doing the best I can (with the exception of choosing an oversaturated work field) to make sure I'm not poor.

- I'd like to retire one day. Maybe even comfortably.

- NB: I have no intention of buying property anytime soon.

All of that said, here's what I'm planning to do with the money I have.

- $12,000 liquid for moving expenses in the fall. Hopefully this will cover a trip out east in July to find an apartment, the actual flight when I move, and to pay movers to move some things I can't get rid of without causing WWIII in my family. Anything left will be used to pay expenses while I'm at school.

- $15,000 in a GIC ladder - $5,000 year 1, $5,000 year 2, and $5,000 year 3. My idea is that I can the first GIC will mature in the middle of my internship, and I can use that $$$ to move to a city with more job opportunities if required (if my internship turns into a full-time job, then I have money to put somewhere else). It's also nice to have something low-risk when first starting out.

- $17,000 (the rest of it) into a Tangerine TFSA. I'm leaning towards the Balanced Growth portfolio. I turned 18 in 2009 and have not yet opened a TFSA, so my understanding is that I have $41,000 of contribution room. I was paying $400 on my student loans every month, so I'd redirect that money to my TFSA until I start school.

... I have no idea how to TL;DR that. Uh... **tl;dr, a future student wants to keep ~1/3 of their $45,000 inheritance liquid, 1/3 in a GIC ladder, and 1/3 in a Tangerine TFSA. Good idea or needs improvement?**"

No one wants a beginner. Everyone wants someone who already has 5 years of experience. If not they want an intern who is still in school so they don't have to pay them.

Basically every summer was filled with classes and I havent had a real break from school in ages. So I have no real work experience but I have listed all my major projects I worked on in school that are relevant.

Fast forward to now, I'm overwhelmed between applying to any jobs that I possibly can find for junior java positions and I'm even considering applying to internships. I spend hours applying to jobs but barely get a response from 1-2 companies despite applying on a plethora of sites (indeed, dice, glassdoor, linkedin, stackoverflow etc). I don't know what to focus on at all. Should I be working on projects and learning new technologies? Should I be working on my interview/algorithm skills which generally suck? How do I balance doing this all without feeling so worthless everyday?

My general schedule is wake up and apply to any jr. java positions/entry level java jobs. Then I start to teach myself various new frameworks/languages. I'm planning on somehow also adding the cracking the coding interview book in. 

Is this the most effective way to go about doing things? I feel like I know nothing x.x

384nal,1,2015-06-01,A crush (limerence?) on a girl gave me motivation to practice NoFap - rejection making me fall back to my old patterns?,user91919191,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/384nal/a_crush_limerence_on_a_girl_gave_me_motivation_to/,"Hello, a long-time lurker here. I'm male, 24 years old. I first discovered masturbation some 9-10 years ago, and it fairly soon escalated to using pornography. On average, I have probably fapped about once or twice a day.  

&amp;nbsp;

I've never had a girlfriend or sex. Between pre-school and the recent events I'm about to describe, I've never even had any female friends my own age. So you can imagine what happened to my attitude towards women when the misogyny of porn and my lack of interaction with women combined. In an intellectual sense I have always thought I appreciate and value women, but I'm not so sure anymore when I look back on it now.  

&amp;nbsp;

I noticed over time that my porn tastes started to become more and more extreme, to an extent that really started to worry me. I began to search information about the harms of PMO and found the NoFap subreddit maybe 2 years ago, leading to aborted series of reboot attempts during the fall of 2013. My maximum time was six days, as I recall. However, I always lost my motivation, mainly due to a sense of having nothing to live for. I continued watching porn, and my self-hatred increased along with the depravedness of my fantasies.  

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, as part of my studies, I worked for ten weeks as an intern at a certain place, where I met this 20-year old girl. As part of my work, I collaborated with her a lot, and after a little over a week I developed feelings for her. I have no idea why, because we really have nothing in common. I literally had trouble eating and sleeping, and when I went home after work, I would be hopelessly moved to tears, unable to enjoy anything that would ordinarily give me joy. Whenever it seemed like she was responding to me, I'd be indescribably happy. Whenever it seemed like she was ignoring me, I'd feel crushed internally. I literally felt like a different person when I was interacting with her. Everything else in my life was suddenly far less interesting. I knew I had to have her.  

&amp;nbsp;

What I found strange was the precise manner by which the sexual aspect of my attraction towards her worked. I didn't find myself thinking in any way about the explicit details of a potential sexual encounter, but rather I found incredible joy in the more abstract idea of ”merging” with her. This worked as a serious wake-up call to the objectifying way PMO made me look at women. I felt like she had been sent my way by God or other spiritual forces to teach me something about myself. I knew I had to quit PMO to be worthy of her. I couldn't withstand the moral contradiction of having feelings for a woman and at the same time jerking off to degrading shit, and I realised also that PMO would be cheating if a relationship with her were to occur. 

&amp;nbsp;

Speaking of God, I feel I've had trouble feeling connected to him. On an intellectual level I firmly believe God's love is unconditional and that he holds no ill feelings toward me for my mistakes, but that doesn't change the fact that society has for a long time promoted the image of an angry judgemental being in the sky. I haven't been entirely successful in setting aside this image, even though I realise the fallacy of it. I suppose that by developing such strong feelings for this girl, I felt I caught a small glimpse of the kind of love God really has for me. When I went home one day, I opened my mouth, and with a booming voice I've never spoken with either before or after, I swore to God I would never ever again look at porn or masturbate. I felt myself filled with a spine-tingling sense of transcendant joy that seemed wash away all my troubles, and I cried tears of joy. I shall not try to describe the experience in any further detail, as no words could give justice to the way I felt.

&amp;nbsp;

So I constantly pursued the girl during the next two weeks (during which I firmly kept my promise not to PMO) whenever we were on breaks or out on lunch, and I may have ended up acting slightly stalkerish. She eventually confronted me about my obsessive behaviour, and I told her about my feelings. She told me she didn't feel the same way. The rejection left me devastated, but she acted very supportively and even forgave my odd behaviour towards her. We remained friends. I even told her about my struggle with PMO and how she was the one who had inspired me to change. 

&amp;nbsp;

After the rejection, I felt I no longer had any goal to work towards. The truth is that I have no dreams or ambitions beyond maybe spiritual enlightenment, which in any case is a long-term abstract goal, rather than something practical I can set myself goals about. The temptation to PMO reared it's ugly head, and after having abstained for 23 days (I had noticed many of the benefits other people report here, by the way), I went on a PMO binge. I would occasionally make greater effort to continue, but I wasn't able to recapture that long streak. My maximum new record was measly 4 days. The guilt for PMOing was greater than at any time before, because I had now experienced something at least a little more substantial towards a woman. I was depressed, only coming alive whenever I saw the girl. Even though I hadn't been able to make her into my girlfriend, she continued to have an uplifting effect on me. Occasionally, feeling like I literally had nothing to lose, I restarted my efforts to pursue her, but it didn't lead to anything.

&amp;nbsp;

Last week, my internee period ended, and this girl and I said our goodbyes and parted ways amicably. I'm not likely to ever see her again, which is probably for the best, as continuing to be in contact with her might only create false hope in me. Anyway, here I am. Depressed, heartbroken, without any sense of goal or purpose, still failing at capturing let alone exceeding that 3-week streak. She isn't around anymore, nor therefore is her uplifting, inspiring effect on me. I'm not even able to cry over her, because I'm too in shock to do so. I feel like giving up.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no interest in anything I once held dear, partly because it's hard to enjoy anything in this state, and partly because I've literally started to lose interest in anything in the material world. What do I mean by the latter? To put it simply, she inspired me to change and improve myself, and I know that I must ultimately do so by concentrating on my spiritual growth, eventually attaining a higher state of consciousness. Anything else feels diminutive by comparison. The main problem is, my family members are distrustful of all spirituality, and they try to attack my beliefs when they are brought up. I can't move away, partly due to practical reasons, partly because I would then be totally, utterly alone.

&amp;nbsp;

No debate on the validity of spiritual beliefs, please. I doubt you'd be able to convince me otherwise, which I'm sure also applies the other way around. On the other hand, observations about the nature of my feelings towards this girl would be welcome. Also, I hope this post doesn't go too off-topic at any point."

[X Post cscareerquestions],[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/384o89/phone_interview_for_it_security_internship/,"Hello, I'm a junior level student enrolled in a computer program. I've got a few months of help desk, QA, and knowledge base management experience. How can I leverage some of this to help me get the position? As the title states, I don't have hands on experience with security tools (other than what I've played with in my free time), but would really like to learn through this internship. Here are some of the duties the position would have: ""Assist with monitoring the network; reviewing reports and system logs for security incidents and irregularities; and investigating possible issues. Maintain metrics on incidents and report to manager. Assist with testing new solutions or upgrades to existing tools to enhance security and reduce the probability and impact of security threats and to ensure compliance, such as confidentiality. Assist with periodic scanning of network devices and STRS Ohio external websites to identify vulnerabilities. Assist with research, prioritization, remediation and reporting of the vulnerabilities.Assist with information security risk assessments, investigating and documenting security exposures, implementing approved procedures and products, and updating the Risk Register.""

384oq7,331,2015-06-01,I can't remember how old I was the first time I saw him. (Part Three),RanRent,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/384oq7/i_cant_remember_how_old_i_was_the_first_time_i/,"[Part Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/37zz88/i_cant_remember_how_old_i_was_the_first_time_i/)

I still don't know how I managed the courage to blink. 

But the very second I did, he was gone. 

Just like that. Just like my mom had described in the car...gone as quickly as he had appeared. The man in the top hat, the one that I hadn't seen since that time he appeared in my bedroom window, was now fresh in my memory. I'll try to do my best at describing him:

- I'm 5'10. His face was lined up with mine in the reflection on the glass, but he was bent down. So I have no idea how tall he actually is.
- He looks exactly like a person. No sharp teeth, no more black in his eye than anyone else. His fingers are regular length. I know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but I can't remember what he was wearing. In my head it just looks black.  
- He smells horrible...like the sewer.  

The second I saw that he was no longer behind me, the second my mom started to regain some color in her face, the room felt immediately...warmer. Like we were stepping inside for the first time after a storm. My brother was the first one to speak:

""He's gone.""

I was next:

""He was standing right behind me...I could see him in the glass.""

My mom just swallowed loudly. My best friend looked confused, but scared. 

""I didn't see anyone,"" he finally said. ""I looked at the steps and there was nobody there and I was standing right here the whole time...I didn't see anyone behind you either. But it did get pretty cold...""

It was then that we were startled by the front door opening. The sounds of my dad and sister's voice rang through the empty house. When they got into the kitchen, I saw my sister was finishing up a cone from McDonalds. She still had her dance uniform on. My dad explained that they had went to get ice cream afterwards because Becca behaved so well and apologized for being so late. He then greeted my best friend and was asked to speak privately by my mom in the other room. My sister sat down at the table, obviously unaware of what had happened. My brother and best friend and I were all still standing up, our chairs pulled out from when my brother had started screaming before. My heart still racing, I tried to calm down. I didn't want to make sense of what happened, not in front of my sister at least. Maybe not ever. I kind of just wanted to forget it all happened. Trying to look natural, I sat back down at the table. My sister had taken my mom's spot, which was across from me. My best friend slowly sat down too and my brother eventually went in to my parents room to speak with them.  

My best friend pulled out his phone -- I remember how shaky his hands were -- and I could see he had a missed call from his dad. I remembered I still had to bring him home...but I didn't want to make the drive back to my house -- although only three minutes away -- alone. And I bet he didn't want to spend the night here. Texting his dad in response instead of calling, he looked up to me. 

""I don't know what to say. Or what to ask.""

I made a face, nudging my head toward my sister. Like I said, I didn't want to say anything in front of her. I didn't know what my parents were saying in their room -- I was hoping my mom was talking to my dad about what had happened so we could do something about it, whatever that would be. Getting the hint, he decided to try to lighten the mood by speaking to my sister, who was sitting quietly. 

""So Becca, how was dance?"" He sounded loud in the quiet house.

My little sister looked up from her ice cream cone and smiled. In response to his question, she started laughing. The laughter caught me so off guard that I started laughing too. Eventually my best friend joined in and we were all laughing, although I don't think any of us knew why. Holding out her ice cream cone to my best friend, she asked:

""Want some?"" 

He smiled at her politely. ""No thanks, Becca.""

My little sister shook her head. I rubbed my arm. It was a little chilly in here still. 

""Want some?"" She repeated. 

I assumed she had to be talking to me, then. ""No thanks, I'm okay. You can finish it,"" I said to her. 

Again she shook her head no. I started to feel uneasy as my best friend made a face. ""Man,"" he said. ""It smells like Lucy farted in here."" He plugged his nose, looking around for one of my dogs. They were nowhere to be seen. ""Do you smell that?""

I did. 

It was then, as I stared at my giggling little sister, that I realized she wasn't holding the cone out to my best friend and she wasn't holding the cone out to me. Instead, the melting ice cream she was holding was directed toward the space between us. 

Before I had time to react my parent's door slammed open, my brother running out. My mom followed, with my dad behind her. I noticed he still had his keys. ""Come on,"" he said to me and my sister, sounding annoyed. ""Lets get this over with.""

Dropping my best friend off at his house along the way, we did the only thing my mom said that had helped in the past -- we went to church.

Luckily it was a Wednesday, which meant they had a night service. Youth group was also that night, although they had left almost an hour ago. The only people that lingered were a few ladies in the parking lot and the man that was supposed to clean up the buildings at night. That and the pastor. My mom had called on the way there, but the secretary had left hours ago. We were left to knock on the doors and ask for directions from the man that was cleaning. We caught the pastor in her office. She looked like she was just about to leave, but she invited us in anyways. My mom gave my little sister her phone to distract her and started talking. 

Basically she told her everything she had told us. From the job at Granny's Donuts to the creepy cop to the time at the museum to what had just happened in the kitchen. The rest of my family sat quietly as she explained. When she was done, the pastor -- who had done as much as blink -- calmly asked her what correlation she thought the thing in the top hat had with the cop from when she was younger. My mom explained:

""I don't know. My run in with that officer was the worst thing I had ever experienced in my life at the time. And then, when I saw the man with that hat, that became the worst thing I had ever experienced. After remembering being told that he was into demonic didn't really--"" 

The pastor interrupted her, a weird look on her face. I followed her gaze back to my brother, who was sitting beside me. His nose was bleeding. 

""We'll start right away,"" I remember she said. 

We followed her into the chapel, where she had each of us lay down on three or four chairs that had been lined up to form a bench. One by one, she asked us if we were willing to accept Jesus into our lives, and prayed over us as she fanned us with a sheet of some sort. I was the last to go. And if I'm being honest with you, I laughed the whole time. I don't know if it was because I was lying down on children's seats and getting fanned with a napkin or if it because I was finally free. 

I didn't have any problem saying yes to accepting God into my life. I had always been a Christian, although as I grew up my faith wavered. It went all around as I learned to question things, to not see everything as being so black and white. But because of those children's seats and fanning napkin, my faith has been restored.

That night at the church happened almost two weeks ago exactly. 

Two days ago I found this website. I decided here would be the place to share my story. 

That night -- the night after I first clicked to post -- I had a real hard time sleeping. My day was good, though. Regular, like it was before. I spoke to my best friend that night, who's off doing an internship for the summer now. I brushed my teeth like normal and closed my blinds and turned my fan up on high as I got under my sheets. But for some reason, that night, something felt off. The last thing the pastor said to us before we left and she invited us to the service on Sunday was this:

""I don't know what's out there. Nobody does for certain. But I do know that what I'm worshiping in here, whatever I talk to at night...that thing, that creature, that being...it's good. Whatever you were dealing with...""

She didn't need to finish. We knew what she would say. For some reason, she directed the last few sentences to me:

""Fear is what they live on. That's probably why you saw it resurface after so many years. You had your memory of it and spread that memory to your brother and then your mother. Don't mistake its interactions with your sister as anything but malignant. You have good on your side now, but it's up to you if you keep it that way.""

I'm scared. Last night was fine, and I fell asleep to happy thoughts.

But I still think I made a mistake. I don't think I should've posted this in the first place. 

I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

I haven't been able to find any guides or advice on course selection. I realize that a majority of the advice would vary from school to school, but I’m hoping to find some general strategies. Right now, I am trying to flesh out a semester-by-semester representation of the courses I plan to take during my four years of college, so any advice would be awesome. One particular thing that I am struggling with is whether to prioritize finishing up computer science courses before gen eds. By this I mean pushing most my gen eds till senior year. The reason I am considering doing this is to get as many computer science courses on my resume as I can before applying for internships (I realize the courses are not directly transferable to the real world, but they have to be more useful than some random gen ed). Or would this be a stupid idea, because I could use the gen eds to balance the exhausting computer science courses?

3859so,8,2015-06-01,How do I tell my NFather I don't want him to visit while I'm at my internship? Long/Advice?,Togetchi,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3859so/how_do_i_tell_my_nfather_i_dont_want_him_to_visit/,"I found this sub a few months ago and reading through the other stories has made me feel like I'm not alone! I still have daily doubts and wonder if I'm crazy or overreacting, but a recent turn of events has given me a resolve to stand up and walk out. (More on that later, see dog bite.)

The good news first: 

I have an awesome internship lined up in my field for the summer! It took a combination of luck (finding about it) and careful rule-following/impressing people who knew every intern would have to pass a government security clearance complete with background check. 

After all the paperwork and schoolyear stresses mingled together the summer is finally arriving, and with it the internship! I have a place lined up through a housing co-op with the company, and my future-landlady seems like a really nice and outgoing woman. The area is gorgeous and near the sea, and everyone I've met/everything I've seen about the company is positive: They employ for life, are constantly growing, looking for people to train for the future, have a steady work-supply, believe in constant improvement, etc. 

I already have a job but my NFather said ""You know [my current workplace] isn't going to be around forever. You should look into other opportunities."" which is what prompted me to apply for internships at my university's career fair last Fall. I only got a response back from this one(everyone else was mostly hiring graduates), and put all my effort into getting in. I got past the first two interviews with the new company and filled out the various reams of paperwork to get security clearance, a badge, and transfer my medical history. They sent surveys to various people I named as references asking if I would be a threat to national security(!), and what my work ethic was like. There were several months of silence while my application was passed between various departments who all had to say yes. 

Finally, around April I was given a green light from the company! They said I'd gotten the internship, and everything looked shipshape. Just wait until I get an email telling me what to do in summer. 

I told my family that I had gotten the internship and my NFather said""You already have a job! What do you need an internship for?""

I tried to copycat what he said initially, ""They won't be around forever, and this opportunity is in my field and employing for life."" 

He rolled his eyes, complained that ""I probably didn't even give my current employer enough of a warning for me to leave without disruption during the summer,"" and the conversation was over. 

My NFather has not once complimented me on getting this internship, or given any indication that he cares about it or the company. Apparently he brags about it at work, as everyone else already knows about it in some form, and has commented that ""He worries for you"". When I first applied I told my supervisor, HR, and the CEO (who is hands-on and deals with arrivals/departures of employees) about potentially being gone for the summer and not coming in to work full-time as usual. Everyone I've talked to is very excited, and has encouraged me to take advantage of the opportunity. 

My NFather has been asking with increasing frequency where I am going to live, and to give him the address so that he and my EStepMother can visit during the summer. I really don't want them to visit, I would like to enjoy my hard-won freedom and focus on working hard for the new company for the duration of my stay. 

The other problem is that I'm using the summer as a jumping board for moving out when I come back in the Fall. I had my catalyst moment when [the family dog bit me](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/36kxto/naw_sharp_teeth/) and no one acknowledged that I was hurt, but I was told ""he has sharp teeth"" and to stop overreacting. It was very strongly hinted at that being bitten was my fault. Now, two weeks later I have scars on my thumb from the bite that was truly deep and which cannot be gaslit as 'me overreacting'. Every time I wonder if I'm crazy I look at my thumb and remember that no one asked if I was okay in seriousness, and that every attempt to bring it back up was met with scorn and fake apologies (""I'm *sorry* he 'bit' you""). I don't think a ""normal"" parent would treat their child like that. 

I told a close friend what happened and she admitted that she never really liked my father. Her moment came after I threw my yearly tea party that took two weeks to organize and when he was done eating he told me (in front of my grandma, his mother) to ""have that shit cleaned up before we get home in 3 hours"". All my grandma had to say was that ""it's his house"". My close friend and another friend helped me clean and repack all the china I'd pulled from storage. In return I hugged them both as much as possible and gave them as many leftover finger-sandwiches, petite fours, and scones as they could haul off! 

I also told my supervisor about the situation after I couldn't hide it anymore and broke down crying for the second time in a week at work after the dog incident. He apologized and said that he knew it was bad, but not like this. Both he and my close friend are encouraging me to move out as soon as possible, and I've started asking around about openings for the fall. 

**TL;DR:** I have gotten a summer internship and don't want my family visiting me. I want to focus on my work, and then move out in the Fall. How do I tell my family that I don't want them to visit, and/or avoid giving them the address? I don't want to cause a scene or worry that my things will be gone when I return.

Also: life advice? Are there any secrets to moving out, and tips for doing it without a scene? "
385by2,69,2015-06-01,I [20F] spent nearly 4 hours cleaning my bf's [25M] parent's house. Get accused of stealing.,beyondfrustratedUGH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/385by2/i_20f_spent_nearly_4_hours_cleaning_my_bfs_25m/,"Hey reddit, so I apologize if this is more rant-ey than it should be. I just need to know I'm not the crazy one in this situation.

So, as per the title, my boyfriend of 1.5 year's parents were on vacation for 3 weeks. Before they left I assured them I would do the weekly upkeep of their house chores (watering their many plants, washing dishes, etc.). I'm over there almost every weekend and I of course wholeheartedly was on board with helping out. 

Flash forward: His parents were due back late Saturday night. Bf really wanted me to clean the place to get ready for their arrival (he would much rather pay me $40 to clean the whole house than do it himself). Obviously I agreed, I would have done it without the cash. I suspect he moreso offered because I'm a student and always strapped for cash, while he has a full time job (still lives at home while saving up to purchase a condo). Thursday night I was assisting at an event until 2am, but nevertheless I was at his place by 11:30 Friday morning because I promised I would clean. 3pm rolls around, I finish up and take some pictures of my hard work and BF comes home. He agrees the place looks clean - I even vacuumed and wiped down places we hadn't touched or gone in the whole 3 weeks. 

Flash Forward again to the present: I get home from a long day at my internship, and I get a text from BF. His mom is ""very upset"". Apparently I ""used her $140 cream without asking, used and didn't clean her hairbushes, and the bathroom/bathroom mirror/toilet were dirty, you didn't clean properly"". 

Now reddit, if I could, I would post the pics here but I don't think links are allowed. That place was fucking spotless. I would even go so far as to say that bathroom was CLEANER than when they left (they leave a lot of clutter around and I just put it all to the side, careful not to disturb anything important). You don't spend 3 and a half hours cleaning and NOT have a sparkling bathroom. I even did their laundry and vacuumed every room!

I will say that yes, I did use her hairbrush once. I am often at their house, as mentioned, and it's over an hour's commute to get there via walking/subway/bus, so I've learned to pack light. I have curly hair and don't usually use a brush but I did use hers the previous weekend. This I admit, and this I am sorry for. 

I never touched her cream. I was shocked that she had accused me of it... not ONLY does she use solely anti-aging creams, and not ONLY would she never be able to tell even if I had used it (unless I'd used an exorbitant amount??) but I was raised very conservatively-Christian. I have never and will never steal anything. Simply using her hairbrush made me feel guilty. They've known me for over a year and a half and apparently they don't trust me. 

But here's the icing on the cake, reddit, and this just pushed me over the edge. My BF was relaying his mother's anger and upset-ness (making that a word, shut up spell check) throughout this whole process. All of a sudden I get a text that reads ""And now I've apparently broken the sacred family trust by telling you about the cream. (his parents say that) I should have followed you around to see if you've been using my parent's things"". So not only am I terrible at cleaning to the point of making his mother upset, but they wouldn't have told me any of this. They wanted my BF to FOLLOW and watch my EVERY MOVE to see if I was secretly a conniving stealing bitch who had no respect for them.

I feel like I am no longer welcome in their house, even though all I tried to do in this situation was help. I spent over a year and a half building a relationship with them and making sure they knew how thankful I was for their hospitality. I gave his mother cards on mother's day, her birthday, and christmas. I called her my second mother because (I thought) she genuinely liked and cared for me. 

Sidenote: I've known his mother was obsessive about cleaning and we've had minor issues in the past about her believing the shower was filthy, or her yelling because she found 1 (no exaggeration) of my hairs on her floors. And yet there are piles of dirty laundry everywhere, I've never seen their sink not full of dishes (washed but never put away), things like this. And they freak out about me not cleaning well enough?

How do I deal with this, reddit? My BF and I spend most of the weekend gaming on his PC and his laptop, we aren't often at my place for lack of air conditioning, comfortable seating, and I only have a macbook which is terrible for gaming. I don't know if I can go back to his house, but I'm afraid that because he's stuck there for at least another year I won't get to see him like I have been, regardless of how I wanted to have a good relationship with his parents. We're in it for the long run...but apparently not all of us. Family is so, so important to me and this just hurts a lot. Maybe they never trusted me or wanted me to be a part of theirs. Sorry for rambling, it's just been a long afternoon. Maybe if anyone could share stories about how they coped with their SO's parents it would make me feel less crappy.





 tl;dr: How do I deal with BF's parents when they freaked out after I voluntarily scrubbed their house for hours and accuse me of stealing? Can I ever go back there? Please tell me I'm not the crazy one here?

**EDIT** Well, things aren't going too well. I'm still very upset about this whole thing, and BF has gone from saying he believes me to defending his parent's actions. He says it was reasonable for them to think I'd stolen from them after seeing a few of my hairs on his mom's brush. I'm sorry, but that is just not a good enough reason. He's ignoring it when I say that maybe it's an underlying issue, and instead saying that they haven't insulted my character etc. I'm afraid of where this is leading to. I can't and I won't just agree with him and accept what they've said about me and what they wanted to do, but what's my alternative? "

In a world where employers only seem to look at credentials, I'm unsure what they are looking *for* exactly. I programmed in VB6 for about 15 years (since I was 12), and did some C# and other languages and even assembly, but what I really need is a training experience. I have an MBA instead of a CS degree but I don't have time right now to go re-do my degree (don't feel it's particularly useful at this point compared to real life experiences); I'd rather take a few pertinent training classes or work an internship because that's practical and efficient. I can't seem to find any community here in Reno NV for AI (maybe I need to look nationally and coordinate online, but where/how? I'm not that good at finding it apparently); I have guessed that socialization is the key to finding some opportunity. Right now I just design A-Life simulations at home, but I would like to learn more working on a real AI project. I have a specific interest in intelligent agents / digital organisms and general AI development, but I see most of the work is on narrow AI for vision and other specific problem domains.

I am completely lost at how to find a mentor for this. I originally learned to program because I wanted to make games, so my approach is half art and half science (and I think some creativity and philosophy is necessary in these fields - to think out of the box and design new patterns). Outside a university, I haven't seen where I can get into this. I don't think it's an intractable problem; after all, I can read and learn what I don't know. It's just unlocking an opportunity to learn that is challenging. Does anyone have ideas on where I can go, who I can talk to? What communities have projects I can learn from/participate in? There must be some action I can take to advance, to get help with it (even if just theory discussions)?

I believe AI is what will fundamentally change mankind, and thus is among the most important focus points along with supporting technologies like quantum computers. I am also interested in computer ethics, a very small but important field. I believe I will have ideas to contribute when I encounter new information; I just want the chance to do so.

Thank you for any input regarding this. I feel very lost right now when people keep telling me what I can't do based only on credentials when I know that I can do it with a passion; I can learn, after all ..."

Im a 24 year old guy with a 20 year old girlfriend. We are both Indian from pretty traditional families (for cultural context). We started dating at the beginning of 2015. We met and went out for about two weeks and then I returned to finish my last semester of college on the other side of the country. I came back in February for about 10 days, and then back in May where we spent about 2.5 weeks together after which she went to India for two weeks and came back today to start her internship in NYC.

I recently got a job offer in Boston working for a really cool biotech startup which in many ways is a dream job for me. Its important to realize that in the 5 months that we've been together, we've spent maybe 1.5 months physically together. The majority has been long distance.

Her brother tragically passed away early April which is why she went to India for two weeks to do his funeral rights. The day before she came back is when I found out about the offer.

Today at dinner, I told her about my job offer and I told her that I didn't want to continue a long distance relationship after I moved to a new city. Holy shit did that not go over well. She has always been there for me, supporting me whenever I needed her and I never really reciprocated as much as she did. She is an amazing, kind, and caring person, I would never in a million years dream of hurting her.
I found out about her summer NYC internship earlier, but didn't end things because I knew that she would be coming back to our hometown to finish college after. After getting this job offer, I know that I won't be coming back to our hometown. Im going to be in a new city with a new job and I want to be open to new opportunities out there. Im only 24, and she's only 20. I don't want to tie myself to a long distance relationship and I want to see what else is out there as I start my career in a new city.

Does that make me scumbag? Am I wrong for feeling that way?
Anyway, she got really hurt. She also spent $400 on a nice watch as a surprise gift that made me feel even more worthless. Im just in so much pain right now. A part of me knows that I don't want a long distance relationship and another part of my feels like shit for hurting an amazing and selfless girl whose done so much for me. I feel like im being torn apart inside and I don't know how to cope.

tl;dr: 5 month relationship mostly long distance. Got a job opportunity in a new city and don't want to do long distance anymore. Told gf this and now feel like the worlds biggest scumbag.

There's me, the girl [S], her brother [R], my room-mate/her boyfriend [B], and her family. S and B started dating 6-7 months ago after myself, B, and R all moved into an apartment together. This happened once S started up university at the same school as us and had known B from a visit a few years back and they had texted a lot up until this point. 

This caused a shit-storm of drama, because B is quite the asshole, and R didn't like that he had to be around their shitty relationship all the time. B and S tried to sneak around for the first few months behind R's back and eventually they got tired of doing that and told them that they were dating. B has always been a bit of an asshole to S and it's caused a lot of issues in the apartment.

Myself and S have been really good friends ever since she started school here, we always joke around and share a lot with each other. A bit over a month ago B and S approached me to see if I'd be interested in having a three-way with them, and I said yes, having even thought of it myself (I'm also really close to B).

B and S have also had issues due to S's family not liking how liberal he is, he's openly bisexual and way more on the flamboyant side. He comes off very strong, and can be difficult to deal with. S's family absolutely hates him, and since R has had issues with him it has made a rift in their family (both R and S are kicked out of the house for the summer, so they signed a lease to stay for a few extra months).

B and S's relationship is coming to a close, I've heard from both sides that they don't think it will last. But S is going to sub-lease B's room in the apartment and she's waiting to end things until it's finalized and he moves everything out. For now he's staying at his parents house to work an internship during the week and will visit for a few hours over the weekend.

Ever since I started hooking up with B and S, things between me and S have gotten somewhat serious. We're closer than we've ever been, we cuddle every night and spend a lot of time during the day together. I started developing feelings for her a few weeks ago when she moved into B's room full time, and things kind of came to a climax between us last Wednesday when S came clean saying she had started feeling for me and had never felt this way about anyone else.

We talked and I shared some of the same feelings and concerns that she had. Neither of us know what to do, we feel trapped with no way out. 

We both kind of want to take the risk and see how things work out. Myself and R are a lot closer than B and R were at the beginning of the year and I feel like R wouldn't make that big of a deal out of me dating his sister since I don't sleep around as much as B does and B made no effort whatsoever to keep his relationship with R in-tact. B would also probably stop talking to me, but I have a feeling he's going to slowly back out of our friend group anyways. I'm the only one he's still close to left in it, and he's living at his parents and commuting next school year anyways. On top of that he'll have even less of a reason to visit considering S will be around a lot, and me and here hang out on the weekends anyways.

The other option is for us to hide our feelings and continue on as really close friends. We wouldn't ruin anything and would still cuddle and share ourselves when we want. But I'm not sure if I would forgive myself for missing the opportunity for being with her. I think she's the most amazing woman, and I know we're already compatible sexually and emotionally. But who knows how things will work out. I'm really lost, sorry for how long this post is, I needed a place to vent.

I've been calm about it, telling myself that I'll eventually find something, but a few days ago, I just became unbearably depressed.

My stomach is in fight or flight mode, I'm puking, I've been crying randomly, I haven't had much of an appetite though I've drinking myself to sleep with a can of beer lately.

I want to see help, but I don't have the means to get a therapist. I can't even tell my own mother that I've been feeling this way because she'll tell me I'm just a weak person and that'll hurt me much more.

She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by 
myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.


Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education. 

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. Since then he has been saddled with child support, and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, bought her a TV for Mothers day, etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by

10 months ago I had to ""drag"" him back to his family home three states away from the city we were living in. We left ""everything"" behind. I was just working restaurant jobs. He had gotten too sick to work. We really left the nothingness and his near-death behind, but also our friends, work and city connections, apartment, in order to recover.



He has 8 months sober. I promised him anything he needed to hear before he went in detox, and I meant it too, I said ""no of course we won't be here in this state of FL that you hate so much living with your sister and her husband for long, just give this 6 months and we'll move okay?""  I thought he might die. I would have said anything. And he got with the program literally the program and is in recovery. In the meantime I moved back in with my mom, got a job in my field with my degree finally, got healthcare, got a clue on taking care of a life I want to live and it's a really beautiful life that I need him to be part of. He's 3 hours away rebuilding himself and his interests back up beautifully as well. We go back and forth visiting each other every 3 weeks.

It is super amazing!

But we would obviously like for each other to be part of each others' lives. We did this for ourselves, for each other, for ourselves. 

Initially we were planning for he and I to move on from our separateness straight to a specific new city together, Chattanooga, in May (this month.) I pushed it back to the end of July. Now I don't even want to move there until I have at least a year under my belt in my current position. Before, I had accepted I was never going to work in the field I went to school for, I didn't think it was ever going to happen, couldn't even find unpaid internships that were interested in my sorry ass. Same story many have to go through. But now I've really been doing it right with my career, understanding my path, where I fit, where I want to be, my self-esteem, my ability to succeed in this field of my very high interest. 



It's not that I didn't make poor life choices leading up to the moment I decided to move back home as well, after I took him back home ""slightly"" against his will. My shit wasn't working for me either. So I owned up too. 



On one hand, I fucking love anything that makes this sweet-hearted, sweet-minded person happy.  Chattanooga? What? That sounds terrible I love it baby when do we leave.  But on the other hand, I have to be responsible to myself now, what do I do? 

I promised we would go, and we've talked about it, been planning it, but now in my mind I've lead him on if we don't split for the city of Chattanooga in May, no wait July, no wait...do we have to? Like dangling a carrot in front of him as it also looms over my head like a giant demon in the clouds. It could destroy my future! But it's also something I promised. It would be reckless to think that, without even a year of experience under my belt, I can just go to a whole new city, THAT city in particular (small, old boy network, college town, secluded) and find the same kind of job. And while we could make money anywhere...my career is important, so it's the quality of life that is really important, the freedom in our lives to have control and wellness. And healthcare. I can't wait tables anymore. God damn it. 

I feel terrible, I've been dealing with this battle of limbo and right and wrong and clashing in my mind for months now. When I talk it out with him, anything seems possible and I'm relieved and ready. When I'm alone again reality check sets in and I'm like, holy shit, am I delusional?  He wants to leave his job, family, and meetings to be with me and find new job and meetings, but I don't want to leave my job because I won't find a new one. He's told me he wouldn't be happy living in the city I live in now. I don't blame him. But I'm feeling weighted down and sad unable to figure out what to do. 



I have a poor grasp on picking out the meaningful parts of this situation and what to do. 


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend/fiance is a recovering alcoholic whose rock bottom also brought me to discover and understand the meaning of a quality life worth living. He has found the same. How do we combine lives now in a responsible way that doesn't Fuck us?

The position was labelled ""CS Intern"" and it is for a company that works very closely with the city.


I guess the interns are also responsible for IT problems for a sector of the building (it is a huge city building).


I've been backing up computers, keeping records, and being taught how to fix IT problems. I've spent most of my day just sitting there waiting for updates, fixing minute problems, and just waiting for service calls. I've even been doing some data entry..


The only time I'm learning any programming is when the other intern is teaching me, but only because we are bored -- not because we were assigned anything.


Is this common for an internship? I kind of feel like I have way too much downtime. I asked if there was anything I could help with, but there was nothing.

3860yx,1,2015-06-01,[openCV][C++][Python] - Need help creating python bindings!,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3860yx/opencvcpython_need_help_creating_python_bindings/,"I am working on a project at my school’s internship (Just extra experience and some spending cash for students) using C++, openCV, and will be using a python GUI. The python GUI will call the C++ functions. These are custom functions and are not a part of the openCV library. The problem I’m having is that I’m not sure how to use the openCV wrapper macros entirely. I’ve read some basic documentation about these macros, but I’m not sure exactly where to start to get the desired results. Hell, I’m not entirely sure how the desired outcome will be. This is my first time trying to do anything like this and it’s very overwhelming. 


**Questions**


* 1-Where should I start? I was told to explicitly use openCV wrappers to create the python bindings. I would like to see examples from start to finish. 


* 2- Where should I look for this specific issue? When I ask my superior, he just kind of shrugs and tells me it's okay to take my time. But I have no idea where to look and I starting to feel frustrated and overwhelmed.


* 3-Is this a viable option? I suggested using boost, but was told that I must use openCV for this.


* 4-What will be the desired result? What kind of file(s) will be generated using the gen2.py?


If there are any questions, I will answer as much as I can. My issue is that I've not used things like this. I've went from taking base level programming classes to being thrown into a huge project. So if my terminology is incorrect, I do apologize. Thank you all in advance!"

I am currently working on a robot for my internship. I am a mechanical engineering student and the company is a robotics company. 

Anyways, I plan on using an Arduino board which I plan to use C++. Woohoo I get paid to learn a language (one of my engineering dreams). That being said I am wondering if there are any other alternatives to building this walking robot.

More information about the robot, it will be 3D Printed, it will walk/move. It will most likely be at CES I will post some cool pictures when I finish as I plan to make is aesthetically pleasing.

Thanks for the information.  "
386brx,5,2015-06-02,[meta] How many of you ladies fantasize about office sex with a person of authority? (Longish and serious),tragiq,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/386brx/meta_how_many_of_you_ladies_fantasize_about/,"Occasionally, I see a request by email for someone looking to role-play a boss/secretary situation. I know we're all about fantasy here, but I have spent a lot of time as I'm sure most men have, pining over some of the interns or employees in my office. 

I find it difficult to determine if I have a shot with any of them, if only for a roll in the hay. Because I am something of an authority figure to most of them, especially the interns, I worry about sexual harassment claims and things of that nature.

As women, how many of you are suggestible to office antics with an authority figure? What if there is an age gap of about 10 to 15 years? Does that make it hotter or creepier? 

Would women in their 20s be more up for the experience or more creeped out? 

Does a girl who acts very proper actually consider such taboo? Is it more or less enticing if the guy is married vs. single?

Are there any telltale signs that you're giving off that we should be looking for?

There's an intern in my office building who is not my intern but rather the intern of my neighbor. Because I'm in his office a lot, I end up chatting with her plenty and she always seems to perk up when I'm around. I don't know how to discreetly approach her and gauge interest without completely making things permanently awkward. Is there a reliable way to feel her out without completely creeping her out and then having to dread every work day until she leaves?

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts and I would be more than happy to indulge in some role-play to figure out how things might play out. I would want someone who on the surface acts very reluctant, coy or even initially offended, only to be later intrigued. 

Is this a scenario that only happens in movies? 

For those of you that are into this, does the fantasy come with a grounded in reality that a fling would be just a fling?

Can't wait to hear your feedback."

However, I don't think it's wrong to also recruit just to compare offers. I just got wind that if we do get accepted for full time, we only have 3 weeks to decide (I'll be graduating next year). My school doesn't participate in prolonging offers from this company, and the full time position deadline is likely to not move since it's more of a program they hire on an on-going basis (so they would need to know who's going to accept to possibly recruit more). With that said, I have a few questions:

*About when should I be applying to other firms?

*If I do get interviews, how do I interview without taking time off my internship?

*Will companies understand that if I do accept their offer (not the one i'm interning at), I won't be joining them until I graduate? Wouldn't this hurt my chances?

*What are the best methods to apply when the career fair isn't an option, especially when you don't have a network (since the deadline won't extend enough to recruit fully)

386ewk,49,2015-06-02,30 post from a guy who couldn't last 3 days and what I did differently,MarkyMarkAndPudding,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/386ewk/30_post_from_a_guy_who_couldnt_last_3_days_and/,"Hey nofapstronauts!

I'm a few days late but I wanted to express my thoughts and feelings towards nofap as I have finally achieved 30 days.

I wanna preface my thoughts by saying as the title says I've never been able to make it past 3 days and when I did I would binge the hell out of myself. I started nofap mainly for the fact I have death grip and it was effecting my sex life but yes my addiction was severe and still sucks but it's part of the process. Also even before starting nofap I was always kind of a naturally happy and healthy guy but very immature. I am 19 so I'm still maturing a lot naturally and now living on my own now. I just want to say this because I don't want people to expect these same things. These results may and probably are a mixture of me growing up and nofap. Also as I'll say later just nofap won't do much for you. 

Do I feel different? Abso-fucking-lutely. My perspective of life is completely different. I'm not shy anymore pretty much at all. I'm more confident. I'm so much more positive. I'm harder working. I do better things with my time. I have way more energy. I'm a culinary student on his internship and working 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week. Yes I could and had to do it before but I have much more energy throughout the the day. 

Are there any down sides? 
Well obviously I crave it. And sometimes it can distract me. (I'm starting to reach my flat line, so yeah that's kinda the sucky part...)

What did I do differently this time after failing so many times after making it past no more than 3 days?

#1. This is monumental. You will almost certainly fail if you do not understand that nofap is a journey not a destination. This applies to everything and nofap included. I would always try and just desperately try to make it to my goal of 14 or 30 days. I would be super uptight about it and think about how great it would be when I'm at that big number. I saw myself as a completely different person. I didn't sit back and enjoy the fact that I'm strong enough to make the decision and I wasn't enjoying the fact that I've made it one more day not almost to a certain one (although it is naturally exciting). If you really want to help yourself I say don't even set a goal. Just start and take it one day at a time. Enjoy that day. Be in it. 

#2. You need to change more than nofap. Yes you will feel different. I didn't do much other than nofap for the first 10 or so days and I did feel different but you really should try to improve other aspects of your life. If you're trying nofap you probably noticed you have a lot more free time. Take that time and put it towards make yourseld a stronger version of yourself. Exercising I would say is the biggest impacting since it helps you both mentally and physically in a huge way but there are other tons of options like meditation, reading, learning to play an instrument. You'll learn that just like nofap the initial effort it takes is huge and takes a lot of mental effort but once you do then you're strengthening your mind to do it what it truly wants and you're reeping the benefits of whatever positive activity you choose. There are also other things you can do to better improve yourself that doesn't require time out of your day like drinking half your body weight in ounces of water or if you're a messy person. Consciously reminding yourself to clean up immediately after you've made a mess or moved something. 

That's it. There's no #3. Just those things have changed my nofap journey from a groggy irritation in my life to a path to find the strongest version of myself. 

Please please enjoy the ride, not just nofap but everything. Be in the now. Be present. You don't want too much of yesterday or tomorrow to take up today."
386hsm,0,2015-06-02,Forced gap semester,thepenofthemorning,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/386hsm/forced_gap_semester/,"Hey everyone.

I've just finished four years at a college working toward a computer science bachelor's degree. However, I failed a bunch of classes (for personal reasons, not because they were difficult) in my last two semesters and ended up not graduating. 

I'd planned to resume classes in the fall and finish up my degree that semester, but because of my poor academic track record, it looks like the college is going to block my registration for the fall semester, saying that I need a break from classes.

So now I find myself in limbo. I have about six months and no plans for how to spend them. I've got some programming skills (years of classes + a couple of tech internships) but no idea how I should use them. I don't think I can get an internship in such an awkwardly-placed time frame. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can use the next six months productively?"

386yin,1,2015-06-02,Is It Possible to Obtain Enough Knowledge about High School Math in Two Years For a Computer Science Degree?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/386yin/is_it_possible_to_obtain_enough_knowledge_about/,"More details, I have zero knowledge of high school math currently. I am not helpless at math. During high school I did well at math when I tried, I was able to solve math problems my teachers had to look up. The problem is I am a high school drop out and lack strong math skills.

My GPA is around 80% in science, social, and english. Math is currently the unknown. I take a distance learning course in Canada. I estimate it would take one or two years to get my high school diploma. I guess I am asking if it is possible to obtain enough knowledge about high school math in two years to meet the requirements for Computer Science?

I am interested in Computer Science because I enjoy programming. The way code is and how it works interests me. I have researched various degrees and Computer Science seems to be the most worthwhile because it opens up more job opportunities and it is versatile.


I was thinking of doing Computer Science as a degree and getting an internship for investment banking. Plausible plan or should I get a reality check?

Edit: I am mainly looking for advice. If it is possible, what would you advise is my best option? If it is not possible, what do you advise I should do instead?

I'm in need of some career advice. I finally managed to get myself into a luxury position (yay!). My situation is as following:

Last summer I've received my bachelors of law at a University of applied sciences. At the moment it is damn near impossible getting a job in the legal field, even for masters graduates (most of my classmates are now working at a cash register or in the greenhouses, masters graduates mostly work as secretary’s).  Now I’ve done a remarkable internship, at which I’ve been given the responsibly of representing well over 100 clients, negotiated on their behalf and represented them before a court of law. This is HUGE on my resume and I really liked doing it.


During my studies I had a side job in IT, because I was unable to find a job in my field after graduating I started working for the IT company fulltime. I am working detached so every few months I'm switching companies/jobs which I kind of dislike because of the uncertainty.


I've now been working at a helpdesk for 5 months which sucked so bad, it was monotonous and didn't challenge me the slightest. It is boring and feels like I’m throwing my education out the door. It isn't really paying well, but a job is a job.


Because I was so bored job at my and scared I would be stuck at a helpdesk the rest of my life  I was sending out my resume like crazy but didn't get one invite for an interview.


Now the thing is: I always do my absolute best, whatever job I'm doing and my employer has received fantastic feedback about me and I've been following courses from which I received very good feedback.


My assignment at the helpdesk is almost at an end and because of my results my employer found a job as a business information manager at a huge multinational. The job sounds like a great challenge and a lot of fun. But, coincidently the same day as I was offered this assignment I got invited for an interview as a paralegal and was offered the job. 


I honestly don’t know which one to pick. I think that because there are way more qualified legal counsellors then me, I will hit a wall soon career wise. On the other hand, it pays like 30% more than my current job because I have a degree in that field. 


It feels like I am at a huge T section in my life, am I going for IT or legal? Perhaps I could use the job offer as a paralegal as leverage for a better salary?


What would you guys advise me to do?

Oh, and before I forget, we do attend the same university!

This summer, we have been very lucky and see each other at least once a week (we live about an hour and a half away from each other). That has been amazing, and I love every bit of time I have with him since we're gearing up for a long period of being away from each other. Recently, I got an internship in the city he lives in, which means I'll be there even more often (about 2-3 times/week).

The thing is, he gets extremely sad after a couple of days of not seeing each other. There are things going on in his life that I know are making this worse for him; however, this is simply the way he is regardless. Of course, I do everything in my power to comfort him and it all works out because we get to see each other within the next few days. I'm terrified though of what will happen while I'm away.

What can I do to comfort him while I'm gone for such a long period of time. I should note that I miss him too and this is not a one-sided thing. It just affects him at a much more quick and intense rate. I love him so much, I don't want him to be hurting for three months straight.

I've a few ideas lined up like a pendant for his necklace to remind him of me, open when letters, and just keeping a steady line of communication via text and voice. I figured those of you that have had experience with this could give me more insight!

Much love, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts and ideas:)"

I am very much in love and feel happy with the possibility of spending the rest of my life with her. She is also my first girlfriend, I have never had any other romantic relationships. We met in college and started dating when I was 22. 


Because of personal insecurities, I had never been able to muster the confidence to engage in romance, despite a few advances from a couple girls. However, there is this girl, let's call her Marilyn, that I have known since elementary school. She was one of my first crushes, although I didn't let her know it. She has always been at least an acquaintance and had a couple serious relationships with some of my best friends growing up. It had been hard for me to see Marilyn in relationships with others, exacerbated by being so close with her SOs. I was not a very close friend of hers however until after high school. We ended up going to the same university. I spent a few years in college ""discovering myself"" before settling down into a degree program I knew I would be happy with. After this self-discovery period I met my current girlfriend, let's call her Anne. I had finally reached a level of maturity and confidence to able to form a real romantic connection. Around this same time I ended up having more than a few classes with Marilyn, during which we became very close friends,  and as far as I knew at the time, her interest was purely platonic. Despite having a girlfriend I could not shake the renewed attraction I had for Marilyn during our time in school together. 


Eventually, one drunk night I confessed my attraction to Marilyn to which she responded that she had had a crush on me as well going back to high school! I was already in a rather serious relationship with Anne however and both Marilyn and I pretty much forgot the conversation ever happened. In the following years Marilyn and I hung out quite a bit; she's was never single during this period. At one point in my relationship with Anne we had a breakup. This lasted about 6 months during which Anne hooked up with a guy in NYC where she had an internship. During the same period my attraction for Marilyn grew, but was un-acted upon because she always had a boyfriend. Eventually Anne and I got back together with a stronger relationship than ever before. I can truly say I would be happy with her for the rest of my life. We have been through some hardships in the past but now we are living together happily in New York, with a bright future ahead of us.


Yet, in my some part of my heart I still bear an intense infatuation with Marilyn. In an egregious act of unfaithfulness I once again admitted my desire for her. Marilyn responded that she wishes I had acted on this earlier, despite her romantic engagements. She told me how she had had feelings for me but did not want to make the first move. By this point she had had an unplanned child and told me she wishes she had been with me instead. This resulted in a series of sexual conversations culminating in our sharing of explicit images. I have never been with anyone other than Anne however I still carry a deep seeded attraction to Marilyn. I am reminded of the Gang of Four song [Damaged Goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvs4_60zvTo), ""sometimes I'm thinking that I love you, but I know it's only lust"". I have never told Anne about any of this, however I feel she senses some part of my true fondness for Marilyn. 


The worst part is I cannot honestly admit any regret for my sexual relation with Marilyn. Because I have felt this way about her so long I feel like I have two different parts of my heart. The (much) larger of which belongs to Anne, but there is still a small part that I cannot help but dedicate to Marilyn. She is a person I have longed to be with for over a decade and a half ( I am 28 now). And I still make time to see Marilyn whenever I am visiting home. I even have sexual fantasies about her. 


 Maybe I should stop being friends with Marilyn altogether. I am confident I will never do anything to betray in the physical sense, but I know it is already unfair that my heart is not whole dedicated to Anne. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and be with Marilyn at least for a little while, the thought of what may have been haunts me on occasion. "
3878uo,15,2015-06-02,Japan's Flying Geese or Flying V Model,Tropicana89,AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/3878uo/japans_flying_geese_or_flying_v_model/,"There have been a few waves of industrialization. The first wave consisted of the colonial powers: England, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands. The second wave consisted of the upstarts who missed out on the colonial land-grab, and butted heads against the established order to get a bigger piece of the pie. They make up the major actors of WW2: Germany, USA, USSR, Japan. The third wave we are seeing today, the BRIC: Brazil, Russia, India, China.  

In particular, the industrialization of China is talked about a lot in the media, but the important role Japan had to play in China's successful industrialization is not mentioned as much. From the time Deng Xiaoping opened China to foreign investment, Japan has always been the biggest investor in helping China industrialize. This can be seen in Japan's FDI. This fact doesn't receive much attention in the West, probably because they don't understand Asia well and probably because they have the dichotomy of Japan = good, and China = bad. This fact also doesn't receive much attention in Chinese and Japanese media, probably because of continued nationalistic sentiments from regular folk, so the leadership tends to not highlight it too much, although they are well aware of the close business ties between the countries.  

How did this high Japanese to Chinese FDI come to be? Because of the development of Japan's Flying V Model.  

Flying geese fly in a V formation. They do this because it allows the entire flock to expend the least amount of energy. The leader has to break wind and focus on navigation, but the geese following him, and the geese following that geese, and so on, just need to follow the geese right in front of them. This allows them to draft a bit and also conserve their energy. Japan proposed a similar model in Asia. Japan was the first industrialized country in Asia. They would break the wind, moving up the value and innovation chain, passing lower-value activities to the next asian nation. In this way they would make all of Asia richer.   

Japan started at the bottom of the value chain, like every other nation has to at some point. They made cheap goods with cheap labour with little sophisticated knowledge of machinery. They then exported this for large profit. As they made money from exports, they wisely invested this in building up infrastructure, education, and developing domestic industries. Eventually the wages of workers raised as more money flowed to factory owners and workers demanded higher wages. This meant Japan could no longer make these cheap products, like knitting shirts and shoes together, cheaply anymore because labour costs had risen. As planned however, by this time, the money earned from exports which had been invested in education and innovation had allowed Japan to move up the value chain to developing slightly more sophisticated goods, for example, manufacturing goods like toys, which need some capital as well as labour. Japan could no longer make clothing at competitive costs so they passed this onto the next asian nation, namely the Asian Tigers, the next asian countries to industrialize: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore. Today, all of these nations have reached almost first-world standard, and are, in turn, shedding low-value industries to the next asian nation, China. For example, Taiwan's FoxConn gets most of its labour from China. This benefits Taiwan in that a sizable percentage of the profit goes to FoxConn, owned by Taiwanese owners, but it benefits China too, in that the rest of the percentage goes to Chinese workers, and the know-how and infrastructure is developed. Even China is beginning to shed its lowest-value industries, hand-sewn clothes and shoes to other asian nations: Bangladesh, Vietnam, Philippines. Eventually, these nations will in turn move up the value-chain and shed the low industries to another nation.   

This pattern was followed all the way up the value-chain. Today, Japan has reached first-world living standards. Their citizens receive top education and make first-world salaries, not as $1/day factory workers. This was all because Japan kept slowly investing in education, innovation, and infrastructure.    

When Japan first got into cars, and tried to export them to US, they were known as shit cars and death boxes. No one bought them except for those who could only afford the cheapest cars. But steadily Japan reinvested this money to improve and of course today, Japan is known to make some of the highest-quality and most innovative cars today. Japan is at the highest end of goods now. The goods they export are microchips, medical products, and other products that require extremely high-quality.   

And as Japan moved up the value-chain, they pulled up the asian nations after them. As South Korea became richer, eventually started their own car company such as Hyundai and Kia, which target cheaper consumers than those that buy Japanese cars.  

Every single successful Asian country has followed the Japanese model. Build a successful domestic industry where you're competitive, usually at the very bottom of the value chain with $1/day labour. Export for lots of profit. Re-invest that money to build infrastructure and education, and slowly move up the value chain. China is copying this model to the T.  

But I think this model actually has important implications for our own lives and the community of Asian-Americans. Asians only started immigrating to the West in 1965 with the passing of the Immigration Bill which no longer banned immigration of coloured people. But many of us have only come more recently. Many here are 1.0 or 1.5 generation.  

Our parents did the hardest work. They immigrated to the land of opportunity, whether that be America, Europe, Australia, Canada. They took the only jobs they could, generally lower-class jobs. And they told us to focus on school, study hard, work hard, etc. Basically, they wanted us to have a better life and move up the value-chain. As the first generation growing up in America we have additional human capital over our parents. We know English fluently, we understand the culture, and we've received a western education through college or some other education which opens doors to certain job opportunities. With our background of growing up in America since we were young, we have more opportunities and can make more money than our parents could. If they could only make $10/hour at a nail salon, we can make $30/hour or higher working in some office job.  

As our cohort becomes more accomplished, I think its important to follow the Flying V Model in giving back to the asian-american community. This can be mentoring. Many of us will also go on to have some sort of management job. Either being able to hire interns for our team or starting our own business and deciding to hire asian employees and helping them break into entry-level fields.  

The more successful you become and the higher you go, the more asians you can pull up with you. Yishan Wong was CEO of reddit. He chose Ellen Pao to be CEO after him (wise or not, I dunno). I'm just hypothecating, but he may have also chosen an asian Marketing Director down the line, who chose an asian Regional Marketing Manager, who took a chance on a fresh grad asian intern, giving him his first break.  

The fresh grad asian intern gets his first break. The asian Regional Marketing Manager gains valuable management experience which will allow him to continue to move up. As they get promoted they can pass on their position to another asian, which will benefit the fresh asian employee and benefit the new manager as they now have a loyal ""team"" which they can rely on to continue to be an effective manager and continue to get promoted. The net effect is enriching and making more powerful the entire asian-american community, which allows us to effectively combat the other cultural forces in America.   

You see this with the Jewish community. Many jewish families started in the textile business, aka making clothing, low-value stuff. They would hand-sew shirts and stuff and sell them for not much. But their kids got a western education and did slightly better, and their kids did slightly better, repeated for a couple generations. Today, the average salary of a jewish person is $100,000. That's insane. Almost all jewish people today work on the higher-end of the value chain. They all make high salaries in professions like lawyers, bankers, academia.  

We can enrich the asian-american community in the same way by following the Flying Geese Model.

The metal Worldstrafer/spirit golem floated ominously in the void. At least, &lt;ke Ahiaan thought it was a spirit golem. It's what that twin headed grand magus told him, anyway. It certainly didn't look like any spirit golem he has seen before. For one, even with his lack of knowledge of magical theory, he could see that there was nothing conductive to magic on it. For two years in school, he got one thought drilled into his head: there's a reason the Unity favours [Ssallglu]/Nikh!o construction: the former provides structural stability, and the latter conducts all the magic the vessel might need. Still, &lt;ke's job was not to think, but to work. Another thought drilled into his head, albeit in a different school.

His job was simple: get close to the... thing, and attempt to establish a mental link. If things got bad, he had an enchanted discblade ready on his side. The twinhead assured him he won't need it, but one cannot afford to be to careful with a species that almost blew itself up into oblivion. Several minutes passed, just getting close to the hunk of metal. Several microasteroids tried to ruin his day, but failed miserably; the spacefaring shields were of an exceptional quality. Finally, he got to the point he could touch the thing. It was far bigger than it seemed at first, a detail which elicited an involtary twitch from &lt;ke. Still, he could not be afraid, he wasn't paid to be afraid. He began moving his mouth mandibles to get into the right state to establish a mental link. The movements continued until the spell was successful and...nothing.

&lt;ke did one thing, and he did it well, that thing being mental linking, but didn't take an expert to notices that something was amiss. Normally, a successful mental link would find the lifeform the caster is focused on, or, failing that, the nearest reasonable lifeform. This complete lack of anything only happens when there is nothing alive anywhere near the caster. The answer was clear: this thing wasn't a golem. In fact, this thing wasn't even alive. To be honest, there was reaction: a *""tktktktktktktk""* fron &lt;ke; his species' equivalent of a sigh. He doesn't get paid enough for this crap. He raised the Longspeaker, and let the other side know: *""The target isn't alive, First-of-Many, requesting different strategem.""* The other side was confused.

The *other* other side was confused as well. Back in Darmstadt, Henrik Braun's mind was bursting with thoughts. This was actually a proof of us not being alone in the universe! He would have jumped for joy even if the FTL drive simply worked properly. Unfortunately, that proof seems to have caused quite a few medical emergencies. The excitement of an alien being was too much for some, and for others, the sheer terror of alien spacefaring bugs achieved the same effect. Some people were convinced that the whole thing was an elaborate prank, and angry voicemail flooded ESOC.

That was beside the point. What was important was that, somehow, this alien lifeform was surviving the vacuum of space, it was somehow moving without any obvious means of propulsion, and it just finished waving its mandible things at the camera. Clearly, this was technology beyond anything humanity has ever witnessed. How could one even contact with such a thing? The Helios wasn't built with first contact in mind, at least as far as he knew.

Fortunately, Gunther was wrong. Thanks to a last minute petition started by one of ESA's interns, a microphone and a speaker were built into the Helios. How can you say no to half a million people, especially when the entire idea only required one gigabyte of data and some extra wiring? And, as if on cue, the responsible intern burst into the main control room. Her name was Maja, and right then, she was screaming in her own language and flailing her arms about like an tube man. It garnered a few laughs from her fellow countrymen, but otherwise left the control center even more confused than it was before. After that burst of (what was presumably) joy, she went up to Gunther and said, with oddly-accented English: *""Sorry, boss. Had to get that out of my system. Did you turn on the microphone yet?""* Mr. Braun responded, with his own, German-accented English: *""We have a microphone?""*, to which Maja responded by pointing to an icon on his control screen. Some time later, contact was established with Helios.

However, before we get there, it would be a shame to leave out what happened with &lt;ke and the twinhead commanding him, over at Alpha Centauri. To be fair, it wasn't just the two of them. While &lt;ke was generally being confused by the metal monstrosity, his commander was listening to his woes aboard the Forgotten One, a Worldstrafer orbiting one of the system's planets. Besides his commander, the who's who of Unity was present, even High Councilor [Aaaeee Gooeeh] who was last seen in public some 34 years ago. The commander themself was the First-of-Many of Unity's xenobiologists, although the Unity concept of xenobiology differs from our own, hence the title grand magus. They were [Garu'Sera], and they belonged to the [Hing'du], or rather, what was left of them. They fought for recognition for years, in the face of prejudice. So many times, they were denied employment, because ""we have a more suitable candidate"". They knew they were lying. It was all the result of thinking that, if the [Hing'du] cannot keep their planet in order, they sure cannot keep a job with high responsibility in order. [Garu'Sera] cannot falter now, even though it seems that reality itself is conspiring against their success. No laws of reality will stop their big break.

[Garu'Sera] responded, their two heads speaking as one: *""It could be some kind of a magical artifact, ready for activation. Search the structure for some kind of a switch""*. With that said, their heads were as two once again. [Hing'du] had a curious ability to grant their two heads limited autonomy. This proved incredibly useful for the purposes of critical thinking, but it had the downside of requiring a lot of energy. Some say this biology was also responsible for the Incident, and are partially correct. Many do not know a single fanatical group was responsible for the destruction of [Garu'Sera]'s lost homeworld. At any rate, they were thinking.

The command he send to the spaceborne Takaih was really a way to stall and make the many officials beside them think that they have the control. To be honest, they had no idea what to do next. The guess of an artifact was highly unlikely, based on what little they knew about humans. Their knowledge of humans was severely limited. Mind reading has yielded little, as human's concepts of their magic are too incomprehensible. The anatomical and mental insight gained from some captures before the Incident also yielded little, as they were only able to capture dead specimens. The Incident happened before the authorization for sapient capture could be given, and by then it was too late. [Garu'Sera] hoped for a miracle. And it came, in form of a message via the Longspeaker: *""The target is speaking. Do you wish to respond, First-of-Many?""*

Back on Earth, Henrik was speaking. He still didn't quite see the point of putting sound-based communication systems on the Helios. He highly doubted the aliens could speak any of Earth's languages,not to mention the fact the ship was expected to be in a vacuum. Still, it didn't hurt to try. After several variations of greetings, the scarab somehow lifted its box, and began to speak, or at least, it seemed like speaking. The language was odd, full of clicking and hissing noises, but it seemed to have some sort of order to it. It wasn't the first time the scarab did what it did, and it was still equally confusing on how exactly it manipulated the box. It was probably a communications device, but, first off, it seemed to be moving on it's own accord, and secondly, there was the question of why would Helios be able to even hear any sound. Henrik concluded that is was probably some form of highly advanced, invisible air envelope.

The importance of the mechanisms of space travel became irrelevant, as the scarab turned the box toward one of the cameras on the Helios. It revealed a hole, and from that hole, came oddly accented, fragmented, and occasionaly, oddly voiced, but perfectly comprehendible English. It stated: *""We wIsh* ***to*** *undErstand: what invIIIIsibleh spirIt is within* ***your*** *contrapshhuhn?""*

This question only raised further questions back at Darmstadt. Slow, methodical discussion followed for the next two hours. It did not lead to many revelations on either side. The humans were able to understand that there was some sort of an alliance named Unity, encompassing multiple sapients. As for the nature of their technology, the aliens insisted it was magic. Some of humanity's xenobiologists argued that the description was just a ploy in order to fake weakness. At that point, every human on the planet had their own opinion about the aliens. The internet blew up, literally in some places, as older nodes struggled to keep up with the load.

The discussion ended with the conclusion that direct contact between Unity and humanity was necessary for true understanding. Besides, &lt;ke's spacefaring shields were running out and needed to be replaced. In orbit around Earth, a Worldwatcher was ready to do just what was required.

Aboard the Radiant Homeworld, throughout the first contact, a heated discussion was taking place on the safety of humanity and whether they deserve a place within Unity. Whatever their thoughts might have been, the High Councilor has decided: the vessel was to disembark on Earth. While [Glubarrtuu] didn't agree, orders were orders, and he was the commander of the Radiant Homeworld. It made some movements with his tentacles, and a transparent form of a [Ssulb] crackling with energy appeared. [Glubarrtuu] spoke: *""Star Spirit, calculate a course for the launch location of the* ***Helios****""*, with the last word being mentally projected instead of spoken. The Worldstrafer's name became known after the talk with the humans, as well as the location of their launch pad; a welcome certainty in the face of confusion.

On Earth, a giant mob of people was waiting near Helios' launch site, located in what was known as French Guiana. It is there that humanity was to first see alien life, face to face. Some enterprising individuals already set up, setting various snacks and refreshments. It was technically illegal to do something like that, but the convenience of something like that was too great for the armed forces in the vicinity to do something about it. Speaking of armed forces, there were many of them. The forces of the AC, the American Confederation, were easily the most numerous, but not by a long shot. The intended effect was to impress the aliens, and possibly prevent any Earth invasion takeovers.

Finally, the Radiant Homeworld touched down, its form disc shaped and coloured black with numerous white spots, seemingly placed without any order. It floated a bit over Earth's surface, and    priest-emperor Zetkah's honour guard were the first aliens seen by humanity. Soon after them, the emperor himself followed, along with [Glubarrtuu] and !a-haka. After them, the entire multiracial crew of the Radiant Homeworld followed. Watching them, with gauss and laser weaponry trained on them, was a whole slew of soldiers and APCs. Behind them, many xenobiologists, linguists, and any relevant experts that could arrive in time. Behind them still, masses of people, ready to witness history. It was a sight to behold.

Before anyone had a chance to talk, something unusual happened: The priest-emperor knelt before the soldiers. Kneeling carries the same meaning in Krikrogah culture as it does in human culture. His honour guard followed. !a-haka tucked in her legs, a different gesture with the same meaning. Soon after, some of the human officers started kneeling too. In a manner of seconds, almost every sapient around the Radiant Homeworld showed respect. Even [Glubarrtuu], with its cynicism in the first contact, gained faith, and rolled up its many tentacles.

First contact was a success.

387gm9,0,2015-06-02,[Visa][CoE] Proof of work experience: internships and part-time ok?,epiju,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/387gm9/visacoe_proof_of_work_experience_internships_and/,"Hello everyone!

I am currently working on my CoE application (a Japanese company is making the sponsorship for me). I am a web developer.

They want me to proof my 3 years of work experience (for the Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa).

I worked:

- 6 months of internship (full-time) with company A
- 7 months of internship (part-time) with company A
- 6 months of internship (part-time) with company B
- 17 months full-time with company C

So 36 months (3 years) in total. Will it be accepted as 3 years of work experience (regarding to internship and part-time)?

In company A and B I was an intern but did the same job as a regular employee (in fact I was the only developer in Company B!

I am asking because on immigration websites they are just mentioning ""work experience"" without further explications so I'm guessing internships are working too but... I prefer to ask!

If not, will my university degree be enough to ask for the CoE? Or it is better to add my degree + my work experiences (even the internships) to my case?

Thank you!"
387nc2,3,2015-06-02,[Engineering Internship] Is my solution to this probability problem valid?,differentiallity,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/387nc2/engineering_internship_is_my_solution_to_this/,"Yesterday in my internship I tried my hand at a probability problem while writing a statistical report.  I'll explain the problem as best as I can:  
  
Problem:  
A plastic car part has 6 metal clips installed during our manufacturing process.  Every day, we take about 3 parts and destructively test their tensile force.  This means we rip them off the part with a force gauge to tell how hard they hold onto the part.  If any one of these 6 clips fail, the whole part fails.  
  
I was given data for 18 parts.  It lists the clip number and the tensile force, in Newtons.  I took the data for each clip and evaluated the C_pk values, using an LSL of 111 N (there is no USL, since a higher force is better).  I then converted the C_pk values into % yield (as in what percent of the clips would meet our criteria).  Here is what I got:  
**Clip**      |         **Yield**  
1                 |             0.94438  
2                 |             0.975741  
3                 |             0.876926  
4                 |             0.94084  
5                 |             0.990786  
6                 |             0.949534  
  
As I said above, if any one of the clips fail, the whole part fails.  Therefore, I interpreted the yield as the probability a clip is successful.

My Issue:  
I have no idea if I did the problem right since I haven't taken probability yet, and none of my supervisors know it either.  Me telling the general manager that we only have a 72% yield is a big deal that would make problems for a lot of people, so I want to make sure I did it right.  In addition, I want to learn this so I don't have to ask in the future :)"

I was never a brilliant student, and my careless attitude made me do badly in most of my high school exams, and I nearly got myself out. I flunked in almost every exam I appeared in, and barely passed my high school. People always used to consider me worthless, and life was quite tough those days. Well I worked quite hard, I gave everything I had, and eventually got into one of the most reputed university in my country, and now I have a CGPA of 3.4+/4.0. The problem is, I still work really hard, and I try everything I can to compete the people I study with, but always fail. I have really good extra-curricular, I organized a lot of events for my university, I worked really hard for three years, but when the time to award the presidencies of the societies came, I wasn’t even considered, I wasn’t even allowed to give an interview. The people who got the posts had way less experience than mine. Secondly I was never good at coding, people always used to say that I have to score good grades to secure internships and other related stuff, I did all that I had in me, I even scored A grades in all programming courses last semester, and now I applied at so many places for these summer internships, but got rejected from everywhere. People with lower GPAS keep on getting internships and I am just hopeless. I am so frustrated and depressed with all of this. I don’t know what to do, no matter how hard I work, and whatever I do, I am just not able to achieve what I want. After doing so much, and scoring this GPA I still feel I am at the same place I was in my high school, this time the only difference is that I am the only one instead of the people around me, considering myself worthless. This is the first time I am posting anywhere over the internet, I really don’t know what I really wanted to ask, I am just posting this all over here as I have no clue of what else I should do."

3883uh,5,2015-06-02,My poems have disappeared from my journal and replaced with chicken scratch. I haven't opened it since I first noticed this weeks ago. Should I open it again? I'm curious.,ciaodanielle,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3883uh/my_poems_have_disappeared_from_my_journal_and/,"About six weeks ago, things were going really well. I accepted a new job, adopted a puppy from the shelter in town, started seeing someone new, and even began to cope with Ryan’s death in a healthy way. I revived my running habit. I started eating healthier. I found a reason to get out of bed every morning. The world was finally turning around for me.

For months, I struggled to find closure after Ryan’s suicide. We weren’t dating or anything, but I had a crush on him for years. In college, we had astronomy class together. It was a gen-ed requirement for our college. We hated the class and one day, started bonding over it. We groaned at another busy assignment, next to the pile of books we’ve yet to read for our other classes. It was so fucking stupid. We later found out we were both literature majors, looking to get our writing out there eventually.

In mid-December, we went out for drinks at the college bar down the street to celebrate our creative writing capstone. Despite the prescience of our forty-something professor, Ryan saw this as an opportunity to get hammered. He ordered a few rounds of bourbon, and it was likely he was already tipsy. He kept a flash in his back, denim pocket. He started ranting about his girlfriend, that he’d been seeing for nearly eight months at that point. He recited an argument from earlier that day. 

“Hey, Lauren, how much should I spend on a Christmas gift for you?” He asked.

“Use your fucking judgment,” she replied. “I can’t believe you’d commodify our relationship with numbers.” 

Ryan was a devoted anti-capitalist. If it were up to him, he wouldn’t exchange gifts at all during commercial holidays. However, he was also a recovering addict that replaced alcohol with opiates and the rest of our class had to hear about his fight. It’s totally normal to fight with your significant other and talk about it, sure, but he was four drinks in and saying goodbye to everyone for the night.

I should’ve stopped him that night. I just didn’t know how. I didn’t want him to hate me for “misplacing” his keys. He for sure didn’t want to hear a lesson from me.

I spent my last semester of college abroad. In South India, the Internet was unreliable and spotty. Even when there was a fair connection, it still was subpar and fairly ineffective. For someone that adores the web, it was painful. It was also painful for Ryan, because we had limited contact. One afternoon, I found a backlash of Facebook messages from him. He broke up with Lauren finally, only a day before their one year anniversary. He thought she’d be heartbroken, but the roles reverse. She moved onto a guy she started talking to and flirting with before she started dating Ryan. Ryan sunk into a depression and struggled to stay alive. He told me he wanted to kill himself. I told him I was there for him.

When I had Internet, we talked for hours. We typed away, despite that I was on the other side of the world. He told me he stopped drinking. He came to the realization buzzed driving was threatening everyone else on the road and worried his close friends.

While abroad, I bought a leather journal for him. He could replace the flask in his pocket with this little book. It was handmade by an Indian native. 

I soon enough returned home. I was in transit for nearly thirty hours in a row between flights and cab rides. Although I enjoyed my trip, and would do anything to travel back to India, I was eager to reconnect with friends I hadn’t seen in months.

I logged onto Facebook. I didn’t have any messages from Ryan. I clicked on his profile for any recent activity. I read an array of posts on his timeline, from relatives and friends, in his memorial. He did it. He fucking did it. Shit.

One night, Ryan relapsed and drank himself to death. He slipped in the bathroom after taking a shower (probably while drinking) and went into a coma. His father noticed the bathroom door was locked the next morning. He pried it open and found his son, unconscious. Ryan was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late.

So that brings me back to six weeks ago. Sorry for the brief ramble. I promise it will all make sense. Anyway, things were going great. I couldn’t have imagined, once I learned about Ryan’s death, that I would bounce back so quickly.

I have a habit of staying up late. I’m sure you can relate. Even though I wake up for work at the crack of dawn, six o’clock on the dot, I write poetry past midnight. After a few poems were published in an anthology by a local publishing house, they asked me to prepare a manuscript for an independent work. My goal is to reach seventy pages. Right now, I have about half of that and I’m still revising relentlessly as I go along.

Six weeks ago, I placed my journal by my bedside, next to the lamp. It was a little after one in the morning. I started writing in that journal I’d originally planned on giving to Ryan. Why not put it to use? It’s silly for me to keep that without anything in it. Besides, Ryan would genuinely want me to fill it with poems. I turned the light off. Moments later, I heard a thrashing THUD next to me. Alarmed, I flipped the light on. The journal fell to the ground. Relieved, I left the journal on the ground and turned off the light again.  I must’ve placed the journal to close to the end of the table. I fell into a sleep almost immediately. 

Work got busy and I stopped writing recreationally so often. I’d recently accepted a new job at a local newspaper, so I did a fair amount of writing and copyediting all day. I started going to bed earlier because long days began to exhaust me. I was only the youngest in the newsroom, next to the intern that bought coffee for the office everyday.

Last Friday, I finally started writing poems again. Often, inspiration finds me even at the most stressful points of my life. I wrote a few verses and scribbles in Ryan’s journal. I quickly grew tired. I closed the journal, placed in on the table beside my bed, and turned the lights off. And there it was again. 

THUD.

I jumped up from my pillow and turned the lights again. It was the journal, planted on the carpet next to my mattress. I recalled my memory of the similar event, weeks before. I picked up the journal to write a poem about these two isolated events.

I flipped through the pages of the journal to my recent poem, to find a place to right a new one on the next fresh page beside it. I couldn’t find the poem I’d just written. I flipped through the entire journal, back and forth over and over again.

The poem, I’d written nearly ten minutes ago, wasn’t there. Maybe this was a dream? I have sleep paralysis and often experience vivid hallucinations while dreaming... of course, I was moving, but I didn’t question it. I dropped the journal on the table and turned off the light. I drifted away to sleep.

The next morning, I decided to carry the journal with me in my bag to work. Perhaps, during down time at my new job, I could spew out some verses during breaks. As expected, I had some inspiration while writing an obituary. The obituary person was out for the day and we needed a dedication for our weekly issue.

I searched for my previous poem to start a new piece. Just like the night before, that poem wasn’t there. Instead, there was chicken scratch handwriting in its place. It read: “I want an end of this pain.” I wanted to scream, but given my situation, I didn’t want to appear insane. I sat in silence and utter fear, towered over my tuna sandwich.

I got freaked out and left the journal in my desk. When I arrived home that night, I inspected every single crevice in my home. I made sure to lock every door and window in my apartment. I slept with the lights on. I switched journals. When I turned off the lights to sleep after a night of writing, I didn’t hear any more thuds.

I kind of forgot about the situation, actually, until this afternoon. I misplaced one of my favorite pens this morning and naturally, rummaged through everything I own at work. This included my desk. I uncovered Ryan's journal. I shoved it back in the desk.

That was about fifteen minutes ago. I've been contemplating on how to approach this situation. I'm unbearably curious about what's happened to the journal. Was I hallucinating? Was it a dream? Was my memory playing a game? I'm not sure what to believe. I'm also nervous about opening the journal, because I might not like what I find. I'm finally at a happy place in my life after months of depression. Should I open it? Do I ignore and pretend what I saw a few weeks ago was just an illusion? What do I do? "

This is my first internship, and i'm wondering which of the three would provide the best learning experience for a beginning software engineer?

The older boys (not my biological children) have a pretty extensive criminal record with a history of drugs.  

In November, their home was raided by the local sheriff.  They found three guns (including a modified/shortened shot gun and a semi-automatic rifle).  The older boys were both charged with several meth crimes (distribution, etc).  They are awaiting trial in jail as I type this.  My ex was not arrested, but my boys (and her daughter from the next baby daddy) were taken into foster care.  
I have been consistently blocked from seeing and speaking to my sons for several years.  I have spoken to them only once in the last five years total.  I continued to send cards, letters and attempted to call with little contact.  No letters have been returned.  My gifts (shockingly) got to them while my ex takes credit for them.  My ex and my children have been moved so many times over the last decade that the kids have not had time to make friends or stay in one school more than a year or two.
When I contacted the case manager to tell her that I intend to request custody, she spoke to my ex (who is ""not getting doing her checklist"" - whatever that means).  My ex told the case manager that I'm not paying child support (sent statements from the State of Florida disproving this) and that I abandoned my sons to move to Arizona.

I admit that I was kind of a loser before moving to Arizona.  Since arriving, I graduated from ASU with a BS in Political Science, married a wonderful woman, started going back to church, got a great entry level position with a major fortune 500 company that provides amazing benefits, start a paid internship teaching (part of my grad degree) in August.  In other words, I have a loving home that provides continuity and a future.  I fear that if my ex gets custody back (odds are slim according to the case manager) that the boys will fall into the same life that their brothers have found.

I really need guidance.  Any advice will help.

3888ap,3,2015-06-02,Weird experience in a retirement home,Sebby74,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3888ap/weird_experience_in_a_retirement_home/,"Ok Reddit, this is my first post ever here, I just have to share this and thought this would be the best place to do so.

I am currently doing an internship (hope it is the right word, english is not my native language) at a retirement home. The guy I have to work with is the Janitor, so most of the time I am not in contact with the old (and sometimes suffering from dementia) people. When I walk past them, It is always very weird for me, they are for example just sitting there laughing or singing/humming. One of them always screams ""Hello"" and something I cant understand, but it sounds like ""I cant..."". Because I have never experienced something like this before, It honestly freaks me out. Some old lady even tries to touch me everytime I am near her. Or this old guy who just screams all day long, I can even hear him if I am doing something in the garden.

But the thing that to this time freaked me out the most happened today. 

I was assigned to clean the Wheelchairs and ""wheeled walkers"".
So there I was, going from room to room, getting them out, cleaning them up and putting them back. Many of the residents were asleep, so it wasnt a problem. 

Then, I got the Wheelchair out of the room of a resident who kept talking to herself, screaming stuff like ""you cant give away the children"" and so on. The worst thing was about to come.

Now the Janitor was back, we were cleaning together because we were faster this way. He got the stuff we needed out of an old ladys room. I think she woke up or something, because before the Janitor got in her room I didnt hear anything from her. We cleaned her stuff, now I could hear the lady in the room calling for the Janitor with his first name. He opened the door, put the wheelchair in her room in a way she could not see him and told me to do the same thing. I asked myself why he did not respond to the women. Then we just stood in the corridor and talked a bit. 

Suddenly, the old lady who was calling him got out of her room and said: ""(Janitors First Name) You are my son!"" 

He just said no and told her to go back into her room. That she did after maybe half a minute telling him he was her son.

Soo, this is one of the most scary moments of my life, not because I feared something, but because it is just strange seeing human beings like that, out of their minds.

Thank you for reading, I just wanted to get this off my Chest :P

I'm a CA resident, so I've been told the standard number to apply to is around 30-40? I want to apply to med schools on both west and east coast though, since I have family in both areas. The middle regions are a bit iffy, but I'm willing to consider it if it's a school within my statistics. Below is my information from this month's ""What are my chances?"" thread for reference. In addition, I'm concerned that my research-heavy background and low MCAT score will hold me back from being a competitive applicant to MD programs.

* **2nd time applicant**

* **Year in school**: Currently a 4th year undergraduate, will be graduating after Spring 2015

* **Country/state of residence**: CA, USA

* **Cumulative GPA**: 3.86. Had a bit of weird trend here--1st year was solid 3.9, 2nd year had a dip in grades for personal reasons, 3rd year was again solid 3.9 and currently completing my 4th year (expected to be around 3.8-3.9). However, I have always maintained myself on the Dean's Honor List for all quarters (GPA &gt; 3.50).

* **Science GPA**: 3.80

* **MCAT Scores**: 32 (11 PS, 11 V, 10 BS)

* **Research**: Photonics West 2nd Author Abstract/Presentation, CA Society of Plastic Surgeons 2nd Author Conference Abstract/Presentation, 1st Author CHOC Pediatrics Conference Abstract/Presentation, 3 Undergraduate Symposium Presentations, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2nd Author Abstract, 1st Author Accepted Undergraduate Research Journal Submission, Journal of Surgical Research 2nd Author Publication, Undergraduate Research Fellowships. I was in one lab (Dermatology/Burn Wound Medical Optics) for three years, though I ended up joining an additional lab (due to an interest in medical 3D CAD modeling) that I quit after 1 year.

* **Volunteering (clinical)**: 1 year senior healthcare center (4 hr/week), 1 year in outpatient discharge and in-patient pharmacy for a hospital (4 hr/week)

* **Physician shadowing**: None currently. Currently in the phase of training and shadowing a surgeon during the summer

* **Non-clinical volunteering**: 8 weeks leading a STEM outreach program for urban underserved high school students (8 hr/week)

* **Extracurricular activities**: Biomedical Engineering Society Leader (Historian, Treasurer, Vice President), Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society Leader (Outreach Chair, Vice President). In addition, do a lot of visual arts (particularly in chalk art festivals), though I have never done it for an award/recognition.

* **Employment history**: None. Technically was an intern for the research lab (with paid stipend) before becoming an undergraduate research assistant (non-paid)

* **Immediate family members in medicine?**: None as a doctor/physician, but do have relatives that work as a nurse and pharmacist

* **Specialty of interest**: Dermatology (due to extensive research with surface tissue), Radiology (due to research work with medical optical technology), or Pediatrics (due to occasional baby-sitting jobs, helping out with children's program in my church, and the STEM outreach program)

* **Shadowing experience**: None, as explained in physician shadowing. Will be shadowing under a surgeon during the summer of this application season though.

* **Graduate degrees**: After this coming spring, will have a BSc. in biomedical engineering

* **Interest in rural health**: Not in particular, though I'm not particularly opposed to it either. I lack the experience of engaging with the rural population in regards to clinical outreach.

I applied for this internship a week and a half ago. 

I'm going to give a little background about myself, and if I can find something this late into the season, you can too. I was originally a philosophy major my first year in undergrad on a premed track, and I decided that I like tech and computers way more and ended up switching to computer engineering at the beginning of my Sophomore year. By that point I had nothing to put on my resume, no relevant course work, no experience, nada. So I didn't apply at all until my second semester where I finally started taking some C programming classes, circuits, etc. I waited all the way until April. I sat down and applied online for hours and hours and nothing. I can't count how many rejection emails I had gotten. I then decided to take  a more active approach to my search for an internship. I started pestering my professors if they knew anyone that was hiring and if they could ask any of their contacts. The semester had ended and I still didn't have a job (May 19th). So I got even more proactive, I started looking up engineering companies and called them asking if they were looking to hire any interns for the summer. This worked surprisingly well. Through this way, I landed 2 interviews. Since April, I've had 6 interviews and as of today I have 3 job offers where the one I accepted is 12 minutes away from my house door to door at a huge multinational company where I'll be doing software engineering. I got this job through a professor who referred me after the semester had ended. I physically went to the office where I spoke with the HR manager in person and handed her my resume. 

My experience is this, the online application system is a black hole. Don't waste too much time in this method. Focus on networking. I went to career services, I called people, I physically walked to offices to apply. Talk to everyone! I landed an interview by talking to an acquaintance of mine (whom I hadn't talked to in years) I ran into at a wedding who's father worked as a software engineer and introduced me. 

It's never too late and if you're still bummed about an internship, start calling and start talking. My friend landed an internship in July where she worked with AutoCAD and was later offered a full time position after graduation. 

Good luck!"

Like I said before I am an auditor, IT systems auditor/consultant to be exact. When I am sent in to audit a software/system I don’t just look at just the software/system itself, I look at everything that has control or influence over the functionality and security of the software/system everything from AD policies to the guard at the door. It seems trivial but security is a cumulative effort. Most people never realize this, this is a tale of one such audit.


It was time for $Big Bank’s independent review of security controls for all vendors and systems that touched customer data after a very public and embarrassing lawsuit over privacy, (sorry can’t say the details but it involved a corporate customer’s data ending up in bad hands and a massive, quarterly profits affecting massive, out of court settlement) so it was time for some [surprise audits](https://youtu.be/7WJXHY2OXGE). They needed to plug any holes since precedent had been set and it would be open season on them if it wasn’t plugged and someone got enough evidence to sue. AMC, my firm, got a decent share of the pie and being the lowly walker I am I got an insignificant outsourced ~~cold sales caller~~ business developer shop to audit. 

The shop in question was a small operation, the owner, 7 dedicated ~~cold callers~~ outreach personnel and the IT Guy. They had a simple home built browser app that they used to receive and process raw customer data from the bank and schedule and categorise their ~~cold sales calls~~ business development calls. Surprisingly the app was pretty damn good considering how home built apps for corporate work usually turns out. I mean the kid, yes it was a kid from college who did it, did his research and basically cloned what is normally sold by FOOL^© but for a fraction of the price and very specific algorithms to get what the shop needed from the raw dumps. He even applied best security practices on authentication, usernames, passwords, etc. Alone the software would have passed with flying colours, but of course no software is an island. 


Since it was being hosted on an AD controlled server and on and AD controlled workstation I had to review the AD. Everything was default, big no no. $Big Bank gave specific recommendations about AD security, audit trails, complexity, etc. that had to be signed off on and inspected. My thoughts, they changed them back after the bank’s review because reasons I guess. 


AD isn’t too bad, easily fixed, let’s look at the database, I should mention that the kid who made the software also offered to support it at a fee but the company cheaped out and turned it over to the in house IT who to be honest was not the brightest bulb. He ia is also the Database Admin, I am sure you see where this is going. They used phpmyadmin for their database. That by itself is not bad but it’s openly accessible via the web but with proper security its not bad. The administrator account was the default account “administrator” password “”. Red flag, big red flag.


I requested to see the tables where the data is store, they were all open, no attempt at obfuscation, with credit, debit and account numbers not obfuscated infact they were clearly visible and distinguishable. This was looking really bad and it got worse.


It was a small shop so they didn’t have a server room but repurposed workstations sharing desks with other users. The database server was under the IT guy’s desk and the main application was hosted on a server that was under the receptionist’s desk. I should mention that this was a home office, literally, it was half of the owner’s residence and the receptionist and IT guy both worked in the living room right next to a regular residential door. The PC’s didn’t have regulation HDD encryption, two factor authentication and they weren’t even bolted to the floor or something. 
 
Needless to say this looked bad. I wrote up the pretty damning report, it was sheer luck a bot hadn’t gotten into the DB and stolen the data and got back to the owner and the bank, he had 45 days to change it or lose the contract. He was of course panicking because the bank was 100% of his business. I told him the best thing he could do is get it fixed ASAP according to the guidelines in the report because the bank wasn't kidding around this time. Since it was a pretty small operation it wouldn’t be too hard. 

15 days in I made my follow up visit and to no one’s surprise IT Guy was gone. The owner was able to get the original kid over to fix it and when he heard he was an intern at IBM he offered him the job, so far its looking good but they are going to cut it real close, I honestly do wish them the best, the owner seemed like a genuinely nice guy even if his business makes my stomach turn.

388pyj,3,2015-06-02,"Dependent Mom Still Controlling Life (Long, but desperately need some insight)",Dreamgirl94025,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/388pyj/dependent_mom_still_controlling_life_long_but/,"Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education. 

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. Since then he has been dealing with child support, and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. In fact, he encouraged us to be open with her about the fact that I lost my virginity to him and he explained that he valued and respected me despite us doing it before marriage. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, we bought her a TV for Mothers day and he paid half plus purchased a converter box, he drives to my house as she doesn’t like me going to his house or be out so much etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by 
myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

388qek,3,2015-06-02,Advice for someone coming back to coding after leaving for a few years?,wemadeahole,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/388qek/advice_for_someone_coming_back_to_coding_after/,"   So I have kind of a strange situation. I graduated with my degree in computer science with a minor in math over 3 years ago with a mediocre gpa.  My job offers for cs were 40k or so salary. I graduated with student debt and my parents died when I was younger so I had no security or nest egg. Also I felt a little burnout so I went to the oilfield doing MWD instead. My company required an engineering degree normally but took mine. I made over 6 figures every year I've worked and was planning to make more this year before the oilfield crashed.  Ive managed to survive 3 rounds of layoffs and according to my boss I'll manage to survive many more or even the shutting down my district. I've advanced very fast at my job and I'm good at it.  I think that's a talking point I can use in an interview for an entry level cs job?  Anyways I'm burntout on working on oil rigs. 12 hr days are a blessing honestly. I find myself working over it seems majority of the time.  I'll be on an oil rig with no women, alcohol, privacy, decent food for over a month at a time in the middle of the gulf of mexico. I've helped out in the office on an 8-5   schedule before and even though the work was tedious I found it easy and my quality of life was vastly improved. Girls don't like it when you're gone all the time. Try to stay in shape for amateur boxing when there's no gym or anywheres to run or even do pushups on your rig and you're gone over half the year. Anyways I'm planning on making a move to nyc because gf is moving there for work. I'm also ready to get out of the south and get into an office. I can't do anything related to my current job over there so I'm touching up resume to get back into a cs job. Any of you been in a similar situation where you coding and try to get a job? How negatively will it reflect on my resume when I put last 3 yrs at a company doing nothing related? I know to keep quiet about my current salary because they will be worried about me leaving. Previous cs interviews for me were fairly simple technical questions which I'll have to touch up on I know. I was able to land offers in college without an internship but how much is that going to affect me trying to find a low paying entry level job in nyc?"

So far no internships and can't figure out what to do.,Epicestperson,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/388vhp/computer_engineer_junior_here_so_far_no/,"I've been applying for the past three weeks and can't find a single internship. I mean, yes I've applied to a lot of places, but it seems all positions are a split between IT, Web Developer, and iOS. All my courses at college have been teaching me hardware based programming like C and VHDL and such. I don't know what to do. I was really hoping for one internship and got told that they wanted someone with a more basic foundation for an entry level internship. I don't even want a high paying internship. All I really want is a internship for experience and low paying is fine. What should I do? I can't find anymore possible internships. I live in NY if that's anything.

Anyone have some guidance?"

388w9s,2,2015-06-02,Advice on bringing laptop?,ProjectProgramAMark,backpacking,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/388w9s/advice_on_bringing_laptop/,"Hey everyone! Embarking on my journey in around 12 days! I will be hitting China for a month, Europe for a month, and Thailand for a week. I need advice regarding a laptop.

I have an internship with a tech company here developing mobile apps, and they are giving me the option of working with them while abroad. This means that in my down time I can easily make enough money for the next day or two by sitting down and programming for a couple of hours. The laptop will also allow me to contact family members whenever I want and allow me to look up information with more speed than my phone would.

However, my two other friends I am going with are bringing their laptops, and so my thoughts were that I could easily use their laptop whenever in order to do my stuff. The problem with that would be I would spend quite a while setting everything up on their laptops in order to do my work from it, in which I would lose a lot of precious time doing it (my friends are already abroad so I can't set it up before I go).

It seems like having a laptop would be a great thing, especially since I am debating starting a blog as well while I'm traveling. The only problem is, I have a  Macbook that cost me around 1700, and even with the AppleCare, it doesn't cover the Macbook being broken or stolen, etc etc. So if I lose it, my life will become a lot harder for me back home (especially since I am a CS major).

My question is if you were in my shoes, would you bring the laptop with you and take the risk, or would you just leave it at home?

Thanks in advance everybody! It's been a dilemma I have been dealing with for a while and just thought I'd get third party opinions."

38941a,1,2015-06-02,Galapaghost,trrh,trrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/trrh/comments/38941a/galapaghost/,"Galapaghost was a monstrously large undead turtle. This made it very difficult for him to secure gainful employment. His resume was impeccable. A triple-major in Computer Science, Marine Biology, and Humpback Whale Linguistics. Perfect GPA. Multiple internships.

He received a steady stream of calls for interviews. But as soon as he showed up, the person from HR would take one look at him and start making excuses. Or run away screaming.

Employ me, Galapaghost prayed every night. Dear God, Dear Creator, Dear Everyone, please just help me find a place in the Universe. I want to contribute to the world. I’m sick of watching all these stupid documentaries on the internet and eating snack food all day long. I want to have somewhere to go, somewhere that’s outside my house. I want to be part of the world.

Galapaghost always felt better after praying. When you want something with all of your heart, the universe finds a way. That’s what it said in The Alchemist. And Galapaghost believed it.

He spent the morning sending off resumes, as usual. Around lunchtime, he was distracted by a news story about the war in Ukraine. Rebels in Donetsk had captured some Ukranian soldiers. The pictures were harrowing. One P.O.W. had two black eyes. He stared at the ground while the rebels paraded him through town.

A civilian woman was being forced to stand on a street corner at gunpoint. The rebels had draped a Ukranian flag around her and forced her to hold a sign that said ‘Spotter for Ukranian Artillery’. Commuters got out of their cars to shout at her and spit on her. Everything was ugly.

Galapaghost couldn’t look away. The images were disturbing, but they tugged at something inside him. Something deep within. This was injustice. This was wrong.

The microwave dinged, and Galapaghost shook off his reverie. When he was carrying his bowl of Ramen back to the computer desk, he noticed that a letter had been slipped under his door.

It was from SmithCorp. Had he applied to a company called SmithCorp? It didn’t sound familiar.

He grasped a letter opener in his bony fin and opened the letter.

    Thank you for sending us your resume. We are very interested in your unique skills. We would like to invite you for an interview this afternoon.

That was it. No other message. Just an address printed on the letterhead. What was SmithCorp anyway?

He checked Google. Nothing. That was odd. Definitely not a tech company. And ‘SmithCorp’ wasn’t the name anyone would give to an NGO devoted to Ocean Conservation efforts. Maybe it was a mistake. The letter had been meant for someone else.

He was about to throw the letter into the wastebasket when a little voice in his head spoke up. No, the voice said. Go to the interview.

But I don’t know anything about the company, Galapaghost thought. Even if they don’t change their minds when they see me, I’ll look like a fool when they ask me questions. I don’t even know what industry SmithCorp belongs to.

It doesn’t matter, the voice said. When you want something with all of your heart, the Universe conspires to bring it about.

Galapaghost took a long breath. He nodded. He could do this. He could give it a shot.

He went over to his closet and picked out his only suit. It had been tailor-made. A gift from his mother. He inspected himself in the mirror. The turtle skull looking back at him was confident. That guy in the mirror looked good. This was happening. This was his time.

He rode the bus, getting off a few blocks from SmithCorp’s building. The building was large, but it looked mostly empty.

“You’re Galapaghost, right?” A man in a charcoal suit said, walking towards him.

“Yes,” Galapaghost said, “That’s me.”

The man held out his hand. Galapaghost shook it with his fin-bone. He was astonished. He’d never made it this far into an interview before.

“Come inside,” the man said, “I’ll start your interview immediately.”

Galapaghost followed the man inside, looking around frantically to see any kind of logo or signage that would indicate what kind of company SmithCorp was. No luck. He didn’t even see a SmithCorp sign.

The walked inside and entered a small private room. Plastic chairs and a wooden table. No windows.

“How did you know I was coming?” Galapaghost asked, sitting down.

The man laughed. He looked at Galapaghost, expecting a smile. When the smile failed to materialize, the interviewer frowned, his eyebrows deepening dangerously. “I don’t think you’re giving us enough credit,” he said.

“Oh,” Galapaghost said, “I’m very sorry, sir. I meant no offense.” His heart was beating wildly. Someone had finally given him an interview and here he was, messing up his only chance.

The interviewer cleared his throat. “Situation,” he said, “You’re assigned to travel internationally. What do you do to prepare?”

“Um,” Galapaghost said, “Pack?”

The interviewer looked at him expectantly.

“Pack my stuff,” Galapaghost continued, trying to buy some time. What did they want him to say? What was the right answer here? He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He looked up at the clock. The thin red second hand was sweeping down in a broad arc.

“I-,” Galapaghost said, searchingly, “I would do some research,” he said in a burst of insight, “On the local language. See, I studied a form of Linguistics as one of my majors. I’m deeply interested in learning different languages and I feel that knowing something about the local language would give me a strategic advantage in any kind of negotiations that might come up.”

The interviewer nodded, satisfied.

Galapaghost realized that he had unconsciously been drawing his limbs and neck down into his shell. He relaxed, extending his limbs outside his shell.

“Situation,” the interviewer said, “You have a goal. Someone else has a goal which is contrary to your own. What do you do?”

Galapaghost grinned. He was ready for this one. “When you want something bad enough,” he said, “the whole universe conspires to give it to you.”

The man gave a look that was almost a smile. “Do you want this job more badly than the other guy?”

Galapaghost nodded. “Oh yeah,” he said, “I definitely want this job more than the other guy.” It was true. He still couldn’t tell what it was, but somehow it felt right. He needed this to work out.

The man asked more and more questions about ‘Situations’. Some were vague, some specific, some bizarre. Some questions involved violence. Was this some kind of psychological screening?

For some reason, Galapaghost found himself talking about the article he’d read about Ukraine that day. It was a terrible mistake, he knew. It made him look unhinged.

But it made the interviewer happy. He asked Galapaghost a barrage of follow-up questions about Ukraine, and geopolitics in general. Galapaghost surprised himself. He ended up sounding pretty well-informed. Watching documentaries and reading articles had paid off.

After an hour, the interviewer paused. “You’re an impressive candidate,” he said finally, “But why do you want to work for us? You could get a more traditional job at any company.”

Galapaghost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Had he gotten the job? That’s what it sounded like. But now was definitely not the time to admit that no one else would hire him. He had to think of something fast. What did this company do? He still had no idea. But he knew why he wanted a job. He smiled.

“I want to do something meaningful,” Galapaghost said. “I care about the world a lot. And I want to be on the side of good. Making things better. Fixing problems.”

The man nodded thoughtfully. “You know,” he said, “A lot of people think that what we do isn’t meaningful. But I think it’s the most meaningful thing in the world.”

He continued, “When I come home from an assignment. And I see my little daughter sleeping peacefully. I know what it takes.” Emotion crept into his voice, “I know what it takes to keep this country the kind of place where little girls like her can sleep peacefully.”

He cleared his throat.

“How soon can you move to Langley?” he said.

“Langley?” I asked.

“To begin your training,” he said, “We’ll start you off as an analyst, but even our analysts have to go through training.”

Galapaghost’s jaw dropped. Now he remembered sending off his resume. This job was beyond his wildest dreams. He never expected them to contact him. Especially not in such a secretive way.

The man smiled again. “Welcome to the C.I.A.”"

**Excerpt**
   
Holding hands, I’m barely aware of anything aside from Aaron’s fingers entwined with mine as we walk out of the building.
   

   
“Golly, he’s adorable!” I exclaim when I catch sight of a beautiful chocolate Lab happily looking out of the window at us as we approach Aaron’s truck. Russell is even cuter in person that he was in the tiny picture I saw last week.
   

   
He’s standing on the passenger’s seat with his tongue hanging out to one side, his warm breath visibly hitting the cold air, and his golden eyes alight with what can only be described as happiness. “I wish I had my camera.”
   
___If only I could capture the obvious love for life he’s exuding._“
   

   
Let me turn on the truck and roll down the window so you can say hello,” Aaron says, letting go of my hand and moving around the hood to the driver’s side.
   

   
Russell and I stare at each other in excited interest, his more visible than mine. He whines pitifully, as his entire body quivers and he beats his tail back and forth.
   

   
As soon as Aaron begins rolling down the window, Russell’s nose is poking out through as much of it as possible until it’s down far enough for him to reach me.
   

   
“Hello there,” I say, reaching out one hand to try and pat him as his head moves around wildly in an attempt to lick me instead.
   

   
“Are you a good boy?” I coo, scratching the soft downy fur behind his ears.
   

   
“Sometimes,” Aaron quips, now standing next to me.
   

   
Again, I wordlessly hand him my mocha, freeing up both hands so I can take hold of Russell's head and give him several kisses on his forehead.
   
   
“I don’t believe your Daddy. I bet you’re the sweetest boy ever. Aren’t you?”
   

   
He begins licking my chin gently as he attempts to climb out of the truck and into my arms.
   

   
“Stay inside, baby,” I laugh, trying to push him back through the window and into the truck.
   

   
“Enough. Russell, sit,” Aaron says sternly. Russell’s eyes move to look at him, but he continues to thump his tail, kiss me, and attempt to climb into my arms.
   

   
“I said, sit!” Aaron growls sternly, moving closer to the open window.
   

   
Russell sits down looking petulant, but sticks his head as far out of the window as possible to continue his greeting.
   

   
“Yes, I love you, too,” I say, scratching Russell behind his ears and giving him several more kisses.
   

   
“You need to get your own woman, buddy. Nina’s mine,” Aaron says, placing my mocha on the hood of the truck before pulling me away and turning me to face him.
   
___Nina’s mine._
   
___Golly, I like the sound of that!_
   

   
I giggle and reach up to tuck his hair behind his ears. “Don’t be jealous, Aaron. I’ll scratch you behind your ears, too.”
   

   
Aaron leans down and silences me with a deep, possessive kiss. There is a faint tingle of toothpaste, tang of orange juice, and the bite of coffee, all mixed with what I'm beginning to associate with as Aaron’s taste.
   
___Delicious!_
   

   
“Not in front of the baby,” I laugh, pushing him back from where he now has me pinned against the truck.
   

   
“Russell, close your eyes,” he commands, before the arms that are wrapped around my waist are pulling me back in. As Aaron kisses me again, my arms wind their way around his neck and I move in closer, pressing myself into his hard body.
   

   
His firm hands travel down to roughly cup my backside, causing me to moan with pleasure. Encouraged, he lifts me slightly so we are touching intimately, and I can feel his excitement growing harder against me. We both groan at the contact.
   

   
Dropping me gently back onto my feet, he pulls away. We are mutually panting and gasping for breath. “I really gotta go,” Aaron whispers, clearly annoyed.
   

   
“Right, that thing called work.”
   

   
“Yeah,” he says, removing his hands from my behind and running them up and down my back, making no move to pull away completely.
   

   
Standing in his arms, shielded from the cold, I feel safe, cared for, and desired. Moving my hands down his chest, I wish I could feel Aaron’s warm skin and his muscles reacting to my touch. I wrap my arms around his waist and pull myself in closer. Looking up into his face, I’m mesmerized by his long, dark eyelashes and cobalt eyes.
   
___I could stay like this forever._
   

   
Resting his forehead against mine, we stand still, breathing each other in. Neither one of us really want to move.
   

   
“I’d much rather take you inside and continue kissing you. I need to kiss all of you—_every inch_,” Aaron whispers, his words heated with meaning. “There—there are so many things I want us to do together.”
   

   
His words send a thrill of excitement through my body, heating me with anticipation.“Later?” I ask, my voice rough and hopeful.

My B4 start date is approximately 4 months out and I am curious as to whether or not it is appropriate to try and preemptively transfer from the office I interned with to another in the area (the office I was associated with for my internship was mainly selected because of my school's location). 

Now that I finished with school and back at my home, the current location is still viable for me, but there are others that are more preferable. Would there be any harm in asking about the option to transfer, given that there openings in the alternative locations? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

First, since my graduation in December, I have been working for a public entity doing not very interesting work, and they may not sponsor me in the future (my boss is taking his time answering that). So I have been applying to several places, but the majority don't offer visa sponsorship for the positions I apply.

My Strategy:
 - Extracted company names that sponsored visas in 2014 and 2015 and organized in descending order, and began applying from top down (Infosys, Deloitte, IBM, etc..)
- Applied through my university career website, and through each company's career website (taleo, succesfactor, etc..)
 - I have a BA in Computer Science (high GPA) from a small liberal arts school, and a MS in Systems Engineering from an Ivy league school (but low GPA).
 - I am applying to analytic/software jobs such as:  product manager, business analyst, data analyst, risk analyst, financial analyst.

Results:
 -Majority of companies (including large ones like IBM, Aon) won't sponsor for the positions I qualify, only for software development. Sadly, I haven't had internships, or work experience in programming.
 - I have had over 10 phone interviews just to realize they don't or they may consider international students, but I don't get a second interview. 

Any advice? How should I change my strategy to land a job?My OPT just started in April, so I should have 27 months left because I have STEM extension. "

So, when I got home, I went on their website to check what positions were open for that particular store, and it showed that there were openings for cashier/clerk...
I tried calling him, to ask about it. He gave a greeting, and I thought he sounded kind of gentle and nice, but as soon as I asked, ""I heard that you were hiring..."", he quickly turned it around and did this really audible and annoyed sigh, and in a lower/annoyed tone of voice said, ""We're only looking for supervisor trainees"", and I said ""Ok"", and then hung up RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of when I said ""Bye"".

I mean, I understand if he's busy or annoyed at getting too many calls, but I am still a customer there, and this felt really mean of him. I don't think I did anything wrong, I just did what I was instructed to since the website did not work. I would have been fine if he had tried to be more polite, and at least say bye, instead of having this, ""Ugh go away"" tone and hanging up while I'm just trying to politely say bye.

Maybe I had too high expectations, but is this normal? The last place I worked at(a paid internship), the manager was very nice and friendly, so I don't really know anymore. It could be because I had the previous job from a program for disabled students, that maybe that previous manager was nice to me, and maybe all managers are like that?

I do have anxiety and depression, with anxiety being the worst, so this does really put me down, but I think I reacted as well as I could have, and I'm only feeling the struggle now while typing this, questioning peoples' rudeness.

I had always liked the cashiers there, because they were so friendly and nice, but now I think I might feel awkward walking into the store."

389vdh,2,2015-06-02,Hi i need some advice on whether to double major or do a masters.,sijose,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/389vdh/hi_i_need_some_advice_on_whether_to_double_major/,"Sorry for making this post so long I just need advice so please bare with me.

I'm an junior double majoring in accounting and finance at a top 100 business school. This upcoming winter I'm going to have the opportunity to either stick with the path I'm on or switch to a bachelor and masters in accounting program. At the moment if I stay in the program I'm in this fall will be very important as meet the firms is held for summer internships. My overall gpa is only a 3.11. I know with that gpa i won't have much of a chance at a big four internship particularly the pwc minority program internship. I know for that one you a 3.4 overall gpa so I'm pretty sure I have zero chance at getting the opportunity to intern there. At the same time I know if I did the five year program that I would have an additional year to move my gpa to a 3.4,or above, thus making me more competitive for internships. The only thing is if I did the five year program I wouldn't be in school for five years it would be more like six years. This is because I was at another university majoring in agriculture before I transferred to my current university. I had been taken some upper level courses in my previous school  that was counted as electives in the school I'm at now. So I basically lost a semester by transferring schools. In my mind I want to do the five year program but I'm worried that people will assume that I did six years because I was extremely lazy plus the school I was at is an large sec school so I'm worried that people will think I left that school for the wrong reasons. Really I left because the out of state tuition was too much for me but what if recruiters question that? I also realize I have bad study habits that led to my gpa being poor. I took intermediate accounting 1 and pretty much barely read the book plus I didn't do much of the practice material yet I still got a b. I know I can get a 3.5 gpa or above I just need to put in the effort. In the end I'm not sure what to do stay a double major while graduating in May 2017 or do the masters and graduate in May 2018.

I've come in to contact with a few people from my adolescence (very recent adolesence, Im 20 now) and I'm seeing people graduate college and become engineers and get internships and while I'm immensely happy for them, it bruises my self-esteem. I know that these people are a few years older than me and only one guy my age is getting an engineering internship that I know of but it all still makes me feel like a damn failure. I still have 3 semesters of community college to go before I can transfer to a 4-year university and god knows how long it will take there to actually  get my degree. Right now I'm just struggling to pay off my debt from the 2014 fall semester which I half tanked. I don't have a car either so I'm not sure how I'll get to school if I make my payments in time to re-enroll this fall where I'll be picking up the pieces from last fall semester. All of this just weighs really fucking heavy on me. If you've read this far, I'm impressed as I'm really just spewing out why I'm upset in order to vent. 

Anyways, I can't give up. I know that things will get better and that my biggest enemy is myself and my self-defeating thoughts. I can't stop trying because the second I really fail is the second that I really give up. Being sober for me right now means dealing with reality and its not easy, but I'm doing it. 

Thanks for being here fellow leavers, best of luck to you all in your sobriety.  "
38a8jc,2,2015-06-02,Temporary full-time position before salary.. how do I negotiate wages?,gdragon90,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/38a8jc/temporary_fulltime_position_before_salary_how_do/,"Hi careeradvice,

TL;DR: My employer wants to hire me as a full time employee temporarily (for ~1 month) until I can be hired as a salaried employee. I have a target salary but since there is a difference in responsibilities between full-time and salaried I am not sure how to negotiate. 

More info:
I am currently a Programmer Analyst intern since last June located in Bakersfield, CA. Since starting, I have been working on projects with other salaried employees. My schedule has been flexible because of school and now that I am graduating I am told I will be offered a salaried position. However, there is currently some corporate rearrangement going on and there is a hiring freeze. This means that approval from high up in the (large) company is needed for hiring me as a salaried programmer.

I am told that this means I may have to wait until the new fiscal year (August 1st) before I am hired as a salaried employee. In the mean time, they want me to become full-time with increased pay (my previous pay was based on my school experience and was $13/hr) I do not know how much the full-time pay is but it is apparently causing additional problems for HR because it is a large difference.

As a salaried employee, I am hoping to make $65,000 to $70,000. How should I negotiate my wages if I am hired full-time? A salaried employee has additional responsibilities (like on call support) that a full-time employee would not have. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I try to negotiate for a wage equal to my desired salary?

Thank you very much for your time.

38acvz,7,2015-06-02,"New GM, full time manager hates her, restaurant staff suffering. (Long and rant-y)",kshearules,TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/38acvz/new_gm_full_time_manager_hates_her_restaurant/,"We just got a new GM
She's fine, but our restaurant is tough to learn. The problem is one of our salaried full time managers absolutely hates her like poison, and spends the majority of the shifts he runs talking about how much he hates her and how much she is ruining the restaurant. 
I have a hybrid position: a combination of serving, bartending, and managing. There's a full time AGM, as well.
The entire atmosphere of the restaurant is being poisoned by the salaried manager, making it very difficult for the new GM and the AGM to keep the staff positive even when he's not in the building. His shifts are absolute hate-fests, and it feels like if you aren't aboard the hate train, you are also the focus of his ire. He's told her right to her face that he doesn't like her, *but he's able to be civil and work with her*; which is patently untrue. 
Today, I walked in to work and before I even saw any of my colleagues I could hear the very loud complaining. Himself, the other server, and a former employee were mocking a note (a nice note that complimented the staff, which also had a few new policies. Nothing to merit the horror vented). The former employee walked out of a shift about two weeks back, then pulled a no-call no-show. The new GM had left her several messages about her employment status, she never returned those calls- so after about a week the AGM sent in termination papers. The night she walked out, she had a verbal altercation with the hate-manny- but from what I understand the two of them are now friends under the hate umbrella of 'oh, that new GM cunt just fucked you out of your job.' Less then a week ago, the former employee came in and his hate was directed at her, as she had a temper tantrum, walked out, and never apologized. 
On the shifts I run, and on the AGM's shifts, there isn't a lot of complaining mainly because we set the tone of our shifts as positive and don't tolerate negativity. Herself and I are on board with the new GM. All of her policy changes are things we should have been doing all along, and everything has an explainable purpose. 
We have a bunch of employees who have whittled their availability down to &gt;3 shifts a week. One of these employees got a month long internship, and asked the GM for a leave of absense- asking to return for her two weekly shifts. The GM told her that she wouldn't hold her job for her as her availability was too little to merit holding the position- to my mind, this makes sense- GM has notified the staff verbally and in writing that if these part part-timers can't loosen up more availability their shifts won't be guarenteed, and will most likely be reassigned to current employees with greater availability or to new hires. Angry manager was motherucking the GM up and down today over the 'unfair loss of a really good employee' *in front of several other workers*... which is completely unfair I don't care if she's the greatest employee we ever had, it's just not good to hold a job open for someone who only can work two shifts, neither of them on weekends. Another employee gave notice last night- she is a nanny full time during the summer, plus she has accepted an interim director position at the nursery school she works at. Her reasons for leaving have nothing to do with the restaurant, but today the angry manager turned the situation on it's ear, telling everyone that the GM is the reason the employee gave notice.
It's soooo hard to keep spirits up during this period of transition. Every little bit of positivity the AGM and I try to pump into the place during our shifts gets decimated by him in the first five minutes he walks in the door. He's pulled up her fb and mocked her in front of at least ten employees. Everything she does, he calls her a dumb cunt. There is no way he's ever going to change his opinion of her, but he's made it impossible for employees on his shift to *not* hate her without fear of reprisal. Today, I mentioned that the new check in server sheets were actually a good thing; I was called a kiss ass and told I didn't know what I was talking about- not by him, but by the other workers. The GM has given me the task of reorganizing the side work, and while I was making notes about par lists and additions/changes to our six year old system; one of the other workers told me that redoing the side work was a stupid idea. Not by angry manager, but he was aware of what I was doing, as I told him and asked him if there was anything he thought we should add.
Sorry this was such a long and scattered rant. I'm just at my wit's end and don't quite know what to do."

I spend a lot of time on this subreddit looking through the various problems and accomplishments that my fellow redditors have in regards to their finances. Recently I have been more and more interested in doing something with money that I have saved up over the years from gifts and summer jobs. I've read past (top) threads
advising people in what to do with X amount of money if they're X age and such. I want you guys to do the same. Place yourself in my shoes and tell me what you'd do with your money.

Details:

- I'm 20 years old, just finished my sophomore year of college. I have two more years of college left.

- I have a scholarships that pay for most of my tuition and other expenses. However, thus far I have taken loans to cover the difference that my scholarships do not.

- Other the course of 2 years, these loans total **$8.5K**. Continuing this trend, I expect to leave school with **~$17k** in loans.

- Starting this Fall semester, I will be renting an off campus apartment with two other people and the my rent will total **$6600** or **$550**/month.

- I have **$1K** in a checking account right now. I have a summer internship where I will be making **~$7600** (after taxes) over the course of 3 months.

- Finally, I have **$5000** in cash in my house. This is money I've saved over many years.

Summary:
 
- 
**$8500** in student loans thus far. Expected to be **~$17000** by the time I graduate.

-  **$1000** in checking account. **$7600** to be added from summer internship.

-  **$5000** in cash.

- **$6600** or **$550**/month in expenses.

- I do not have a car or any other expenses.


Now, with all this information, what would *you* do with the $5000 (or any of the money) that is currently collecting dust?"

I'm out of school, didn't finish my degree. Specific questions are below. Thanks for looking.**

I started coding at age 14 on a MUD, over the next 12 years it remained a hobby. Didn't go to college after high school, worked full-time mostly in service/support call-centers from 18-25, left my job as a licensed insurance claims adjuster and worked on the US census in 2010 as a sort of regional supervisor/trainer, made good money and saved it all for school. Got unemployment benefits, went into college full-time at 26 and had benefits for nearly 2 years - hard to turn down, mistake in hindsight. I held a perfect 4.0 for 5 semesters in Physics and used Python &amp; C++ for simulations and numerical analysis. I started to lose interest in where Physics was going to take me career-wise so I switched to ""Computer Information Systems"" as my school didn't offer CS or SE. I did well for the first couple semesters but my GPA slipped a bit. I found it easy and boring. I was coasting.

Finally I hit a class where OOP was dissected and it all clicked. We weren't going deep, just small console apps that didn't *do* anything. I looked forward in the curriculum and saw little new material coming my way; nothing about Linux beyond Unix file systems, nothing about version control, no portfolio-worthy projects. I stopped going to most classes April/May 2013 and ravenously put in 15-30 hour coding binges building Java 2D games. I didn't use any frameworks and really delved into game logic &amp; OO design, studying it in books, lecture courses, and youtube. I used my physics knowledge to manually implement simple physics. I let myself get terrible grades, even missed a couple exams - but I was building *real* stuff. It felt so good.

Bitcoin bubble began rumbling that summer, I started building mining rigs and daytrading crypto. By early 2014 I was addicted to trading profits. I completely abandoned that semester 4 weeks in, I really thought this was it: daytrading was obviously a great career and I was great at it (derp). I dove into Linux and started coding crypto-related projects. Made my own altcoins (never released them), a C# trading app that interfaced with exchange APIs to automate trading, a couple utilities to help me notice news/events in the market, etc. I learned about Linux, VMWare, VPS, and CLI tools that would be relevant for an entry level sysadmin or NOC type job. Linux was demystified and I got comfortable on git - awesome. I expected to get all D's or F's that semester - instead the school withdrew me on my behalf. I now owed grant money back but I wouldn't find that out for another six months when the bill came. I thought I had my career as a trader.

By August the markets were very different and profits had stalled. I still had to pay bills and eat - no problem, my bankroll was still solid - I'd ride it out. Long story short I started gambling (margin trading) on unregulated exchanges, Bitcoin kept falling, I was living entirely off of my bankroll, and by Nov-Dec 2014 after some huge losses I briefly tried real ForEx trading but finally resigned to the fact that it was over - this wasn't my career, I just lucked out. I started looking for jobs. I interviewed around my non-tech town but my lack of a paper credential or real experience at an IT job was a brick wall. A couple guys were intrigued about my crypto adventures but no one was impressed... with so few software jobs around here they could pick an experienced professional.

Frustrated, it was now the start of 2015, I couldn't afford to pay back my grants to get transcripts - gambled it all away.  I found bootcamps - couldn't afford those either. Maybe AppAcademy? Ok, time to learn webdev. I obsessively dove into The Odin Project to prepare, 15-30 hour stints again, learned a ton of new stuff. March 2015 family tragedy, the last of my money and the next 2 months of my time was needed elsewhere; coding was on hold. A few weeks ago in May a distant relative offered to cover the deposit for AppAcademy if I get in. I brushed up on what I was doing and I applied very recently - I'm hopeful but I'm not banking on it. I redid my resume this past weekend taking advice from reddit. I signed up for a ton of meetups in my area to try to network better. I'm willing and even eager to relocate. I just need *something* - a job, a chance, AppAcademy - whatever. I read threads on reddit saying they're having trouble finding people who can do FizzBuzz or a merge sort and I'm shocked. I know I have the chops to excel in an entry level position.

Thank you so much for reading if you made it this far.

**So, my questions:**

1) Should I just start shotgun blasting out resumes to Cali, Seattle, Denver, NYC? [Anonymous copy of resume] (http://www.mediafire.com/view/rvvaxrq7crb0wh1/anon_resume.pdf). Is my lack of transcripts/degree/certs just as much of a barrier there as seems to be in my non-tech hometown?

2) I'm willing to work for minimum wage or even free if it involves code or a terminal so I can finally get my hand stamped to be in the IT/software club. I'd rather code for free than go back to mindless office jobs. Can I get internships out of school? Is my age (now 30) a massive problem? I'll take *anything* to get started. I realize I screwed up coasting on benefits and lucky timing crypto adventures during school instead of working.

3) I'm not exactly afraid of the whiteboard, I prototype/brainstorm on paper and whiteboards all the time. I'm pretty confident about a lot of basic DS &amp; Algo's (stack, queue, LL, recursive algos, sorting algos, etc) - but reading *Cracking the Coding Interview* made me feel like I'm not ready in the slightest. I just read it over the weekend and intend to keep hammering out challenges. Is every interview process and whiteboard session in tech cities as comprehensive and intimidating as the ones described for the top companies the book?

4) Any suggestions? Did I get serious too late? Did I screw myself with the past 5 years of no official paychecks? I filed my crypto stuff in taxes but no one around here takes my crypto stint seriously as a job, even though I was putting in 100+ hours a week on it and living off it. Any guidance would be massively appreciated."

**Background and miscellaneous crap first (I have no clue what's relevant and what isn't):** I'm a caucasian male from Brooklyn at the end of my junior year. My mom has a bachelor's degree from Pace University. My dad has a bachelor's degree from NYU, master's degrees from CUNY Brooklyn College and Fordham University, and is currently a PhD student at Adelphi University. I suffer from panic disorder w/ agoraphobia so staying at home in NYC might serve me well (or kill me, I'm not sure). We're nowhere near well-off, yet my parents insist that they want to pay for my college. I have no idea what I want to major in. I think I want to be a doctor but I'm far from sure. Majors that I've been interested when browsing include Biology, Neuroscience, Anthropology, Political Science, Public Policy, and International Development Studies. Schools that I'm heavily interested in include CUNY City College (Macaulay Honors, possibly also the biomedical program, but I'm not hopeful on making either), SUNY Stony Brook University, SUNY Binghamton University, University of Toronto, McGill University, and New York University (ridiculously expensive and I have no idea how my family would afford it). I love living in the city. I'm particularly attracted to McGill due to the reputation, cost, being far away from home, quality of education, and the opportunity to immerse myself in the French language.

38aoab,20,2015-06-02,70+ Companies Bay Area No Job,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38aoab/70_companies_bay_area_no_job/,"I graduate in 2 weeks and have been applying for jobs in SF/Bay since April 1st after spring break. I know I should have started earlier to get better chances. I have had 4-5 phone interviews, 2-3 technical interviews, and 1 onsite (which I didnt do too well but get the results in a few days). Oddly, a google recruiter contacted me 2 days after applying so I have that interview to do. I have a 3.2 gpa, technical work at campus department, no internships at tech comapnies, and 3-4 Android projects.

I have exhausted indeed, glassdoor, dice, linkedin, and other job board new grad/entry level software engineering positions. I dont know what to do anymore besides just applying to more. I just need to get my foot in the door but I dont think many companies are willing to accept a new grad with little experience. 

Any advice, feedback, etc is welcome. I know there are no magical solutions so even resources/tips to find more jobs is welcome.

Edit: I never said or think the Bay Area is the best place to work nor do I think its some kind of Disneyland for SE jobs. I live in the Bay so that is naturally where I would apply to work. The Bay and Silicon Valley are large areas and have lots of opportunities but I feel I have applied to most of the job opportunities or at least those jobs are getting increasingly difficult to find.

I work basic tech support for a company that has roughly 700 employees. I do much of the easy tasks whenever we get requests into our ticketing system. Mostly toner changes some troubleshooting and installing software here and there. This is my second time at the job as I have only worked there during the summer as a sort of ""intern,"" but I have learned a lot and have seen a fair share of ridiculous requests and issues. My future posts, will be shorter and better formatted as I get the hang of typing these up. To the story!

This happened just a little while ago. I end my day at 5-5:30PM. One of the analysts in a different office takes over watching what issues come in after my help desk cohorts and I leave for the day. My mom, who also works in IT at this company is in charge of the 24/7 phone. It's name explains itself, it is used to go over what issues come in after hours and reply to anything that is especially urgent.

She picks up the phone and begins reading one of the emails that came in,""The laptop bag I was using to store the tablet in has been stolen from my car. Can you shut off the tablet ASAP?""

I chuckle, ""Well, that's not happening tonight.""

Some background, One of our junior network admins spent several hours creating the image to drop onto the tablet and then I spent another hour packaging that one and a number of other tablets to be shipped out to our sales people, who get pretty much whatever they ask for. 
Of course, there's nothing we can do at the moment. Tomorrow morning is going to be interesting. I will update with more information as we research the issue. 

Thanks, Theprofessor23



EDIT: The one way we could track it would be to turn the Verizon Air Card that is installed in it, back on and have them track it. That didn't seem like an option that the team was going to take. The sales guy will just have to file a police report. Not a storybook ending, but that's how the cards fall in this case. "

My time in university was rushed; I transferred from a state university to a ""better"" university after 2 years because my parents kept nagging at me that the former wasn't a real university. (For those of you familiar with colleges in California, I went from a CSU to a UC.) I then proceeded to cram in classes and summer sessions, because my parents kept nagging at me to graduate within 4 years total and that they didn't have enough money to keep me in school. So I graduated, without an internship, without talking to any professors/counselors/whatever about my career choices and where to go from there. I finally got my current job through a friend, after half-assing the job search for half a year. I've been at my current company for just over 3 years now. Didn't do much for the first year an a half or so because the team I got hired onto kept running into rough patches with managers, and frequently didn't have one. And I was stuck working with a ""senior"" software engineer who frequently didn't understand the task given to him and refused to listen to anyone else opinion.

**TL;DR**: Rushed to get a degree, never did any internships, only got current job through connections. Had current job for 3 years, with the first year and a half pretty much being wasted.


I just recently had my first software release of any kind, an Android app that is meant to be used along with one of our hardware products. The reviews on it are terrible, because of a certain way the app behaves. And because of that, the reviews on the hardware are terrible too. I made fixes that completely changed the way the app behaves and now we've been trying to push an update to the Play store for a month now except... The QA team keeps finding new bugs. Nothing that crashes the app, just UX related things.

This is the first Android app I've ever written, this is my first time coding in Java, and I was the sole developer. I'm actually a little proud of myself for how it turned out regardless of the bugs. But I just feel so shitty about my abilities as a developer. We're blocked on releasing the update that we desperately need, but QA keeps finding these bugs due to my shitty coding.

Is what I'm feeling normal? Is this software update QA process normal? What should I be doing to avoid these kinds of situations in the future? I feel like I'm missing something important in the development process that no one ever told me about..."

I was wondering if anyone has some insights to help me.

This summer I have two options:

1.) Find an engineering related summer internship.

2.) Start early this summer on my graduate practicum project so I will be able to accomplish a bigger project.

My M.Eng program is only 2 semesters long (9 months). I will be taking 7 grad courses (spread throughout both semesters) on top of the graduate project. 

I was hoping to start early this summer on the graduate project with full-time effort from July - August, and part-time effort from Sept to May. This is only if my summer is available. 

But if I do a 9-week internship this summer instead, I don't know what show-worthy practicum project I can do within the time-frame of 9 months (Sept - May) on top of 7 grad courses. At the same time, an internship is valuable to get a job after graduation.

I am grateful for any advice. Thank you guys!"

Starting with Team **Fan Favourite:**

---

**Part 1**

Okay as you can see there are alot weights hanging in a tree, about 15 feet up. for part 1, you will be creating some type of ladder in order for you to go up and cut the down the weights. It doesn't even need to be a latter as long as one of can get up there. The materials you can chose from included.... * 15 foot long log * Steel rope * Giant fan * Duck tape * Duck tape * Giant cauldron * Glue * Giant rubber band * Basket full of butterflies * Fireworks * stones * stuffed bear * SCISSORS * flame thrower * trampoline You can only use 7 objects. Now not only will you be graded about getting up there but you will be graded on getting down safely. This challenge will also be graded on functionality and creativity.

**Practicality: 7/10** - Creativity challenges are tried and true with practicality, and this seems fair and decent, 4 different gradings though? That might be a little too much for just 1 part of a challenge

**Creativity: 3/10** - Not super creative, since it's basically taking the bridge challenge and turning your head 90 degrees upwards, and it's getting quite a low score just for the fact that basically all of the items were taken from previous creativity challenge

**Coolness: 5/10** - It's not particularly cool, nor is it particularly uncool. not really much to say about it otherwise.

---

**Part 2**



First of all, there should be a long streak of tar with wooden poles dotted throughout; the more weight you carry, the lower your chances are of getting across, where if you fall, you lost 15 seconds on your time. Then, there should be a rope swing where you must make the right movements in order to get across without getting hit by projectiles shot at you. (Blasts of water, pepper spray shots, spike balls swinging back and forth) The more time you take to stop and wait for them to pass, the lower your chances of succeeding, due to the weight dragging you down. Every time you wait, you lose 5 seconds. Lastly, the should be a long board covered in slime (not unlike Pahkitew's) with rope ladders leading up. The catch? The ropes themselves are covered in slime, so you have to be fast. On top of that, if you fell prior to this, The people of the opposing team who completed before can dump water on you. You lost 10 seconds if you fall. The sooner a contestant gets to the end, the better, for this is a race to the end, in order to put the weights down.

**Practicality: 0/10** - Ok... so what? I have literally no idea what the hell I am supposed to submit for a part like this, literally the only thing I can gather is that I need to get a lower time. But there is literally nothing telling me to do anything, so it's entirely impractical.

**Creativity: 4/10** - There is nothing exceptionally creative about this challenge, most of the things I assume we would submit are things that have been done before

**Coolness: 3/10** - honestly, it was a cool challenge, but it was so saturated with... stuff that it makes it really uncool, more confusing than anything else.

---

**Part 3**

For the 3rd part of the challenge. You will have to select a member of your team to hold all the weight the other team managed to get across from part 2. Of course, as soon as the other team gets to the end they are placing the weights on you. So you better hope your team gets to your opponent before they get to you. However you will get to pick which spot to put the weight. Your arms, legs, back, torso, or neck. Each body part will be able to hold the weight for different periods of time.

For everyone else, with the weights you must decide where to place them. Left-Left. Left-Middle. Left-Right. Center. Right-Left. Right-Center. Right-Right. Some spots will make the weights seem a lot heavier than they are and how you organize the weights will impact how long the contestants may hold them. The team who cannot keep the weights on them before dropping them loses.


**Practicality: 7/10** - It works. That's a big thing. It's a little unclear as to how it works, but it works.

**Creativity: 6/10** - props for combining time based and simple left right left challenges, but there is nothing that screams creativity either.

**Coolness: 7/10** - Not too sure why, but I like this part a lot, perhaps it's the survivor esq feel, or the simplicity, yet complexity of it.

---

**Blendyness: 3/10** - The first part of the challenge has nothing to do with being time based, while the second ones do, and the only real meritable blendyness is that  you go from weights in trees to weights on people.

**Final Score: 49/104** (+4 thanks to Gwen's Handy Dandy score card)

---

Now for team **Dratini Diddlers**

---

**Part 1**

For part one we made a few fakes and you must pick what ones are fake. Here are your choices. Pikachu, dragonite, pichu, ponyta, snivy, greninja, jigglypuff, lucario, Mewtwo. You get 3 choices so pick wisely!

for the challenge part the host would pick the ones that will be fake

for each part of the challenge the winning team will get 20 xp, 2 place will get 10 xp, and 3 place will get 5 xp. The team with the most xp at the end will win in the end. That idea came from shawn

**Practicality: 5/10** - It works as a challenge, it isn't very well elaborated on, but I see that it works, which is something.

**Creativity: 4/10** - It's not very creative, considering it's just a run of the mill challenge

**Coolness: 6/10** - the pokemon theme is nice, but the fakes dont really have anything to do with pokemon specifically.

---

**Part 2**

So my last submission to you was just kind of the prototype of the challenge. So for part 2 now we're going to make it so that you need to drain the HP from the Pokemon in order to train/catch them. You need to pick between 1-10 HP to drain but if you drain too much the Pokemon will faint and you won't score any points. This adds some complexity to part 2 instead of just picking a number between 1-10. And like i said the challenge I sent you earlier was just a prototype (didn't realize it at the time I sent it in) so if other people send in changes to parts 1 or 3 disregard what I had sent. 

**Practicality: 8/10** - A tried and true challenge, with a little more intrigue than a completely basic challenge

**Creativity: 4/10** - It's not really an original or ground breaking idea, nothing exceptionally special

**Coolness: 8/10** - I gotta say, I love the whole taming pokemon thing, it really works with the challenge and is pretty awesome

---

**Part 3**

For part three you will be battling a intern cough I mean trainer! You must chose to use tackle or tail whip 5 times (example. Tackle, tackle, tail whip, tail whip, tail whip)

**Practicality: 8/10** - it's clear, and it works, which is more than can be said about most of the challenges

**Creativity: 4/10** - it's not super original, and is a very ""left right left"" challenge, but at least it fits the theme

**Coolness: 4/10** - Huge wasted potential with the idea of 

---

**Blendyness: 8/10** - the first part is a little iffy, but the last two parts blend perfectly, and it's not like the first part is completely exclusive, also the XP system works really nicely.

**Final Score: 59/100**

---

And with that, Team **Pikachu Pedos win immunity!** They all also get a shot at Idol Island!

So Team **Fan Favourite** You are going to need to vote someone out of this game!

I really need advice and my post was removed from /r/relationships so I am posting it here in hopes that you guys can help me.

**TL;DR:** I am concerned about the situation with my fuck buddy. I am in a new city, we live and work within a five minute walk of each other. We have become extremely close in a very short time (2.5 weeks), but there are several red flags (described below) about him which I feel could lead to an abusive relationship. 

I’m sorry for the length of this post. I have tried to summarize it before getting to the entire essay. I have only known him a few weeks so I summarized our relavant interactions and what I have found online about him. I feel confused because I feel strongly about him. Either I'm overreacting or I need to stop seeing him. Please help me with what to do Reddit.

**Background about me:**

I am a college student, and I have moved to a new city for the summer for an internship  about 2.5 weeks ago. I am completely new to this city, and three hours from home. Other than my fuck buddy (let's call him Troy), I have very few friends here besides my roommates (two people who I have just met). 

I am in a very open and committed relationship with my boyfriend from my school. We have been together (open the entire time) for one year. He is 24 years old and knows everything that is happening with my other sexual relationships as well and vice versa. We consider ourselves polyamorous. This is really only slightly relevant. He is still at our school about 4 hours from where I am from the summer.

**Summary about Troy and the major red flags:**

* He’s 46. He lied to me and claimed he was 31. I have not confronted him about this. I don’t really care that he’s 46, but clearly I can't really trust him.
* He is *extremely* athletic, big and strong, and honestly does not look 46.
* He was raised in Romania, and apparently saw active duty in their army
* He owns his own successful business.
* He knows and has introduced me to a lot of people and is well established here.
* He’s not okay with my open relationship.
* He mentioned that he has anxiety stemming from his last breakup, and that he has been prescribed medication (for when he needs it) but hates and avoids taking it.
* We’ve hung out almost everyday that I’ve been in this new city. I have enjoyed the time we’ve spent together. He’s never acted violent or maliciously around me.
* He knows exactly where I live and work, and also lives and works in close proximity (5 - 6 blocks) to me.
* He wants to have unprotected sex, and I don’t. He is extremely pushy about this, and once joked that he would rape me. 
* He allegedly assaulted someone in 2011 at a bar. I found a blog post about it from the victim.

**The entire (excessively long) story:**

We began talking on Grindr (gay dating/hookup app) while I was here preparing to move about a month ago. We texted back and forth until the day that I actually moved here. During this communication I established that I would only be here during the summer months and also that I have a boyfriend. He asked me at one point to guess his age. Based on the fact that he owns his own business, and his appearance I guessed 38. He told me that he was 31 (I found this was untrue last night using google). 

The day we met (the day that I moved to the new city) I was entirely charmed by him. We walked around the city and he showed me his business, and after this we went to his place. We began to kiss and cuddle, and while this was happening he poured on the sweet talk (you're beautiful, I want you to be mine, etc). While I didn't mind it, it seemed to me that there was some type of disconnect. At one point I said, you remember that I have a boyfriend correct? He responded by saying that he had put it to the back of his mind and did not want to talk about it. He also did not remember that I would not be staying in the city permanently. While I thought these things were odd, I didn't think all that much of it. We then went out to dinner, and had sex later. 

We hung out (not just for sex, but meals, movies, walks etc.) everyday and we continued to become infatuated with one another. About a week after we first met, he texts me saying that he believes strongly in monogamy, and I tell him that we should have a conversation in person about this topic. When this conversation happens over dinner a few days later we essentially agree that we were looking for different things and that it would be best to stop or slow down. He told me that he could not stand to think about sharing me and that he did not want to know anything about my relationship with my boyfriend. He also said that his last breakup two years ago was still messing with him but didn’t go into detail. It was established that we needed some space, and that he would think about the whole thing. To be honest I was pretty devastated that the conversation went poorly. We continue to communicate over the following days via text, and eventually he invites me over to meet his friend and watch a movie, during which we begin to kiss and cuddle. We didn't really ever continue our discussion, it sort of just picked up where we had left off.

We spent another great day together walking around, shopping, eating and having sex this past weekend. When we have sex, he tries to convince me to have sex without a condom. Latex apparently irritates his privates, makes him lose his hardon, etc. I have always refused to have sex without a condom, and he has whined that I don't trust him (clearly I shouldn’t), that it would be so hot, that there's no need to worry because we're both clean, etc. This past weekend I slept over and when we woke up, we started dry humping, naked, without a condom. That's fine in general, but he was clearly trying to get it in there so I stopped him (we had to go also) and he casually joked that he would rape me. It was clearly uncalled for, but I didn't really respond to it and we just got dressed and left. 

That was the last time I saw him. Last night I googled his name and found out his real age is 46, not 31. Clearly I was beyond stupid to believe that, though I did have suspicions. 

I also found a blog post from 2011 by someone who was allegedly assaulted by Troy. I'm sure it's about him as it specifically mentions his business. The entire blog is a really dramatized diary of this gay guy. They were apparently at the same bar (they were intoxicated) when Troy overheard this guy speaking badly about him. Troy apparently shoved/punched him and gave him a bloody lip (unprovoked other than the shit talking allegation) and left the bar shortly after. Later in the post it shows a conversation they have over the internet on a gay hookup site. Troy was defensive in the conversation and admitted to doing it but didn't apologize.

**Conclusion:**

I’m really concerned about how to handle this. I’m guessing everyone will advise me to go no contact, though I feel this could provoke him the most. The possibility of him trying to (and easily succeeding in) stalking or finding me scares me a lot, and I’d prefer that if it needs to it would end more smoothly on what he thinks is a good note. What do I do or say? I would not really feel comfortable involving the police unless he actually threatens me.

38b5rr,10,2015-06-02,I [19 M] am worried about how to end my relationship with my FWB [46 M],mthrowaway199,gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/38b5rr/i_19_m_am_worried_about_how_to_end_my/,"**TL;DR:** I am concerned about the situation with my fuck buddy. I am in a new city, we live and work within a five minute walk of each other. We have become extremely close in a very short time (2.5 weeks), but there are several red flags (described below) about him which I feel could lead to an abusive relationship. 

I’m sorry for the length of this post. I have tried to summarize it before getting to the entire essay. I have only known him a few weeks so I summarized our relavant interactions and what I have found online about him. I feel confused because I feel strongly about him. Either I'm overreacting or I need to stop seeing him. Please help me with what to do Reddit.

**Background about me:**

I am a college student, and I have moved to a new city for the summer for an internship  about 2.5 weeks ago. I am completely new to this city, and three hours from home. Other than my fuck buddy (let's call him Troy), I have very few friends here besides my roommates (two people who I have just met). 

I am in a very open and committed relationship with my boyfriend from my school. We have been together (open the entire time) for one year. He is 24 years old and knows everything that is happening with my other sexual relationships as well and vice versa. We consider ourselves polyamorous. This is really only slightly relevant. He is still at our school about 4 hours from where I am from the summer.

**Summary about Troy and the major red flags:**

* He’s 46. He lied to me and claimed he was 31. I have not confronted him about this. I don’t really care that he’s 46, but clearly I can't really trust him.
* He is *extremely* athletic, big and strong, and honestly does not look 46.
* He was raised in Romania, and apparently saw active duty in their army
* He owns his own successful business.
* He knows and has introduced me to a lot of people and is well established here.
* He’s not okay with my open relationship.
* He mentioned that he has anxiety stemming from his last breakup, and that he has been prescribed medication (for when he needs it) but hates and avoids taking it.
* We’ve hung out almost everyday that I’ve been in this new city. I have enjoyed the time we’ve spent together. He’s never acted violent or maliciously around me.
* He knows exactly where I live and work, and also lives and works in close proximity (5 - 6 blocks) to me.
* He wants to have unprotected sex, and I don’t. He is extremely pushy about this, and once joked that he would rape me. 
* He allegedly assaulted someone in 2011 at a bar. I found a blog post about it from the victim.

38b8or,2,2015-06-02,Ferocious Feline Fells a Friend? Fffuuuuuu...,kidsweekend,clovetree,https://www.reddit.com/r/clovetree/comments/38b8or/ferocious_feline_fells_a_friend_fffuuuuuu/,"In search of adventure, Barry, Gruul, Orange, Thrrak, and the intern Appie decide to revisit the old Dwarven Temple of Courage, which is located a quarter-day south of the Halfling fort where they had been staying. It has been several months since Gruul and Thrrak had last explored the terrible catacombs underneath the abandoned tower and were touched by its sinister power.

Appie's mother (may she rest in peace) told her that Duergar were known to lurk below the tower and Orange's description of them matches what Gruul and Thrrak remember about the creatures they fought there.

As they travel to the place they come across a deep ravine and notice that goblin-like creatures have made camp on the other side, though only two remain. The party hatches a plan that involves using Appie as bait to try and lure them across the ravine while the other adventurers ambush them at the bottom. The plan works! However, the party does not notice the Tiger lurking near the bottom of the vale and Orange is brutally attacked.

Despite the best efforts of his friends, Orange is torn apart by the Tiger and is killed. They quickly dispatch the goblin-like creatures and the Tiger too, but begin to realize the awful truth. Appie becomes hysterical and Thrrak delivers a funeral sermon. Yet as they prepare to say a final goodbye to their friend, Barry--in a truly selfless act-- calls upon the gods to cash in a boon.

Using an awesome and mysterious power granted to him by the gods for having drawn from the Deck of Many Things, he recalls the name of a powerful Oracle who is said to live on the island and compels her to cast True Resurrection on his friend, saving him from permanent death. Barry is concerned because he knows that the Oracle--an old woman named Marble Blackmyre--will remember this day, but his friend is returned to life and they soldier on to the derelict temple. 

Gruul notices tracks from several days ago that go down into the catacombs and after spending a night in preparation, they descend into them. Gruul immediately confronts a group of Duergar and intimidates them into submission. The party kills all but one of the creatures, who suddenly becomes invisible and escapes down a well trap that Gruul and Thrrak remember from their previous adventure. They follow the fleeing Duergar down the trap and into a cavern of icy water. Orange sets a nest of Dire Rats near the shore into flames before the party decides to wait for reinforcements.

Thrrak turns Orange into a gaseous cloud so that he can float up and out of the cavern, return to the Halfling fort, and retrieve their friends Osmen and Telmah. Together, they plan to journey further into the catacombs and confront the dark menace that had once cursed them many moons ago..."

Our relationship recently became long distance due to his internship and plans for getting his master's degree over there. I'm going to see him sometime next month for a few days when I have time away from my job. It seems like he and I will be in a LDR for quite a while, so I wanted seek some advice from you guys. 

What's the best way to deal with a LDR? Yesterday was the first time that the silence really hit me and we've been apart for only a month already. Not in a way that's lonely, but in a way where my mind was playing tricks with me. Just the typical insecurities and worries about how things may work out. What's the best way to prevent such things?

38bns7,2,2015-06-03,[Product Review/Suggestion] For the guys and maybe the girls I found a body trimmer that some might find useful.,notaswedishchef,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/38bns7/product_reviewsuggestion_for_the_guys_and_maybe/,"Hey guys, just 2 disclaimers

I hope I'm not breaking any rules and I hope people find this useful, that's all I aim for in this post. 
 I am not a coporate shill, I'm not getting paid, nor will I ever get paid for this. Hell I can't even get my internship to pay me (heyooooo).

Also many people swear by straight edge razors versus the mass produced razors that companies throw at men. Cool, I respect that


I'm just about finishing my internship, same with my gf. We have been seperated for months and I grabbed us a hotel and will finally see each other in 4 days, we have all these things planned and we both can't wait. So today I was at the store grabbing mini bottles to put body wash and crap in for the plane. I found [this](http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Fusion-Proglide-Groomer-Trimmer/dp/B0062IWQVU/ref=sr_1_6?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433302192&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=gillette+fusion+proglide) and for those that don't want to follow the link it is a personal body groomer with an attachment for razor blades to shave with. I picked it up to check it out as an easy way to shave the Johnson and the boys and then throw on a razor and shave. I have owned one other hair trimmer, that said I could only once bring myself to bring something big and metal close to my junk, plus I needed to buy a bunch of different size combs with it and that seemed like work going to sally's or ordering from online. This proglide styler I figured would be a nice ""cheap"" way to keep myself all trimmed without investing in a whole new product that needed special batteries or a cord. 

So how well does it work? Well it's powered by 1 AA battery, that comes with it. It's a hair trimmer that is a bit smaller and doesn't need a cord or charging. It's maybe about an inch across and a bit shorter than a hand. It's a nice fit in the hand with good grip all over and a sleek design. The product comes with 3 combs, long med and short. Long is maybe a quarter inch med being 1/8 and short being pretty much stub if not gone. It's not sharp but it does cut hair. It also comes with what is basically an extension and a razor blade to attach there. It also comes with a cool base that holds the 3 combs and extension in it. 

How it did? Actually pretty great, It cut short where it needed to, didn't nick the skin and did it's job quickly. Now for down there it did a great clean up job, around the main attraction it did it's job quick and painless, no catches no cuts nothing. For the boys, it trimmed up but I've gotten closer. I was a bit more hesitant here since there's a bit more skin and easier time fucking up. 

As for shaving? It's not the best shave I've had, it works and didn't cut me. I didn't get any ball hair in my mouth or on my face. Cleaning it was a bit finicky. You push back on the styler blades and the black part pops up and you run water under it. It wasn't clearing so I pushed the black part back farther and heard a click then put it back together and it wouldn't start. I gave it a minute and it works just fine now, be wary when cleaning it. 

All in all this was a good tool, I can keep my bathroom from overflowing with single purpose items. I spent maybe 22 bucks to consistently keep myself groomed. Hell I may give it to my girlfriend to help shave the back of my neck. This is a nice way to groom down stairs without people seeing it in the bathroom and thinking of that immediately. It's from a big company so easy to break and replace parts or the whole thing and it's well made. If you have any questions let me know, I can't talk for long term maintenance or reliability or battery life. If your interested in that pm me and I'll get back to you in the future. "

38btng,1,2015-06-03,Summer Internship -- Need Help Not Withholding Too Much,domn1995,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/38btng/summer_internship_need_help_not_withholding_too/,"I'm a 19 year-old dependent student from Idaho in the following financial situation:

I worked a TA job for my university for the last (Spring) semester and earned $2043.79 after $154.35 paid towards federal income tax and $53.00 paid towards state income tax. I claimed 0 allowances.   

This summer I will be working an full time making approximately $1,635.20 every 2 weeks before taxes for 3 months (until school starts again), when I will go down to working around 10 hours per week and make approximately $368.00 before taxes every 2 weeks.

As such, I predict that my income for 2015 will be the following:


  * $2,251.14 from my TA Job
  * +
  * $9,811.20 3 months full time 
  * +
  * $3,312 4.5 months part time 
  * --------------------------------------
  * $15,374.30 2015 Gross Income
  * -
  * $6,300.00 Standard Deduction (can i claim this as dependent?)
  * -------------------------------------
  * **$9074.34 Taxable Income**

If I have done the math correctly, and if I can claim the standard deduction as a dependent, then $9074.34 will be my taxable income for 2015.

Falling in the 10% tax bracket, this would make me owe around $907.43 in federal income tax.

I have already paid $154.35 towards federal income tax from my TA job, and around $287 from my first paycheck from my internship (not including FICA and state income tax), adding up to $441,35. I didn't claim any allowances because I was afraid of not withholding enough, but I have come to believe that may have been a mistake. 

If I don't change my allowances, I think I will end up paying around $2,000 in federal income tax this year ($287 per paycheck during the summer), considering that I will probably pay around the same as my TA job per paycheck towards feral income tax -- $21.97.

In turn, am I correct to deduce that I should adjust my allowances in my W-4 to try to reach around $900-1000 in federal income tax paid that is paid evenly between my paychecks? Something like $33 per paycheck for the next 6 months for a total of around $400?

Am I on the right track with this math, or completely crazy?

I know this may be a confusing question, because even I am confused by it all. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification, and as always, thanks for the help!

I have only completed one Java programming course and one basic 'intro to engineering' course which makes my selection of internships limited for this summer. I know it's late in the summer, and I was not even planning on finding an intern. I was originally just going to work full time at my IT position, but I received an offer from two companies.

 One of them basically entails teaching younger children how to write basic code in java and build stuff with Arduino kits. I don't know if there is any financial compensation for this one, but I'm meeting with the coordinator tomorrow for more info.

 The other one is an internship for an IT Support Specialist role. It pays 12$/hr , but since I'm not even an IT student I don't know how beneficial it will be. However, I do work for the IT department at my university as tier 1 support and this internship is essentially ""tier 2"" support. I can use this internship as a way to get promoted to part time tier 2 at my universities IT department when school starts again this fall. It will basically pay a little more, and possibly open more doors if I want to continue working for the employer or my schools IT department after graduation.

What I really want is to earn a more prestigious internship next summer once I have learned more skills. Will having an internship this summer help with that? Any suggestions as to which one I should go for?

However, I do work for the IT department at my university as tier 1 support and this internship is essentially ""tier 2"" support. I can use this internship as a way to get promoted to part time tier 2 at my universities IT department when school starts again this fall. It will basically pay a little more, and possibly open more doors if I want to continue working for the employer or my schools IT department after graduation.


What I really want is to earn a more prestigious internship next summer once I have learned more skills. Will having an internship this summer help with that? Any suggestions as to which one I should go for?"

38ckl7,4,2015-06-03,Applying for transfer this fall/low first semester GPA,fuckmeinmygoatazz,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/38ckl7/applying_for_transfer_this_falllow_first_semester/,"Alright, so here's the gist of it: 

- first semester at CC 6 classes/19 units
- fucked myself over 2.4 gpa
- 1 D I plan on retaking the class in the fall
- taking 2-3 classes this summer 
- I've had a job and two design/architecture-related internships that are also leaking into the summer
- intended to transfer into Berkeley or LA for architecture/CMU for industrial design

I know, I know. I fucking blew it. These are top tier schools and even if I had a perfect gpa this summer, it'd be difficult for the colleges to see past my dismal fucking first semester gpa. I also wouldn't be able to remedy the D in time for UC apps, so it'd look worse. I probably shouldn't apply immediately this fall, but I still will just to chance it. Now that the pity party's over, just how likely would it be to get into these schools in those majors. How good do my ecs have to be to carry me over, or is it impossible? I understand the reality of the situation, and I'd get it if I didn't get in, but a tiny light at the end of the tunnel would be super fucking duper."

I'm a 3rd year environmental engineer from Canada.  This summer I have gotten an internship working for the 'Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation' partnered with the Vishwakarma Institute of Technology in Pune, India.  I am living here for three months while helping design this deployable toilet system and I'm looking for some help/ideas that we could use to help complete this project!

The project:

We are trying to design a toilet system that is completely off the grid, requires no external energy, and is not harmful to the environment in any way.  Money is also an issue, we are looking to be able to mass produce these toilet systems for around $800 US.  The most difficult aspect of the design is that toilet system must be able to last for ~5 years without any maintenance.  What we have so far/what we are looking into:

-A septic tank system that runs under thermophilic conditions (2 compartment septic tank that use 'I' or 'T' baffles)

-This will be connected to a pump that will pump water through 2 self backwashing charcoal filters (After testing, this still leaves some suspended solids in the liquid, not sure what else to use? membranes clog too easily and can be quite expensive)

-For disinfection we are currently looking at 3 options; Ozone, Solar Disinfection, and Biosand Filtration.

-Ozone is looking the most promising and we are set to start testing it in the next few weeks. 

-Solar Disinfection is cheap but can't work at night/monsoon season/with bird faeces blocking the sun

-Biosand filters seem very cool/interesting but issues with backwashing (dump and swirl) and time (allowing the biofilm to generate)

-We plan on using a solar panel to run the pump, possibly the ozone generator, as well as to help heat the septic tank to thermophilic conditions

-The biogas created within septic tank/digester will also be used to help heat the tank 

Any help or ideas will be greatly appreciated by our design team and more importantly by the people this system is going to help.  Thank you!"
38dh7s,7,2015-06-03,Contemplating backing out of my match... would I regret it forever?!,omgcantdecide,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/38dh7s/contemplating_backing_out_of_my_match_would_i/,"Hi all. I'm 25. I went to a very expensive college for dietetics (read: student loans)  I got rejected from matches 2 years in a row (due to not having any clinical experience at the time), and I FINALLY got a match this year after going to conferences, getting work experience in a hospital as a dietetic tech, taking graduate courses, doing self-guided research and learning about dietetics, etc.  It was my last choice match and I don't really like the program, but hell. It's a match.

However... I'm having serious cold feet. Tuition ($8k) is due June 15th. I'd have to quit my job, leave my amazing apartment and move back in with my parents for a year, and take out another loan to cover the tuition.

Reasons I'm considering doing the internship:

* I've literally spent the last 7 years of my life working towards getting a match before having a major change of heart in the last 3 months or so; maybe this is just temporary insanity and cold feet?? It seems crazy and heartbreaking to give up now after so much of my life working towards it

* I've always wanted to be a dietitian and I'm enthusiastic about helping people eat beetter

* Family would probably throw me in an asylum if I rejected it haha

* will get me the RD which will allow me to practice legally and open up job opportunities

* if I decline it now, I figure I'll be basically throwing away my opportunity for an RD forever, since my DPD is going to expire and I'll be pretty much blacklisted for declining a match anyway, and I'm just not sure I'm ready to commit to never being an RD

* There is some valuable knowledge and experience to be gained from the internship

Pros for not going through with the match: 

* I'm still passionate about nutrition but in the last 3 years of research, I've personally decided that the evidence points toward a mostly-plant-based, unprocessed diet.  I think a lot of the dietary guidelines are total crap (3-4 servings of dairy a day?? Way too much meat and grains and crappy margarines, not based on science but based on $$$$ from corporations)

* I have some serious issues with the AND (see above) and I'm not sure I want to give them my money 

* I truly feel well-informed on dietetics and patient counseling from my BS in Dietetics and my 3 years working at the hospital, I've read literally thousands and thousands of books and research articles, I don't think an internship would teach me much more that I need to know, since I don't intend to work in a clinical setting again

* I would have ethical issues having to advise patients to eat more of foods that I truly believe are harmful. I've started doing the summer homework and for so many of the questions, I know the answer I would give is completely different than the answer they expect me to give. 

* I've actually gotten the travel bug, have issues with the USA, and have family in other countries. Lately I have been seriously considering moving out of the country entirely, which would make an RD pretty pointless

* I have never planned on having a 9-to-5 work-for-an-employer job; I've always intended to be an entrepreneur and/or find my own clients to work with, so the lack of jobs from not having an RD isn't a huge issue

* There seem to be thousands of people making plenty of money advising people on shit like the paleo diet, various shakes and gimmicks, ""health coaches,"" ""wellness coaches,"" etc.  If these uneducated snake oil salesmen can do it, then why shouldn't I be able to do it? I truly consider myself very well-informed on the topic of nutrition and always try to use critical thinking and the best evidence-based theories and I'm open-minded to changing my opinions when new research comes out. Would having an RD *really* make me that much more appealing to the average uninformed person of the public who wants to lose weight or get healthier? In an ideal world, I should've spent the last year trying to get clients and see if its a viable source of income, but I didn't and I can't change that now.  I've read all the laws about who is allowed to give what advice legally, and it seems that I would be in the clear as long as I don't label myself a dietitian or give medical advice. I've also worked as a chef in the past and I'm a certified personal trainer, so I could see myself in the niche market of a health coach type thing, giving exercise advice, cooking advice, and general nutrition advice. I could buy liability insurance.

* I'm worried that 10-15 years down the line, once the RD requires an MS, I'll be looked at less competitively for jobs anyway even if I do have an RD

* This is slightly off topic, but I make decent side income with online blogging and I would love to get into rental real estate as an alternate form of income in the future, so I don't rely on nutrition as a means of supporting myself, and I would like to eventually get married to somebody who has a job and be a stay-at-home-mom kids ... but I also know I can't rely on that as a form of income, who knows if/when it could happen. But it seems pointless to get an RD if I could theoretically be not working in 5-10 years... maybe.. But maybe I'm overly optimistic.  Who knows, I could never have kids, and maybe in a decade I'm really going to want a solid RD career

* skipping the internship would save me a lot of money, allow me to keep my apartment, and save me from having to move back in with my parents which would be miserable

Ugh. Anybody have some advice? 

Am I making a logical decision here, and it's perfectly possible to get by without an RD? 

Or am I batshit insane for even considering declining a match and I'd regret it forever? 

So many things are up in the air and undecided... I could see my life going like 100 different ways, some of which would need an RD and some of which wouldn't... I need a crystal ball! Sigh.

Thanks in advance! I know this is my decision to make in the end, but all responses and advice, no matter how critical, would be appreciated!"

I have been learning java as an intern at a software firm for a bit less than two weeks now. The guy teaching me is pretty busy, but told me to write a simple command line calculator yesterday. This is what I came up with:

Now he has asked me to improve it so it will accept more than 2 entries at once (for example: 2+4*1/56) and I am at a complete loss for some reason :( A hint of his was ""use arrays"" and he mentioned trees, but said that that was more oop focussed and I should concentrate on the programm itself for now.

My question is less ""How do I do this"", although input is appreciated. The real question is ""if I fail at this, is it likely that I am not good at coding, or is this more of a knowledge problem?"" I'm getting pretty discouraged, especially when I compare this to how easy javascript was to use (which I was dabbling in before this dev offered to teach me java).

Thanks in advance for any responses :)"

38e2g1,21,2015-06-03,Starting to feel that a career in programming isn't for me,iamcathyy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38e2g1/starting_to_feel_that_a_career_in_programming/,"I'm a final year computer science student and I'm done with all my modules, except that I still need to complete an internship before I can graduate. Currently I've been interning at a mobile apps company for the last 2.5 weeks, but I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a programmer.

I mean, I'm fucking lost. Maybe it's due to the training, or maybe I'm just terrible at programming, or maybe it's both. For my training, my supervisor just linked me a bunch of websites with tutorials for Android development and gave me a few simple app challenges to program. I'm just so fucking lost. 

Every day I just read up a bunch of tutorials that make no fucking sense to me, try to mash the example codes together with my codes and somehow figure some way to make the damn thing work. I get it done eventually, except it takes me twice the time and I still can't quite seem to grasp how the system architecture works. It hurts my head trying to figure things out that my brain usually shuts off from stress an hour or two after lunch. Yeah okay I can tweak someone's code to make it do what I want, but if you left me alone I'd have no fucking idea what to do.

And I guess I'm feeling a little bit demoralized because I always thought mobile phone programming is ""easier"" since the framework is already provided and you don't need to code things from scratch, but I'm struggling so hard with it now. I have classmates who can code amazing apps and they were self-taught. But I have no bloody passion to go study all of this on my own.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Apart from that, I just have so many people giving me a completely shocked expression when I tell them I'm a programmer. I'm a girl and everyone always asks me why would I want to do something like this. People (including colleagues) often tell me that I'm gorgeous, speak really well and have a really nice voice, and they even go so far as to say that it's a waste to keep me copped up behind a computer screen.

Sure, I know it doesn't matter what people think as long as you enjoy what you're doing right? Well, I'm not sure I really enjoy it either. Apart from whatever I listed above, I was also quite a different person when I entered my computer science course. Shy, nerdy, ugly; didn't talk or socialize around much; always alone, but I'm completely the opposite of that now. When I look around my department, it's filled with socially awkward foreigners from Vietnam, Myanmmar, India and China. And these just aren't the kind of people I look forward to being around every day at work. I tend to click better with girls and so far I've mostly been hanging around with people from the other departments rather than my own.

I'm really lost with what I want to do as a career. What other jobs besides programming can I do with a computer science degree?"
38e4ue,74,2015-06-03,We Need Model Legislation,KahnsSermon,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/38e4ue/we_need_model_legislation/,"Vaping is going to be regulated at the State, Local, and Federal levels. That battle was over before it started. 

Right now it seems most groups are reacting, trying to rally support to defeat or carve out exemption in proposed legislation. This has a lot of strategic disadvantages. Often legislation moves fast so you have to react quickly, defensively. Legislatures are lazy and don't like to change things or rewrite legislation so it usually takes a good amount of outside pressure to get them to move. Most importantly it puts us in the position of opposing ""tobacco"" regulations, which makes it easy to portray us negatively in the media. It's generally a weaker position to argue from. 

We need to *propose* regulation. Model legislation is used by most industry and public interest groups, and quite a bit of law in general comes from some proposed model. (especially from industry, Tobacco, Coal, Labor, Ag, Telecoms, and lots of other big industries basically write a lot of their own regulations) An industry group or private body crafts legislation and regulatory guidelines that they support then tries to get a Legislator to sponsor that bill. If needed then rally public support to see the bill through. 

Once the Model is written, anyone can take the bill, modify for local considerations if needed and try to get a legislator to sponsor it. This is a big advantage if you are dealing with local / county / state regulations, make it easy for anyone to take up the fight. 

Lots of advantages to this. Legislators are lazy, writing the bill for them saves them / their office a lot of time and effort (not a lot of legislators actually write anything themselves, the interns / backoffice / policy institute people do that) just give them a fully written bill that makes them look good, or has support and/or money behind it, make it easy for them. It's normal, pol's are used to working with industry. It puts the other camp on defence. You call the proposed bill something catchy like ""The Keeping Children Safe Act"" or just vaguely Orwellian like ""The Tobacco Products Control Act"", what kind of monster opposes The Keeping Children Safe Act? 

Of course any bill would have to be sellable. Anything that would pass any legislature would have to seem like it's cracking down on the vaping industry. No sales to under 18's, no marketing to children, no vaping in restaurants, etc. Your local politician has to be able to stand up at a town hall meeting and claim victory. But the bill you push has all the exemptions you would want already carved out; sampling in stores, vaping only lounges, flavours are ok, stuff like that.  It's easy then to portray us as reasonable / responsible. ""hey, we are doing our best to work with the legislature to keep the kids safe"" 

We are not going to dodge regulation, everything's regulated. This is a widely used strategy for staying on top of it that seems to be missing from the fight to keep vaping (reasonably) safe (please correct me if I'm wrong). 

So that's my pitch. 

P.S. If anyone is going to put out youtube PR videos, it needs to feature relatable folk. Moms and Dads, middle age professional ladies, smiling grandparents, that sort of shit. The fear machine is in motion against us, this is largely a media battle.

38e6pj,7,2015-06-03,Parsing a PDB file while in Apache Spark.,[deleted],bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/38e6pj/parsing_a_pdb_file_while_in_apache_spark/,"I recently started an internship where I was put to the task to learn how to use Apache Spark, my mentors don't know how to use it yet. I'm also still new to bioinformatics and quite overwhelmed. 


I'm a little confused as to how it really operates and how would I go about parsing a PDB file there. Since there is so much information in a PDB file and it's not just a list of numbers, I don't know how to start. I have [ProDy](http://prody.csb.pitt.edu/) installed and that has functions to parse PDB files. Is there a way to bring those methods into the Spark Python shell?


Thanks.


Edit: 
So far I followed this [tutorial](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html) and created an RDD of the pdb. So I know how to count the number of items in the file and view the first line, but I'm stuck otherwise... Would looking at the ""Self-Contained Applications"" portion of the tutorial be more helpful?
The next step they wanted me to do was to take each chain in the protein and store them all of different nodes in the cluster.... Which I could also use a guilding hand in pointing me in the correct direction."

I'm not even sure where to start but here I go. I've been dating this girl for a little over 2 months. She is awesome, great, and just a lovely individual. We are really compatible together and we have been pretty open about everything good and bad.

Before I met her she was seeing this other guy who is pretty ""famous"" in our industry. They hooked up for awhile and had unprotected sex all before we met. I knew all of these things already and as long as she was over him I was ok with everything.

Right now she is overseas working on an internship and she has been having really bad cramps every night. I suggested that she should go to the doctors over there and get checked out which she did. After a ultrasound and a urine test (administered by the doctor) she was informed that she was pregnant and based on the timeline of how far along the baby is - it's not mine.

She has said she doesn't want anything to do with her ex but at the same time she probably can't go through with an abortion. She's struggling with that decision right now and hasn't made a clear choice one way or the other. She said she needed some time to think and some time alone right now.

At the same one once she talked to her ex on the phone, she informed me that she is going to come back home from the internship (presumably to see him?). Being internationally and 14 hour time time difference from each other has made communication a little difficult during these times.

I really like this girl but at the same time:

- I totally understand we are still in our honeymoon phase. I haven't been seeing her that long and I have no idea if I am ready for a long term commitment like this.

- I can't even stand the thought of having her ex in my life which would definitely be the case if she kept the baby.

All this has happened a little fast and I'm having a hard time to think through everything. It's not really my place to tell her what to do and I'm not sure if I would want to stay or leave. Would really appreciate any advice especially from someone who has had a similar situation.

This may be a little long. But it's been on my mind for a while and I just need some where to vent:-/

Several months ago my husband got a job in a new state so we had to relocate, which meant I had to find a new job. 

Over the course of several weeks I put in several applications. One business called me in for an interview, so I drove two hours from where I lived to meet with them. That interview went very well and I wouldn't change a thing. Then they tell me I made it to the second round of interviews and they wanted me to meet with an occupational therapist to 'see if I would fit into their workplace.' Having never met with an occupational therapist before, I thought why not. And anyways I really liked the job. The people were nice and it would have been a nice change of pace for me. 

They took me out to dinner before I had to go to the therapist. During that meeting, I got a voicemail for another job interview with a different company. One of the managers there recognized the number and pulled me aside later that meeting to tell me I had the job, they've turned away other people, and that they were talking about paying me X amount of dollars bc of my qualifications, and not to worry about ur meeting with the therapist bc it was just a formality. Before I left to meet the therapist, another manager told me that out of all the candidates who applied, i stood out bc of my detailed cover letter, experience, etc... And he said he would really like it if I came to work for them and not to worry about the meeting with the therapist. He also told me they would contact me early that next week to give me a final answer. 

When I got to the therapist, that is where everything went down hill. I had to take like 20 different tests that asked me questions I didn't know the answers too and not to mention they were timed. (I should note that I'm diagnosed ADHD and have severe anxiety about timed tests. I was given extended time in high school and college whenever it came to exams). The interview was for a reporter position, so the fact I had to answer questions about long division really threw me. Math has never been my best subject and I can't remember the last time I have had to use long division. Other tests were a mix of something to the effect of 'an apple is to a banana, like a car is to _______' and 'if such and such problem arises in the work place, how would you handle it?'

I was honest on one part of the test where It asked me to fill in the blank for 'never ask me ____________.' I put 'why I over analyze', which in retrospect may have not been the best answer, but at time I thought it might have been OK bc I was honest about how I tend to over analyze in my job interview and that it was something I'm continually working on. 

I was already nervous bc I was applying for jobs in a state I had never lived in before. I was comfortable at my last job and was very confident, as I had been there for several years. So leaving that was very hard for me. So I was trying really hard to say and do the right things at this new interview and the meeting with the therapist. 

Well the therapist was very rude and basically wanted me to tell him my life story, which I was not going to do. I didn't think it was appropriate to tell him that I get anxious in certain situations, that I was nervous in that meeting so i got awkward and didn't know what to say, that I had just wrecked my car bc it slid in the snow, that I just got diagnosed with MRSA and was taking antibiotics and felt like complete and utter shit. For one it didn't feel appropriate. And two, how am I supposed to remember exactly what my intern editor said about me in summer 2008 or what exactly was on my performance review three years ago?

I got more and more nervous everytime he shook his head and wrote something down in his notes. I felt awkward the entire time and I felt like he could sense it too. I got flustered, stumbled over my answers and was all in all, just not doing well. 

I left the meeting feeling really uneasy. I knew it didn't go well. But I thought everything was OK bc of what one of the managers told me-- that I basically had the job.

Well an entire week passed and I heard nothing from them, even though they said they would call me early that week. So I built up the courage to call them, which took a lot for me. One of the lower managers was the first one to pick up his phone and said 'well it looks like your meeting with (therapist) didn't go well. What happened?!'... I didn't know what to say, so i said 'I was nervous.'

Not 10 minutes later the higher up manager calls me and gives me a spill of '(therapist) had some
Concerns about you and after some internal discussion, we've decided to go with someone else... If you were under the impression that you had the job, than i sincerely apologize.... We're continuing to adjust things here; so i would encourage you to apply again in the future. ... Hey we even live in the same area, so might see you around town.'

It was hard to hold back the tears as I heard that. So the minute he stopped I awkwardly said 'thank u. I appreciate it.' And that was that. 

What really stung most of all, was not that I didn't get the job (which now im thankful that I didnt)... It's that i was lead to believe i had it. Don't tell me I have It and you've turned away other people bc u all decided to choose me.!it upset me That I got a call on a Wednesday asking me to meet with the therapist on Friday, even though at that time I still lived two hours away. So I had to drop what I was doing, ask off work even though i had already put in my notice, and drive up there... If me getting the job was so contingent on this therapist's recommendation, I wish they would have told me....I feel like I wasted my time.

Also it made me wonder, what the hell is wrong with me? I had a lot of experience, clips and im a good employee. So what about myself did random guy think was so concerning. I just got flustered in the meeting. 

It's been several months since this has occurred and it feels like it's constantly in the back of my head. Everytime I hear the word 'concern' that phone call seems to replay in my head. It has affected my happiness and my over all confidence. 

I just wish I could be like those people who can just compartmentalize and move on.

We wrote a song we were all really proud of and are getting ready to record in July. The guitarist sent it to a buddy who interns at a studio in Cali. 

The guitarist sends it over to his buddy. The guitarist's buddy added some effects and different sounds but used our riffs note for note. It turned out really well and even though it was just a scratch track everyone loved it. 

Today we are contacted by his friend. His friend was excited because he did a damn good job making it sound full and different, so he showed his boss - after all, he is looking to get a job there hopefully. 

This *fucking guy* **stole** our track. Literally note for note, only taking out a prechorus and chorus. It's 100% our song, we wrote it. I'm fucking *livid* right now.

I need to know what we can do. He gave it to another band that he is producing for. We don't want to fuck over the guitarist's friend and end up getting him fired, but *fuck.* We put so many hours into that song and even had guest vocals from our favorite band in it. We already paid the guy for guest vocals. Everything was ready, we were off to record in July.

We asked the friend about copyright shit, and apparently according to him, there's no ""automatic copyright"" even though we have proof the guitarist wrote the song via email. He said that the studio had a copyright license and now it's their song essentially and we could be in a legal issue if we continue to go and record **our fucking song.**

What can we do here? We're fucking lost, guys. I feel so defeated. It wasn't the friend's fault, and I know he feels bad... but **fuck.** HELP."
38eiuy,182,2015-06-03,Me [25F] accidentally read some text messages between my boyfriend [26M] and a girl he likes.,sitting_on_a_dream,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38eiuy/me_25f_accidentally_read_some_text_messages/,"(Throwaway account since I know he reads reddit)

First of all, I'm going to preface this with the fact that I KNOW reading another person's text messages is a huge invasion of privacy. We already talked about that and he's forgiven me. I feel terrible about it. 

Now for the issue. I have been dating my boyfriend ""Brian"" for over 2 years now and it's been great. We've gone through our own share of hardships but have always come out stronger, or with a new understanding of each other. Before we started dating, Brian had a massive crush on one of his inner-circle friends named ""Eva"" for well over a year. She's never reciprocated, but I think she's the type of person who likes to flirt back for attention. 

Approximately 2 weeks ago, I was sitting in bed with Brian's laptop getting ready to skype my family in Asia. I knew from the time when we had done long distance, his microphone sometimes doesn't work - so I went to click on ""Echo sound test"" just to make sure I had everything ready to go before I start the call. By accident, I clicked on ""Eva"" instead of ""Echo"" and instead of immediately clicking away like I intended, my eyes got caught on some messages between them. It listed things like...


B: ""Happy Valentines Day! I was thinking about you a little last night ;) Hope you're having a good day. I Love you!""

E: ""I love you too!""


or


E: ""Hey crotch face!""

B: ""I bet you wish my face was in your crotch""

E: "" gross""

B: "" Don't say that, I'm actually very good at oral ;)""

E:""Gross lol""

B:""I really miss you, can I hang out with you when I get back?""

E:""You will be busy hanging with your woman""

B:""No way, you're my number one priority""

etc....


Now, normally these messages wouldn't bother me. I mean, people get flirty with their opposite-gender friends quite often, right? I mean, I've been known to be flirty myself - albeit without any sexual innuendos or saying any 'I love you's.
But the thing was - during the time he sent these we were abroad in Sweden - just the two of us living on our own. I had accepted a 10 month internship and worked 50 hours a week. He came with me so we could be together, but he couldn't find a job and would just hang around our apartment all day. He also got sick, depressed and really bitter, mostly because he was home-stuck in a foreign country for 2 months. I can't blame him for wanting to go home, but it got to the point that the only time I ever saw him happy was when he was making plans back in Canada where we're from. 

After those 2 months he decided to go back home and we would do long distance for the remainder of my internship. When he got back to Canada, the first few weeks he barely talked to me - which really hurt because I had spent so much of the first two months trying to make him happy and showing how grateful I was for him trying to support me. I would message him ""Hey, I'm really lonely, do you want to skype?"" and I wouldn't hear back for days. On facebook, I saw that him and Eva were hanging out, going to bars, museums etc. There was a big evening campfire event that happened over the summer and some of my own friends messaged me saying ""Did you and Brian break up? He's being really flirty with this other girl"".

Now that we're both back in the same country and have brought our relationship back up to speed after doing long distance - I can't help but get that nagging feeling that he's not over Eva. We talked about it, but all I ever seem to get out of him is ""I'm sorry, I don't like her I promise!"", but by the way he talks about her, or prioritizes her over his other friends I feel its a different story. 

One of my best friends is actually dating Eva's sister, and has told me that sometimes even Eva finds it uncomfortable how Brian only wants to hangout with her when I'm busy and how she sometimes feels like a ""surrogate girlfriend"".

Now, I've been cheated on in the past, so I know I have some insecurities that might make me blow things out of proportion, but I can't help but think he's lying to me when he says he's not into her anymore. We've been dating for 2 years, but then that would mean he's liked her for 3 years. Do you think someone can just get over a major crush on a close friend without ever wanting to know what it would have been like? I mean, she's absolutely gorgeous and funny. I just feel so inadequate.

I'm sorry internet strangers for the long novel. I know my dilemna is almost nothing compared to some of the stories I read on r/relationships, but even just some validation that I am/am not going crazy would be helpful. Am I blowing things out of proportion?

  
**tl;dr**: I accidentally ready some of my boyfriends messages to a girl he used to like. I don't think he's over her after all these years and it's eating me up inside.

38ejsf,1,2015-06-03,Help?,fiberthrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/38ejsf/help/,"Hi guys,


I just finished my sophomore year in high school, and, my grades were terrible. I want to pursue a degree in Computer Science/Computer Engineering.


I got a C+ recently in AP Calculus AB, and I don't know what to do now, I was literally crying when I got my report card and now I am all depressed. I will be going to BC next year, so hopefully those grades can compensate.


For now, my GPA is:

 
Weighted: 3.79


Unweighted: 3.35


Total: 3.8


However, by end of junior year I should be able to increase my grade dramatically up to a 4.04 because of AP classes.


Is there any other way for me to increase my chances to get into college going into junior year and senior year. For example, is there anything I should do in my college application that can help to boost my chances?



Here are some stats about me that could go into consideration:


-California Resident


-Asian Male


-Total 11 AP's projected: AP Calculus AB+BC, AP Computer Science, AP Statistics, AP World History, APUSH, AP Psychology, AP English Language, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Physics C: E&amp;M


-Finished AP Calculus AB and APUSH


-AP's will be either 4's or 5's, but mainly 5's


-2350 SAT


-I will be applying for Computer Science/Computer Engineering


-Currently won first hackathon I ever went to, will be going to more hackathons sooner (win maybe 3-4 more?)


-Leader of Website of Robotics club (future president?)


-Outreach in the Appalachian Mountains to help restore the environment as part of community service, as well as helping locally for the poor


-Over 150 hours in children's museum


-In school's Math Team and Programming Club Leader


-Knowledgeable in more than 10 programming languages


-Piano for 7 years


-First one in family to go to American college


-Planning to do an internship somewhere?









Also, with these statistics, which universities will I have a chance to get admission into?

If I get into one of these schools I will be more than elated- I love almost any of these schools equally:


-USC


-UCLA


-UC Davis


-UCSD


-UT Austin


-Georgia Tech


-Carnegie Mellon


-UC Berkeley


Saftey/ I will be not happy to get into any of these:


-UIUC


-UC Irvine


-San Jose State University


-Cal Poly SLO




I am literally feeling so depressed because of my GPA right now, because I badly wanted to go to UC Berkeley. Is there anything I can do at this stage that can help me stand a chance against other applicants? I still have all of junior year and senior year to make a ""difference"" to help me stand out, I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the billion questions and the wall of text, but I appreciate any kind of input. Thanks."

38euvj,15,2015-06-03,Advice on building a brief bank?,stalkingturkey,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/38euvj/advice_on_building_a_brief_bank/,"Hi, I'm interning this summer at the states' attorney's office, and we've recently been asked to develop a brief bank for a summer-long project.

The office's appellate briefs are all in docx or pdf format on a shared drive in the office domain. The assigning attorney would ideally like some sort of searchable database where you could locate briefs primarily by issue (Waiver, Ineffective assistance of counsel, etc), and then by sub-issue (Waiver - Post conviction), and then of course by Attorney's name, docket number and all of the obvious issues.

I have a good bit of IT experience from before law school, but databases are not my strong suit. For now, I've established a google spreadsheet with all of the file names, and have established categories for attorney name, case name, issue 1, issue 2, issue 3, etc., and now me and the other interns are going through every single brief and tagging different issues that we see. But I don't know where to go from there, or if that is even the right approach. I'm thinking of asking a couple of my programmer friends if they could teach me the basics of SQL Server or something similar, but this is such a huge project that I don't think anyone outside the intern pool would be willing to do it. 

Has anyone had any experience building an in-house brief bank? If so, how did you do it/What software did you use/how did make the work more efficient? Thanks!"

I'm quite upset. I was scheduled to start working at a well funded start up next week and I got a call today saying that ""our (they) hiring needs changed and we can't take on any interns."" At the moment I'm screwed for the summer; it especially sucks since I turned down an internship at a major tech firm for this company. 

Does anyone know of any companies still looking for interns? It's really late in the game I can't imagine any are companies still hiring for the summer. I can show my resume to anyone who may want an intern.

I'm not supposed to be here -- as in on Reddit -- right now. I'm not supposed to have another part of my story to tell. 

About a month and a half ago, things started getting a little weird for me. I started seeing friends in places I knew they couldn't be and started hearing noises I knew I shouldn't be hearing and my dogs started barking at things that wouldn't normally have been barked at. This was all, I assumed, due to the fact that a cop that had become obsessed with my mom when was younger had cursed my family with something that could only exist in a world where hell is real. We dealt with these problems for a little while, until a week ago, when everything finally resided. I'll post the links to my first few parts up above so you can check that out to fully understand what I'm saying. And then, just a few days ago, I decided to post my story on to here. 

I know it sounds ridiculous, I really do. To sit here and try and tell you that my family and I were being tormented by a demon in a top hat sounds ludicrous and to tell you that our solution to get rid of it was to go to a church and have ourselves prayed over sounds even worse. I was surprised when I got comments of disappointment on my last update, with people saying things along the line of:

- I hate when the story ends with the family being prayed over. It's so cliched and overdone. 
 
and:

- Great story, but disappointing ending! Just not super believable. 

I was even more surprised -- offended, even -- when I got comments of people making fun of my story and what happened to my family and I. 

I'm sorry that my ending was too cliched for you. I'm sorry that you love hearing stories of demons taking over and ruining peoples lives, but hate it when they end on a happy note. Realistically, people, if there is a hell, then there is also a heaven. 

Despite the comments, I was just relieved to have gotten my story out there and off my chest. I was proud of myself for not fictionalizing anything. I was proud for not acting like I was writing this story on my phone because I was in a rush or claiming anything had happened to me when it didn't. So I decided to go out and get off of here for a while. Go enjoy my summer for a bit -- get some sun, go to the beach, get pumped for next semester and talk to my best friend about the internship he was doing this summer...the one that I'll be joining him on next year. Unfortunately for me, I didn't even last one day. 

For yesterday morning, it happened again. 

I woke up pretty early for a summer morning. I had no work that day or anything, but a daily call from my best friend scheduled at some time before nine had me up. I stayed in bed when we talked and kept my curtains drawn. I could hear my dad and sister downstairs, the television blaring. He would stay with her until her nanny got there at around ten, when he would leave for work. My mom had already left and I figured my brother was still asleep in his room. When the call was over I got up and opened my blinds and turned my fan down to a lower setting. I waved downstairs to my dad who was getting ready to leave -- the nanny had just gotten here, as made clear by Abby and Lucy's barking -- and then locked myself in the bathroom for a shower. Throwing my boxers into the hamper, I turned the water on and waited for it to get warm. 

It didn't. Sticking my hand under the shower head, I was surprised by how cold the water actually was. It was too early for the hot water heater to have been turned off so I tried turning the water off and on again. This didn't really help too much, so I decided to just make my shower quick. Taking no more than five minutes, I dried myself off with a towel and got dressed. When I got downstairs to eat breakfast, I was greeted by a note on the table. Written in my sister's nanny's handwriting it said something along the lines of:

*Taken Becca for a walk. Didn't bring a key. If you leave please keep front door unlocked. Thank you!*

I proceeded to make myself breakfast and head back upstairs, logging in to my computer. I went around online for a bit until I got a text from my neighbor, the one I mentioned very, very briefly at the beginning of my first post, where I brought up the fact that I work at Chipotle with my neighbor and my best friend. My neighbor is the one that got me the job in the first place. I guess she was just heading out for work when she sent me the following text:

Kiyah: Hey, just making sure nobody's kidnapping Becca. Saw her holding hands with a fat lady down the street haha

I responded immediately, laughing. 

Me: No, she's all good. It's just her nanny or whatever to help watch her over the summer when my parents are working! Speaking of which, is that where you're going now?!

She took a little while to respond. Becca and her nanny where still not back from their walk. 

Kiyah: ""Yeah, I just got here lol I'm in the parking lot now. And oh that's cool, but why did they hire two? Has Becca gotten that out of control?! Hahaha

I made a face. 

Me: Two? As in two nannys? 

Kiyah: I really need to get going! But yeah? Does she not actually have two? Did I actually just witness her kidnapping? lol

Me: No, seriously...she just has the one! The fatter lady, right?! I hope that's the only person she was holding hands with...

The last series of texts she sent me made the hair on my arms stand up.

Kiyah: I mean she wasn't holding hands with the guy, he was just kind of walking behind them

Kiyah: I guess maybe he wasn't with them? He was walking kind of close though 

Kiyah: He was also dressed kind of weirdly. Not like the fat lady. He was wearing all black and had this weird ass hat on

Kiyah: A top hat, I think

Kiyah: But anyways I really have to go so see you later! 

I waited after that downstairs for Becca and her nanny to return. And when they did, it was just them. No man following behind them or anything. I quietly asked the nanny how the walk went and she said that it was fine. She also commented on how chatty Becca was being today, remarking that her speech therapy must be going well. 

I asked what she meant by that and the nanny responded with:

""Oh, I don't know. Just chattier. Happier. She kept turning around and waving. I thought maybe she was just interacting with the neighbors around us, but I don't know. I think she might have an imaginary friend! She kept calling his name and telling him to hurry up, it was--""

I cut her off. 

""His name?"" I asked. 

The nanny frowned, surprised that nobody else in my family had heard her mention this before. *She talks with him all the time when I'm here,* she told me. She then told me his name. I could swear that when she said it the room got a little colder. 

And then that's it. Nothing else weird happened that day or last night. This morning was fine and this afternoon is going well. But I don't know what's going on. I thought that maybe I had made a mistake by telling my story on here and that by paying him attention, he would come back. I think I've just learned, though, that he never left. 

I don't want to say his name. Not unless, of course, you think any of you can help. I googled it and got nothing...nothing related to a man in a top hat, at least. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my parents...I'm probably just still anxious, right? Kids have imaginary friends...and if her nanny said that she's had him before then it's probably harmless. I just can't shake what Kiyah sent me. I tried calling her last night to ask her again about it but she didn't answer. I sent her a text this morning too and she still hasn't read it. 

I can hear my little sister giggling downstairs now and I'm scared. Any help would be appreciated.

I was in a very serious relationship from 21-23 (I'm 24, looking to date at 26) and want to try dating a guy when I finish school.

I'm getting an MS in a tech field and want to pick up hobbies like 3D modeling/editing, acrobatics, and read 2 books a month, not including the coding you do on your own time outside of school and work. I'm also going to try to work at an internship during the day as my classes are in the evening. I additionally want to volunteer with an organization benefiting children ~5 hours a week, but actually working with kids not more tech. I am really strict with scheduling so I'm not concerned this won't all get done.

I have a small group of friends I see 2-3 times a week I code or make art with. I feel like between school, my friends, and picking these things up that a relationship would suck time away from my hobbies.

I don't plan on having sex during this time because the only sex I've enjoyed has been in a relationship.

Even when I date the guy, I'm going to continue the hobbies, so I would need the guy to either give me space or spend time with me at home while I work on my computer. Though really I would only date someone with long term hobbies like me, so he might be at home anyway. I would also still be out a few times a week exercising and volunteering so the guy wouldn't see me every day either.

Will a guy think it's weird if I tell him I had no desire to have sex or date for two years? I want a long term relationship that would ideally culminate in a marriage (though not until at least my late twenties) and probably children. Is this break from dating a red flag for something undesirable?

Let me know your thoughts,

Thanks"

I usually don't post on Reddit often, but I wanted more opinions on this matter other than from friends and family. So I will be an upcoming freshman in the fall with computer science as my major, and have been debating for a while if it was worth transferring to GA Tech or staying the 4 years at UGA. (Sadly, I did get rejected from Tech with decent scores)

A little background of myself. I'm an in state student from Duluth, GA. I LOVE the UGA campus, food and atmosphere at Athens, but I also don't mind living in the big city of ATL (although I would hate Tech food lol). I  understand that Tech's CS program is a lot tougher and I would have to give up some of my social life, but I would end up learning more. I've already read many posts related to this matter on Reddit and College Confidential, and have heard from multiple friends and alumni that GA Tech does have the better CS program overall (#9 vs #90 on US Weekly). However, I also have friends who have graduated from UGA with a BS in Comp Sci and have decent jobs at Microsoft and small companies in ATL. 

Ultimately, is it worth transferring to Tech? I can have all the credits necessary for transfer after one year. I just wanted some answers/opinions to these questions:

(1)My biggest concern is how many job placement/internship opportunities Tech has over UGA. If I stayed at UGA, would I be able to find decent amount of summer internships, and after graduating, a good chance at a job in a somewhat big name company?

(2) Is the average starting salary for comp sci majors considerably bigger at Tech than UGA? 

(3) And, for those who graduated from UGA in Comp Sci, where are you working now and have you considered transferring to Tech at any point?

Any help is appreciated! :D"

We thought we could find a job and a little apartment then move on to our future careers, but no. We were desperate for work, and took what was offered us. It's retail.

He wanted to be a teacher but now he says he doesn't know.  I plan on returning to college once I am considered a state resident in a year (that's the wait time to be considered resident). There, I plan on taking Computer Science.

I want to be in software. I am reading books on Python, Java and Jquery, and C. But now I fear this won't work.

38fugi,1,2015-06-03,Bizarre dream where time kept resetting it self,Fat_Ass_Reddit,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/38fugi/bizarre_dream_where_time_kept_resetting_it_self/,"**TL;DR - Evil old man and evil toddler came to my work. Toddler was trying to use my computer to summon demonic alien. Time kept resetting itself, same scenerio, different versions kept occuring. Eventually evil old man brought clones of the evil toddlers, overtook the office, and summoned said demonic alien.**

I've always had bizarre dreams and a good memory for them since I was a child, along with lots of sleep paralysis experiences (it's entertaining once you learn to control it). I don't usually write down my dreams since I'm pretty good at remembering them for a bit, but I feel like I should start now that I've been browsing this subreddit. I don't really talk about my dreams with many people that can relate to having such vivid memories of them but I've always wanted to. It's a few paragraphs so I hope it's not too long and it gets a few reads.

This last dream I had stuck out because it has such a strange context (although not really any stranger than other dreams many of you or myself have had)...

I'm at work, in my office (I work in IT). This elderly asian man and an asian toddler (maybe 2-3 years old) walks in. I get up to approach them. The toddler looks vaguely familiar, but I don't think much of it. The old man, wearing tan slacks and a polo shirt, has this vicious look on his face and mutters that the toddler needs to use my computer. Before I know, the toddler has ran to my computer desk and is typing away. I try to pull the child away from my desk but the old man grabs me with force to stop me. The man, looking even more wicked than before, tells me in a harsh tone to not get in the way. The child looks back at me, emoting the same sinister vibe of the old man. I keep trying to pull the toddler away but I struggle as the child resists and the old man keeps pulling me away. This is when it happens...

Everything happening stops. Literally, like a hard cut in a film. I'm back in my office, alone. Like time has reset itself. The old man and toddler are gone but something is different. I intrinsically know that they are going to come back and the situation is going to repeat it self. I'm aware time has reset itself and before I know it, here comes the man and the toddler through the door again, same scenario.

This time our department office setup is a bit different. The room dimensions are still the same but some furniture is moved around. We have 2 computer workstations out in the open part of the office for our interns. Those workstations are now on the opposite end of the room from were they are usually.

This time the toddler runs to one of our intern workstations and when I try to pull him off, the little fucker bites me! Then it hits me, I recognize him. He's my friend's child who I only know because of Instagram. My friend posts photos of their kid all the time. I've never met the kid or have spoken to my friend in a few years other than comments left on photos. Now, I don't know if it's because of this sudden realization that causes me to lose some focus, but the segue to next part of the dream is a little blurry.

I somehow figure out what the purpose is of the toddler typing on the computer. Another sudden realization. The old man and toddler are trying to summon a demonic alien into this world, and apparently they are going to open a portal that's accessible by typing some shit on a computer (I saw Kung Furry recently, so I'm assuming the ridiculous shit that hacker dude did influenced this. For those that haven't seen it, go watch it. It's an entertaining 30 minute film).

I then ""wake up"" in my room, like everything is normal but I still know it's going to happen again. This is where I'm unsure whether I was really awake or not. The same scenario happens a couple of times more but this time when it ends I keep waking up, laying in my bed, falling back asleep and repeating. I don't ever die, but time appears to be resetting itself every time I get to the part of the struggle of pulling the toddler off computer.

The interesting thing is time keeps resetting itself a few minutes further back each time, meaning that I realized I keep getting more time exponentially to prepare for these two demon summoners to arrive. This time I had enough time to shut the doors to our office before they showed but it's almost as if ""they knew"". I waited and listened for them to approach and heard their footsteps outside but this time the old man brought multiple clones of the toddler, about 15 or so, and they started banging on the doors, screaming in an eerie monotonous tone to let them in. My boss is in the office time time, but as soon as I realized a purple, vortex-like portal appears behind him and sucks him in. Fucking even more random. Like if something realized ""hey, he's not suppose to be there, let get rid of him.""

The last scenario before it ended seemed like it took the longest. I was on the first floor of my building, trying to gather other co-workers to come help me prepare for the arrival of the old man and toddler clones. I convinced a few people to come up to my office but it was too late. The door was left open and the toddler clones and old man were already inside summoning the demonic alien force. The toddler clones were typing away on every computer in the office. I ran as fast as I could, just knowing I was heading towards my car.

I was relive to finally wake up and got out of my bed immediately, even saying out loud ""I'm so fucking glad that is over.""

I told my girlfriend and she said it sounded like something straight out of a Dr. Who episode, which I though was hilarious.

Funny thing is the very next night, I was aware I was starting to dream the same scenario again but I was literally able to think ""nope!"" and woke up."

(Sorry if this is not the right format or type of posts),TheHamburgerlar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38fw79/career_advice_job_change_background_sorry_if_this/,"I'll keep this as short as possible, since well, I'm at work and nobody wants to read a summary of my life.

Long story short, I graduated in December 2012 and landed a job at a small bio company shortly thereafter in June 2013. As for what I do, it had nothing to do with my degree (like in many cases) but it was my first ""high"" paying job and I enjoyed the money/experience I was getting. Fast forward 2 years later. I feel like I've experienced all I could experience here and saved up enough to do what I want for a while (it was never really about the money to begin with, but the money and safety and health benefits kept me around for an additional 1year).  It's not that I absolutely hate my job, because it's so easy I have time to do whatever I want (ie: Facebook, reddit, youtube, phone), but I do feel like I'm wasting my time now and this is definitely not a career job. This is not a career job and I do not know how stable it will be in the future (50k/year + benefits at the moment but there's no direction or growth possibilities and I'm only 26) I wish I took the time to learn more skills, which I'm doing now for SQL, but I do not know how much that will apply for me in search of a new job more towards my future/career.

So that's my current situation. Here's a short summary of what I'm doing and where I want to go.

Graduated: Undegrad BS in Decision Science (Business, Data Analysis, Management) 

Experience: Sales at Gap, Intern at a Developer company, and currently a Bio Company

Brief Current job description: Bio company looking at compatibility of patients to the device. (Ie: photos come in of the patients from hospitals. I kind of examine it and put it into files send it to my higher up to see if they are compatible to use the device.) in addition to this, I record everything on Excel and Netsuite and write reports here and there about the Rates that are ruled as compatible or not compatible (reasons why it might not be) - **this is the only thing I really enjoy about my current job because it has somewhat to do with my skills/strengths.**

Skills: Primary Excel, learning some SQL basics which I really hope might help me land a job as a Data Analysis or an Analyst for a particular business.

TLDR: **I want to contribute to the growth of a company and really analyze the business aspects of things. And I know my excel skills are relatively top notch for what businesses looks for in an analyst. IE: Basic Formulas, data filtration, pivot tables, formatting spreadsheets, and graph creations. I'm trying to learn more right now such as SQL and apply it to my resume/assets but it might be hard given how that's unrelated to my current job right now. I've also reached a threshold at how much more time I can waste here. It's difficult enough waking up every morning and round trip driving 2+hour in traffic to do something I don't have any desire to do.**

Suggestions on what to look for on sites like indeed, careerbuilder, etc and job position titles that might be viable to what was posted here? I'll post my resume in the resume section too for critique but this might help me get a jump start in my search for a career job.

38fype,2,2015-06-03,"[Long] Turning 18, need to move but no where to go.",ImNearlyHomeless,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/38fype/long_turning_18_need_to_move_but_no_where_to_go/,"This is a fairly difficult situation (at least for me), and please forgive me if you don't understand some parts that I may cut out just due to them being too personal. And thanks in advance for taking the time to read it. Sorry for such a long thing, but I feel like I needed to say everything in order for it to make sense... and I had to get this off my chest after all these years.

So let's see.. where to start.

I'm the 2nd oldest child in a family of 5. I have 3 sisters: one older and two younger. I don't have any brothers. We (my 2 younger sisters and I) live with my mother, as I'm currently 17 (i'll be turning 18 on Sunday) and finishing school this month. 

My 3 sisters all have the same father, but I don't. Without disrespecting my mother, I'll just say that she was 19 when she had my oldest sister and with a guy I'll call Joe. She fell in love with Joe at a young age, but didn't marry him and living in the city, it wasn't too uncommon for that. But when she was pregnant with my oldest sister, he started to hurt her and so she left him and began to live alone.

 I should also note that her side of the family is a bunch of racist alcoholic nooks who don't give a damn about anything but themselves, so nobody was there to help her. She had also got into some drugs and violence, but she was never a hardcore addict and she absolutely doesn't look it today. She'd been involved in minor gang activity, but the gang wasn't very large and they apparently didn't have a problem with her leaving (as she was pregnant). 

&gt; Randomly inserting this, but I should say that my mother is blind in one eye, and she doesn't own a vehicle nor can she drive. She got her license suspended after receiving too many DUIs (at age 18).

So after leaving Joe, she had my first sister. Everything was fine for her, since she had previously worked at a diner and was able to support her and her new daughter (my oldest sister). A few years later, she started seeing another guy and that's how she got pregnant with me. Though, like with Joe, he became violent and she left him. And shortly after my birth, she returned to Joe (I don't know why) and eventually had my other two younger sisters. I don't know why she did these things, but I can't hate her for it and there's no point in judging her now since it will do nothing but make her feel useless, which I absolutely do not want to do. There's nothing I could've done, we're all different and we all make mistakes and poor decisions sometimes too.

When she had my last sister, she moved from the city, with all of us, to New York. She was unemployed after I was born, since she was receiving money from Joe. After moving to New York, we lived alone for a few years and everything seemed to be okay. She was receiving social security / disability (I'm not really sure which or how it works.. sorry. I also can't explain why, because I'm not too sure), as she still does today, for 4 children so supporting us was not a problem. However, neither my father nor my sisters' paid child support so that was an unfortunate burden but we never struggled for food or clothes or any of that. In New York, we moved to a very very small town where we still live today. This town is beautiful, however there is nothing to do and the nearest fast food restaurant is an hour away, and there are scarce amounts of jobs which usually require a lot of physical labor (such as farming).

She met a new guy, I'll call him Tim. Tim was a great guy, I really mean it. He was the father I had always wished for. He loved the outdoors, he was really friendly and funny, he had a good job, and he was just an honest guy. When my mother began dating him, she fell in love again. But I think that she felt that this was definitely love compared to the other two times. She was really serious about this guy. And for the next few years, they dated and became engaged, and overall everything was great. We were financially stable, everyone was happy, and we had a nice home. We later moved to a larger house, simply because the first one was a 3 bedroom, and 4 bedroom would've suited better so my oldest sister could have privacy and we could have more space and such. There were also 3 of us in school, and my youngest sister began the year we moved. It wasn't a far move, just a few miles away.

Everything was great, including the new home. But a year or two after moving, Tim got laid off from work. This was around 2006 or 2007 when the economy in the US was kind of going to shit (or I think anyway, somewhere around then..). Unemployment wasn't really helping much, so Tim searched for a job and found one just a few hours away. Tim owned a vehicle and such, so it was fine. For a while again, everything was okay. But when my oldest sister, who I'll call Haley, was 18, she became really depressed. School was difficult for her, like for a lot of people, and she was bullied daily. The school she attended only had 200 students and it was a K-12 school, but bullying happens everywhere and her classmates didn't like her for reasons I don't know. She became anorexic and suicidal and she cut her wrists. One day when she cut too deep, am ambulance was called and she was brought to a hospital an hour away (as it was the only city with a hospital capable of such care). This happened multiple times, but eventually my mother couldn't handle it anymore and made the decision to send Haley to a mental hospital where she could be helped by professionals around the clock. Keep in mind that the rest of us 3 were children, so we were scared and we didn't really understand what was going on. 

After a few months, Haley seemed to be doing well and returned home, but changed schools. For a while it was okay, but again Haley fell into a severe depression which led to self-harm and then back to the mental hospital. This happened a handful of times, around 6 or 7, but then my mom had met with social workers who thought the best thing to do in this situation was to switch my sister to a different mental-hospital-like residency where she could feel more freedom but also be safe and not being a danger to others in our home. Every few months, we'd visit her and everything was kind of okay. But as a result, my mom didn't receive money for her (since she was not living with us anymore), which wasn't initially a problem.

But of course, for whatever reason, my family doesn't seem to have the best luck. While my sister was away, she decided to come out and say that Tim had molested her. Despite the fact that people knew she was probably lying, New York especially takes it very seriously and investigates these crimes. Immediately Tim's reputation was ruined. He lost his job, he had to move out from our house because he was a 'danger' and he had to move back in with his father. This wasn't only a huge problem for Tim, but also for us. This meant that the only income my mom received was for us 3 remaining children, which really wasn't a whole lot. At some point, they cut the amount they were able to give, for reasons I'm not sure of. 

After a few months of looking into Tim's case, they found him innocent. However, it was decided by social services that it was best if he didn't return home simply because there would be too many questions asked and living in the small town we did, our family would have a poor image. So he left.. and we haven't talked to him since.

This is where things really began to fall apart.


So now my single mother was supporting a family on disability/ss checks. If anyone reading this receives them or know someone who does, you'll know that it helps but it's definitely not something you can raise a family off of in the 2000s. Food stamps don't go as far now as they used to. And 3 growing children and an adult eat a lot more food than people may think.

So now, for the past few years, it's been a struggle growing up and my mom has done everything she can to make sure that we're doing okay in school and that we have food and clothes and things to make us happy. She always put us first, and I always worried that she wasn't happy and that she never had much of her own. But she smiled as much as she could in front of us. 

When I hit 9th grade, I became depressed just from all the stress around me and academics suddenly mattered and were a bit too difficult for me. I was suicidal and I attempted suicide once, but I was more concerned with peoples' feelings if I was gone than my own, so thankfully I was able to control myself and talk myself out of it. Despite not feeling like dying, I still felt like shit and I didn't give a damn about school and I cried a lot. I didn't have any friends, only classmates I occasionally talked to. The teachers didn't understand and some didn't even care at all what I was going through. The school counselor was a bitch and all she cared about was people saying she did a good job, when she did the opposite. Throughout my 4 years of highschool, she hadn't helped me at all, and even made some of my situations worse. I felt like I had no one, but I kind of went on feeling empty for the rest of my 9th grade year and barely passed with a 70 GPA (per 100 scale). To add to it, we have to buy our own review books to study for the regents exam, which we will use in class (Regents Exams are just New York's official tests). We all had to bring in $5 and the school covered the rest of the money, but I literally didn't have $5. Five whole dollars. So as weeks went by, the teacher would ask me when I would bring money in, and I said soon.. I didn't know what to do. Well one day, the teacher flipped out on me and yelled and said it wasn't fair to the rest of the class that I wasn't bringing in 5 damn dollars for a review book that I needed in order to pass the class. I'm a pretty strong person emotionally, but this really made me break down and cry.. It's so hard to believe that you don't have $5 until you really just don't have it. Nobody understands until they're in that position. I talked to him after class and explained that I just don't have $5 and I won't have it anytime soon.. and it was as if something just clicked in his mind and he looked at me and said that it was okay. But the way he said it was like he kind of understood, or at least a small bit.

In 10th grade, it got even more difficult. On top of everything that was going on, my mom was diagnosed with throat cancer, lung cancer, and another cancer (I can't remember). She 
underwent multiple surgeries and thankfully was able to have all the cancer removed. She also got her thyroid removed, and was put on a lot of medication (on top of the rest of her medication such as xanax). Being the 'mother' of the house, she felt like her role was crippled and that there was nothing she could do until she recovered. It was difficult to try and care for her, since my two younger sisters aren't the most cooperative of people.. but we managed. 

In my 11th grade year, my mother was better but our financial status was the same: horrible. Not being able to drive anywhere and having to rely on our grandmother to bring us anywhere.. not having food after the 15th of the month because food stamps didn't help that much.. Having to go to the food shelter every week just to try and help, and it still wasn't enough.. Living in an old house that was disgusting and had black mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and exposed pipes everywhere, and shitty wallpapers and really needed painting and yardwork.. Couldn't afford paint for the house, couldn't afford gas for the lawnmower, couldn't afford anything for house repairs. The whole environment just kept the mood low.

And now, senior year, I'm finishing school. This is the year that most people finalize their college decisions and attempt to get some job shadowing experience or even internships if possible. I also did a job shadow, and it was great. But that's not really important. 
So in the location I live, it's impossible to find a job. Even 14 years after living here, there haven't been any new job opportunities. If I could find a job here to support my family, by all means I would. But it's just not an option. This year, I made college plans but of course it was impossible for me to follow through with them. I want to study computer science at a college that's right for me, not some shitty dumpster college that's overpriced and has a horrible environment and tons of campus crimes. But I just can't afford it. Even the cheapest of the community colleges isn't an option, because I can't pay the smallest fees. I have applied for at least 50 proper scholarships, and I have only received 2. One only applies if I go to that school, which'll be a $2500 discounts from a $50,000 yearly cost.. impossible for me to even dream of. The other one applies only if I maintain certain grades for the first two years, and it's only worth $200.. sure it's $200 more than I had to start but.. it just feels like nothing... like a drop in the bucket that has evaporated. I have absolutely no money for college, it was impossible to start a college fund, and there is no place here to work where I can save money to do anything. I hear about all my friends going to these great colleges, because their parents can afford to help them and because they already had a good financial setting they will have no issues going to any university they'd like. But me.. I can't even go to an okay one. It's really hard to hear your friends talk about it all the time, and when they ask you... what am I supposed to say? I just tell them I'm taking a gap year, because it's the easiest to say. But in reality, I know I'm fucked and I don't have any idea if I'll be able to go to college. 

So the college and finance issues have gone all this time, until now.. and it's the final problem to just kill me inside.


Since I'm turning 18, I'll no longer be on my mom's SS case... meaning that she'll receive a reduced amount of ss money as well as food stamps. After figuring bills for the month and food and budgeting everything.. I know that it's impossible for me to stay here. It's just not. And I don't know what to do. I can't afford to move out, and I have no where to go. No friends or family to stay with, and no where to offer me a place in exchange for work. I'm in such a bad position, and I'm so confused and upset and I'm trying not to be depressed because it would only make things worse. My mom really doesn't want me to leave until I'm able to go off to college or have a good job. She's not ready for me to stop being a child, like most mothers. But my mother.. she often asks... ""Am I a failure?""...

If you've never heard this question, it's the hardest one I've ever had to hear. My own other asking me if she's a failure. If she's a bad mom. If she could've done anything differently. If she made too many mistakes.. 

Of course I tell her no and that she's a great mom, but just the fact that she thinks about it.. it's really upsetting and I hate to see my mother that way, it's horrible and I'd never want to wish the same upon anyone. 


By July 1st, bills will become too much of an issue and we'll essentially be evicted from our home since we'll be unable to pay rent with all of the other bills. 



I really just don't know what to do, and I've tried anything I can think of. I've asked for professional help and they all give me ambiguous answers like ""have you asked __? oh, they can help you"" which leads me to the next person, and the next.. I spent so much time looking for aid, but there's no one there to help.


And I don't want to be selfish, but I feel like it's my turn to be able to explore life and find things that make me happy and pursue my dreams. I want to go to college. I want to become a software engineer. I want to have a girlfriend, and later a wife and family. I want to travel the world. I've studied Japanese for almost a year now, and I want to study abroad in Japan and even work or live there for a while if possible. I study so much about things I want to do, only to find that there's no hope for me right now.

And some may think ""Well, if you can program stuff, why can't you work from home?"". Well I could, but it's not as easy as you think. I'm not an amazing programmer. I've taught myself everything, and I've only been doing it a few years. I've never worked for a large company, and mostly did small hobby projects and the only money I've made is from private projects for games. I'm not innovative, as I don't have the creative mind to come up with ideas. I'm more of the person who can learn and implement something that already exists. But even then, I'm not a professional programmer like some people may think I am. 

    
I don't really know what else I can say now, but I may edit the post later with some details I forgot. 

Thanks for taking the time to read it.  I really appreciate it.


TL;DR turning 18, have no money, can't go to college, need to move out to help family but no where to go."

Lastest issue is some yarn I left lying around.  I was making balls out of two 500 yd skeins I bought.  One of them got massively tangled and I had to go on a business trip, so I left it out because she said she'd like to give untangling it a go.

I get back and she finished... she said it took her an hour. Strange, since I spent a good 3 hours and got only about halfway through it. But whatever.  I looked at the ball today... and it's only half the size of the other ball. They were the exact same length/size/brand/everything.  Both balls should be the same size.  It's pretty obvious she untangled it for an hour and just cut it to say she was done, which would be whatever... if she had been the one who dropped $30 on it.  If she couldn't untangle it, she should have just left it.

Second problem has been my misplaced packs of birth control.  Every other month or so, I won't be able to find my new pack anywhere.  I'm pretty disorganized and absent minded, so at first I figured I was just misplacing them and would go call the gyno and get another one. Except it's now happened 8 times, and I'm being careful about it now.  Come home from pharmacy, put in drawer next to other pack... and then it's gone the next evening.

I go on a lot of business trips unexpectedly, but she NEVER throws out my leftovers for me in the fridge.  This would be another ""it's whatever"". BUT. She says she's thrown out ""some things"" when I get back... and only my chocolate/chips/ice cream/liquor/etc is missing.  You know, the things that wouldn't go bad.  That salad though is degrading into a pile of mush at the bottom of the veggie crisper though, without fail.

There's also the weird issue of where she says she shares a bunch of hobbies with me (anime, metal, knitting, reading)... but she's never heard of anything I talk about.  I'm not 100% versed at any of those, to be sure, but most people have heard of Pride and Prejudice and a large proportion of people at least know that Cowboy Bebop is an animated series. She allegedly speaks close to fluent French (it's even on her resume), but my boyfriend (who is from there...) can't understand any of the phrases she rattles off.  She backs this up with ""I can't really understand his accent in English either"".

Allegedly she got a job at our crappy company (we work at the same place) because she couldn't take the stress of filling out more than one job application; but she had a 4.0 GPA and a prestigious internship with a major company in our industry, on top of a million scholarships that made her ivy league school ""pretty much free"".

There was the pizza incident.  Me, her, and another coworker were going to order pizza.  She got so mad we didn't want to order from Pizza Hut she STORMED OUT of the room... it would've been fine if she preferred the taste of that to the local place we were ordering from, but she swore up/down/left/right/sideways that the Pizza Hut pizza was a better ""deal"" than the local place, when the local place not only has cheaper pizza's but also gives you every fifth pizza free.

This is slightly more confusing, due to my unwillingness to give out personal info.   There was also the infamous ""contracting"" incident, where she was sent to a client site allegedly to do something relating to some skill she doesn't have yet.  However, she was supposed to perform some other task entirely not related.  The other guys from our company at the site didn't care, since the job she thought she was doing is annoying and tedious.  But the job she was sent for never got done, so the that particular client will only continue their contract on grounds she never goes there again.  She had a meeting with the local manager about it, and her supervisor wound up just getting written off for ""communication issues"".  Possible, but I got sent out for the job after her, and the email the site managers had all included that her task SPECIFICALLY was this one thing she never did.

Strange girl.  She probably has issues.  Thank god I'm moving next week."

I arrived here in late April for a summer internship at a start-up. It turns out we weren't a very good match, which means my next few months will be very open. I'm trying my very best to get myself to daily events I find through Facebook in hopes of establishing friendship(s), but I'd like to exhaust every avenue for finding them, reddit included.

A little bit about me: I'm 21, a fourth-year university student majoring in Computer Science, minoring in French. I'm a small-circle-of-friends kind of guy; I have one very close friend back home, two a bit more distant, but apart from them it's just acquaintances. I'm very devoted to queer, feminist, and racial equality causes and have spent much of these last few years back home doing activist work. (I'd like very much to get involved with similar things here.) I'm a nerd who loves tech, but also language; sudden realisations that previously unlinked words in my mind have common etymology gets me as excited as unboxing my latest device. Late night talks with friends are some of my favourite things in the world; I'm infinitely happier waking up after having spent all night emotionally bonding through debate than rising at morning having bonded sexually. I don't speak French very well at all, but enjoy making a game out of finding the words to communicate existent in my present vocabulary (again, language nerd). Finding someone at my level (that of an early primary school student, perhaps) and amused by similar follies would be super.

As I stated, I have much free time, so it would be ideal to find someone who's similarly uncommitted. Excursions together at least a few times a week, dining at new restaurants, walking around new parks, spending nights together talking on the couch, etc., would be great. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm searching for intimacy, yes, but emotional intimacy, not sexual; I'm an ardent supporter of the theory that attraction takes many forms, some of which couldn't be more distant from genitalia.)

Well, I think that's it for now. I'll edit later if I come to realise I've left out anything critical. Please, feel free to reply or inbox. I'm posting this on a Wednesday evening (3 June), and would love to grab drinks or a cup of coffee together anytime, be it to-night, to-morrow, or this week-end!

Thank you kindly,

38g9xa,55,2015-06-03,I [23 M] have wasted my life and now I'm paying for it,cvrdinbees,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38g9xa/i_23_m_have_wasted_my_life_and_now_im_paying_for/,"Sorry this is long but I'm just writing to get this out. I'm 23 and sitting in my childhood home and I've let insecurity and laziness run my life for so long. When I was in high school I lost a ton of weight, pretty girls started to take interest in me but I was always too nervous or scared to do anything, was totally afraid to take a chance and never made a move with any of them. And I know it was just hormones but everything felt fresh and new like spring, I was excited about life even if I was too afraid to make any sexual moves and I loved writing and I had a good group of friends and generally just felt good about my life. 

Then I went to college and it seems like all the confidence (or pseudo-confidence) I had built up just turned to mist. Suddenly I was scared again and frightened, and I ended up spending two years just being antagonistic and aggressive because I thought that's what confidence was but I just felt fucking miserable all the time. I also hated the school I was in because I went to a small Catholic high school and I went to a small Catholic college so I felt like I was on repeat and I wanted out. I almost tried to kill myself because I was just too upset and felt like I had nothing to live for, especially if college was supposed to be the best time of your life, I figured why stick around for the rest? I transferred schools after my sophomore year and I was even more miserable at my next school, it was like a nightmare. I hated my roommates and was stuck in off-campus housing so I had nowhere to go. I didn't go out and try to join clubs or anything because I was too upset and felt too sorry for myself to do anything about my situation. 

I coasted through and now I'm out. It's been a year and I just finished an internship in NYC but I have no motivation to do anything else. All of my friends took their college search seriously or more seriously than I did and they made lasting friendships and had good experience and have SO's and even if they're not all completely living the dream they just seem to have more motivation than I do.

I'm just not sure where to go from here. I want to be a writer but I have no inspiration and even though I write every day I don't care about any of the projects. I didn't take advantage of any of the opportunities I had an now they're gone. I don't want to live in my quiet suburb but it's like I don't care enough about my life to do anything about it. It's like I'm floating in a fucking sea of apathy. I don't think about killing myself but if I died I'd be fine. I feel as if I'm stuck in a cycle, and I know that if I never do anything about my insecurity and depression (I guess idk it's just general feelings of apathy and sometimes hopelessness, like extreme lethargy) I'll never live the life I want to live. I just keep reliving how I actually felt alive when I was a teenager and keep screaming at myself for all the time I wasted in college. I'm just very, very tired and I wouldn't mind sort of nodding off and never waking up. I feel like this is going to be my life for the rest of my life and that it's too late to experience  all the things i should have already experienced before turning 23-first love, traveling, making new friends (that I made before high school). I feel like I wasted my life and it's just going to be mediocrity from here on out-the same people and and the same bars and the same places. I just hate myself and the faults and weaknesses that both simultaneously blocked me in and brought me to this place. I feel like I'm done.

Sorry for the shitty grammar, rambling and repetition. Just had to let all this out.

EDIT: Wow, I really can't thank everyone enough who commented on this. I'm new here (as in I just started going on Reddit literally two and a half months ago) I didn't expect anyone to actually reach out, just figured I'd vent. It seems ridiculous but I guess I was too mired in myself to see any way out. Not sure if I'm even writing in a section where anyone can see this (no I don't know what I'm doing, yes I probably do need an adult) but I really want to thank everyone for their kind and thoughtful comments about this. Truly, everyone, thank you.  "
38gjbr,1,2015-06-03,Girlfriend [19/f] got a full time job which is causing problems for our relationship and I [18/M] need some advice.,bdawson130,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/38gjbr/girlfriend_19f_got_a_full_time_job_which_is/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for around seven months. Everything has been great and all with some problems but thats in every relationship. I have an internship where I currently work 8-4 for five days and a part time job where i work 12 hours. After the first two weeks of my internship it will reduce to 20 hours and my other job will be bumped up to 20 hours. She just got a job where she works 4-12 m-f. So as you can see we work quite the opposite schedules. She originally had a job where she worked mornings for around 30 hours a week but quit to work at her new place. She lives with her dad and i live with my family, we both are home from college and live within 30 minutes. 

So my problem about all of this is that I dont want to only be able to see her for a couple hours on the weekend. What happens if something comes up then i dont see her for 2+ weeks. I know this may not seem like a big deal to some but im a pretty affectionate guy who needs some time to spend with my SO. She will be working full time during school as well so that makes it even worse. 

Her reason for taking this job is because she doesn't want to have any loans when she exits college and wants a fall back plan. I keep telling her that she gets to be young only once in her life and now should be the time to take full advantage. She isnt buying any of it. I dont want to have to threaten to leave because i dont think thats really fair. Preferably advice where I dont leave her because I really do love this girl and would like things to work out. 

Anyways any advice is welcome and there is lots more detail that ive let out so just ask me questions ill answer them. "
38gp2z,2,2015-06-03,How can we [20F/21M] spice up our relationship? He says it's boring...,throwaway_041212,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38gp2z/how_can_we_20f21m_spice_up_our_relationship_he/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years now, and things are going well. We've talked about marriage in the future (not anytime soon of course, but we see a shared future together). Sex is good, this post isn't about our sex life lol. One big difference between us is that he is so adventurous and always wants to go out and do something, while I am one to choose to stay home and do my homework. Of course, when I DON'T have school priorities, I love exploring new hobbies and places. 

Anyway, today we were just hanging out at his place after I got out of class, and I noticed something was a little off about him. I asked him if he was happy in our relationship. I'm not sure why, but sometimes, I just have these weird feelings (call it intuition if you want) that he's not as into us sometimes as his usual self, so I'll ask him to make sure something isn't bothering him. He told me that yes he was happy. Then he got quiet and weird and after a LOT of pressing and asking, he finally asked me if I thought our relationship was ""fun.""

I asked him to clarify and he said that he feels like we do the same things all the time and that we don't really do anything new. Like I said, he is the adventurous type and loves to try new things. I am too, just not as much as he is, mostly because school and work are my main priorities, so for me, fun comes last often. 

I asked him what he would like to do because we live in a small town, so there aren't very many options for activities. Plus, we are both full time students, so money is tight. I only have a part-time job, and he just started a full-time internship that will only last for the summer, and we are both trying to pay for school. I pointed out this financial problem to him, and he just said to forget about the money (?!?). This started a different discussion about how I care too much about money--he thinks taking out loans for school isn't that big of a deal because I will be able to pay it off when I start working--I say I can't just spend all of my money now and expect to have a good paying job in the future. Then he says he doesn't mean that we have to go out and do something extravagant. I again ask him what he has in mind because I'm all for doing something new with him, it's just that nothing comes to mind and I'm honestly short on time often because of school...but he doesn't even know what he wants to do -______-. 

He mentions then that he wants to go on a road trip (really...this costs so much money...). I say I don't have money. He says we can just get a hotel and hangout and drink in the big city nearby, just spending time together someplace else other than our homes. He also pointed out that he thinks it's not just our relationship that he feels bored in. He said his two best friends rarely want to do anything anymore either besides chill at home and smoke hookah. So I pointed out to him that we are all growing up and have different priorities. But to him, growing up is the exact reason we need to all go out. I see his point of view, but at the same time, I feel like he has a hard time keeping in mind the REAL priorities. 

I really am SO for trying something new with him. I think that it's healthy to constantly change up your relationship here and there! My only problem is that neither of us really have money to spend, and I have so little time for myself/him outside of working/school (school 5 days a week, work all weekend). He asked me to take off work for one weekend to spend it with him, but I just can't...I can't afford to NOT make money one weekend to spend money that I do not have...

Also another thing to mention is that he feels like I don't give him enough of my time. But I honestly can't! I'm literally at school all day, I come home and have to study for the rest of the night, and then I work on the weekends. And during the regular school year, we go to different schools, so it's even harder. I feel like, though, when I DO have a day off or the littlest free time, I spend it with him /:

My question is what are some cheap, affordable activities that we can do together? What other ways are there to spice up our relationship? We planned a day trip to a state park (we like hiking together and exploring nature) since I have the day off, so I'm not sure why he's complaining now ):

So far I passed FAR, AUD, and REG. I find it difficult to find a channel to apply for entry level positions since I do not  have access to on campus career fair opportunities. UCSD's career fairs are not attended by large accounting firms either so attending as alumni seems to be a dead end. Would appreciate any tips from those who have walked this path!"

PARKING: Map and detailed instructions here: http://drafthouse.com/kansas_city/mainstreet/mainstreet_directions_parking/

There are 2 parking garages, both on 13th and Main: - If you arrive before Noon, the H&amp;R Block Garage will be closed, so use the Cosentino's/OneLife garage. Prime floor is 3rd floor, same as Main Street level. - Otherwise use the H&amp;R Block garage. All floors are deeper than Main Street level, but there's a patron elevator toward the south wall you can use to quickly get back up.

Regardless of which garage you end up in, GET YOUR PARKING VALIDATED or you'll be charged when you leave. The first thing you should do when you walk inside Alamo is hand the parking pass you took to get into the garage to the box office to get it validated.

STAFF: Brett Alan Cooker is our main man if you have questions about anything. He has a job to do, though, and on most nights he has to disappear at 9:30 PM to run films and won’t be available for the rest of the night. Just keep in mind we’ll be on our own after 9:30.

FOOD Full menu: http://cf.drafthouse.com/_uploads/files/23389/mainstreet_-_10-13-14_reduced.pdf

We’re not hollywood enough yet to have staff attend to us in the mezzanine, so just head down to the 1st floor lobby to order what you want. There are also plenty of restaurants in the Power &amp; Light district within walking distance from cheap (Chipotle, Burger King) to not-so-cheap (BRGR or any of the bar &amp; grills). We hope you choose to support Alamo though!"

38gtf4,0,2015-06-03,Long-time sad person now stuck in a pretty awful place seeks strategies to get better,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38gtf4/longtime_sad_person_now_stuck_in_a_pretty_awful/,"I've never been a cheery person. I've always been able to enjoy life to some extent and be happy on a day to day basis, but beyond that there has always been some sinking empty pit in my stomach that's made some days awful. Not all or most. But I would get into modes here and there that varied from completely apathy towards being alive to some pretty gnarly despair.

I always came out the other side though, which is why I would've previously struggled to think that I actually had depression. Last December however I got hit with a miserable loss and spiraled down into a dark place pretty fast. As of a month or so ago I thought I finally came out the other side. I was having a lot more decent days than miserable ones. I was wrong unfortunately, because the days got worse and worse and more and more frequent, to the point when I don't really know when I'm out, if I ever am.

I'm a college student, and during the school year I periodically visited my school's counselor over a period of 3 or 4 months. He never told me anything I didn't already really know, such as needing to move on, and I've done everything I can to achieve that goal. Thankfully, he kept my mind focused enough that my life and health stopped suffering and even improved if anything because I picked my grades back up and even landed a great internship. I never figured out the smoking gun to move on and actually recover, let alone to find any strong and lasting happiness in my life.

I watched Robert Sapolsky's lecture on depression and the line about how depression is a disease that ""makes you unable to enjoy sunsets."" That really stuck out to me because now that the weather is finally nice, even seeing the same sunshine and feeling the same summer breezes I felt with the person I lost makes me feel like utter garbage.

I don't know what I need to feel like myself again, but I want it bad. I don't want to sit here the rest of my life. I want to regain myself and get better than I've ever been, so I can actually find the serious happiness and fulfillment that everyone deserves and even owes themselves. 

I really need to know what my options are here so I can find a way to escape. I usually will my way through everything like a stubborn bastard, but the second I realized that it's been 6 months and I'm not particularly better is the second I realized that there might be something very seriously wrong with me. Thanks for taking the time to read this."

---My Mission Statement (Draft 3):--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was the little girl who received free lunches at school.  I know what it’s like to be given a coat because I didn’t have one.  I understand what it feels like to need a helping hand.  I owe the person I am today to community members showed me the way to opportunity – I’ve been incredibly lucky. 

I’ve always felt drawn to the Peace Corps both by my appreciation for the generosity that has shaped my life as well as the inspiration I’ve found in helping others.  I first felt empowered by service in secondary school when I saw younger students come together against bullying after a mentoring conference that I helped lead.  I felt the pull of participating in something greater than myself when a stranger with tears in her eyes thanked my group for helping her devastated community after Hurricane Katrina.  Volunteering has afforded me some of the most honest, raw, and rewarding moments of my life.  In these moments I’ve found meaning, purpose, and an unshakable drive to serve.

I also see the Peace Corps as an adventure.   As an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer I set out for Wyoming knowing little more than that I was to spend the summer building houses with Habitat for Humanity.  I felt so alive, taking that chance and adapting to the challenges of a novel experience, that I’ve sought that feeling through my internships, co-ops, and study abroad.  I’ve cultivated a love for travel, but to me it’s not enough to stand on the outside looking in.  My fondest travel memories aren’t the grandeur of ancient sites or swanky tourist attractions. Rather they are the opportunities I’ve had to connect such as explaining that I don’t’ live next door to Brad Pitt to my homestay family as a People to People student ambassador. 

From travel abroad to helping ESL students improve their English on my college campus, I’ve cultivated an open minded approach and intense curiosity towards people, cultures, and ideas different than my own.   I believe the best way to expand my view of the world is to try to understand someone else’s, but not everyone sees it that way.  Building trust and confidence is one of the most important cornerstones of progress, but rapport takes time to develop.  I believe I'll encounter my greatest challenges during that development phase.  It will be challenging to maintain balance between integrating myself into a new culture and faithfully representing my own.  It will take strength to effectively and dynamically use my skills under adversity – to not only hold myself up, but to benefit others as well.  

When I was young someone told me, ""It is difficult to be sad and useful at the same time."" I've held this mantra close, and when life's challenges seem much greater than myself I'm made strong by turning my focus on others.  I will be encouraged through the Peace Corps’ challenges by my fascination in learning a new culture.  I will be impassioned by the deep-felt meaning I find in helping others.   I will be reinforced by my belief that struggle is the predecessor of progress – it’s an opportunity to become more than you thought you could.

Presently, I am seeking synergy between an engineering career and my desire to help people.  I covet a future where service is a primary component of my everyday affairs.  I’ve learned the best way to find your path is to surround yourself with people and experiences that resonate with your passions.   It’s my passion to grow a life that blesses those it touches.  I believe the most fertile ground for that is in the Peace Corps.   My decision was cemented upon identifying with the words of a friend and former volunteer, simply put – “it's just what people like me were born to do.”

Today I realized that life is hard and all the meditation in the world cannot fix this hurt I am feeling. I am so hurt and I feel so alone.

She gets really into the characters for movies and she is very over the top with reactions. This being said, I want to get a her reaction to the red wedding because I've seen videos of reactions and think that she could have a really good reaction... The problem is she moved to Texas for the summer for an internship so I won't be able to watch the show with her. I've come to the conclusion of two possible solutions:

1). I have her record herself watching the episode from the beginning. It will suck because she will know something is going to happen this episode, but I'm sure when she gets into the show she will forget that she is being recorded. However, then we are left with an hour long video and I have to trim it. Not that big of a deal and probably my best option but it's just kind of a hassle.

2). My other option was to fix the lengthy video problem by telling her at a certain minute into the show to turn the camera on. However, I personally don't really like this idea because it gives away that something crazy is about to happen because I am having her turn on the camera now. To me I feel it ruins the experience and the reaction won't be as sincere.

My question to you, Reddit, is are there any ways that you might know of, or could come up with, that will help make sure I can get the video I want while also making sure I don't give away the fact that something crazy might end up happening? I feel like the first option is my best, but I'm hoping that you guys can help my find an even better one.

Also, sorry for the title, this is my first post on the subreddit and I'm not 100% sure how to make the spoiler in the title."
38h3nb,4,2015-06-04,Should I learn a new technology stack for internship in California companies?,zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38h3nb/should_i_learn_a_new_technology_stack_for/,"Hello. I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student studying computer engineering. The school I go to have a huge coop program and this fall will be my 3rd internship.

Currently, it is the application period to apply for a position for next term and so far, I have been unsuccessful. The jobs that I have applied are all at start ups or well known companies in California or Washington state (Redmond, Seattle, etc...). Out of the 50 applications I have sent out (our limit for our first batch), over 40 of them have rejected me so far and I have landed absolutely 0 interviews.

Personally, I do not think it's my mark (Currently 3.5 C-GPA, 3.8 previous term) that is affecting my possibilities of getting an interview. I have a fair bit of side project (3 hackathons, a bunch of small random side projects to display my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, working on a fairly medium sized full scale application and also android apps. All are published on Github) along with good evaluations and experience from previous work terms (Full stack dev (Angular, C#, SQLite), App dev/QA (Python, Java, C#)).

When I showed my friends me resume for them to help me understand why am I not getting any interviews at all (my friends have what I would say comparable to what I have, either a bit more side projects or a bit higher mark, most have already secured 3 to 5 interviews), their biggest criticism is that ""No one in California uses .NET or C#"".

On my resume, I do mention the Microsoft technology stack a lot (As I am most familiar with it out of everything). I have mentioned C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studios, etc... Now, personally I don't know very much about rumors and stuff, I did check out some of the job qualifications and there is overlap for Java, javascript, python, C++ which I know. There's also technologies like Ruby, NoSQL, PHP, Objective -C which I have yet to learn. I do find usage of Microsoft technology to be more rare in the job postings from California companies at my school.

Basically, the question I have is, with the Microsoft Stack, what is my chance of me finding a good internship in California (in like a big company or a start up)? If it's bad, or if it is more beneficial for me, should I learn a completely new stack that does not rely on the Microsoft Stack and familiarize myself with technologies that is well, considered to be more ""hip"" and ""popular"" in California?

Note, I am not saying that the Microsoft stack is bad. Personally, I love working with the stack because it is so simple, C# is a very elegant language and Visual Studios is awesome. I have bragged that in hackathons, esp working on an app that needs to connect to the internet, I can deploy the back end REST API in a few hours onto Azure. It is definitely a pleasure to use it but I am afraid that since it's not well, ""hip"", it doesn't help me finding good internships in California.

Thank for your help and input."

While this is *EXTREMELY* helpful (I've already used ~$800 of the funds to incorporate and will be using ~$300 for a small experimental ad campaign), my raising target is ~$150k and they don't have that at their disposal. 

Based on my calculations, this will be enough for me to concentrate on this full-time for a year. I'm the sole developer/founder/salesperson/support lead/social media intern and am somewhat confident that I can raise a team and launch the first public beta of this sucker in six months if I had no full-time obligations. (At the very least, this will help me get someone who can offload my social media responsibilities; social media done right takes much more time than I thought!!!!!)

Because I work full-time however, not only do all of those estimates increase by 2-3x (I can spend six hours on it per day, and that's on a *really* good day), but it also introduces a lot of context switching that slows down both sides of the development pipeline (I've got to roll this *really important* piece of code, but my mockups suck so I need to fix those eventually; shit, I have two coffee/pitch meetings this week and I need to get out early enough so I can post/tweet some events during happy hour to try and gain traction, etc.).

I am also wary about spending that entire investment since, well, parents.

Is this something I can mention to angel investors that I pitch thinglistr as positive reinforcement of the idea?

Thanks in advance!"
38hpbk,1,2015-06-04,I'm lost for the next 4 years of my life,shunug,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38hpbk/im_lost_for_the_next_4_years_of_my_life/,"I'm a senior in High School and I have the dream of becoming a television writer when I grow up. I've been focused on this for about 2 years now, and everything I have done has pretty much been to get me closer to this goal. Last August I decided I was going to apply to NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, arguably the best film school in the nation. No big deal right? Wrong. There was a 5 part supplement including a 6 page script I needed to write for the application. I spent all my time working on this app. I wa so focused there was nothing that was going to stop me from reaching my dream of NYU.

Well in the meantime I also play baseball and was being recruited by nearly every DIII school in the PNW among other schools around the nation. I spent my main focus on Occidental a small liberal arts school in LA and Willammette a small liberal arts school in Oregon. I visited both schools and was the top recruit for both. However both were slightly out of my financial range and I was still hoping on my early decision from NYU to come back positive. 

Well it did. I was accepted and for that brief moment I was so happy. My entire life was being lit up right there in front of me. After I found out I had been accepted I didn't bother applying to any other schools because I knew I was going to NYU. Until they didn't offer me any financial aid and asked for $70,000 a year. I was fucking screwed. I made the mad dash to scramble and find any colleges with admission still open who also had an at least semi respected film school. I ended up applying and being accepted to Arizona State and Montana State. During this time my dad, who works in the Maritime industry, suggested joining the merchant marine for a year to raise money to potentially go to NYU or to go to a different school. I got all my papers and training and also got geared up to potentially join the Sailors Union of the Pacific. 

I ended up denying my acceptance to NYU and sending my deposit to ASU. I also got a deferment accepted for before my freshman year at ASU so I can take the gap year and sail if I wanted. My only problem is I feel like I can do better than ASU and i fucked up my chance with Occidental. My biggest stress in college is internships because that's where I break into the industry so I worry about Arizonas internship opportunities where I know Occidental is right in the heart of LA crawling with internships. I fucked up though because I didn't apply.

I have at least 4 different options for college and I have no fucking clue what I'm gonna do. I could just go to ASU next year, I could take a gap year then go to ASU. I could go to my nearby Community College to play baseball then try and transfer somewhere, or now I could go to a CC in California to play baseball and have the possibility of transferring to a state school in California.

I feel like I fucked up because I cut my ties too soon. There are so many things running through my mind about which possibility would be best. Should I call the Occidental Coach and see if there were any strings he could pull to get me into the college next year? But then would there be any financial aid money left over? How badly do I want to continue playing baseball in college? Would playing in college take up too much time for me to get any quality internships or make any quality connections? NYU has a baseball team and they're DIII, would the coach be able to find money for me if I wanted to play there? Could I even still make it back into the school? I still can't believe NYU was so close to me. That school was it for me, like the girl I still haven't gotten over. Sometimes I go to the website and still pretend like I am going there and look and see all of the things I would be doing there. I can't believe any of this happened to me. Maybe taking a gap year would be the best thing for me but would I be able to go to any other school besides ASU? I can't make any decisions for myself because I'm still so hurt over NYU and other people are pulling me in every direction imaginable. I just wish I could skip college all together or just have somebody make a decision for me because all of this anxiety is killing me.

Tl;dr I have too many options for college next year and it's killing me inside"

I'm a serial entrepreneur specializing in tech upstarts. I've had 5+ startups and 2 of them were very successful which we turned it into full fledged businesses before exiting. Me and my partner are currently building our new project in stealth mode. This Project-X took off and spread like wild fire and the fast growth created intensive growing pains.

We're major (double major) geeks and really love the process of creating technology to solve everyday problems. Sure, making money is important but if you are able to solve a problem with your idea, revenue will follow soon after. We are firm believers of that process.

A major trade off to the profession that we've chosen is that we don't get to rest, we're ultimately time-broke and we miss opportunities to meet a lot of cool people from gatherings and online communities. Is this the lifestyle that you are looking for? What do you strive for?

We are shorthanded and we were in the process of putting out feelers for developers and interns in the Los Angeles area but realized there are so much talent nationwide, why limit ourselves? Ultimately, it's the people that makes or breaks a startup.

What are some pains you've ran into? If you have the drive and passion for this industry, we're happy to help answer some questions you may have.

This may sound cliche, but I have been wanting to work for Google (or any other big SV company. I always associated California with Google) for almost 5 years now. Due to high school and other responsibilities, I never got the chance to really learn more than basic programming.

I am a prospective first yr student as a CS major, and I want to spend the summer before univ learning algorithms as deeply as I can. I have begun [this] (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/p/challenge-find-minimum-in-subarray) course, and I'll finish it within a week.

What should I do this summer to maximize my chances of getting a Google internship? Any Waterloo specific tips? Like scoring good on course XXX (that way I can brush up my basics in that course)?

How to get resume noticed in the horde of resumes of upper year and more qualified students?

Also it doesn't hurt that they pay handsomely. I talked to some people and they say if I get an SV job at big companies, I can easily save enough money to cover 2A's fees.
So, yeah. that's that.

Thanks for reading!

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Liam Hawke Ex Brotherhood Of Steel Knight Height: 6""2"" Weight: 96 kgs. Muscular body type. Eye: Bright Blue Hair: Black Gender: Male Sexuality: Straight Age: 26

Liam was with the California chapter of The Brotherhood Of Steel for a fair few years and he thought he would be with them for more. But after a load of changes by new leaders and rules that were being conservative and stupid Liam had enough. He had asked two of his best mates if they wanted to leave this place with him but they said no. So that left Liam on his lonesome out in the wasteland.

Liam was a a lot luckier than most people in the wasteland, having power armour and the best range of weapons and explosives. So he didn't really have any problems with any humans he encountered they would usually stray away from him when he had his armor on. Though he did have to kill a a lot of mutated creatures. 

Liam spent all his time traveling across the U.S, going to the East Coast he decided. But after awhile he stopped and thought why the hell is he going there? He didn't really know. He stopped in abandoned buildings, remote settlements and semi destroyed cities when he needed rest or wanted a break.

After months of the same process he saw signs that he was approaching the state of New York. Liam smiled, he had always wanted to see New York.

Hello there people! This was the start of a story that I had going with someone else but due to personal reasons they had to leave but now I am looking for someone to revive it. I would play the role of Liam so I am looking for someone to be Scarlett. I want this to be a long term role play. Don't worry so much about the large wall of text if that worries you as i do want long detailed rps but normally do a paragraph or two/three per posting. This is obviously set in a post apocalyptic/ post nuclear world of the video game series Fallout. I would prefer to role play over platforms such as kik, yahoo msger, skype, google docs and google chat/hangouts. I can send the rest of the story or we can make our own start from after these two posts. If your interested send me a detailed message.

However, two weeks before I left we got into a huge argument (that I started unintentionally) and we broke up.

Over the following few months, we didn't really talk but after I went back home for the holidays we met up and reconnected and started talking again. We were texting off and on and then became very regular and were constantly texting/skypying/calling etc. each other every day up until about a week and a half ago when I drunkenly started another argument and was for some reason really obsessive/acting very controlling over her which she obviously didn't like. 

Since this isn't the first time I have hurt her with this (i guess for lack of better term) trust issue, she told me she needed her space and I have obliged and have had zero contact with her for a week and a half now..

However, it is complicated because she is coming to London (where I am studying) in about two weeks to start a summer internship, and we had all these plans and things to do together once she got here. I love her, and what her back but don't want to force things and lose her forever. 

Have I waited long enough and should I try contacting her, especially since shell be here soon? Or should I just wait it out and see if she makes the first contact? 

tl;dr- Fucked up (again), now not talking to me. What do?

&lt;-- History Archives Accessed --&gt; &lt;-- East Commonwealth Field Report New York City Recon Mission - 08/10/2256 --&gt; The city is a hopeless cause. What remains of the buildings there are are losing a fight against nature with mutated plants growing at an exponential rate and feral animals running wild in the streets.

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

At this rate we won't have anyone willing to visit the doctor once old Peabody dies.

I told her father the girl needed to be married off by now, it's not natural for her to be unwed at her age and it only serves to encourage sin. Best course is to get rid of her ASAP, so young Peggy Carter can take her place and one day be Chief Medical Officer instead.

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Liam Hawke Ex Brotherhood Of Steel Knight Height: 6""2"" Weight: 96 kgs. Muscular body type. Eye: Bright Blue Hair: Black Gender: Male Sexuality: Straight Age: 26

Liam was with the California chapter of The Brotherhood Of Steel for a fair few years and he thought he would be with them for more. But after a load of changes by new leaders and rules that were being conservative and stupid Liam had enough. He had asked two of his best mates if they wanted to leave this place with him but they said no. So that left Liam on his lonesome out in the wasteland.

Liam was a a lot luckier than most people in the wasteland, having power armour and the best range of weapons and explosives. So he didn't really have any problems with any humans he encountered they would usually stray away from him when he had his armor on. Though he did have to kill a a lot of mutated creatures.

Liam spent all his time traveling across the U.S, going to the East Coast he decided. But after awhile he stopped and thought why the hell is he going there? He didn't really know. He stopped in abandoned buildings, remote settlements and semi destroyed cities when he needed rest or wanted a break.

After months of the same process he saw signs that he was approaching the state of New York. Liam smiled, he had always wanted to see New York.

-----------

Hello there people! This was the start of a story that I had going with someone else but due to personal reasons they had to leave but now I am looking for someone to revive it. I would play the role of Liam so I am looking for someone to be Scarlett. I want this to be a long term role play. Don't worry so much about the large wall of text if that worries you as i do want long detailed rps but normally do a paragraph or two/three per posting. This is obviously set in a post apocalyptic/ post nuclear world of the video game series Fallout. I would prefer to role play over platforms such as kik, yahoo msger, skype, google docs and google chat/hangouts. I can send the rest of the story or we can make our own start from after these two posts. If your interested send me a detailed message.

38i3pk,1,2015-06-04,I have 3 months of summer left and am struggling to come up with a workout plan,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/38i3pk/i_have_3_months_of_summer_left_and_am_struggling/,"Hi r/fitness! 

I'm a 20 year old college student. My height is 5'3 and weight is 138lbs. I used to work out during last semester at least 3 times a week but then stopped because I was frustrated as to how little it looked like I was losing. However, I want to get back on it and have convinced myself that it will take weeks/months to get the toned, athletic look. 

I just want to at least kick start my journey to fitness. I have a lot of time on my hand besides my internship, which ends early in the evening. 

My plan was that I start off 3 times a week, then next week 5 times a week, then twice a day 3 times a week with the other 2 days just once a day workout. The workout lasts 30 minutes. I was thinking of using the T25 workouts and going to the gym for a mix of cardio and strength training. However, I'm not sure how to start lifting. I have no clue where to start.

For diet, cut down on rice and toasts and for days to eat them, they'll be brown rice and whole wheat. I do feel slightly better these days when I don't eat too much grain but I don't feel any better if I have a low-carb (maybe more moderate). Eat a range of fruits and veggies, cut down on sugary foods and drink 3 liters of water a day (I already drink 2 per day but I'm trying to increase that)

Could you please offer some extra tips or ideas as to how I can exercise and plan it all out? Thank you in advance :)"

38i5v1,284,2015-06-04,Me [27/F] with my FMIL[45/F] after making me cancel my wedding last year is guilt tripping me into changing my wedding date again.,Mooieberry,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38i5v1/me_27f_with_my_fmil45f_after_making_me_cancel_my/,"Update here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38kq3h/update_me_27f_with_my_fmil45f_after_making_me/

-Backstory-
I met my fiance Mike 3 years ago and we've been engaged now for over a year and a half. After becoming engaged I started planning out wedding naturally and planned it for a year out to give us time for me to finish undergrad and well so all the planning a wedding takes. So after finding a venue and putting down a hefty deposit we set a date only to have my FMIL Kate to freak out! Freak out she did, she said we weren't ready to get married, too young, to broke, Mike wasn't done with school etc. etc. Then she threatened us to stop the wedding by kicking Mike off her insurance, taking back the car he was loaned and basically making out life a living hell. 

So after several arguments and discussing it with my family, we decided the best thing to do was cancel the wedding because we were not financially ready to tell Kate to fuck off and let us live our own life and make our own decisions. 

-Current Problem-
It took several months for me to become excited about planning another wedding after canceling my last, it was so humiliating to tell everyone I had cancelled it and expensive too! So now we've pick another date for June of 2016 and I've picked a venue and put down a deposit, also hired a photographer. Even before I picked a date I sent a nice to to Kate asking if their family had anything planned next summer I should avoid and received no response. So I went ahead and picked a date in June. NOW! Apparently Mike's little sister wants to go overseas for an internship and will be gone for our wedding. WTF! I asked Kate before I booked if there was anything I should avoid so this situation didn't come up. I feel horrible because Mike's little sister is a bridesmaid, I love her she's the sweetest and has a very close relationship to Mike. BUT, I can't lose another deposit and damn'it if I wasn't pissed that I should have to move my wedding AGAIN for Kate. 

Please help, I don't know what to say or do. Kate is blowing up my phone asking me to change my date and guilt tripping me. Should I change the date so the whole family can be there, or ask lil' sis to book another internship? So confused, could really use some advice.



   
**tl;dr**: Cancelled and move wedding once, now FMIL is asking me to do it again but I don't want to."

I have been working as an engineering intern for the past three summers. Every summer I am taxed as if I was self employed. Someone mentioned that I might be able to write some things off because of this but I have very little experience in this. I was hoping someone could give me some advice.

For example, for my job I work with a lot of 3d modeling (using programs like SolidWorks). If I bought a laptop so that I could work on the modeling at home (it's a pretty demanding program, my current computer struggles with it), would that be tax deductible? 

In general, I'd like some advice on if I can write off things, and if so, what kind of things can be written off. Please forgive me if these are dumb questions."
38iavo,4,2015-06-04,Dependent Mom Still Controlling,throwaway03011211,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/38iavo/dependent_mom_still_controlling/,"TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education.

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. He is currently paying child support (and seeing his kid frequently), and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, bought her a TV for Mothers day, etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

38ib22,19,2015-06-04,[AMA Series] Church of the Nazarene,Salivific,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/38ib22/ama_series_church_of_the_nazarene/,"Hey everyone, /u/Salivific and /u/jape2116 here. Welcome to the Church of the Nazarene Denominational AMA! We're here to answer any questions you might have about our denomination, as well as provide a background for and explanation of what the CotN believes.

We'll give general explanations of beliefs, history, and polity all in this main post, but other than that, ask away!


--

---

* Beliefs

Nazarenes have an agreed-upon [creed](http://nazarene.org/beliefs) (though we don't call it such) and sixteen [Articles of Faith](http://nazarene.org/articles-faith). These and more can be found in our [Manual](http://nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2013-17.pdf). Nazarenes are a product of the holiness movement in America, and are staunchly Wesleyan-Arminian in theology. Doctrinally, we're probably closest to Free Methodists or Wesleyans (go figure). Nazarenes are by-and-by-large more conservative than not. That isn't to say that there aren't any liberals or moderates, but they are certainly not the majority. We affirm the Creeds from the first four great ecumenical councils. The CotN has been sending missionaries around the world since our founding, and we have roughly two million members today because of this.

--

* History

The CotN comes out of the American Holiness Movement, specifically the strain of the holiness movement that sought to reform ethical practices after conversion and held camp meetings (like, actually in the woods under a tent). We still do camp meetings, but they're usually indoors now. They're still quite often out in the boonies, though. 

The CotN is a product of mergers, and today contains sixteen denominations as a result of their continuation. The original CotN was founded in 1895 in Los Angeles. This denomination merged with the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America in 1907, becoming the Pentecostal CotN. This in turn merged with the Holiness Church of Christ in 1908 at Pilot Point, Texas. This is considered the official founding of the modern denomination.

--

* Polity

The CotN is a hybrid of episcopacy and congregationalism: As an international denomination, the world is first divided into six regions, each covering approximately a whole continent. Each region is split further into districts (see [the USA/Canada region](http://usacanadaregion.org/find-a-district) map for a visualization). Each district has mission areas that cover smaller areas (e.g. the Nashville South mission area on the MidSouth District). Local congregations are members of the district they are located in, but operate with relative freedom and impunity. Each local congregation has a board which helps to govern on church business, and often several subcommittees as needed.

Once a year, each district calls all clergy available (as well as lay delegates) to come to a district-level assembly where district business is done, reports given, etc. This assembly is presided over by the District Superintendent (think bishops). And once every four years, each region calls representatives from all of its respective districts (the District Superintendents in particular) to a General Assembly. The assembly is presided over by the General Superintendent for that region (think archbishops).

The General Superintendents meet to discuss the issues facing their respective regions, as well as church governance on a board. At the same time, though, each local church is given a great deal of operational freedom. Hence, hybrid.

---

* Panelist Bios

/u/Salivific - I am a fourth-generation, cradle Nazarene. My father is an ordained elder, and I myself am a district-licensed minister. However, as I'm still enrolled in undergrad at Trevecca Nazarene University, I'm not a pastor yet. I am currently in an internship at a local church for the summer. I am probably a liberal by Nazarene standards (which would probably make me a right-leaning moderate if I were in the UMC). I'm also a lover of church history, though I'm not exactly extremely well-versed in it.

/u/jape2116 - I have been a Nazarene for about a year and a half now. I was baptized Presbyterian, Grew up Lutheran, sang in a Catholic church, and attended a non denominational church for awhile. When looking for a new church my wife and I attended a Nazarene church and immediately felt at home. There is something about they way the church evangelized. They brought not only the community they were housed in together, but also worked closely with other churches. I then moved churches and became the worship leader at my current church. I just finished my first year of graduate work at Mount Vernon Nazarene University working towards a Master of Ministry degree. To be honest, I don't know where I fit into the the greater denomination as far as being liberal or conservative, I don't bother too much with those things. I constantly google the Nazarene church because I am still getting a feel for the culture. This denomination seems to be all about who you know and everyone knows everyone. So if I had to sit down and think about it, I'm probably more liberal.

Our budget is probably a maximum of €500 ish. We just need a double bed, kitchen/kitchenette and a shower really. Could anyone recommend a good site preferably with English too? And is there anything else I should know about moving to France or Lyon itself?

I am very interested in game development, and have a pretty solid grounding in both Java and C++. I definitely want to take one of these 2 courses, since they seem more unique than courses offered in other universities. 

Currently, I am leaning towards the Games course, since it seems like something I would enjoy more; however, I can't help but worry that it would be harder to get non-game jobs and internships. Also, should I ever decide to transfer to another university, which only offers a regular CS course, would it hurt my chances?

If anyone can provide some advice that would be fantastic. Thanks a lot! "

38ij0o,27,2015-06-04,CMV: A person with visible facial piercings or body mods will likely be viewed as less professional and turned down in favor of equally (or even less) qualified individuals.,AtomikRadio,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/38ij0o/cmv_a_person_with_visible_facial_piercings_or/,"I would really like to believe this isn't the case, but I feel it is. I love facial piercings. Nothing extreme, just an eyebrow piercing or a labret or, at the most extreme, snake bites. Throughout my life I've had these, I've had a scaffold/industrial piercing, and I've had my ears stretched to a 4g. (So, not big ""discs"" or anything but large enough that people noticed.) Everything (except the lobes) were one at a time, I never had more than one type of ""abnormal"" piercing at a given time in my life. 

I always removed my piercings and let them close before returning to my school or job or what have you. For a while I worked as a pizza driver with the labret, but after removing it found my tips improved. I think many people think piercings and similar stylistic modifications are phases teenagers go through and not appropriate for adults.

I'm about to enter my last year of undergrad and move on to a Masters program with an internship component and I feel I cannot return to having a piercing (let alone multiple ones) beyond normal lobe piercings without being taken less seriously, seen as less professional, and possibly being passed over for positions and opportunities.

TBH I'm about to turn 28 but still have this, like, inner-goth side that is constantly yearning to get a piercing or two and rock some black hair dye again, but I feel I can't because I feel I'm *supposed* to be beyond that and I'm ""too old for that stuff.""

I would love it if someone could change my view. You are more than welcome to address tattoos in your response as well, though I am mostly referring to piercings and possibly dyed hair that is clearly not a natural hair color for the individual.

(I am a female, if that is relevant. I know some people view piercings on different sexes differently.) 

Edited to add: I see many people mentioning it depends on the profession. I realize this and I'd thought just mentioning the Masters program would make it clear I'm not going to work at a tattoo parlor. lol But fair statements. I will be working in the healthcare field as a direct provider to patients, but not as a physician. There is also a high chance of working in research/academia after the internship phase.

Furthermore, I'll clarify here that is is the intent of this CMV to find out if there are areas of the country where this is not the case. I am from a small farm town in Utah, I was hoping this reaction to piercings was a local thing, and so this CMV is an attempt to find out if it is true all over the country. Alas it sounds like my view won't be changed, due to being correct. :( But *please* change it if you can. I really want to be wrong!

38ikad,0,2015-06-04,Had the best orgasm of my life last night. I'm a fucking failure and I'm afraid it's going to kill me.,nofapthrowaway21932,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/38ikad/had_the_best_orgasm_of_my_life_last_night_im_a/,"Two weeks ago I posted about my medical condition: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/360m4k/please_help_save_my_life/

The counter is wrong. I actually relapsed three times during this time. 

The second time it happened (after a 3 time binge), I had the worst headache of my life the next night. I thought my brain was going to explode. I begged any force in the universe to save me- said I'd do anything to live. In the end I stayed up til 3 and collapsed exhausted after taking some Motrin. 

I don't know how the hell I forgot about that night. But the fact that I couldn't change myself after that fucking galls me. I can't even stop masturbating to save my life. 

Last night I relapsed after edging for six days. I thought I could handle it. It turns out I just ended up discovering a new way to masturbate that creates even MORE pleasure than before. I resolved to never edge again. 

Yet this morning I relapsed AGAIN. Even after last night's headache wrecked me, and even after the previous headache threatened to kill me.

I'm really starting to doubt that I can save myself. During the longest streak I had- about 4 weeks ago, total of 1 week- I think my headaches started diminishing at the end of the streak. But I don't remember and I'm scared I have some other problem like a tumor or some shit, or that I'm past the breaking point and it's already over.

I hate playing the waiting game. I’m in a fairly high pressure internship right now and after I relapse, I can barely work. I just have 0 motivation and the headaches distract me from doing anything. I’m always waiting to hit that point where they start diminishing but I haven’t made it to a week for an entire month. 

I keep thinking about my life and how much it's gone to shit over the past few years. I'm just starting to finally believe that I can't put it back together again. 

I just want to give up and die. I don't know how I can keep going on. I want my life to begin, but living with this everyday pain is just too much.

38ilef,60,2015-06-04,How many of your friends know about your big secret?,bdp_thrwaway,bigdickproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/38ilef/how_many_of_your_friends_know_about_your_big/,"I’m actually a pretty shy guy and don’t strut my stuff at all, always showering in swimming trunks and such. I’m 27, and I’ve only had sex with four girls. However, despite my attempts to keep my size under wraps, it seems that many of my friends found about it through various events - some run-of-the-mill, and others quite bizarre! Here’s some:

———

1. My first gf and I were virgins, and we had a rough start doing it without hurting her (I’m about 8” and 5.5” around). It took time for us to find the right groove - but when we did, she grew to really like it. She later told me she consulted with her close friends (some of whom are my friends as well) about our troubles and triumphs. 

2. After my first gf, I was out of town visiting a friend for a week, and his gf introduced one of her friends to me. We hit it off quickly, and she soon invited me home with the mutual knowledge that it would be a fling. When we took our clothes off, she was absolutely floored. I was her biggest by far, and she later marveled that I was bigger flaccid (around 5.5) than some of her previous lovers. I took things slowly, and our first night was a success. She said she did not think she could orgasm from deep penetration, and lamented she might not be satisfied by other guys any more. She really got hooked on it the next few nights, and surmised “most girls would go crazy about it if they knew…”. My friend later told me he heard about my “big secret”, and said she went on a long rave about me to some of his friends.

3. My friends (3 guys including me and 2 girls) were hanging out, and one girl asked about our sizes as a part of a game. The first guy said 6, I said 7.5 (which is my nbp length), and the third guy said 8 (which he has stated many times prior). After our responses, she told the other girl, “See! I told you all the guys measure it!” Now comes the BIZARRE part! A year later, my friend (the 6” guy) had a long-distance gf visiting, and they invited me to hang out with them. The night started out innocently, but started taking risqué turns. Eventually, they asked me about a 3some, and I said yes! Soon, when the girl took my pants off, she was shocked by what she saw -she said it must be 10 inches! When I said no, she decided she had to measure it! She measured it from the side, at an angle, really pushing it in, and declared, “okay, maybe it’s 8.5… 9!”. She also measured my friend, and what he claimed was 6” was actually about 4.5”… She started to fuck him, but would only suck me, saying that it would probably destroy her. We were good sports about the ordeal, and the night ended well.

4. My current gf got thrilled at seeing my penis, and gave me repeated compliments, saying that it’s the perfect size (she’s had one larger, but said it hurt too much). She also decided to save some pictures of it on her phone. A friend later borrowed the phone, and started snooping around, eventually finding the pictures! My gf’s denials didn’t work, and now two of her friends know what my penis looks like…

———

So like it or not, many of my friends now know the secret - how does it compare with your experiences? Do you try to keep it a secret? Also, I had exactly one girl approach me for my size, but our date fizzled way before we had sex.

———

**EDIT: More detail in response to requests**

Both of my relationships have been long term (4+ years) - and greatly helped in developing my skills. I was quite clueless at the start, and my first gf really showed me the ropes on how to please her and how to use what I have. It took a lot of time and practice before there was pleasure without much pain.

Afterwards, I didn’t think much about my size until I was with my second girl (the girl from the 1-week trip on my post). Getting such a positive reaction from her was incredible, and it really boosted my confidence for a while.

Before my current gf, I also had a very short-term relationship while I was away on a summer internship. She was cute with a great body and I normally would have thought she was way out of my league (I’m 5’6” so many girls have rejected me for height alone). However, I was on a confidence high, and I made many advances. After showing lukewarm interest, she finally agreed to a date after getting rejected by a guy that she was chasing. 

On the date, she vented a lot about the dude that rejected her, and didn’t seem too interested in my stories. However, she did show physical interest, and was more than ready to go after some alcohol. When the clothes came off, her eyes got wide and she said that my dick was really big.The sex was fantastic, and she came many times, saying things like “oh god, I’m coming again! It’s so big I love it!” She got hooked, and we had a primarily sexual relationship until my internship ended. While this was many years ago, she does hit me up from time to time when she’s in town to see if I’m free.

Meanwhile, the 3some experience was definitely the most bizarre. I was (somewhat) hoping that I was smaller so that things could have been less awkward. I do wonder whether the girl would have fucked me if the my stark disparity with her bf wasn’t there.

38ipmm,0,2015-06-04,Does going to an interview mean I should be mostly committed to the job?,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38ipmm/does_going_to_an_interview_mean_i_should_be/,"I currently work a $9.75/hour retail job working about 25 hours a week that I just started a month ago. It's not really not too bad but I don't like it. They seem to like and trust me a lot but dealing with the company's annoying sales goals, working alone 90% of the time, and having to call security on unattended children on the daily is getting taxing. 

I'm in 2nd year of college for Computer Information Systems and I have been unsuccessful as of late with trying to find an internship. However I actually landed an interview for a paid $9/hour IT intern position at one of the best companies in the city. Obviously I'm excited.

However I'm still weary. I don't know how long the position is for, what the hours are like, and really anything else aside from the title ""IT Internship"" and that it seems like I'm under qualified. Also I was going to save for a car but if I get this job most of my money will go toward the train to get there.

My question is do I have to go into this interview with the full committed mindset that I will take it if they offer it to me? Also any other thoughts on my decision?"
38irrl,2,2015-06-04,Long Hair Internship Help?!,DTraindom,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/38irrl/long_hair_internship_help/,"Hi everyone. I'm new to this forum and I was hoping that you guys could help me in this time-sensitive situation I am in. 
 
I'm going to be a senior in college majoring in mechanical engineering and as you all might know, internships are encouraged for the eventual job hunt after graduation. 
 
I got into an industrial engineering internship at a Fortune 500 company with damn good pay ($18 hourly) but it's not totally relevant to my major. It involves a lot of logistics which I am sure I can turn into a positive for future interviews. 
 
The issue is my long hair. My internship, which is for 11 or so weeks, has guidelines which require me to cut my long hair. It took me years to grow it to the length I like. Given that a very poorly done trimming (in which I lost hair that will take several months to a year to grow back) made me pretty sad, I think that cutting my hair even more will probably hurt my psyche. I'm already wincing on the inside just thinking that I have to cut it. 
 
I know some of you might think that I'm being a pussy because I'm so attached to my hair, but really, I feel it's the same as asking a woman to cut her hair, which can be devastating, I believe. So please, I'd appreciate sensitive advice. 
 
Anyway, I had to leave work and come back with a decision tonight or tomorrow. My boss was pretty nice about it. He knows the sacrifice behind the long hair and told me it is my decision. But I don't know what to do.
 
Oh and before I put up my questions, I wanted to make a note on my hair. It's not scraggly, greasy, or bad-looking. I've gotten compliments on it by girls. A girl has asked me how I keep it like I do. It is presentable hair. 
 
Here are my questions:
 
Is this gonna be the deal for the rest of my engineering career? Can I never have long hair in the industry?
 
If I get one to no internships, will I be able to find a job as a mechanical engineer somewhere? Or am I gonna be screwing my self over by not taking this one internship?
 
Any advice will be greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Just for reference, it's taken me two to three years to grow it to this length. It will take me that long to grow it back. 

EDIT 2: I cut my hair. I might get it back to its original length in a year or so. If it keeps proving to be such a sticking point despite accumulated experience, I guess it''ll be cut again. 

Thanks for the replies, everyone. Much appreciated.

Yesterday he just asked me to do him a favor and fix his computer, and he would compensate me with weed. Last year,  I said yes and fixed his computer.

Just want some opinions from others on my thoughts and reasoning. 

Background Information:
We started dating when I was a senior in high school and she was a freshman in college. Things started out great and we really fell in love with each other. I was writing her poems and songs and all that crazy romantic stuff that happens. Of course that only lasted a year or so when the honeymoon stage ended. I really wish she still inspired me like she used to.


We moved in together after about a year and a half of dating. Everything was still great. We both go to the same school, enjoyed spending practically all of our time together etc. 


Things died down slowly but we always remained very stable and did not spend much time with other people. We are very much best friends. I had some trust issues until about a year ago but was able to overcome them. We fight about as much as any couple would, mainly over petty things. 


Why I feel like I should end things:


I think we got way too serious when we were both very young. My parents did the same exact thing (its scary how much my relationship mirrors theirs) and it did not end well. They stayed together for the kids and now are unhappy. 


We are at the point in our lives where other people are age are getting married and I know she wants that but  I don't see myself marrying her anymore. Our personalities don't seem as compatible as they once did, and I am having to decide if some of her traits bother me enough to be ""deal breakers"". Our relationship has also turned into more of a ""roomates"" kind of things. We are content, but not happy.


I am extremely self motivated. I enjoy learning and trying new things. I play 4 or 5 different instruments. I generally put my best foot forward on most things. She is the kind of person who is ok with doing ok (nothing wrong with that, but being the way I am I generally try and push her a bit), is more closed to new experiences (food, places, sex etc), and has few life goals. 


I am also very close to my parents. I enjoy having dinner over there, talking with them, etc. Its one of the main reasons I chose to stay in my hometown for college (her being another main reason as well). I guess I just know they wont be around forever. She does not like this too much. she is not very close with her family. I love for her to go with me over there to eat and what not but most of the time she would rather not. My parents love her and she knows this, but even after all this time she is not very comfortable being there. We go over to her parents house every now and then, its usually in and out, most of the time she tells me to just stay in the car. Her parents like me and they think I am a good man and know I treat her well. I enjoy talking with them and seeing them, but I know her childhood was the not the same one I had, so I understand her reasons for not being as close with them.


Our sex life is not ideal to me. I have a high sex drive while her's is pretty much nonexistent now, although it was fine the first year and a half or so. There may be an underlying cause for that such as depression but we have talked about it a lot (I feel bad about bringing it up but it is just so demoralizing to have to beg your girlfriend for something that seems so natural and that you want so bad) and she says she just does not want or enjoy sex that much. Maybe I am not doing something right, who knows. I go down on her all the time with no want for reciprocation (which she does maybe once every 3-4 months), just because I enjoy doing it and making her feel good. I would love to do it a few times a week, but am lucky if it happens a few times a month. 


I am also away for the summer for an internship and am exploring the new city with my new friends, trying new things, and generally trying to enjoy my time here. The distance between us has been hard. I have had doubts for the past year or so, and our time apart has really amplified them. Maybe its just the newness of it all, but it gives me a feeling like I am being held back, like there is so much more out there. I hate to be cliche but I guess I fall into the ""wanting to find myself"" category and want new experiences.


On the other hand:

she is my best friend and the one person who knows everything about me. She is kind and caring. She is smart and full of potential but I feel like her inner drive wont lead to any realization of that. I would say we have an extremely strong bond even if it does not show as much anymore. A very companionnate love. When we first started dating I did not really think she was extremely pretty or anything (frankly I was not very attracted to her), but she grew on me and turned into a very beautiful girl. We get along very well. We communicate a lot, express our concerns, but in the end it always comes down to us saying things will get better and we both are going to try harder and do more but nothing ever really changes. I am especially bad about saying I will change but never do. Its like our relationship is stuck in quicksand and we start working on things, but they never really take and it sucks us back down.


My mind is telling me to end it, but my heart has this worried feeling. I'm scared I am just in a phase of wanting something new and exciting and one day I will realize she was the right one all along. I guess I can never know for sure.


While blame lies on both our shoulders, mine feel pretty heavy. I think maybe if I caught things earlier I could have fixed it, but at this point its getting so hard for me to try. I feel like a lot of our problems have to do with sex, and I feel bad about that. Its important to me, but so is she. What do you guys think? Is breaking up the right decision?


**tl;dr**: 4 year relationship. Still love her. Always will. Bad sex life, some bad traits but some good ones. Want to find myself, try new things, experience more of life in general. Do I end it or try one last time?"

38jbbr,27,2015-06-04,Me [25/F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 2.5 years. Should I stay even though he's broke?,anxiousaboutfuture22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38jbbr/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_25_years_should/,"That title is a much much harsher version of my question, and in no way am I attempting to reduce my boyfriend to just his bank account. I was hoping it would draw people in.

My BF (Trent) and I have been together for two and a half years. We started out really hot and heavy and have been practically inseparable ever since. We have had our issues, but our foundation is really strong and we share core values and have discussed building a life together.

The issue is Trent's lack of income. I come from a different part of the country (USA) have been established in my career in our current state for 4 years. I had some initial family connections that got my foot in the door of my first company, and I was able to make a lateral move with a pay increase last year on my own. Trent is from here, but does not have any real connections, through his family or otherwise. He was a varsity football player in high school and college, so his summers were dedicated to that and he was not able to build a resume of internships. 

He has had odd jobs here and there, but has not found a real career yet. Many of his promising opportunities fall through. Our entire relationship has occurred while he has not had a steady job. I completely understand how difficult the job market is, and I have been understanding and supportive and have had no issue paying for most of what we do together. It is hard, but completely manageable, so far. He spends a lot of time at my apartment, but officially lives at home with his parents and younger brother (still in High school). Basically, we are very serious about each other and I know he would do the same for me, so I am more than happy to support him in his time of need. 

My issue is that I'm worried about how long that time of need might end up being, and I'm nervous about committing to him in a more concrete way (we've talked about getting married and moving in together officially) because of his lack of income/career opportunities. Obviously because of his lack of savings and his lack of income, we are only able to talk hypothetically about the future we want at this point, and we are still young! (both 25) so I know there's no rush, but I'm still nervous. 

He has gaps in his resume, no specific industry, and is not completely qualified for any job with previous experience required. His wonderful qualities, smarts, quick learning, and charm don't even make it past the front door when up against resumes more stacked than his :( I love him so so much and would love to settle down with him and have kids when the time is right, but when will that time be?

I am anxious that I would end up being the sole provider for our family. I am in an industry that has solid pay, but I probably won't ever make six figures unless I change industries or get more schooling to take on a different role. Where we live, that would make it very difficult to give our children the life we want for them. 

I also have a medical condition that will make it harder for me to conceive, so I would hate to miss out on having children if it takes him another 5-7 years to start helping me build a solid foundation for a marriage/family. 

I am a realist and am painfully aware of how much housing and having children costs, not to mention a wedding (even if it's small and done on a very tight budget). I can't do it all alone, and I'm wondering how much time I should give him before it becomes clear that he won't be able to be an equal partner in everything. I do NOT expect him to take care of me. I am happy to be the primary breadwinner, just not the sole breadwinner. 

I help him with job applications when asked, but do not push or pressure him in any way. I have hesitated to bring this up in the past because I'm terrified of him feeling emasculated or attacked. I know he is working on it, and sends out hundreds of applications without hearing back. He is looking into getting a specialized degree (IT or a real estate license), but that takes even more time. I would hate to be cruel and give up on him despite his efforts, but at the same time, I am not sure how many years I can support him and put off planning a future. 

Help? What can/should I do? 

**tl;dr**: BF of 2.5 years doesn't have savings/career to help him build a future with me. I am scared of what a future would look like with me as the only provider. What can/should I do?

38jju5,1,2015-06-04,"Jeff Brady and the Trenchcoat Guy, Part 8: The Re-Growth",[deleted],tardtales,https://www.reddit.com/r/tardtales/comments/38jju5/jeff_brady_and_the_trenchcoat_guy_part_8_the/,"&gt;be Lilly, 21. A friend from college who's visiting me. The main character of the story.

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and we were going to go to Peoria, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. If anything notable happens this summer (since guys' nights are usually when we're out), I'll definitely report back and tell you all what's been going on.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in Central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."
38jls4,9,2015-06-04,Today has been hard,HawliBear,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/38jls4/today_has_been_hard/,"I'm doing an internship at *Patheos* right now. It's been lovely.

But my mother keeps asking when they're going to let me write something, and I can't tell her I've already been published on there twice. I can't tell her that many readers like my writing. I can't tell her that my career may be beginning.

I want to be open with her. I want to share this with her, but she won't be able to be proud of me. To her, I'll forever be a lost sheep. As I read *Undivided*, a book about a mother and daughter and their relationship after the daughter converts to Islam, it validates all my fears. The mother brings up repeatedly how she wishes her daughter would return to the fold; she wishes her daughter would just love Jesus.

I want to tell her, but I don't want to destroy her. I don't want to prove all her fears right. I don't want to be the child she's ashamed of, but I""m angry that it would come to that. I'm a good child, some would go so far as to say I'm a good person. I'm intelligent, I've supported myself through college. I've made good choices.

I'm not bad.

But that's all she'd see. If I tell her, I'll just be the lost child. I'll be the prodigal daughter that she hopes comes home. She'll take my lack of faith personally. She'll take my move away from Christianity as a personal failure: both hers and mine. It'll prove to her that I've become immoral, despite the truth related to my morality.

So today has been hard. Today I want to be honest. Today I want to promote my blog, today I want to share my writing. Today I want to be honest, but I can't tell if now is the time. I don't know if there will ever be a time that's right."

I am researching computer related jobs, but every result I get is asking for either a Bachelors or Masters degree which I don't have and 'x' years of experience, which I don't have at the moment and some of the other qualifications are higher than the experience I already have.

38js1n,1,2015-06-04,Renege an offer... How do I do this?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38js1n/renege_an_offer_how_do_i_do_this/,"I have accepted an offer after my internship from last summer, and since then I realized I really don't want to move away from home. I have an offer with my dream company here where I live, and although the offer isn't as good, I know it's where I want to work.

Now the question is, how do I tell the other company I can no longer work for them? I feel sick just thinking about it, and I know they put in a lot of effort and time into keeping my offer on the plate for a year. Is there any way I can put this to them lightly?"

I've been a gamer for all my life and regardless of living here i always buy my games and never pirate.
But recently i came across this gorgeous game called Elite: Dangerous. This game is a space simulator with amazing graphics and a very large space to explore. I've always wanted to play a space sim and now that i have an ok PC i thought i should try.
But unfortunately this game is soooo expensive here, it's really absurd. Well that's because the brazilian Real is worth 0,32 cents of a dollar right now :(
But the biggest problem for me is that i recently lost my internship because the company i worked at changed focus and didn't need interns no more, and now i'm having a tough time finding a job that doesn't get in the way of my college schedule.
But anyway, here's a video with gameplay, maybe you like it enough to buy it for yourself: https://youtu.be/6gkQH1xRlh0

38jucm,3,2015-06-04,"TIFU by leaving the country, making someone homeless and begging for a ride home",drinkingonthejob,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38jucm/tifu_by_leaving_the_country_making_someone/,"In response to a request from /u/weddle32 from a comment I made on another post a while ago

Like most, this did not happen today, but about 10 years ago. And sorry for the long winded-story. 

I was an intern in Washington, DC and one of my friends was an intern at the Canadian Embassy. They were having a meet and greet and he invited us to partake (fellow interns in DC always look out for each other when it comes to free happy hours). It was a Friday night and he reminded us to bring our passports, since you are technically going to that country's property when you're at their embassy. 

Anyways, we get in and I see my buddy behind the bar. Two options: Canadian beer or Glenmorangie 18 year old scotch. Guess which one I ordered. Apparently everyone had been asking for scotch and coke all night, so when I asked scotch on the rocks, he was not only relieved, but he filled the Solo cup nearly to the top with that delicious whisky (single malt out of a plastic cup? Poor form, Canada). I drank at least two of those, the two that I remember. That was my first fuck up, which led to several others. 

We left the embassy (were politely asked to leave) (it was the Canadian embassy, of course they asked politely) and head to a bar. One of my friends had the bright idea of letting me ride her bike around downtown DC. Black-out drunk. Thankfully I didn't die or kill anyone else, but the only reason I know I was on a bike was because someone took a picture of it. I don't remember the bar at all. 

We head to our friend's apartment in Georgetown (in a high rise building) where we played beer pong all semester long. Despite being obliterated, my roommate and I run the table. And we very loudly celebrate each cup made and each win. Someone knocks on the door and asks for the music to be turned down and the yelling to stop. Twice. At some point, we realize that the last Metro train will be leaving shortly. We high tail it out of there and barely make the train

The moment we get on the train, we both pass out. Thankfully we did not need to change lines. Just a long one hour or so ride out to Alexandria, VA. I wake up. The train has stopped and the doors are open. Something is wrong. There is no voice announcing the stop. There is no one on the train besides me. The smell of puke is pungent in the air. My second fuck up: I fell asleep and missed my stop. 

I look over at the seat where my roommate had been sleeping. He's gone and there is puke on the floor in front of his seat (this is his second time puking on the train after a long night of drinking btw). I walk out onto the platform. I am completely unfamiliar with this station because I've never been out this far. I wander around and find a worker and ask how I get back to my station. I can't. The trains are done for the night. She rudely points me in the direction of the cab stand and walks away. 

When I get to the cab stand, there are none there. I call for a cab, but no one is answering. I only have about $7 in my pocket anyways. I'm not sure which direction my neighborhood is in, how far of a walk it is and I'm still quite drunk. I'm starting to get very nervous. As I'm slowly starting to freak out, a newspaper delivery guy shows up in a station wagon. He must have seen the look on my face because when I went up to him to ask for help, he was immediately reassuring and helpful. My stop was only one station over and it was the next stop on his route. He offers to drive me home. I was extremely low on options so I say yes. 

I get into his station wagon and it is filthy. Garbage and newspapers everywhere. He is super nice and very talkative. He takes me right to my apartment building and refuses to take my $7 and wishes me well. I get into my room and my roommate is fast asleep. Bastard. 

When I wake up the next morning, we recap. My roommate puked on the train, and like we did the last time it happened, he got off the car we were on at the next stop, and got into the next metro car, not wanting to get blamed for puking or have to pay the fine for clean up. In his drunken state, he forgot to wake me up, or make sure I got off at our stop. He thought my story of how I got home was hilarious. Bastard. 

Time for the final fuck up. I called my buddy at Georgetown a day or two later to tell him about the funny story of the rest of our night. He wasn't surprised because he had news too: they got kicked out of the apartment complex. Like I said, we had partied and played beer pong there a lot that semester. That night was the last straw. They had to move out immediately. I apologize profusely. He is very easy going, says it wasn't our fault, there were plenty of other times that we weren't around and they had huge parties, this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. For about 5 years afterwards, every time I saw him, I apologized, and he just laughed it off, never held it against me for a second.

Tl;dr: went to Canada, got blackout drunk off scotch, partied too hard, got stranded, took a ride from a stranger and got my buddy kicked out of his apartment. Still feel kinda bad to this day

38jxz3,2,2015-06-04,My boyfriend [25M] can't meet my needs [22F] because of dyslexia?,whatevverrr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38jxz3/my_boyfriend_25m_cant_meet_my_needs_22f_because/,"We've been together a year now and come from very different backgrounds. He's Italian from Ferguson, Missouri and yells and gesticulates and accuses and ""says whatever is on his mind."" It's been an issue for me in the past but he says that's how he's been brought up to communicate. I come from an Asian family and prior relationships that have been quiet, understanding, and resolve conflict in a peaceful manner, as opposed to an explosive one. I don't know how to deal with him. He's tried very hard in the past to do things my way and I have to admit that he's made a lot of progress, but I'm uncomfortable with being yelled at when he slips up.



He also breaks promises all the time. We're apart now for the summer and he had previously promised an entire summer full of activities and trips for the both of us. I planned my family vacation and work for the summer around these plans that we made together, and then he took an internship that prevented all of our plans from happening. That's okay of course and I was happy for him, but the way he told me about it made me feel he'd simply forgotten about everything we'd planned together.



We got through that, and then because we're apart he promised to be home at 10:30 every night to Skype me. It's been 10 days since we've Skyped. He promises to text in the morning and the afternoon, and he doesn't. I'm lucky to hear from him at all until 4:00 pm and after that I'm lucky to exchange 10 texts with him. 



So I broke up with him Saturday (5 days ago). 



The problem is that I love him very much and I know that he loves me more than anyone has loved me before, he just can't show me in a way that I understand. He tells me all the time and when we're together he'll look at me in amazement and be genuine in saying, ""Wow, you're the most beautiful and smartest and kindest woman I've ever met, I'm so lucky to have you.""



I've tried to break up with him in the past, but he convinces me back into it because he says we love each other and that should be enough to want to work things out. Is it? Do you think so?



Now, in talking to him post-breakup (because he's promised to call and Skype to discuss and missed those promises too), I've discovered that he can't grasp the concept of time. He doesn't know how much time is passing or what time of day it is and he mixes numbers up so that he can't give me an accurate estimate of when he'll be available. He's also so incredibly busy at his job that he doesn't have a second to call. He's an artist, and he gets lost in his work and loses track of time ON TOP OF not being able to tell it in the first place. (He has both dyslexia and ADHD and can hardly read.)



Now my problem is that I don't know whether or not I should be sympathetic to this, seeing as I know I'll be able to find someone in the future who is not dyslexic and will meet my needs in the way I need them to be met. Obviously I am very young and I've only had one other long term relationship before, which was very different from this one. He tells me loving each other means that we have to work hard and, honestly, he's improving in every other area that I've asked him to: telling me when he's angry and has to take a moment to calm down, explaining his feelings, using ""I"" statements to avoid blaming me, etc.



I don't know if I should have to hold the hand of a 25 year old man and walk him through the basics of being in a relationship when I could leave him and be happy with someone else who doesn't have dyslexia and ADHD. While those things are the bulk of the issue, it's not only those things that are making him wrong for me. We also communicate in completely different ways and I hate how he yells and screams. But, like I said before, he's trying his best not to and he's doing a lot better. So I guess my question is whether or not I should give up on this. It's been almost a week and I know that either decision I make will be the right one in the end, but I don't know if I want to waste my time trying to change someone that can't change, even if we love each other.










**tl;dr**: My boyfriend has unchangeable traits (family background, dyslexia, ADHD) that keep him from being right for me, but he is trying with all his heart to change them. Should I let him try, or should I move on?

38jyif,7,2015-06-04,Is exodus the only way?,Enquivator,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/38jyif/is_exodus_the_only_way/,"Background: I am chinese. My parents were from Singapore, an island nation in South East Asia, emigrated to the US in 2000. I spent a great deal of my life in both countries and I hope this allows me to provide some insight and perspective into the differences between the asian and american culture. 

My family is predominantly christian although my parents were converts. My upbringing was fairly strict but not absurdly so. Major gripes growing up included a fixed curfew which is common to most teenagers of all races. Parents rarely praised or criticized me as is the standard in asian culture. They were interested in my grades but not to the point where they expected all As although I did ended up performing fairly well in my academic path due to my own convictions. Mom had several unsorted psychological issues and loved to play the victim and guilt trip and if the above failed, would fly into a mad rage and would threaten to commit suicide but in her defence, was also a decent provider. 
Dad was quite violent but not to the point of abuse and loved to throw stuff around, break furniture and was quite mean to me when I was young and often scolded me for trivial things. Who reprimands a 5 year old for breaking a cup? However, he has mellowed out later in his life. 

I got by my young days by ignoring them and their drama and even as an adult, I do maintain occasional contact but the bonds that were never formed can never exist.

Disclaimer: The following statements are just my general observations. Do not be offended if they appear to be unlike your situation because some of the statements I make are also contrary to my own experiences and are just what I observe to be the norm. 

Whilst hierarchy is prevalent in all cultures, in asian culture, it seems to be overly emphasized and used. 

It generally implied at many levels and contexts that a hierarchy exists. The limitations the hierarchy can have on one's freedom vary, with mild limitations being required to show simple respect to severe limitations being required to accede to every single request and to take verbal and physical abuse.

Personal experience: I had the rare opportunity to intern overseas in the same office as a general manager during one of my college semesters. The company was predominantly chinese and the female general manager was being verbally and mentally harassed by the managing director, by his lack of direction, ridiculously huge workload, incessant screaming, frequent overtime (8am-9pm) and the unfair pinning of blame. As an american chinese, I was shocked and asked her why it was neccessary for her to take all this abuse and to report this to HR. She declined and told me that their corporate HR existed only to serve administrative functions such as the processing of leave and recruitment. I was in huge disbelief at the vehement way the company chose to do things and at the general managers quiet resignation to her unfortunate fate. To a 3rd party like me, this was clearly bullying bordering on abuse but because of the strict 'hierarchy' my general manager did not dare to speak out or seek redress and her only avenue of relief was through complaining to me and the other interns to which we sympathetically complied. My general manager was probably one of the nicest person I have ever met whilst interning at the company.

It is easy to find fault with the people directly involved. Most sane americans would be condemning the managing director to hell and rightfully so. However from day to day observations and hours of recording minutes in top level meetings (yes they made us interns do that), I found out that the managing director's ideas, which were honestly quite good, frequently shot down by the CEO. Furthermore, during company events, the managing director brought along his family who were quite happy and well adjusted and he offered to pay the tab for all the interns. He was also extremely polite to us out of the office. So what could have caused such this person to have such conflicting personalities? Hierarchy. When out of the office, the managing director appeared to be a fairly cool guy but in the office, he became a demon once subjected to hierarchal pressure. 

To some of us in the west, it seems unfathomable that one would be able to switch 'faces' so easily. To us, we would accuse such a person of being underhand, sneaky and generally lacking sound morals. However this is because we denounce the notion of a strict overbearing hierarchy based on the society in which we were taught and grew up in. To us, anything that requires us to be two-faced is absurd and childish. Even in our corporate world, whilst 'politics' can cause people to backstab or bully, this is generally due to the desire to climb the corporate ladder or to victimize but not a result of complying to hierarchal norms.  For example, the boss might verbally abuse the worker because he is in a foul mood or is an asshole but generally the worker accepts that this is wrong behavior and does not need to take this 'bullshit' unless he needs the salary. Most provokation or disregard for rights would at the least elicit a negative response or even a decision to quit.

However, asians with a traditional mindset truly believe that they are to follow the hierarchal system. So adamant is their belief that it overrides their sense of logic and becomes ingrained into their personalities. They genuinely accept that it is ok or at least, cant be helped for someone higher up on the hierarchy to take liberties with them. This notion becomes almost religious-like if you will. This also translates into familial roles as well whereby parents expect their children to comply and similarly, these parents are to adhere to the wishes of the elderly without question. This is a result of a deepset tradition where boundaries are not clearly defined. I am sure that the concept of asian hierarchy was not developed to subjugate inferior people but rather to teach the importance of respect for seniors and to acknowledge that they have had more experience than you and hence, are able to guide you. However, nowadays, it seems as if some asians have neglected the true meaning of structured obeisance and used the hierarchal system as a tool to project their own deficiencies and insecurities onto people weaker than themselves.

What is the relevance of me telling all of you this? Most threads I have read on this subreddit seem to culminate in an exodus from their homes. From an outsiders point of view it seems like a disappointing thing to happen and especially so when it heavily affects this minority. I wish to help people who have cut ties find peace.

And after all of this, who get the blame? The parents for being demanding, overbearing to the point of abusive? Or the tradition aka 'asian heritage' that has caused all these inconceivable ways of doing things? 

My perspective is that there is no simple answer but rather because the american culture espouses ideals that run contrary to most conservative asian values. As such there is little common ground and young people growing up in america and saying the pledge of allegiance almost everyday would not be able to understand what their parents believe in and vice versa regardless of which is right. So if you have to go on your exodus to find freedom because you were oppressed or harmed at some point in your life, find peace by knowing that it was neither your fault nor your parents' fault that it happened and that at some point of your parents' lives, they too had suffered oppression but were unable to break out of its cycle because they were in less of a position to do so. Do not guilt trip (this is becoming an increasingly common word here) yourself or others. Things just did not work out.

Oh and if anyone wants to know what my personal stand is on this issue, lets just say that had I not come to America, I would probably not be writing this article now.

I've been to Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria with my family. I'm not interested in taking classes in a foreign language, but I am a poli sci major and I'd love to continue my studies abroad and/or possibly an internship. So far here are the countries I'm thinking and the pros/cons:

-London-
     Pros: English speaking, exciting city, close(?) proximity to Ireland and the coast, ability to visit other countries in europe, my uni offers programs and internship programs there, rich history
Cons: Conventional choice, not as close to other european countries, possible safety concerns, expensive living, not great food (apparently), not as exciting of a natural landscape

-New Zealand-
Pros: gorgeous landscape, lots of adventurous things to do, english speaking, my school offers programs there
cons: less exciting urban life, not much to do outside of the natural stuff, isolated from other countries, not sure about internship programs related to political science

-Greece-
pros: gorgeous, allows traveling to other european countries, school offers program there I think, rich history/sight seeing
cons: concerned about the quality of english classes, might not be the greatest country to learn about government, farther away from other european countries, safety concerns

-Switzerland-
pros: beautiful, close proximity to other european countries, great place to intern with poli sci related programs (if I can find one)
Cons: I've been there before, might get boring

-Australia 
pros: beautiful, great cities, lots to do, english
cons: SPIDERS and other scary shit, isolated, expensive, not sure about internship opportunities

-Mayyyybe Spain-
pros: beautiful, I've heard great things about it, location is prime
cons: not a great place for an internship, I'm kind of sick of learning about Spain from my past spanish classes

-Semester at sea-
pros: I'd be able to see multiple countries, wouldn't get bored with a country, reliable classes in english, interested classes offered, variety of activities and leadership opportunities 

cons: my school doesn't offer a program with it so It would be more expensive, cooped up on a boat, might look like a joke on my transcript (although it's with UVA so I don't know), safety concerns about traveling to India, africa, burma etc., I have a bf and I've heard the boat is a sex haven,

Feeling a little overwhelmed..",BinghamL,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38kanj/c_sql_server_internship_starting_in_a_few_weeks/,"I am ending my second year of programming in school in which I've spent most of my time using Java. I did take a quarter of C, so I'm at least familiar with it and it's concepts. This summer I have an internship using C# and SQL server. I will be using .Net also, which as far as I know is some medium where you are able to combine languages into a single application, yes? I've never used .Net before so I'm not sure what I should focus on reading about in that area.

Anyway, so far I don't know what my project will be in this internship, or what I will be doing specifically. So for now I'd just like to get the basics down. What are the biggest differences from Java to C#? For a lot of the C# code I've looked at I can understand it completely or very near completely, but when I read beginner's guides or the like there are a lot of things mentioned that I don't understand, and I would like to know which ones I should spend the most time on to be functional.

SQL Server seems to be pretty straight forward, but are there any challenges you've faced with it? I've only written one program that used SQL, and it was pretty easy to read up on to figure it out. From what I've read so far, SQL server doesn't look any different, but I'd hate to come in under prepared.

In summary, I have a good background/understanding with Java, and I've been exposed to C, and had minimal exposure to SQL (all of which were in a school setting). In a few weeks I have to have the best understanding possible (given the timeframe) in C#, SQL Server, and using .NET. What would you suggest I spend the most time on studying/reading/practicing?"
38kbgj,0,2015-06-04,"Somebody close to me has died, but I don't know who it is yet",pleasehelptimejump,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/38kbgj/somebody_close_to_me_has_died_but_i_dont_know_who/,"I have this problem that started when I was in the second grade. I don't really know how to describe it. I wouldn't call it ""time-travel"" per-se, but I don't know any other close explanation. 


The first time it happened to me I was sitting in class and the teacher (Mrs. Jacobs) was reading a story to us. I can't remember the story but right about half way through speaking Mrs. Jacobs suddenly skipped to the ending sentence of the story. I was confused, but nobody else seemed to be. She had skipped a good 10 pages of text but when I looked around everyone was sitting and patiently listening as if nothing had happened. I didn't think much about it then, maybe I was just confused. That night when I got home my mother told me that my grandma had passed away. 


Now I didn't put together this ""time-skipping"" experience with the death of my grandmother right then and actually kind of forgot about it.
Fast forward a couple years and I'm sitting on the sideline of my rec league soccer game. I wasn't the strongest player so my coach had taken me out of the game at about the first quarter (this was kid’s soccer so we played four quarters instead of two halves). Then bam it was the end of the game. I didn't know who won or lost because I didn't see any of the game, it was first quarter then it was final whistle. I didn't tell anyone and didn't ask anyone about the score because I didn't want people to think I wasn't watching the game. Walking back to the car my mother got a call on her phone (it was 2006 so yes, cellphones existed). The call was about my Uncle, he had died in a car crash on the way to lunch during work. 


This is when I started to put together my weird time skipping with the deaths of people close to me. The only two people I have ever known to die had died during this time skip. I was spooked, but too spooked to tell someone. I didn't want to get in trouble for this.


Nothing happened until just this year during my freshman year of college. I'm up late studying for midterms and suddenly 3 hours have passed. It was about 4 in the morning so I didn't want to call my parents to check if things were okay. It would surely be suspicious if I called and someone happened to be dead right then. So I waited, I tried to sleep but I just ended up tossing and turning all night. Finally at about 7:30 AM the call came in. My mother had woken up to the sound of a gunshot. My neighbor had killed herself. My neighbor was my best friend, we grew up together, went to the same schools, dated for a bit at the end of high school but broke up when I left for high school and she stayed home (she didn't get into any colleges). I still cared for her and this one hit me the most. I try not to blame myself for her death but I don't understand.


I have always wondered that maybe I am killing these people during these times. Maybe my soul leaves my body to go end these lives. Each person that has died has been wanting death. My grandma was slowly dying, with bad Alzheimer’s and nothing left. My Uncle had just been laid off and left by his wife. My neighbor believed she had no future or life ahead of her. Maybe I’m being sent to do the deeds for these people so they don’t have to?


After months of grieving I am back home from college and I have a summer internship, each day at work I come onto reddit nosleep looking for someone who has a similar problem to me. I haven’t found anyone yet but I have seen that people here are getting help. So please, if there is anyone out there that knows how to help me I need it.


I haven’t received any calls yet but I know it’s coming."

38kebr,18,2015-06-04,Parent Plus Student Loan unable to make payments,studentloandesperate,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/38kebr/parent_plus_student_loan_unable_to_make_payments/,"First and foremost, this is a throwaway, mostly because I'm embarassed about this situation entirely and hate talking about it in general. Secondly, I appreciate **any** and **all** advice given regardless of how hard it may be to hear.

**TL;DR - Went to a private university in Florida and accrued a substantial amount of Student Loan Debt (roughly $30k in my name and $150k in my mother's). I have paid my loans down considerably; however, my mother who works retail for around $7.50 an hour cannot afford the payments and I cannot afford to help. Have consulted a lawyer and got a friendly ""you're f@#ked"" in reply.**

Now before I begin, I want to state that I don't consider myself to be a ""bad person"". At the time I was accepted to the university I was, I was so excited and naive that student loans seemed to be something I could pay off easily with a job in the future. After my 5 years in school (did a three semester internship), I was left with roughly $30,000 in student loan debt while my mother had taken out Federal PLUS loans in the amount of nearly $150,000. After graduating, I was lucky enough to immediately land a job that paid pretty well and I started paying back my loans as aggressively as possible as well as trying to help my mother with her's. Very quickly, I realized I was unable to sustain bills on my own by helping her with her loans and we put the loans into deferrment/forebearance and they have been in that state pretty much since.

For the last two years, I have been losing sleep and getting sick over the large looming black cloud that hangs over my mother's head. I did some research and Parent PLUS loans fall into a very particular category of loans that is not fortuitous for those who take them out and end up not being able to afford the payments. From my understanding:

* Parent PLUS loans **cannot** be discharged even in bankrupty (with the exception of a hardship bankruptcy that is nearly impossible to get)
* Parent PLUS loans cannot be put into the repayment plans of Income-driven options (i.e. Income Based Repayment, Income Contingent Repayment, or Pay as You Earn)

I truly don't want to rob tax payers or ""steal"" my education. Initial talks with the lender a few years ago basically stated there was nothing they could do past the extended repayment plan (which now would equal about $1200 per month). After speaking with friends and family, I was referred to a lawyer who specialized in student loans to some degree. He basically stated there was nothing he could do as they couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy and that all the lender would be able to do from now on would be to garnish my mother's wages and retain any tax refunds she receives.

I'm hoping someone here has either run into this situation before, knows a lawyer who perhaps can help, or knows of a miraculous solution that won't put anyone in jail or on the streets. Either way, I appreciate you reading and providing any input. Also, it just feels good to get it out there.

I'm willing to answer any questions I can in order to get the best advice possible, but I'll list some I think you may have below:

* **How much debt is there on the PLUS loan exactly?** Currently sits at $174,623.30. It's divided between a private lender ($130,714.50) and the Department of Education ($43,908.80)
* **How much does your mother make?** She has worked retail all of her life (no secondary education) and only makes $7.50/hour right now and roughly a yearly gross income of $14,000
* **Where are you located?** My mother and I are both in the US living in Georgia at the moment. We lived in Maryland while I was at school and my school was in Florida.
* **Have you made any payments?** Yes, back in 2011 I made three months of payments when they were around $900 per month. I was unable to keep up with them so we put them in deferrment and now the monthly payment would be nearly $2000 per month
* **Have you researched your available repayment options?** Yes, Graduated Plan - $1401/month, Extended Standard - $1419/month, Extended Graduated - $1240/month, Income Sensitive - $1145/month (all of which neither she nor I can afford)
* **Do you know how much forebearance/deferrment you have left?** No, but I'm willing to ask the lender if that helps. Currently, we're scheduled to start making payments again on 15 August 2015."

I'd rather hear some tips and tricks, unless there aren't any.

I have an informal lunch interview with the guy who'll be my boss (if I get the internship) tomorrow and I'm kind of worried. I'm perfectly good at making conversation with random people in informal situations (usually with jokes and funny observations), but I'm completely out of my element in formal or semi-formal settings since even self-deprecating jokes can be inappropriate or damaging.

The internship is IT-related; it's basically systems integration, hardware and software troubleshooting, and creating software packages, which are all things I know how to do. However, I'm a chemical engineering major with not much of an IT background. I recently started learning HTML and CSS, and am relatively proficient in all the high-student-base languages such as MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple. I'm going to try to leverage this internship for a co-op opportunity in the Fall, and I think this may be my last shot at an internship.

Other than that, I don't really know what to talk about. I would feel awkward asking him about his family, recreational pursuits, or dreams, since he's in his 50's or 60's and seems like it wouldn't be organic to the conversation.

I think most of my anxiety stems from the fact that out of the fifteen or so chains of interviews I've given in the past year, only two of them didn't suck. And out of those two, one of those resulted in an internship offer and the other resulted in this interview.

**TL;DR:** Coffee interview tomorrow. I'm awkward. Plz help."

tl;dr: Cancelled and moved wedding once, now FMIL is asking me to do it again but I don't want to

This morning I fought with Mike about how I believed his mother was doing everything in her power to stop us from getting married. Of course he was hurt to hear this but he agreed that his mother had been pretty shady about not informing us about his sister's internship next summer. He also informed me that he fought with his mother last night and that he informed her that he wasn't going to make me move my wedding date again. 

A few hours later Kate sent me a text saying that flying lil' sister home was a stupid idea and to keep the date as is and they will work around it. So that was a nice to hear but my feelings are still hurt and I feel that Mike needs to talk to his mother and REALLY back me up. 

Mike and I are skyping with lil' sis as she's overseas now and are going to explain to her that weddings are planned far out and that she will need to pick another internship that will go around our weeding, her choice. 

Thank you all for your insight and advice, I feel like if this marriage is going to work Mike is gonna have to tell his mom to butt out and stop trying to control our lives as well as stand by me. I fear this will not be the last power struggle but at least this one is over....for now.


   
Edit: Lil Sis hasn't even picked a new internship for next summer...or applied or anything, she had just wanted to go for the same time period (beginning of summer?). She also told me that I should have consulted her before booking my wedding....I had no idea I had to ask everyone if a certain date was okay with them before booking my wedding. I thought that you pick a date and those than can, will make room for your special day. 

Half of you say to tell them to fuck off, the other half are calling me selfish for picking a date and not changing it....again. Guess you can never make everyone happy."

My commute is about 45-60mins each way, per day, in a less-than-conveniant transportation set up by my employer.
To make my life easier while I'm here, I have been looking to buy a cheap car that would run for that 1 year and preferably also be sold before I leave for some pocket change.
Now for the main reason for this thread: A coworker told me the other day that she and her husband are trying to sell one of their cars, a 1992 BMW 325i. They are the original owners of the cars and have mostly used it for commuting to and from work. I took a look at it today and it seems to be in pretty good condition. The engine seemed to work fine (although it needed to get a jump since it hadnt been started in over a year), the interior wasnt in too bad shape, the outside was fine except for the small patch of rust near the left signal light on the back end. However, the back doors won't open for some reason and the signal/hazard lights and power windows dont work. They have a specified BMW garage that they have been using exclusively for all their maintenance but the car has almost 300.000 miles on it.
They want $1.500 for it, how reasonable is that price? Should I be expecting high maintenance costs throughout the year if I buy it? Any other good suggestioms for buying a used car (in South Carolina)?"

He graduated a while before me and recently started working at the company he interned the previous summer. When we first started dating, he was honest with me about a crush he had for a girl he met during the internship. And he swear that he was over it at the end of the summer last year. He said that it sucked that once he expressed interests in her, she just tuned him out and it sucked. But whatever, we all had a life before so it didn't really bother me at all. That girl is due to start working fulltime at his office this fall(pretty small startup, so they'll have plenty of interactions at work I'm sure).

A month after we started dating (long distance), he told me he was going to have dinner with his intern mentor from last summer and another previous female intern, which didn't bother me at all either -- he was new to the city and I was glad he could hang out with his friends. After that dinner, I started to wonder and asked if this was the same girl he had a crush on. And he said yes. I was a little upset that he didn't bother to tell me. But still, he's over it and they'll be co-workers. Plus I totally trust that he's not the type to cheat. So I got over that pretty quickly too.

A couple weeks ago, I moved out here and is staying at his place temporarily. He gave me access to his desktop so I can play games on it. While he was at work, I was opened a browser to launch facebook and mindlessly clicked on the facebook search bar. Turns out he's still logged into his facebook and this girl's name is right on top of his ""previously searched"" list. It made me a bit uneasy to see that, so I checked his facebook search history. Turns out, he searches this girl's name quiet regularly. Before we started dating (while we were flirting on fb chat and all that), he would search for my name and her name almost daily. After we started dating, the search frequency for both of our names died down for a bit. But in the recent two month, he would search for this ex-crush's name sometime 5 times a day, some time 3 times a week. But he stopped searching for my name in the meantime. This re-surfaced search pattern bugged the hell out of me and I messaged him right after I saw it. He was weirded out and didn't think he would search it all that much. He apologized and tried his best to make everything right and prove it to me that he really doesn't have feelings for this girl, including voluntarily delete her from his facebook. Open up his message log to prove that he has not talked to her since March and didn't actually try to start conversations with her at all. During this whole thing, he didn't try to turn the event on me and blame me for breaching his trust or privacy at all. But he did feel a little hurt that I don't trust him or think he had lingering feelings for someone else. He didn't think he did anything wrong by searching her on facebook that frequently. And he defines ""emotional cheating"" as something you have to act on, whereas I think he lied by omission, just like what he did the first time by not telling me he had dinner with his ex-crush.

So now a couple weeks has passed, and he's still super affectionate and we have a lot of good times together. But I'm just having a hard time getting over this. He pretty much give me an open door policy to his phone and computer. And he promise to tell me all the future non-work related contact he has with this girl. And promise he won't hang out with her alone etc etc. Aside from this, he has never given me a reason not to trust him. But I just have trouble knowing that, in a couple month, he'll be working in close proximity with a girl he pretty much stalked for a year on facebook.

Reddit, I'm crazy or over-jealous? Did he really not do anything wrong?

I'm a goodie two shoes kind of guy, I don't really go crazy or anything. I mean, I go out on the weekends, but for God's sake I'm working a software internship. But I have a hidden love of trap, I don't know why, but the heavy bass line keeps me on task for hours at a time.

Unfortunately I've gone through my normal plays lists pretty fast as I'm listening to music 5+ hours a day.

So, if you could just post long, long play lists of trap, I'd appreciate it. I don't need the highest quality banger big house edm rave shit, as long as it's in general trap and it's not awful I'll listen to it. 

Particularly calming or smooth, deep trap. But anything works. I only want SoundCloud because it kills my battery the least.

Also, if you're an aspiring trap artist, just link to your account and I'll go through your stuff.

Thanks so much!"
38lmqo,2,2015-06-04,"I will be graduating with a mechanical engineering degree in about three months and i have a couple of things that are really bothering me regarding my degree and potential career choices, can someone please clarify?",wiltuz007,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/38lmqo/i_will_be_graduating_with_a_mechanical/,"This is going to be long winded so please be patient with me. I can't seem to recall a lot of the stuff I've learnt over the course of the last 4 years. I can remember the rudimentary concepts of the subjects I've learnt, but the more advanced concepts are kind of a haze, i can remember that i did it but I don't think i will be able to solve it if I was given the same problem right now. I mean, I took Controls in the Fall/Winter semester and i don't remember anything substantial other than the basics and some intermediate concepts. Is this true for most of you here? cause i feel like im kind of an imposter of sorts.

This brings me to the next question, I have been very interested in designing/building stuff (as i expect most of us here are), so statics and dynamics were right up my alley. However I had little to no interest in Thermodynamics/fluids (ill go so far as to say that I resented studying fluids). I passed those courses, with decent grades but it feels like the only reason I studied them was not out of curiosity/interest but I did it anyways since it was a course requirement. I am an avid reader and I love sci-fi, and you know sometimes after you watch a really good sci-fi movie/read a good book you tend to reflect on the how things function in that universe even if its just a story. It feels like whenever I come across stuff like that and read up on these concepts(such as thermodynamics) I'm much more interested in knowing more about it as I read through it, compared to when i learn the same concepts and eventually forgot them when I took it as a course. Do any of you have the same experience or were you naturally curious about everything you learnt from your courses? Me not being interested in the subject matter consequently meant that I didn't put much effort/ work as i probably should have.

I did a 1 year internship at a big oil and gas company and I learnt a lot on the job and i found that people were helpful whenever i had questions and highly appreciative of the work I did. While I am grateful for the experience (and and much needed money haha) I felt that it stopped becoming a potential career and turned in a 8-5 job that I showed eight months down the road. I felt like a drone working there and while I am not bothered by repetitive tasks/work, the job just became mundane once I stopped learning anything new from it. I was not really satisfied(and happy) with my work, every engineer i worked with had the same ""oh you are doing an excellent job"" whenever I asked them for any positive criticism. I feel that working at a large company isnt exactly for me right now, and Id be much happier working at a small company since i think it will help me be well rounded( and I get to see how a company actually works and not just the engineering aspect of it). Right now I think i value experience over pay, and I feel that I can risk it now when im young(i just turned 22) and have little to no responsibilities. Now with oil and gas not exactly booming(and since Im in Alberta, Canada where Oil and Gas is the major industry), should i apply for small companies(where I think Ill be more happy and productive)or should i take up just any job i come across given the market right now? Im sure there are more people who were in the same situation as me, and I was hoping that someone could give me advice based on their experiences. I am hoping that my one year internship and my experience with school's solar car team will help me out.

*phew* thanks for reading!"
38ltoy,0,2015-06-04,Kind of disappointed by internship,newwavebossanova77,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/38ltoy/kind_of_disappointed_by_internship/,"Rising senior CompE student here.  I just started my first engineering internship and I am little disappointed with the work they do here.  Basically I work for a moderately large aerospace company and my particular branch/location focuses on launch operations (i.e. the actual launching of rockets).  They put me in basically what is the IT group and my primary job is to document their current systems as there is no current documentation.

I'm rather disappointed because I am finding that no actual design engineering happens here.  For the record, I had no idea what my specific job would be until 2 weeks before I started.  I guess I can't expect much from my first internship but I really wanted to design something; you know, actually use something I learned in school and apply it to real world problems.  Anyone else have a disappointing internship?"
38lvm4,3,2015-06-04,I need to talk about my sexual assault - the prospect of getting tested for STIs is bringing everything back and I need to deal with my guilt,testedthrowaway1,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/38lvm4/i_need_to_talk_about_my_sexual_assault_the/,"I just wanted to talk about my sexual assault somewhere, because I'm finally realizing it wasn't my fault, and that even though he didn't have sex with me, it was still assault and that my feelings about it are justified. I know this is a huge wall of text, but part of the humiliation for me is my relationship with him and another guy involved, so I wanted to write it out.


Over a year ago, I lived in a college internship house with about a dozen other people. I'll call two of them X and Y. One of the first days we were all there, we partied and drank a lot. X started dancing with me and trying to kiss me. I was drunk, happy to be where I was, and thought, why not? so I kissed him back. Neither of us mentioned it after that, and I understood it to be a one time thing, a drunk kiss that didn't mean anything, and our lives went forward. I wasn't interested in X and he never made a move at me. 

Fast forward two months, and I started dating his roommate, Y. We went on a few dates over a few weeks, and decided to call it of because we were incompatible. During that time, Y and I fooled around a bit, enough for me to stop him and tell him that I was a virgin and hadn't done much before. At one point, he put his hand down my pants and rubbed my clit a bit, but that was it. Even after we had called it off, I had feelings for him for a while later. 

Fast forward another month, and we're all getting ready to move out. We partied and drank again, and some of us hung out in the backyard. Eventually as people began to go in, it became just me and X. I was drunk, but not terribly so. At one point I high fived X for something, and he grabbed my hand and forced me into his lap, and held me there. At this point I was scared and knew what he wanted, but was intimidated and confused enough (drunk, remember) that I didn't try to get away. X was huge, a ~300 lb football player, and I'm quite petite, if that puts it in perspective. X started bringing up how we had kissed a while back, and asked what had happened between me and Y. I told him, and X ranted on about how much he hated Y (lots of reasons, they were very different people). He said Y had told him and their other roommate that I was a virgin, and X teased me for it. I was embarrassed and angry, but still didn't leave. Then X demanded to know why I never dated *him*, and I bluntly told him I didn't want to and wasn't interested. His tone was accusatory, even though he had never made a move! 

Still on his lap, he started kissing me, and I was so confused by it all that I kissed him back. For some reason in my drunk state it felt rude to not reciprocate. When he started moving down to my pants, I protested. He persisted and kept talking the whole time, about my virginity, about why I should let him continue, until I gave up saying no. I stopped kissing him and stopped participating entirely, but he continued to escalate things until he was fingering me, rubbing his penis against my crotch, and clothes had come off, all while periodically I had been saying no and being shut down. Eventually I became so uncomfortable that I managed to get off of him, despite protests that he wouldn't come on me or I was giving him blue balls. 

I went back inside, with him right behind me. To my embarrassment, Y was sitting just inside and saw both of us. I tried to laugh off the obvious situation Y had found us in, because I still had feelings for him, and left the room. X closed the door behind me and immediately told Y all about how I had jumped on him, kissed him, etc.  X even invented dialogue that I had said as I ""seduced"" him. I stood behind the door with tears in my eyes - I still liked Y, and here X was using me as a tool, a conquest, to one-up him because he didn't like Y and felt entitled to my body because I had let him kiss me months before. 

*****
I felt guilty about this for almost a year after, because I had kissed him back at first, and I hadn't kicked and screamed and fought back. Because of my guilt, I never reported him. 

I have a gyno appointment tomorrow and I'm realizing that I should get checked for STIs from X (I've never been sexually active before or since), and the prospect of talking about it and facing it in any way is making all these feelings come back. I keep thinking, it's just not fair, because X got to take advantage of me and brag to his roommate about it, and never considered that I was a human being, that I had my own life outside of gratifying him, and meanwhile I get to live with feeling disgusting and humiliated a year and a half later- I can still hardly talk to Y, because I'm angry that he told so many people about my lack of sexual history, and I'm embarrassed because he thinks I threw myself at X when it couldn't be more false. And because X had a Kentucky accent, I still can't hear those accents without feeling uncomfortable. It's stupid, but the little things won't leave me alone. X's name is also really common, so I hear it everywhere.

If anyone read it all, thanks. I know it was a lot to get through. I just needed to get it out there before I bring up my need to get tested tomorrow. I'm scared and if anyone has any words of comfort or advice, I'd appreciate it. Thanks."

38ma8u,3,2015-06-04,Coworker Situation,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/38ma8u/coworker_situation/,"Cringy and long, but caught the dreaded feels so I needed to type this out whether it gets read or not.

So I share a cubicle with an astonishingly attractive girl (9.2/10 face and body) who is now only here for 4 more months as an intern and we quickly developed some simply unreal chemistry (potentially on a level I haven't felt before which is why I got kinda neurotic).

After 2 months of heavy flirting, we hooked up after a night out with coworkers and friends. (Made out/danced for 2 hours at the club, continued at my place. Tried to escalate by taking her pants off, got some resistance but eventually got em off but she kept closing her legs etc. At this point we are both drunk and exhausted so I say fuck it and went to take a piss and come back and we pass out with her head on my shoulder.

She leaves way early before I get up (says she was sweaty) and I get the ""thanks for the great night :)"" text.  Thought I was in for 4 months of plate fun and work shenanigans.

Try to make dinner plans (yeah..I know, been wanting to try this place for a while though, this was a good excuse) that night but she's busy. We decided the next day was cool.
Texted her early here and there and kept getting the hour later reply deal. Told her I made reservations for 2 at 7:30. Around 5:30, said ""getting hungry"". And she replied ""kind of..."". A couple back and forth 20 min in between texts. Asked if she wanted to postpone cause I get the whole not reply right away thing, but we're trying to make fucking plans here. ""I'm coming""

Her body language was way off when we met up, dinner was OK, didn't try to kiss her at the end of the night (probably huge mistake), she didn't want to come back to my place (logistics were certainly in line). 

Next day at work wanted to clear the air.told her to meet me outside the office. Said let's be clear with each other since we work together. Kissed her, ""you're a beautiful girl, etc"" ...Told her I'd really like to spend time and explore the city while she's in town. ""it seemed like you didn't want to go to dinner, what's up?"" ""do you want to stay colleagues and nothing more?"" 
She says ""friends is cool...what do you think?"" Then I proceeded probably spout my mouth too much and don't even really remember what I said. Went back to the office.

Got busy at work, didn't really pay much attention to her for 2 days (headphones in, facing a bit away from her). She says ""Did I say something wrong?"" ""Why are you ignoring me?"" I was actually busy but certainly wasn't initiating convo and flirting like normal. ""Nah just busy""

Ended up talking again in private and I said ""No I'm not mad or ignoring you, Just been busy and not exactly sure what happened between Friday(the club) and Sunday(Dinner). She said she was hungover. I said you clearly didn't want to go. She said I imagined it. 

I said I still don't get it, let's go back to work. I was basically thinking fuck it, next girl, this is a huge distraction and she's leaving in 4 months, but I really enjoyed our chemistry (haven't felt it on that level before) so it was fucking tough to ignore this girl that I can see out of the corner of my eye for 40 hours a week.

Things kind of went back to normal. Got flirty again...At one point she was sucking on a lollipop and comes over and puts it in my mouth, rubs the back of my head when she leaves the cubicle a couple times

Today found out some dude bought her flowers (they were under her desk). Pretty confident she went out to lunch with him (put on perfume right before leaving the office for an hour and a half - same perfume I told her I could smell in my bed for 2 days and she knows I fucking love). Not happy about this.

The rest of the day I was pretty dialed in..headphones in etc, pretty much ignoring her besides work related issues. Avoided eye contact a couple times (probably super obvious). She left for work and rubbed my damn head again (god I love that).

I'm really not that bummed about the other dude in principal, it's the fact that I was honestly looking forward to spending a lot of time with her while she's here - and I think she's been going around town with this dude.

I am still very attracted to her, and pretty much any time I talk to her she's super receptive.
Do I need to clear the air again - be super up-front, tell her I know she's seeing some other guy but I don't give a fuck and to come out with me as well/instead? Just ask her out again? Remain stoic and professional (not my default state)? Go back to normal flirtatiousness, but not bring up us hooking up again and see where it goes?



TLDR: hooked up with coworker (cubicle mate), got mixed signals (probably gave them myself as well), might have inadvertently friendzoned myself, found out she might be fucking some other guy, still getting signals...best way to play out the next 3 months to avoid toxic work environment and maintain mental sanity).

38mj7t,9,2015-06-05,Weird reaction at work,vickevlar,Trichsters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/comments/38mj7t/weird_reaction_at_work/,"This might just be venting a bit. A small ""incident"" at work as left me feeling very weird, and while normally I'm pretty open with boyfriend about my thoughts and feelings about my trich, in this case I see him going into an unhelpful overprotective mode. 


I've had trich for about 14 years, and I had been managing it to a level I was satisfied with for a while until I started a year-long internship last July. It was stressful, emotionally draining, and just generally not right for me for ages, although it has cooled down lately since I'm so close to being done. My pulling at work has not cooled down, though. It's been totally out of hand this whole time. It stinks that it affects the way my hair looks, but what I really hate is picking something off the ground and realizing how much hair accumulates around me. You don't notice from above because the carpet is dark. I always try to scoop up as much as I can and throw it away in a tissue (or several). I'm also always needing to brush it off my desk into the trash. Fortunately, I am sequestered away in a corner cubicle, working by myself, and rarely have anyone even walking by to see me pull or to see hair everywhere.


The other day, though, I came in to the office later in the afternoon because I had a technical issue with my computer, and when I arrived, there was a big balled up wad of my hair sitting next to my computer, like someone had scooped up a bunch from the floor and left it for me on my desk. It was so bizarre that I didn't even know how to react to it; I just threw it out and pretended nothing had happened. But I can't stop thinking about it now.

 
Usually people find other people's hair pretty gross, so who would actually scrape their hands on the floor for someone else's hair and ball it up? Then not throwing it away and leaving it on my desk, the only reason that makes sense to me is to embarrass or shame the person, which isn't cool but the thing that sticks in my mind is just how odd it is. Despite my hatred of my internship, I know everyone in the office &amp; they're pretty nice and friendly, and since I'm just a temporary intern working on my own thing I don't even really ""work"" with any of them except my supervisor in any meaningful way; all our interactions are for the sake of being social and it's cordial. The only candidates I can think of are maybe if an IT person had to crawl under my desk to plug in something, found hair and for some reason decided to try to make me feel bad, though the computer problem I was having really shouldn't have needed anyone to do that, or if a cleaning person got tired of my shit, although I sometimes stay late enough to see them and have never seen them do anything other than empty the trash bins. The only other possibility is that it's someone who is usually friendly to me.


So it was creepy and weird. Over the years, my feelings about the disorder have bounced around a bit, but usually it's about how I want myself to look. This is the first time where ""avoiding other people's reactions"" have really factored in. Just another reason why I can't wait to get out of here. Thanks for listening. "

'Just Fred,' the man responds.

The officer is in a good mood and thinks he might just give the biker a
break and, write him out a warning instead of a ticket. The officer then
presses him for the last name.

The man tells him that he used to have a last name but lost it. The
officer thinks that he has a nut case on his hands but plays along with it. 'Tell
me, Fred, how did you lose your last name?'

The biker replies, 'It's a long story, so stay with me.' I was born Fred
Dingaling. I know -- a funny last name. The kids used to tease me all
the time, so I stayed to myself, studied hard and got good grades. When I got
older, I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college,
medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was
Fred Dingaling, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I
decided to go back to school.. Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through
school, got my degree, so then I was Fred Dingaling, MD, DDS. Got bored
doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she
gave me VD, so now I was Fred Dingaling, MD, DDS, with VD. Well, the ADA
found out about the VD, so they took away my DDS. Then I was Fred Dingaling,
MD, with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA taking away my DDS because
of the VD, so they took away my MD leaving me as Fred Dingaling with VD.
Then the VD took away my Dingaling, so now I am Just Fred.'"
38my8j,0,2015-06-05,Differences between CS 61A and CS 61AS,ignoculture,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/38my8j/differences_between_cs_61a_and_cs_61as/,"There are not a lot of resources about the comparison of CS 61A and CS 61AS. For starters, there is a very precious source:

https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a.html
Quoting from there, written by Brian Harvey:

""61A: New curriculum, everyone works at the same pace, four units, combines lecture/lab/discussion, uses Python.

61AS: Best CS book ever written, everyone works at own pace (can be spread over two semesters, or can add a fifth unit of advanced topics), 2-5 units per semester, mostly lab, uses Scheme.

If you can't stay disciplined about doing the work without a fixed schedule imposed, take 61A.""

So now, this fall 2015, 61A is offered by John DeNero and 61AS is given by Paul Hilfinger. I know both are great, legendary professors.

I opened this thread specifically to compare your experiences. There are a lot of resources to compare 61A curriculum to 61AS, and they are so minimal that Brian Harvey summed it up with three sentences there. I don't think Python/Scheme thing will matter that much since the idea is to learn programming and one can learn a language in free times.

(Just to make a context: I have almost six years of programming experience, internships in IT companies and AP CS 5 credit) 

So what will the difference between 61A and 61AS in terms of difficulty, time consumption, materials learned, usefulness? According to schedulebuilder grade distribution CS 61A seems to have a better grade distribution. Apparently, neither of the classes has a curve (correct me please)."
38n0fb,0,2015-06-05,Is C++ 11 a good bet to get in Google's undergrad software engineering internship?,NLKNguyen,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38n0fb/is_c_11_a_good_bet_to_get_in_googles_undergrad/,"**Note**: This is not a question about what language is the only one I need to know. It's more about what language the interviewers like to see.



I plan to apply to [this](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&amp;jid=59615001&amp;) next time, and I'm considering which language (C++, Java, Python) to focus on. I'm not worrying about solving coding interview questions. What I concerns about is what language the recruiters like to see, and whether or not focusing on C++ 11 will actually work against me. 


This [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433484728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&amp;pebp=1433484731526&amp;perid=1W0SSSQ3QKC79NY08SGN) book written by ex-google interviewer strongly suggest that Java is ""the best"" option partly because everyone can understand and because you need to do a bit of manual work to show your understanding. 


On the other hand, this [quora post](http://www.quora.com/Do-interviewers-frown-at-potential-hires-when-they-use-Ruby-or-Python-to-solve-an-interview-question-instead-of-C-C++-Java)'s answers from some interviewers at big companies saying their preference toward scripting languages because the code to solve problems will be shorter and easier.


I like C++ 11. I think it's cool, and the new language features make a lot of coding shorter than Java (at least for usual coding interview question), and I want to show my interest and understanding of C++ beyond the scope of school teaching. However, not everyone is familiar with C++ 11, and they may question my sanity of why I don't use something simpler and more productive like they say, for example Python.


I'm a project-driven learner, and working on different programming languages is not an issue for me. I actually enjoy learning different languages and technologies. But I want to get in Google's undergrad internship. So, should I not focus on C++ to get a higher chance to get in? 


P.S.: I intended to contribute to an open source project that uses C and Lua, but those languages are not listed in the preferred languages of Google's internship. With my limited time before they recruit again, I want to do something more relevant. Should I do it, or maybe building some Android app or Django web app will make my resume looks better? What do you think?"

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and we were going to go to Peoria, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. If anything notable happens this summer (since guys' nights are usually when we're out), I'll definitely report back and tell you all what's been going on.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in Central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."

Everything was going well between us until I left for an internship abroad. We used to be very close with each other and we were sharing everything. We were spending every day together and I really loved him, we were having the same friends and we were never bored. Since I moved things between us changed. He was very defending and every time we had an argument he would find a way to hurt me. Although he is visiting quite often, in our anniversary he did not come, something that hurt me a lot. In my birthday he booked tickets but he missed the flight, when I was trying to discuss with him, he was accusing me that I do not understand how hard it is now that I have left. In the past every time I asked for help in anything, he was always there for me, now I asked him to help me find a job after my internship and he is not helpful at all. I was trying to understand why he was so distant and to find if  hurt him somehow, but apart from the distance, I never changed my behavior towards him.  For months we are discussing the same problems all over again and we are not able to change anything or to solve them. I do not know what to do, sometimes I do not even want him to come and I am thinking how I should react  when I see him. I stopped trusting him that much and I am keeping things from him.I do not see him with the same way anymore. I used to adore him and admire him, now sometimes I feel sorry for him because he is not trying enough to achieve his goals. I do not understand how can a person who always was sweet and kind, to become so arrogant and negative. He told me many times that it is a mistake that I left and that I hurt him with this decision. He is my first relationship so I have never faced a breakup before.All of my friends here who had a bf have already broke up and they advice me to do the same, but I never cheated neither did him and nothing extreme ever happened between us so how can I be sure if I should end this relationship or not?

38ntrj,2,2015-06-05,TIFU by sending a voice recording to my ex-girlfriend,jbarnes222,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38ntrj/tifu_by_sending_a_voice_recording_to_my/,"

I was at a concert last night with a bunch of my friends. We pregamed before at my buddies apartment which is a 10 minute walk from the concert venue, so convenient. Anyways, we get to the concert before the headlining band is performing. We have no interest in the opening indie acts, its a free concert anyways. We all have to piss so we head over to the portapotties. Of course the lines are absolutely ridiculous, we end up standing there waiting for 45 minutes in total.

A bit about my ex-girlfriend. We dated for less than a year during my senior year of high school. This dating occurred about 3 years ago. The breakup was about as rough as it gets without becoming violent. Hooking up with friends, having make-up sex, getting into verbal fights at parties, playing the ""I'm over it"" game etc etc etc. I could count the amount of times that we have spoken to eachother since then on one hand, and these times were brief.

Anyways, while we are waiting there in the potty line, after getting separated from a few of our friends as so often happens at concerts, my ex-girlfriend comes stumbling along. 

We immediately make eye contact, I smile to be friendly and she covers her mouth with her hand and while looking at me says something to the person she is with. I raise my eyebrow at her and she saunters over, opening her arms for a hug. I go for it, and she grabs/scoops my ass with her hands during the quite short hug. I back away and get a little pissed that she did that, but I don't outwardly show it. She starts talking about some shit, honestly I don't really remember most of what she was saying but she was flirting with me pretty hard. Then she starts talking to my friend about how she was looking up peoples bank accounts at her new job because she has access to that(she got an internship at M&amp;T bank) and she didn't know it was illegal and thinks its hilarious. Then she starts saying she could look up my information, but says she didn't and laughs. I laugh, give her a smirk and say you could try, but I don't use M&amp;T bank. That kind of blows her mind for a minute that not everyone uses M&amp;T bank. She keeps talking to my friends acting as if they are best buds, and then out of the blue starts critiquing my body language. She says why are you so mad, you are clenching your jaw. I did not realize I was clenching my jaw, I do it out of habit. I ask her why she isn't with her friends, and she says she got lost. I say she should go find them and she tells me I should take a chill pill. A Waiting in line for 45 minutes to take a piss in a heavily used portapotty is shitty enough, let alone having to deal with an ex while in line. 

Anyways, she insists on cutting us to use the bathrooms before us. As she leaves, walking through our group, she whispers in my ear ""I hope that girl is for John*(my friend) and not you"". I don't know how to take what she says, my friend asks and I tell him and he gets pretty pissed off. It is his girlfriend and he kind of takes it as an insult. I think he does because my ex-girlfriend had called and left me voicemails before calling girls I was with ugly and shit like that after she had seen pictures, and my friend John had been there to hear them. So to him he takes what she said something along the lines of, ""That girl is not good enough for you, but she is good enough for your friend""

Thank the lord she disappears for the night.

Fast-forward the concert ends. We go back to my friends apartment and hang for a while. All of us leave except John and his girlfriend because its his apartment.

We get back to my friends house, and its 3 of us guys and 1 girl. My one friend goes to sleep and us others are just talking about life and having really awesome conversations that seem to only happen late at night for some reason.

Its 2am when I get a text, and whaddya know its my ex girlfriend. She's apologizing for her behavior(nice!) and I wait because I know there will be more. Whenever she has done this in the past, theres usually a slew of messages. Then comes the, ""I miss you"". I have no intention of responding, I don't want to go down this road.

My friends obviously ask who is texting me, I tell them. We start talking about the concert. Then we are just talking about my ex-girlfriend and I, our rough breakup, and such. 

I look down, and I see that I have sent my ex-girlfriend a fucking voice recording. I recorded a portion of our conversation while we were talking about her, and I was saying how embarrassed I was of all the shit that went down.

I had no intention of responding and I fucking recorded the worst conversation of all on accident and sent it to her.

I immediately texted her ""that was completely unintentional""

Then my friends made me realize that makes me look like I meant to send that on purpose.

TL:DR I accidentally sent my ex-girlfriend a voice recording of a portion of a conversation I was having about her.

At the end of my intership I should make roughly 7000+/- before going back to school. I want to start my own software development company, possibly game development. Should I take this money and throw it at an LLC and get the tax exempt status for buying the required tech to start developing my own independent software?

38oc6z,58,2015-06-05,Are these three anon posters to /r/accounting the same person? Let's find out!,greatbawlsofire,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/38oc6z/are_these_three_anon_posters_to_raccounting_the/,"So yesterday we had an instant classic with the post [Fraternization with a Manager](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/38l0q2/fraternization_with_manager/), by /u/internbig4. 

Earlier in the week were also graced by anon posts ""[sharing personal info with coworkers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/38jex6/sharing_personal_info_with_coworkers/)"", and ""[how do you feel working with a gay person? Big 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/38izea/how_do_you_feel_working_with_a_gay_person_big_4/)"" by authors /u/shoulditellall and /u/isgayok, respectively. 

All of these posts appear to be from an intern who is going into big 4 with more secrets than Dolly Parton keeps in her hair. /r/Accounting is this the same person with all these same throwaways? Is this one enormous troll giving themselves a pat on the back? Is this Chipman_69 from the [going concern forums](http://www.goingconcern.com)? Who knows?! Chances are, it's a coincidence (or a troll), but maybe, just maybe, there's a gay intern boning their manager and wondering if they should share it with the office. 

But if it's just a coincidence, do we have a glut of interns without common sense and a lack of self confidence coming in? Either way, these posts the last few days have been like daytime TV drama for my audit team in the field, so thanks for posting!

Edit: Apparently I missed the ""[Does race matter in Big 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/38dynw/does_race_matter_in_the_big_4/)"" thread as well by /u/doesracematter 

At this point, it's getting a little bit over the top with these throwaways coming in with the /u/ being closely topical with the post subject. Still to early to call! "

38oitx,4,2015-06-05,TIFU by arriving late at work.. again.,atheisthotdog,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38oitx/tifu_by_arriving_late_at_work_again/,"Little background story:
I'm a lazy person by nature and I always have overslept classes in school.
I think I had overcome this this year (school year) since I was working almost 24/7 on my final school project that would Grant me an internship if I did something better than the average joe.
Since september I struggled to come up with a 3D game made on unity, I did my presentation on April, they loved it and gave me this internship.
I'm in a really big name company where I live, it's not about programming but it's a really good opportunity.

Skipping to the present: 
My work here has been easier than what I had to do in my school to come up with a 3D game, I was averaging 3-4 hours of sleep EVERY DAY. 
I also didn't have ANY vacations, after my presentation I got immediatly contacted to start working next monday (it was friday when I got it). 

When I noticed the niceness of people and the easy time I'd have here my mind kinda decided to play tricks on me.
Basicly now I'm oversleeping my two allarms by hours. I wake up at 11~12 am and I should start working at 9 am (I take roughly 2 hours getting to work). 
I started out by making excuses to my supervisor saying that I was taking this pill that really makes me sleepy, that excuse kinda weared out itself.
So today, I overslept again, for the third time this week. I arrived and it was a little different than other times. (Usually my supervisor greets me asks what happened, I answer with silly excuse and I start working, averaging the 6 hours a day [which is the standard time i'd do anyway])
When I got here noone was near my desk (my supervisor sits next to me along with 3 other co-workers), so I thought, nice, I can sneak in, turn on computer and pretend I'm here for a while.

I did that, and while I was opening my briefcase I hear some voices on the other side of office, they were all having a meet.
Hm... so I guess they saw me coming in, this is really bad since I really have no excuse on why I'm coming late.

My supervisor leaves the meet and sits at his desk, asks me what happened and I said : ""I'm late, I'm sorry."" He kept looking at me like: ""is that it?"" and I stood there saying nothing, working. ""He then standed up, went to pick some water for himself, and stopped right in front of me with that motion of :""oh, I wanted to tell you..."" and says : ""We gotta talk Atheisthotdog, you know that right?"";
I asked: ""Sure thing, wanna talk now?""
he said : ""No, I have this meet, we'll talk after it""
I asked : ""What is it about then?""
he answered: ""About your internship.""

And here I am now, writting you guys this to kinda relieve some stress out while waiting for his meet to end.

Also, I did everything I was asked to do, way before the deadlines, they just don't give me alot of issues to solve hence being a laid back job.

TL;DR : Got late to work, boss told me he wanted to talk about my internship here..

I'll be editing based on the Chicago Manual of Style. Try to keep submissions manageable. If you have a book, message me and we'll talk.

This is all that I really want from you:

1 - What audience are you writing to? For instance, if you are writing a book of fiction, what kind of reader do you want to pick up that book? I will try to look at the work from that angle.

2 - If you want to donate money as payment for this service. Here's a Kiva campaign I set up http://www.kiva.org/campaign/1965?utm. Kiva is a micro-loan site where you are able to loan small amounts in increments of $25 to people around the world. The money then comes back to you. So your payment will eventually come back to you for this editing gig.  If you really want to give directly to me, once again message me. 

I will try to get back to you with a time when your work will be edited.

Did I miss something??,Tomatoes_for_u,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38omvx/now_i_am_desperate_how_do_i_get_out_of_the/,"I posted a longer version of this on ask women a while ago because I didn't know this sub existed. I'm 27, have an Associate's degree, continuing for a bachelor's, have an apartment to pay for, need full time work. I am a marketing/advertising major and would prefer a job or paid internship in that field (can't pay rent with unpaid) but I am not limiting myself to that field. Any 9-5 Monday through Friday would be great.


I am soooooo fucking sick of getting paid in cash at night. Every bill I have, including rent, takes out of my bank account. I make almost daily trips to the bank to put in night deposits (about 5 nights a week) last night I didn't make the trek after work and met up with my sister at a brewery instead, then I wake up to find I owe $60 in overdraft fees. All I want is a steady paycheck with direct deposit. Weekends off. My boyfriend works 9-5 an I want more time to see him. I have friends I used to be very close to who I haven't seen in months who have day jobs. I want time to do things after work. 


My current days are like this: wake up at 10:00, do stuff around the apartment (empty dishwasher etc), change into work clothes, eat a late lunch, go to work and bust my ass for old people who might tip well sometimes, leave and drive to the bank to make a night deposit, go home watch a TV show and go to bed. Sometimes I meet up with my coworkers at a bar but it's not too often and usually on a night with cheap specials. On my days off I see my boyfriend. I have next to no money.


How I want my days to be: wake up early, go to work, eat lunch at work, finish workday around 5 pm. Then either go to my boyfriends house and work on our garden or go out with him or just chill and watch Netflix. Or, maybe meet up for dinner with my friends. Or, go do something active like rollerblading and biking. Or, just do chores and watch tv. Cook dinner more than eating workplace food. SO MANY OPTIONS. Budget better, put the lessons I learned in personal finance class into place.


This is what I've done so far. I need something that pays $14 / hr minimum:


- send out resumes and applications to over 50 companies that I've found on indeed and Craigslist. Some days I send out 10 some days just 2 or 3. Some I am qualified for, most I don't meet the qualifications but I KNOW I could do well if given the chance.
- gotten an interview for an internship through someone my boyfriend knows in my field of study. I did very well in the interview and it looked promising but they had to wait until my school semester was over because I had day classes (working around my current work schedule). When school was over they had already hired someone bc they needed to fill the position sooner.
-gotten offered interviews from 3 different scam ""marketing"" companies who are actually door to door sales, their websites are only for potential employees and do not cater toward clients or even mention who their clients are. When I asked one of them who they represent they said the couldnt tell me for ""legal reasons"". -_-


I am on a timeline here, I need to find something before August so I can register for night classes. Another semester of working around a waitressing schedule is another semester of missed opportunities. I have a linked in profile that is well written  but very few connections. I don't know how to meet people in the field I want to work in because people don't wear t shirts with their jobs printed on them (well I do, lol) but mostly everyone I know is either a server or has a masters degree, no in betweens. 


What can I do? I'm getting so depressed barely making rent and I want to enjoy my life and my late 20s before I have to start thinking about starting a family and all that stuff. I want to travel a lot and have fun and not worry about if I will make the same amount this week as last week :("

I am a 20 year old female currently home from college for the summer. Since I graduated high school, I have found myself struggling to figure out ""who I am"", and as a result have struggled with some anxiety issues the last few years.

In the last year in particular, I have been having a hard time. My long term boyfriend of four years broke up with me. It has been almost three months since the break up occurred, and we are attempting to be friends, but I constantly find myself thinking about him and comparing my life to how his is going. In fact, I recently went out with him to take a ride in a new car he recently purchased. Despite the fact that nothing happened and we had a good conversation, I went home that night and was unable to get out of bed for the rest of the night. I constantly focus on the fact that I feel as though I am ""not good enough"" for him any longer, despite him attributing some his current success to my help throughout high school, and him stating that he wants to ""live the college life"".

I am dirt poor right now, and unable to keep gas in my car. This has led to me taking a minimum wage job in a field that has nothing to do with my interests (I am an Animal and Veterinary Sciences major). It is also causing me to have to leave an internship that I was really excited about participating in, because of the cost of transportation and my inability to sacrifice work to attend the internship at least three days a week. I am also struggling to find a place to live in the fall when I return to college, because my would-be roommate abandoned me because I couldn't pay my portion of the rent at the time we got accepted for the apartment.

Because of all of my stresses, I find myself eating more than I should, not exercising, and falling into a general rut of self-pity. I attend college with the goal of becoming a Veterinarian, but recently have been finding that I don't have enough confidence in my ability to succeed. I tend to sit and think that I should improve my life, but never actually get up and do anything about it. In fact, last night I sat and made a list of things I wanted to get done today, yet it is the afternoon now I am still sitting in my bed.

So, in short, I'm looking to improve various areas of my life. I want to become better at handling a friendship with an ex while being happy with my own achievements. I want to be satisfied with the money I make, and understand that just because a job isn't in my field, doesn't mean it's worthless. I want to eat healthier and exercise and generally become a happier person.

Any help, whether it is guidance, suggestions, or a finger pointed in the right direction, would be really useful. Thank you."

38ousz,0,2015-06-05,This beautiful girl lives in my father's house with me and I don't know how to deal with her.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/38ousz/this_beautiful_girl_lives_in_my_fathers_house/,"So I'm 19 and just finished my first year of college and I'm home working at an internship over the summer. So my Father took it upon himself to hire this 20 year old girl at his company and since she has family troubles he offered her to stay in the house for a while (in the room across the hall from me). So we got pretty close the past week or so. We haven't actually had sex but we've done pretty much everything else that would come before it. But the problem is she is wary to do stuff with me because she lives with me and she is employed by my father. So if shit hits the fan her life could be really shitty. But because I'm just home for the summer, we think it is not a good idea to attempt to start a legit relationship. I can tell she is conflicted when she is laying with me because she resist contact but then goes against herself. I guess what I want to know from you guys is if I should try to stay away from her or just keep doing what i am doing. I know my father is very against nepotism and I try to tell her that but she still is unsure. We keep having super serious conversations and it's very stressful because if we weren't in this situation it'd be completely different.

Thanks in advance"
38oxct,2,2015-06-05,How do I quit?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38oxct/how_do_i_quit/,"I'm quitting my job as soon as I have another one lined up -- which is looking like it might be soon. I'm leaving partially for personality issues (there are some huge communication issues at my current job and I often don't feel respected) and partially for career reasons (I'm underpaid and not focusing as much on my area of expertise as I was lead to believe I would). I would much rather focus on the latter for my reasons for leaving, and leave out the former. However, as I've never quit a job before, I'm incredibly nervous and would love some input.

- The prep: I feel like I should go in with an outline of what I can do to ease the process (I'll give 2 weeks notice). There are two interns that work in my department and are likely to handle a lot of the work I'm leaving until they can find a replacement. Is there anything else I should think to prepare or have a plan ready for?

- The actual process: I'm planning on having a conversation with my boss that morning. How do I frame this? I feel it's likely for her to take it personally and be upset because they need me. How do I mitigate that?

- The letter: My understanding is I should also send a more formal notice after our conversation. What should this actually say?

- Maintaining relationships: My boss is close to other personal contacts and I would like to avoid leaving on a bad note. What should I do in order to be the best departing employee I can be?

Thanks for any advice or experiences you can share!"

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and wings were on sale, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. If anything notable happens this summer (since guys' nights are usually when we're out), I'll definitely report back and tell you all what's been going on.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in Central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."
38pfha,17,2015-06-05,Question regarding my education,slokenafk,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/38pfha/question_regarding_my_education/,"Hi all. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I wanted to look to some people with experience. 

So I have been going to school for 4 years now. I'm about to complete my associates. I wasn't able to finish my associates in 2 years due to being miss advised and due to tuition costs. 

Anyway I major in IT with a focus on networking. Last summer I landed an internship at a college in NYC. They liked me enough to hire me and I have been here since. Today the college president offered for me to go to school here for free. Only problem is they don't offer any IT programs. I am considering going for a management degree and then doing certs for IT  related things. 

I guess I'm just kinda confused what to do here. The free tuition combined with the idea of working and going to school in the same place seems really appealing. I just don't want to go to school here and not be able to find a job afterwards. 

Any opinions or experience?"

A little bit about me is that I started to pick up the CS major the 2nd semester of my freshman year (started off pre-law) and I feel very, very fortunate enough to land an internship in the first place. I'm getting paid by the month ($1k), which I really don't care about because I just want the experience. I have decent experience in C++ and python.

Now at this startup I'm working at, my assignments are basically things I've never worked with before. And it's been about a month in and I'm still very shaky with some of the new concepts (a lot of cloud-based and mobile stuff).

I feel like a fraud. I know there's the imposter syndrome so maybe I have that right now. But I was pretty confident with my CS skills in the two classes I've taken.

Is this normal? I feel very useless. Do people who have full time positions spend long periods of time not actually contributing anything to the company but learning ""knowledge"" instead, but this ""knowledge"" may or may not help them accomplish their assignments?

TL;DR: First internship, I'm a rising sophomore who has taken CS classes for 1 semester. No idea what I'm doing, I feel guilty, like a waste of money. I'm trying to learn and do my best by asking questions, but it's been a month and I haven't gotten anywhere. Is this normal?"

38pjgx,0,2015-06-05,Getting into programming apps is relatively easy. How do you actually become good at it?,[deleted],iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/38pjgx/getting_into_programming_apps_is_relatively_easy/,"After teaching myself Python (the syntax anyway), I decided to enroll in college as a Computer Science major for my freshmen year. The program teaches us in depth C++ over the course of our degree and I really liked it and will definitely go into that career field. Midway through my second semester, I decided I wanted to be programming more than I was for classes and I wanted to feel like I was actually making something instead of staring at a black terminal learning about quick sort. Like many others I turned to iOS programming and I bought a decent Mac Mini and starting learning. Learning how to program basic apps and learning the ropes isn't too difficult. There are dozens of tutorials and programs and tons of different routes to take. Over the past 3-4 months I have been learning Swift and how to use XCode, and I now have my very own app on the App Store! I'm pretty proud of it and it really is awesome to see your own name on the App Store.

Anyway, after learning what I will call the ""basics"", where do you go from there? Is it natural to just tackle each problem as you run into it and just learn through solving your own issues? Am I supposed to read about things before I need to use them? When am I considered experienced enough to confidently apply for internships? My fear is that while I *could* keep creating decent apps with the skills I have now, I won't grow as much as I need to as a developer to be taken seriously if I do.

TLDR: Learning to make basic apps is easy, how do I learn about the next levels?"

1. Is there any additional information I need to provide besides the filled out 1040nr-ez with the W2 attached?

2. Is it safe to mail these forms with all my information/SSN/etc?

3. I am asked for my ""immigration status"" at the end of the 2014 tax year... I had been back in Canada for 4 months at that point and nothing but a Canadian citizen. What do I put here?

4. Is it too late to file my taxes? I know in Canada that the tax deadline is hard if you owe money, but if the gov. owes you money you can file whenever, is it the same in the US?

Thanks so much, any help would be greatly appreciated.

(J1 VISA),doopdewoop,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/38pog7/help_filing_american_taxes_for_canadian_citizen/,"Hi! I am a Canadian citizen who participated in an internship in the US last summer (2014) with the J1 working VISA. I was being taxed 26% off of each paycheck and I know it's late but I would like to file my taxes. I have figured out that I need to use my W-2 to fill out the 1040nr-ez but I have a few questions.

1. Is there any additional information I need to provide besides the filled out 1040nr-ez with the W2 attached?

2. Is it safe to mail these forms with all my information/SSN/etc?

3. I am asked for my ""immigration status"" at the end of the 2014 tax year... I had been back in Canada for 4 months at that point and nothing but a Canadian citizen. What do I put here?

4. Is it too late to file my taxes? I know in Canada that the tax deadline is hard if you owe money, but if the gov. owes you money you can file whenever, is it the same in the US?

Thanks so much, any help would be greatly appreciated.

38pox9,1,2015-06-05,Somebody Just Give Me A Job,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/38pox9/somebody_just_give_me_a_job/,"How freaking hard should it be for me to land a job after graduating with a bachelors of science in electrical engineering? I'm in a place that has tons and tons of high-tech companies that have jobs relevant to my degree and what I want to pursue, and yet I get phone interviews maybe once every couple of weeks, with person-to-person interviews few and far between. I graduated with a decent cumulative GPA (a 3.48), but I unfortunately never landed an internship. I certainly tried the last couple of summers but through a combination of me sucking at having conversational skills and just bad luck, I never got one.

But that shouldn't mean I can't be able to get a job after graduating. If it is, then I'm fucked and there's no way I'll ever get a job. I'm so tired of getting on my computer every day, going to indeed and searching for jobs. I always set the search to limit results within the last day because otherwise I'll just find repeats of jobs I've already looked at or applied to. My resume focuses on my project experiences (which really, *really* are not that bad, *at all*! I have lots of great engineering project experiences), because I don't have any decent work experience to show. 

It's been a month since I graduated, and I've been searching for jobs since last Fall.

I'm starting to think I need to just find a stupid retail job, but every time I think about it, I feel like they're not going to want to hire me because I'm way overqualified for such a position, and they'll probably think I'll leave as soon as I get an offer for a real job. Which is entirely true.

I've been depressed and have had anxiety for the greater part of a 
year too. It hurts me on the inside to see so many of my peers who have already obtained jobs. Going on Facebook is risky and can sometimes make me feel like a freaking loser.

38pp76,14,2015-06-05,New York City or Atlanta?,camelConsulting,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/38pp76/new_york_city_or_atlanta/,"Hey everybody, I'm really struggling with whether I should go for Atlanta or New York full time. This summer I'm doing a Big 4 cybersecurity internship in Atlanta, my home city, and I graduate next spring with a bachelor's from a large southeastern state school.

I was hoping that those of you in NYC/Atlanta (or elsewhere) could give me thoughts on other criteria I may not have considered, and all feedback is very appreciated. Here are some pros and cons I'm working with now:

**Atlanta Pros**

* Lower cost of living 
* Fairly good network in place, lots of friends and family + interning here
* Hartsfield-Jackson Airport &gt; JFK/LGA

**NYC Pros**

* The lifestyle/culture
* Public transportation

Really I want to go to New York, I'm just worried that starting fresh with my network, especially from a southeastern school might be tougher on my career.

Thanks in advance, I appreciate the insights."
38pr01,158,2015-06-05,Me [37 M] trying to deal with [24 F] potential stalker,Dealing_with_a_Crazy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38pr01/me_37_m_trying_to_deal_with_24_f_potential_stalker/,"So I have what my buddies describe as a crazy dream.  I have this really hot new hire that seems to be into me, which would normally be great but she is also super young and potentially a stalker.

Here is the deal.  We work in the same building but not on the same project or anything.  We cross paths in the cafeteria and in the garage but outside of that don't really interact on a daily thing.  Our first meeting was back in April at an office happy hour thing.  It seemed to be a pleasant conversation and we hit it off for a few hours and then went our separate ways.

We would cross paths a few times in the hall or the company cafeteria, but would just smile or stop and make small talk.  Then about two weeks ago I was sitting having lunch outside by myself and she came and joined me out of the blue.  We laughed and joked and then finished up and I went back to work.  When I came out that night to leave for work she was sitting on my motorcycle waiting for me.  She asked if I would take her for a ride around the block but I explained to her that I only had one helmet and riding in our city without one could get us a ticket.  I know weak excuse and my buddies gave me flack for it, but honestly I am weird about safety when I ride.  I told her maybe another time then went home.  Two days later I am at my gym finishing up and I get a tap on my shoulder.  Its the intern!  We talked and she told me she just joined, to which I thought nothing about and then I went on my way.  

Now I am not going to like,  I was thinking of maybe asking her out, but I really don't want to screw around with my job and career just over a hot girl whom I may or may not have anything in common with.  I talked it over with my friends and well many feel the same way with a few that live for the moment and others that put more thought into actions.  The next day (last week) she joins me for lunch again.  We get to talking some more and she told me she wasn't sure about joining a gym but after talking to a few people and seeing that I worked out there she decided to give it a shot.  Fast forward to last night where I get a strange knock on my door.  I open it up and who is there, you guessed it the Intern girl.  She said she was in the neighborhood and wanted to know if I wanted to go out for dinner and some beers.  Now I am a bit creep-ed out and ask her to how she knows where I live, to which she states she peaked at my employee file (she works in HR as an intern there).  I tell her this is not acceptable and ask her to leave because I already have plans to which she apologizes and leaves.

Now I know she is young, so some of this might be impetuous mistakes, but I am honestly a little freaked out by this.  I don't know if I should report this to HR (where she works) or let this go.  I mean I don't think I've done anything to lead her on, I have not asked her out, slept with her, or even do anything outside of have lunch with her.  I'm not trying to get her fired nor ruin my career in any way.  One of my friends seems to think if I just went out with her she would calm down, but I don't think I want to encourage the behavior and end up with a dead animal nailed to my door or something.  I am not sure if I go to HR and say ""hey, your intern is looking into my personal file and showing up where I work out and at my home"" if they would believe it.  She also seems genuinely nice and sincere in conversation so I don't want to ruin her life if it was just a stupid mistake we make as a kid type thing.  I also don't want to assume that because of this she is interested in me then try to have a talk with her and have her come across as if I'm at fault here.  What is the best way for me to protect myself and proceed from here?  Am I over reacting or making a big deal out of nothing?



   
**tl;dr**: Met an intern at company happy hour, she went into my HR file and started appearing where I hang out.  Not sure how to deal with the situation."

Can someone in it or who knows about it maybe elaborate on what it does, what the benefits are, and how if it's worth anything when finding internships or applying to grad school?
Thanks!

Also, I'm planning out my schedule. Give me feedback on the classes (if they're too hard, easy, how the workload is, etc...) if you can!

38ptgs,19,2015-06-05,"I keep getting interviews and potential job offers, but no follow up..",wafflebread,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/38ptgs/i_keep_getting_interviews_and_potential_job/,"I guess I haven't been out of grad school for too long (3 weeks). I'm in the animation/motion graphics/design industry. I've applied to maybe...30ish jobs? And I've actually gotten quite a lot of phone interviews and in-person interviews. So I know my portfolio and resume is attracting people. But I just haven't gotten any committed offers.

The last week of school, I got an interview for an internship at a animation and design company. Through email they seemed super excited to meet me. But when I got to the interview...and it's a different person than the woman I talked to over email. The guy didn't seem interested in talking with me AT ALL. Like, I had to pull his teeth to even get more description about what my job duties would be. I even got an email after that interview from the original lady I spoke with asking if I was still interested in the position. I said I was...no reply.

A week ago I actually got a call from a different advertising company that wanted me to do freelance work that would pay really well. The guy who would head the project said he believed I could do the work, and just wanted to meet me and other people at the company before I got started. I was out of town and said I'd love to meet the following Monday.

I emailed him asking to meet. Got no reply. Called him and he didn't pick up. Left a message. He finally emailed me back said they were super busy, but we could meet Thursday. I emailed again trying to confirm. Thursday has passed. So I'm pretty sure that job has fallen through, or they just found someone else.

I guess I haven't been looking long enough to just assume that I'm being looked over because I'm black. But yesterday I took my picture down from my website just to see if I get any better luck. With LinkedIn, though, people can still see what I look like. Also I'm not bragging, but if you google my name a few big awards I've won and pictures of me will come up. So I can't really hide what I look like if someone is looking to find out..

Anywho I was just wondering if you ladies have dealt with similar things and if you had any advice when interviewing on how to deal with this. I know I need to work on my portfolio more for some of the positions I've been applying too, but I am starting to feel like something wrong is happening at the actual interview stage. :/ I'll find something soon, though!"
38pztb,2,2015-06-05,Squidward's suicide,Mesytry,ShitShortStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitShortStories/comments/38pztb/squidwards_suicide/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one.

I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.

The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams.

Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.

    Best idea go to the Lampost Thursday developer lunch (at noon on Thursday's

    A lot of the best internships take applications in Sept for the following

    &gt;&gt; haven't really been able to implement anything like that in web design, but
    &gt;&gt; it does help me understand things like arrays, loops, if/else statements,
    &gt;&gt; etc. I am willing to work on a ""contractual"" basis, meaning I realize that
    &gt;&gt; my limited experience in a very competitive market and am therefore I am
    &gt;&gt; willing to work for below the minimum wage (hence why we'd need to make it

    So I'm seeing a number of WWVB receivers. They're more expensive than
    GPS, and don't seem to be as easy to use for high precision timing
    (ie: they look like RS232 out, some seem to have a TTL pulse per
    minute, but not the GPS pulse per second).
    
    I have no idea which is a better hardened system, though obviously
    there's a lot of hardening of components and your local system you
    could do.
    
    Depending on just how back to basics you're thinking of, I'd consider
    some sort of physical assembly with photo sensor to get a very
    accurate true local noon, and calibrate for that in software. But then
    I'd also consider carefully just how much precision you need in your
    time.

What are some professors /classes I should take? :) Are there any internships you can think of for an incoming freshman?

I've been told that what I learn in first year isn't enough to secure an internship after first year..so what else should I learn? I don't want to just focus on one area of development though. Could seriously use some advice. 
38qz47,1,2015-06-05,ReBuilding a Gaming Rig into a Mini ITX,huyster_sc,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/38qz47/rebuilding_a_gaming_rig_into_a_mini_itx/,"A couple years ago, I built a gaming desktop. I used a [MAXIMUS VI HERO](http://www.amazon.com/MAXIMUS-VI-HERO-Motherboard-Generation/dp/B00CXIVEA2) and put everything into a [Thermaltake V71 Tower](http://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Power-Supply-Tower-CA-1B6-00F1WN-00/dp/B00IS8P4YI).  
  
I learned this year that moving a giant tower is not fun, especially when you have schooling, internships, and jobs that have you consistently moving. So I started a project to shrink down my tower into a smaller tower.  
  
  
My current hardware is:  

Intel Core i7-4770K  
Crucial M500 240 GB SATA  
[VGA EVGA GTX 760 2G](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130932)  
Western Digital 3TB HD  
  
I want to move those over to a [MAXIMUS VII IMPACT Mini ITX](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MI8D1YE/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=MU9TAJJ9LISA&amp;coliid=I1P2BOCHIYIWP0) and put everything into a [EVGA Hadrom Hydro Tower](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IKDFMN4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=MU9TAJJ9LISA&amp;coliid=I1112NENWSYOE3)  
  
  
So here are my questions.  
  
First and most important, will all my components fit into the motherboard and tower? I've read a lot on the dimensions, and I'm pretty sure it'll work, but I want to make sure. Especially the EVGA Video Card, it's pretty big.  
  
Second, the current tower I have is large and thus gives excellent passive cooling to the processor and video card. Will I need to think about cooling components (i.e. liquid cooling) because I'm packing everything closer together. Losing half a grand to overheating is one of my nightmares.  
  
Three, are there any other suggestions for motherboards and/or towers? I'm completely open to different towers and motherboards; if the two I've picked won't work or if there's just better options.  
  
Please help, and thank you Reddit.

38qzbd,2,2015-06-05,Can a relationship fail because of fatigue?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/38qzbd/can_a_relationship_fail_because_of_fatigue/,"Apologies if this is a little meandering. I'm trying to get me thoughts in order, but we'll see how I do.

Context: My BF [25] and I [25 F] have been apart for just over a year now, after four years of attending undergrad together. During that time, we've seen each other fairly frequently (for this sub anyway); about one weekend every 4 months. He also spent a much-needed three weeks with me in mid-winter when I was having a hard time with school.

Here's my problem: we had an end date, it's come and gone, and we're still apart.... and it's really wearing us down. We were planning on waiting until I finished the degree that put me in another city, see where I got my internship, then move to that city and spend the summer together... and then, if things were still working out, move in together.

I found out where I was going to intern back in March. He immediately started applying for work in my new city. But, for a variety of reasons, it hasn't worked out. He's gotten depressed and has started to give up. He sounds more and more despairing every time we talk and I don't know what to do.

/rLong Distance, I am out of ideas. I don't know when I'm going to see him next, he's sliding into depression, and there's nothing I can do. I can't host him at my place here for more than a few days (I can't afford it, and my lease wouldn't allow it anyway). I need encouraging words for him, because I've said everything encouraging I can think of and it isn't helping. I'm tired of being alone all the time, I'm tired of missing him all the time, I'm tired of feeling left-out when my friends talk about their boyfriends, I'm tired of not being able to just tell him things, I'm tired of racking my brains for encouraging things to say tell him... I'm just tired.

How the heck are you supposed to stay motivated when all the certainty is gone?"
38r4xf,5,2015-06-05,another classic in love with the wrong person at the wrong time story...,no42throwawayno42,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38r4xf/another_classic_in_love_with_the_wrong_person_at/,"Probably the oldest story told, but here goes...

Me 43M, married for almost 10 years to my 43F wife, together for 15, with the best 9 year old daughter anyone could ever hope for. For years we've been in love and yes, we are still in love. But over the last few years, my wife has gotten more and more immersed in her very high-pressure, high paying job. We don't need the money and could easily live our lives on less income, but despite the pressure and stress the job give her, she shows no signs of wanting to leave. As a result, about half her time or more she's either spending days or weeks at a time on business trips to her company's home office (based in another city) or working 80-90 hours a week from a desk at home.  We're both high-ranking professionals in our respective fields but I'm able to set boundaries with my work that give me the ability or freedom to work no more than 40-45 hours a week, and never from home, always from my office about an hour from home. My wife on the other hand divides what precious little is leftover from her non-work time between our daughter, her friends, and her family. I miss her, as we rarely have the opportunity to spend quality time together. It also seems like she's changed and gone from the free-spirit I fell in love with years ago to the hyper-career-driven, gotta-have-it-all worker bee, a personality type that has never been something I was attracted to. Long story short, the last few years have left me feeling like my wife puts me low on the priority totem pole. We've had many fights and arguments about this, especially as I do the vast majority of our housework, but to no avail. Which brings me to my current dilemma...

At my company last summer, we hire an intern in a department that I don't have much direct dealing with, but at the same time I end up training her and working with her on a few projects and events, especially after she ends up being good enough at what she does to get hired on a full-time basis.. I notice her (23F) but I'm not really looking or noticing at all. Except, it does start to seem like we have a number of interests in common and there certainly seems like a connection. We chat every once in while, find out she has a boyfriend, but doesn't seem to affect the fact that we can very easily chat and talk in a really warm, comfortable and friendly way. All is well until I hear that she's giving two-weeks notice to pursue her desire to move to a different city to pursue her career in our field there.

On a total impulsive whim, I ask her out to lunch.  Purely on a professional basis mind you, I'm high up in the company, she's a valued employee leaving on good terms and a goodbye lunch is certainly in order. But at lunch, we really talk and bond, laughing and chatting in a way that feels like we've known each other for years. A work lunch that ends up feeling like an awesome first date, except that we both lament that we have to cut it short to go back to work.

So she has her last day at work, after which I connect with her on FB. Another quick chat ensues and we make plans to have another lunch, days before she moves. Over lunch, we talk and talk, sharing deep personal details and stories to an intimate level that I've rarely experienced with another person. Again, time flies and flies and this lunch really feels like an amazing date. I also come to find out that she's moving to this other city without her BF, but he's still in the picture somehow and helping with the move. Nevertheless, the connection between us is electric, deep conversations with occasional extended moments of just looking into each others eyes. We also make plans to definitely see each other again, the next time she's in town or the next time I'm in the city she moves to (where I tend to travel fairly regularly.) We also talk about possibly spending a weekend at a music festival in her city later on this summer. Unfortunately, I have to go back to work. We take a train back and the whole time on the train back as we chat, we're leaning into each other with our shoulders.  But we get to my stop, we say our goodbyes, share a very warm, lengthy close embrace, and I get off the train (she's taking it one more stop.)

And that's where it is now.  To recap, I'm married, she sort-of has a boyfriend. There's almost a twenty year age difference between us. We also now live in two different cities. Yet, there's an undeniably electric spark between us, and clearly has been for a while. A tender, sweet, passionate, intellectual, emotional, and erotic spark. She's absolutely, mesmerizingly beautiful, BTW. I'm planning to go to the music festival this summer (I'll book my own hotel room though, I'm not staying with her) and I have no idea what will happen then. I'm not looking to burn down my world, not to mention my wife and daughter's, but at the same time, there's a feeling that this other person could be a soulmate that I would have been together with in any other lifetime.

TL, DR: just as my marriage hits serious trouble, I find myself infatuated with the absolutely wrong person, at the absolutely wrong time, for the absolutely wrong reasons. Yet merely change one parameter and this could have been one of the world's great romances. Or alternately, I'm just an idiot.  Or maybe both."

However, it starts as an internship for 10 weeks and from the looks of it, there's a good chance of conversion into full time. It's a startup and the company culture and everyone I've met seems really down-to-earth and the environment is super casual.

It pays $10/ hour and I live in a major metropolitan city so I wouldn't be able to afford housing unless it transitioned into full time. If I live with my parents, the commute is a little over an hour each way. I don't want to move home, but if I take this I'm definitely going to live at home until it transitions (if it even does). Even if it does, I have no idea what the salary would be.

I met a guy 10 years older than me at my new internship and fell in love. He has been working there for a while now in a different department. I swear the first time I saw him I felt a connection and I thought it was mutual, almost like love at first sight (at least for me). At several occasions he approached me to start conversation. We have many things in common. Last friday we went to an afterwork party, I drank too much (probably he drank too much as well) and we stayed together the whole night.. we had fun talking, dancing and he even kissed me on the lips for like 1 sec.. probably because he didn't want anyone to see. He has my phone now and I have his. 

He kind of asked me out that day when sober, but passively. We both want to go to this museum exhibition and he suggested we ""should go someday"" not really specifying when so I couldn't say anything but ""yes we should...""

The thing is... I haven't seen him at work ever since nor heard from him via text message/call/work messenger/email...etc. Usually I see him 2 times per week maybe 3, this week however... nothing! 

I'm confused because I was sure everything went well and that it might be mutual after all, I'm afraid he regrets something or thinks that the age gap/work relationship isn't okay...

Additional information:

He told me he likes being alone, he doesn't really care for social media or internet, he lives alone (not married, no children, probably no girlfriend). 

Please help me figure it out! Do you think he likes me or is it in my head??

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I'm interested in getting into the virtual reality scene so I wanted my build to meet some or most of the specs for that.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

My budget was between $800 and $1000 but being a little over is okay with me.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I'll be purchasing my parts in the US

I'll be moving across the country again in a few months so I wanted a smaller build that will fit in my car for the long trek home. But unfortunately this is what I'm most worried about. I did a bit of research and found that my parts will fit in this case but I just wanted to double check with the community here. For example with the optical disk drive fit with the graphics card?

Thanks and any help is appreciated!

38rewy,1,2015-06-06,"I'm 20 F and my partner is 20 M. Our relationship (of nearly 2 years) was once very happy and exceptionally healthy, but I'm miserable. Can you give me some advice as to how we can salvage it together?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38rewy/im_20_f_and_my_partner_is_20_m_our_relationship/,"I met my partner during the fall of my freshman year and his sophomore year of college, and we've been going strong ever since, though less so now. We started off moving fast--met his parents before we'd even dated a month, now count his close friends among my best friends, talked a lot about the future very early on. 

Now things have changed a lot: 
-We went through some pretty big trust issues (MJ related--I'm doing my best to be open minded but he lied by omission about smoking it), but have tried to recover.
-We both moved to (separate) apartments this past fall, and I had a hellish three months that led me to stay most nights at his apartment just to escape from my horrible roommates.
-He had planned to study abroad in Scotland in the spring so grew extremely distant, but never ended up going (claims he did it so he wouldn't have to be away from me, and holds my going to London to study abroad against me). 
-We went on a weeklong trip to Canada together where it was just the two of us, and that went decently despite some communication issues. 
-I moved to a different apartment where he escaped from a tough roommate situation, visited almost nightly (as it turns out, to comfort me) during a tough spring semester, and where we went through the death of a close friend together.
-I got accepted to grad school (a dual degree program) and my dream internship, he got accepted to a teaching internship, and we both decided to stay in Boston over the summer to work. I also had a housing situation fall through at the last minute, so was homeless for three weeks. He helped me move out of my on-campus apartment and into his for two weeks while I got my ducks in a row.

So, you can see our relationship is pretty good, but very much a mixed bag. He's an incredibly nurturing, loving person and in a lot of ways, I'm tremendously lucky. For all the good in our relationship, though, we have what I feel are a lot of issues that are driving me crazy. I guess somewhere in his last (*appallingly* unhealthy) relationship, he learned to be tremendously accommodating, ever-present, and flexible to the point that he doesn't voice his opinions unless pressed. 

So, that's led us to spend a huge amount of our time together at the expense of some of our other relationships (part of the reason I've neglected some of my friends and have to rebuild our relationships, and why he hasn't been able to grow too many relationships outside of his old friend/close friend groups). An increasing proportion of the time we're spending together is starting to feel obligatory from either side (i.e. either my heart's not in it and I kind of want him to leave me alone or I can sense that he doesn't really want to be there and would rather be with the guys), and that's obviously making some of our dates/the time we're hanging out kind of suck. 

I've talked to him about this and we've agreed to only spend time together when we genuinely want to see each other, but it's always the same conversation and nothing really changes. He's been noticeably less open about his plans or what he's done over the course of the day (basic stuff, which I only ask because I'm working 60 hrs a week and would like to see him at least a little bit or sort of feel present in his life), and because of this and because the tone of codependence that seems to be forming between us makes me sick, I've been curt and less communicative too.  For all the time we're spending together, our sex life has kind of gone to $#!† (once in the past two to three weeks, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I used to), and I'm starting to despair. I've become unrecognizably fickle and vindictive, and have reacted by pulling away, spending more time with my girlfriends and shoving him towards our mutual male friends--I really hate what's happening here.  I feel like our once-model-healthy relationship is getting to an unhealthy point, and because I love this man and he loves me and we've discussed wanting our relationship to last a lifetime, I want to do all I can to salvage our relationship before we reach a point of no return. He says he's willing to do whatever it takes to fix this, but even I'm not sure what would be best to do.

Have you reached this point in your (otherwise good) relationship? If so, how did you cope? Can you offer me any advice?


   
**tl;dr**: Relationship of two years is at a crossroad because of hard times and loss of independence on both sides--can you offer me advice for salvaging it?"
38rf4f,2,2015-06-06,Can anyone provide some insight on this HR behavior?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38rf4f/can_anyone_provide_some_insight_on_this_hr/,"Backstory: After my last job failed to mature into an internship like my company confidently said it would (I guess I believed them for some reason), I've been frantically trying to to find a new one. Since I'm no longer tied to the reigns of my current region, I started applying out of state where my brother is attending college in hopes of being able to share an apartment with him while he goes to school and I work. Long story short, I found a great company in my target city, I've completed a total of 4 interviews, 3 on the phone, 1 in person. I thought all of them went very well and my experience is directly in line with the position. It has now been 6 weeks since my first interaction with this company, and 1 week since my last interview (a phone interview). Here is what is currently happening:

Monday morning I get a call early in the morning from the Sr. HR manager of the entire corporation who I've been in contact with throughout this entire process. He says the following:

&gt; ""I am going to call one of the references that you provided in your application. ... you should hear back tomorrow.""

At least that's what I thought I heard. I was a little groggy still since he woke me up with his call.

So Monday passes and there's no call on Tuesday. I talk to one of my old coworkers on Facebook at the company where my reference works at and he mentioned that my reference was out of town until Thursday. So I think it's a good idea to send a quick email to the HR manager giving alternate references from that same company.

Now it's Wednesday, and I get another call from the HR guy saying,

&gt; ""I was going to talk to [the HR manager at the branch that you applied for] today but she was out of the office. But I just wanted to let you know that everything looks very positive, we're still interested in you and you should know soon.""

So, from what this sounds like to me is that they're actually interested in me and they're just ironing things out and setting everything up to make an offer. Would I be correct in saying that? I'm really not sure at this point, because all of yesterday (Thursday) and today (Friday) I haven't heard anything back from anyone.

I was really hoping to find out this week because I need to start looking for housing in that area and I'm really getting anxious over the whole thing (like I wasn't already anxious enough) especially since he keeps saying he'll get back to me ""tomorrow"".

Does anyone with insight into the HR world know what's going on? Sorry if I sound impatient, it's just all I've been able to think about for the last few weeks, I really need a job."

I would like to relocate to either SF, Denver/Boulder, Seattle, or Austin. I have 2 internships and I am coming from a big state school. What is the best way to find a job there? I've tried Indeed, Dice, HackerNews, but no luck. Is there a better website to look at to get hired there? Any tips?"
38rjjx,10,2015-06-06,Ended a relationship. Now I'm totally alone.,throwaway_damnit93,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/38rjjx/ended_a_relationship_now_im_totally_alone/,"I kind of need help, this is not an specific gay issue but, between bros we can relate.

So, I stared my first relationship a few months ago, with a guy I dated for 4 or 5 months. The guy is great and I feel really attracted to him, so I did my best to get him. I must confess that before I was with him I was a shitstorm, I did drugs, consumed a lot of alcohol, went partying a lot, and I fucked a ton (even BB). I got out of that dark place to give that guy my best, and to not kill myself haha.


At the start we went through something rough, I needed to know my HIV status, I was really scared (scariest time of my life), he was there all the time, rock solid, no HIV found. Then he helped me execute my decision to voluntary distance myself from bad influences, like most of my addicted friends. 


Then I got my life on track, got the best available opportunity for my internship, ended the semester with the max grades for all my subjects and I still had a boyfriend.
I was pushing myself a lot, I choose to grow and my boyfriend seemed to support me, he made me feel so alive.


Suddenly he started feeling out of place at his new job (I helped him to get through the interview process by the way), and everything changed a lot. He was constantly nagging me on how I was always busy or tired (work/study 15 hours a day, obviously I can't be super energetic) and how I stopped giving him little gifts and stuff. Imagine a 15 year old girl/boy on her/his first relationship, just like that.


It felt strange. I did stop giving him gifts because all my free time was to be with him, we saw each other 3 to 5 days a week at least 3 hours/day. I had 0 hours left in my day. I was tired, of course, but I was happy to be with him... I'd sleep early the weekend, making him frustrated, I tried to make him understand that on my weekends that was the only time I could sleep the hours I needed.
We talked about this for months, week after week, I kept telling him to please wait till the summer, I'd have more time then and I'd be able to give him those things he missed of the guy he feel in love with.


He broke up with my a week ago, and I'm fucked up. I feel alone, got no friends to go out with, I feel like I did something terrible to him, and I miss the old me... like if something was telling me to destroy everything I built in almost a year, my new person, and get back to live a life out of mindless passion.


I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with that guy; but I'm not sure if I want to be with him because I really don't think he's ready. 
We had a very weird relationship, it's our first serious for both of us; but there are some things that also made me uncomfortable: 

* he has some (mental) issues with sex so, no sex (even when I tried to talk to him about this, he made me feel bad for pushing him).
* He's 25 and I'm 21. He's really dependant on his family, talks to them for hours everyday, I'm more independent from them.
* He wants to travel the world with money he doesn't have, buy expansive cars and clothes like right now. I want to build a career and save for my retirement, make investments and enjoy when it's time to. Right now I feel like I have to work my ass up to where I want to be.
* He got mad at the smallest things, like, me not calling him for at least and hour when it was not possible for us to see each other (that was when he got weird). Not answering quickly to his texts. Not saying yes to everything he wanted, for example, when we disagreed on something, he'd say that we were radically different just because we disagreed on something stupid.


So basically I'm conscious that my relationship is in a weird place, but I still love him. And I wrote a lot about the negatives but he has a ton of qualities. He'd never cheat on me, he likes a lot of the same stuff I like and we think similar, in long term we have similar life goals and he drives out the best of me. 


I'm not sure where to stand, and I'm telling him we should go back, I really love him. He says he still doesn't know if we're getting another chance or not. But I feel like I'm getting back to my old habits, and I feel really lonely. I miss him, it wasn't fair that he finished this just before the summer started... I was supposed to be with him more, and to make him the happiest guy on earth, I feel like I failed.

Sorry if you think this is stupid and immature, I guess I'm stupid and immature. "
38rpi2,1,2015-06-06,[Build Help] In about two months I am going to spend 1500USD on a gaming PC. What is a suggested build?,flyersfan314,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/38rpi2/build_help_in_about_two_months_i_am_going_to/,"###Build Help

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Gaming

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I want to play new games with high resolution at a minimum of 60 FPS.  I like action/adventure games and a bit of FPS. 


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

About 1500 INCLUDING a monitor

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Not going to build it for about two months but I wanted to know what you all think my build will look like. I am just so excited. I just got a paid internship in my field and it may turn into a full time job. I am really happy and I love this sub, all the builds make my mouth water and get my heart pumping. 

I am curious about 4k gaming but that seems expensive right now. 1080p used to be expensive but now it is reasonable so I am thinking I should wait on that as 4k will eventually become reasonable. I am interested in a build that can be upgraded to 4k if possible. I do not know much about SLI. What would you recommend? 

Also I would prefer an orange/black or orange theme if possible. 

Thanks!

I think all I really need is the circuitry and Python emphasis from Physics.

* I'm sure we use our computers a lot in ECE, so are there really any hardware specs we should get? Like CPUs and GPUs? Do we use AutoCAD at all? I'd assume so, but maybe not until later on. I was saving up to build a rig, and get quality parts for the computer instead of using integrated graphics and 2nd gen CPUs for years lol.

38rtlt,1,2015-06-06,In about two months I am going to spend 1500USD on a gaming PC. What is a suggested build?,flyersfan314,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/38rtlt/in_about_two_months_i_am_going_to_spend_1500usd/,"###Build Help

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Gaming

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I want to play new games with high resolution at a minimum of 60 FPS.  I like action/adventure games and a bit of FPS. 


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

About 1500 INCLUDING a monitor

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

I am open to it. I do not know much about overclocking or if I should overclock.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Yes and whatever you recommend. 

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Not going to build it for about two months but I wanted to know what you all think my build will look like. I am just so excited. I just got a paid internship in my field and it may turn into a full time job. I am really happy and I love this sub, all the builds make my mouth water and get my heart pumping. 

I am curious about 4k gaming but that seems expensive right now. 1080p used to be expensive but now it is reasonable so I am thinking I should wait on that as 4k will eventually become reasonable. I am interested in a build that can be upgraded to 4k if possible. I do not know much about SLI. What would you recommend? 

Also I would prefer an orange/black or orange theme if possible. 

Thanks!

38rvqz,1,2015-06-06,I'm a complete failure.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38rvqz/im_a_complete_failure/,"For the past 4 years I've been working toward a computer science degree in college. Last fall I failed one of my major classes and the deal was that I would have to retake it with at least a B- if I want to stay in the major.

This quarter I've been retaking that class, and again it's been really really tough. The final is this Monday, but the professor offered a large extra credit opportunity that was due yesterday. Whether or not I get a B- and stay in the major pretty much rests on this extra credit project.

Turns out that the project is almost impossible. I tried working on it with classmates, but my classmates gave up. I tried paying over $100 for a few hours of guided programming time with a tutor, but he couldn't completely get it himself either.

The deadline just passed and I was able to turn in a functioning project, but one that mostly does not fit the project requirements. I do not expect to receive much credit for my attempt.

Thus, I will most likely be kicked out of my major.

Here's what makes it even more awful: I was very very close to graduating. So close that my family is coming to see me walk at the graduation ceremonies next week and finish up a few credits in the Fall. They made travel arrangements a year in advance and they've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm absolutely terrified of how they would react to me failing out of a degree about my lifelong passion, especially considering my parents have paid for my entire tuition and most of my living expenses.

I'm also terrified of how this is going to affect my career. I have an internship at a hugely well-known company lined up for this summer, but after that I don't know what's next. Sure, I can spend another year in school and still graduate with a general science BS and ""almost a computer science BS"", but that's obviously not the same to employers. I won't be able to compete with my classmates in the job market even though I'm just as qualified, if not moreso thanks to this internship.

I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I'm scared. I've failed myself and my family despite tearing myself apart for this degree. I don't know if I have the will to go on."

So about a year and a half ago I was sick from the standard gillette blades and done some research and switched to a DE razor. The one I got was the gillette tech safety razor off eBay. I used this for a while and it did reduce the number of shaving spots, however it did not remove them completely. They were still very visible.

In conjugation of this blade I also used Proraso Shaving Cream Soap and a badger brush. I thought my shaving was fine, and that my prep for shaving was fine too (I would ex foliate before a shave, never use alcoholic based after shaves etc). 

So with the spots still not going I decided to go see my doctor. He told me that it'd be wise to stop shaving for a while and let the redspots go away then start again. I followed his advice and I've been trimming my beard with an electric trimmer which doesn't irritate my skin. The red spots have decreased ALOT, however there is still a few spots and a little redness, I fear as though when I start shaving again I'm going to end up with the same problem.

So now I'm here, what do I do? I have an internship coming up and I need to shave for it. The red spots make me feel really self-concious and without being able to grow a stubble to cover it I have no idea what to do.

I recently got a Merkur 23C long handle as a gift, should I replace my gillete razor with this? I use feather blades by the way. I've experimented with other blades but I feel as though these are the best.

Please any tips on how I can make these go away.. as I'm honestly out of ideas."

I have to send out resumes now because the 4th semester is over in about 2 months. 

In Business Informatics you study economic basics, IT basics including programming and combined fields. 

Starting from the 4th semester i noticed that my only interest was in the programming classes i had so i started to learn on my own to get a little bit deeper into it. 

The problem is that i have so many other difficult classes that i cant really concentrate on programming so much.

Overall i am at a beginner level i would say...i know the absolute basics of c++ and java(bit more java than c++), i am ok with html5 and cs. 

But i guess thats not enough for a 6 months internship since i cant really programm anything besides maybe a basic calculator or beginner stuff like that. 

Should i still try to get an internship in that field or is it not worth trying ? Has anyone experience with that ?

38sosl,49,2015-06-06,[Non-Romantic] Parents enabling my abusive sister [24/F] Causing me [18/F] extreme mental anguish. What should I do?,CanisLupusAquarius,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38sosl/nonromantic_parents_enabling_my_abusive_sister/,"**Edit:** I spoke to my parents at length about this situation. They themselves have no idea what to do. They have conceded that my sister is an impossible problem, but there is nothing they can do about it. I asked why they don't just throw her out onto the street, and their response was ""she would have nowhere to go... she would die."" So I guess she's just going to live with them and torment them until my parents die.  



I am 18 years. I am still in highschool (well, for the next twenty or so days,) but I will be leaving for college in two or three months. My sister is 24 years old and for all intents and purposes, unemployed, and has been verbally and mentally abusing me and my parents for the better part of ten years. When I was ten years old she told me that I deserved to be ""raped and tortured to death in a Holocaust concentration camp"" because I did not go to school. For years after that she would call me fat, told me I was causing my parents to get a divorce and that I deserved to die, etc. (My parents did never get a divorce, though my dad talks pretty openly about how he wishes he could either die or leave us. And I don't blame him. I think the reason they haven't divorced is because we're financially unstable.)  

 

My sister refuses to get a job outside of the theater industry. So, she ""works"" from home and commutes into NYC by train maybe once a month. She is essentially a glorified intern, so she doesn't even make enough money to cover the cost of her train tickets and the takeout lunches she buys 2-3 times a week. She can't do many things on her own. She refuses to do chores around the house. If asked to do a chore, she will purposefully do it wrong so that she doesn't get asked to do it again. She yells at my parents for two hours a day, often over trivial things.  

She has ""rules"" that we must follow, otherwise she will throw a tantrum, scream for hours, and break things. 1: You are not allowed to eat tuna when she is home. I'm not joking. She has broken chairs in the past when someone has tried to make tuna salad. 2: you are not allowed to talk about any aspect of her life or career to anyone. This rule, of course, does not apply to her. She is the nosiest person I've ever met, and talks incessantly about other people. She does not value anyone else's privacy, though she has called my grandmother a cunt to her face when my grandmother asked what she was doing for work. 3: you're not allowed to talk when she is talking. Again, this rule does not apply to her. I can't remember the last time I got to have a conversation with either of my parents that she didn't butt in.   

My mother suffers from depression and anxiety and my sister purposely tries to make my mother have anxiety attacks. The family dog passed away in January and my mother hasn't been the same since. My sister will say things like my mother killed the dog (the dog had liver disease, so that's just absurd-- my mom loved the dog more than anything), she'll bring up his death out of nowhere, she'll ask my mother if she actually loved him and then when my mother says ""yes, of course,"" my sister will say ""no, you're lying."" My grandmother (my mother's mother) died 17 years ago from lung cancer, and if she's brought up in any context my sister will say that my grandma deserved to die and was a bad person because she smoked cigarettes.  

Yesterday my sister demanded that my mom buy her ""royale raspberry tea"" from the supermarket. When my mom returned home with ""red raspberry tea"" by the same producer, my sister threw a fit. She later had the audacity to make my mom buy her Starbucks and a doughnut, then take her to the movie theater and buy her popcorn and candy at the movies.  

Financially, my family is not doing well. My father makes good money, but not enough to cover the mortgage on our house and his putting three children through college. Like I said before, my sister is effectively unemployed, and she tells my father that he doesn't make enough money for her, that he's only a ""sperm donor"" to her, and that they should be making more money. Just for context, my sister spends probably $300/month on things like takeout sushi, iTunes music and apps, and movies, but pays none of that back. Every few months she also makes my parents pay for her to stay in an apartment in the city, which she doesn't pay back.   

My sister misinterprets what other people say and then insists that everyone else is lying when she in fact is delusional. If my mom says to her ""we might go to the animal shelter this weekend"" my sister will say ""you told me that we were going to adopt a dog this weekend. You're a liar."" This is just a minor example. She herself is a pathological liar and a hypocrite, but refuses to accept or admit it.   

My sister has been abusing my parents for nearly all of her life, and the majority of my adult life. Still, they won't kick her out of the house. I can't take it anymore. Every day of my life I come home and I am subjected to this torture. My parents refuse to deal with her, and in doing so they are inadvertently harming me. I feel like I have been robbed of my childhood. I got a job when I was 15 years old to compensate for the fact that she does not make money. I do twice the amount of chores around the house to compensate for the fact that she does none. *I buy my own groceries at the supermarket and cook my own dinner to compensate for the fact that she spends twice as much money on non-essential food as the rest of us.* For years I have had to clean up her messes because it's unfair for my parents to have to do so.   

When I leave for college I never want to come home; not for holidays, not for vacations, not for anything. I will do anything in my power to never see my family again. I love my parents, and on the rare occasion that my sister is not home (she actually rarely leaves the house) I get along really well with my parents. Unfortunately, I can no longer associate myself with them as they're never going to deal with my sister. I feel bad, because my mother is incredibly depressed and my father has reached the end of his rope. Still, I cannot continue to go down with this ship.  

I myself suffer from anxiety disorders as well as depression and an eating disorder. College is not going to be an easy thing for me. I worry about failing out. Still, I'd rather fail out and live on the street than return home. As much as I love my parents, they are dead to me, and I no longer can put up with their enabling behavior.  

I'm really desperate, looking for any advice or help whatsoever. And before you say it, my sister refuses to see a therapist. My parents tried taking her to one before I was born, and apparently she threw a screaming fit. Since then, my sister says that ""she can't trust [my parents]."" So having her institutionalized is out of the question, though that's what I think would be best for her.  

My entire adult life all I have known is anguish caused by her abuse. She is a burden on this family. My parents will not kick her out. Please, please help me. Tell me what to do.

   
**tl;dr**: Parents can't control abusive sister, have been enabling her for about a decade. Don't know how to overcome the trauma that she has caused me. Need advice for coping and/or how my parents can deal with her. "
38sovu,3,2015-06-06,me [m23] her [f21] recently LDR,lakers299,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/38sovu/me_m23_her_f21_recently_ldr/,"Hey reddit,
            So I recently graduated from college where I met my girlfriend of 6 months. She is a year behind me and will be graduating this upcoming spring semester. Our end goal is to be together/live together the first chance we get. Problem for right now being I, since upon graduating have moved back in with my parents in Alabama. She lives in Southern California.

My parents recently moved to Alabama so I no longer have any connection to the community or have a circle of friends. My days are spent job hunting, playing video games and waiting for her to snapchat or text me back. Her days include going to her internship and spending time with her friends she hasn't seen all school year. I don't think she realizes how important how simple texting me or snap chatting me back in a timely matter is. As dumb as it sounds I literally have nothing to do. So when we have a dialogue and it's half an hour to an hour between texts I get frustrated. Especially when she goes out the bars with her friends. If I were to say something she would say how she's busy with her friends and I can't expect her to give me her undivided attention, which is true. But sometimes it feels like bullshit, because she's always on her phone. Does she see my text and just decide to let it marinate? I don't get it I instantly respond to her no matter what, but when she puts time in between texts I almost feel obligated to do the same, but then I wonder why the hell am I playing her game.. If it is even one.

Next is the issues of her going out. She's a fairly attractive girl and loves to dress up and put on make up. That's great I get it she's a girl. But what's the point of doing this and going through all the trouble to go the bar when you're in a relationship. Back in college when we were together I would forgo going to the bars all the time to be with her. If I asked her to do the same she would say that I'm trying to control her. It's not that I don't trust her but alcohol can make anion do irrational things. 

That's another thing I'm worried about for when she's back at school. She's going to be living minutes away from the bar scene and her sorority sisters are very pushy when it comes to going out. It's hard to think of all the guys that will be drooling over her at the bars, I hate thinking about it. What is she going to do when her friends are dancing with a group of guys? Stand alone in a corner or join in. It just hurts to know that I can't be there.

Today she is going to a concert and when I asked her who was going she named 4 of her girlfriends that I know and some random guy that she immediately removed any possibility of being a threat. Then she said about how they made 100 Jell-O shots for the tailgate and when I asked why she made so many for just 5 people she said well that's just our car that's going. Is there a reason why she felt the need not to tell me everyone who is going? 

I don't know reddit long distance is hard. I will be seeing her in less than 3 weeks but the time apart sucks especially when I don't get the attention that I feel I deserve. What are some ways I can bring this up without her getting too defensive or just default saying she's busy. I don't want this relationship to be about me worrying and feeling left out. "
38syef,109,2015-06-06,"For those working full time, how did you get used to the time and energy commitment?",DickCheeseSupreme,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38syef/for_those_working_full_time_how_did_you_get_used/,"I just started my first internship this week, and I'm exhausted. It's not my first full time job, but it's the first time I've ever had to work on code for 8 hours straight. I find myself spacing out very frequently. I'd say most of my day is spacing out with some coding peppered here and there. I know it doesn't sound like much, but sitting in one spot trying to focus for 8 hours feels like I'm in high school detention or something.

I'm used to my university schedule, so this full time work schedule is somewhat foreign to me. I have to be at work for 9 hours (1 unpaid lunch hour), but it takes me almost 40 minutes to get there. So in the entire day, I wake up at 7 AM and get home around 6:45 PM. I don't see the sun or my girlfriend or anyone I care about. When I get home, I have maybe 4 hours to myself before I go to sleep and do it all again.

That's enough complaining. So my question is, how did you get used to this type of schedule? How did you keep yourself from day dreaming the entire day away? How do you manage your personal life when you barely have any time to yourself? The last question is especially important to me. The salaried employees at my job work nonstop. When they go home, they log in remotely and keep working. I can see them making commits at like 11:00 PM. It's absolutely insane. I don't want to live like that the rest of my life.

I'm sorry for complaining, but I really want to succeed at this job. Not only that, but I want to enjoy it too. I like the work itself, but I feel like I could do a better job in half the time if I were working from home. So what's a new intern to do?"

38tfnl,4,2015-06-06,Apartment Complex is forcing us to sign a lease and pay for an apartment that is not ready (OR).,whyn1116,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/38tfnl/apartment_complex_is_forcing_us_to_sign_a_lease/,"Hi, legal advice. I've been a lurker in this subreddit and it's about time that something happened to me.

I'm moving to Portland, OR for an internship for the summer. It's very hard to find a short-term lease in the city because it's a landlord's market at the moment. The apartment is brand new--we would be the first tenants. It was very attractive deal because they gave us 2 free weeks of rent. We were promised an apartment on June 1st but because the apartment continues to not pass inspection and obtain an occupancy certificate, my roommate and I were put into a hotel. We were told that the hotel would be paid for and we would not have to deal with the lease until we sign and move into the apartment on the 8th with the 2 weeks free offer still standing. 

On Thursday, we were told that we were to be put into a temporary apartment on the first floor and start paying lease. We were weary because there's still a bit of construction but it was fine--whatever, we just needed to move in. The apartment is nicer anyway--only downside is the dust.

This morning, I received a call saying that the 1st floor temporary unit we were supposed to be put in did not receive the occupancy certificate and so we will not be able to move into that apartment on the 8th, as promised. They have extended our stay at the hotel until Thursday. Not only did this news happen, they told us that they are requiring us to sign a lease starting yesterday Friday, 6/5/2013. They want us to start paying the lease yesterday and are justifying it because we are staying in a hotel under their charge. They want the lease signed within 24 hours.
 
We have furniture in their storage unit. Couches, mattresses, and home furniture. If we were to look for a new apartment, we'd have to somehow cover for the moving truck and find time to find a new apartment. 

What should we do? Do we have to proceed with this lease? Is taking them to a small claims court an option?

Update: Oops forgot something. They mentioned to comp the prorated rate in our lease but it is still in the lease contract they sent over 15 minutes ago."

38tipg,10,2015-06-06,"[21F] Been experiencing ""healthy"" weight gain over the past six months. Having trouble coping with it.",oculus_caesius,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/38tipg/21f_been_experiencing_healthy_weight_gain_over/,"**TW: Self-harm/suicidal ideation mention**

Some backstory:

I have always been a small person. I am 5' 2"" and have a high metabolism, so I was always a bit underweight to begin with. Starting the summer after I graduated high school (2012) I started coming down with various physical ailments. I was admitted to the hospital for colitis, which I had never experienced before, and experienced quite a bit of (unwanted) weight loss. In August of 2012 I was 89lbs, which was awful! A combination of steroids and Ensure managed to get me back up to about 105lbs, which was my average weight. 

I have continued to battle digestive troubles ever since. I was never given an official diagnosis, some doctors saying I have an inflammatory bowel disease and some saying I just have IBS. It's been a very frustrating struggle. 

Over the past six months or so, a lot of my digestive symptoms have lessened, and while I still deal with pain, diarrhea, nausea and such, I am not in agony nonstop and that is wonderful. However, I have started putting on weight. Currently I am just at 120lbs. I have stretch marks on my hips and thighs, I went up a size in pants, many of my shirts feel a lot tighter on me. As much as I hate saying it, this weight gain is really, really hard to accept. I am looking for advice because I have never struggled with feelings like this before. I have had issues in the past with self-harm, suicidal ideation, and depression. I have gotten help with those issues, I have not self-harmed or had suicidal feelings in nearly two years, though I still struggle with the depression sometimes. My main mental health struggles now are anxiety (generalized and social). All in all, life isn't so bad. I'm in school to be a social worker (I've already completed an associate's degree), I have a job I enjoy, an internship that I love, I have a supportive family, caring friends, a wonderful boyfriend and am very active in my church. 

I find it hard to talk to my family and friends about things like this. They've seen me at my sickest, when I was basically skin and bones, and had to take three doses of steroids a day. I never want to be that sick or skinny again because I was absolutely miserable. I'm just having a lot of trouble dealing with this rather quick weight gain. I have never gained weight fast enough to actually notice it happening. I love food, but I also feel the slightest bit of shame any time I eat anything unhealthy. I just need help making sense of these feelings and hearing from people that can relate. This is all very confusing and different to me. 

**For the record, I am in therapy for my anxiety, but since the focus of my sessions has been working on learning how to handle the social anxiety, I haven't had much of a chance to bring these feelings up to my therapist. I do plan on doing so soon, though.**"

I do know solid works, matlab, and some coding knowledge. Do most internships require gpa? Could I lie?

Should I still apply? Any advice would be helpful."

I am a recent graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering. I had an internship doing QA automation and testing but I don't want to get pigeonholed into doing QA for a career. I am extremely passionate about the role technology plays in the economy such as p2p, mobile payments, NFC, cryptocurrency, biometric security, you name it.  But I don't know what my first step or first position should be to start off right. I was thinking of a Business Technology Consultant/Analyst role for big4 or smaller company but I'm not sure if that would gain me enough experience to become specialized in this broad field.

38trle,2,2015-06-06,(21M) I Feel Like A Distance is Starting to Develop With My Girlfriend (24F),Laffmeister,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/38trle/21m_i_feel_like_a_distance_is_starting_to_develop/,"Hello folks, 

I'm in my first relationship and I just came here to spill the beans anonymously and get some feedback. I've been kinda twisted in a knot and I feel like I got things reasoned out from a logical standpoint, but from an emotional standpoint I'm still wrenching my gut. It's that whole logos pathos thing. 

So I've been dating my girlfriend for awhile now, we hit our 6 month anniversary a little while back and I've taken an internship position down south which just so happens to be close to where she lives. I'm from the north, so this is about 10 hours from home. To avoid a twelve month lease, I looked for a prolonged stay on airbnb and was lucky enough to find a place.


There's a few problems that have made themselves apparent living down here. My roommate is a girl and we are strictly friends. She's shown me around the city a bit, has done a good job of helping find a friend group down here with the local grad school population, and we often go out for beers with that larger friend group I've developed. In the city I'm currently living, its pretty easy to find something to do after a day of work and having a few people to do it with has been awesome, I couldn't thank her enough for that. 


However, my girlfriend has been getting a little jealous. Obviously when another girl's name keeps on popping up in conversations, I can see how it could happen. It's just that I'm not the type of guy to break the faith. At a very young age, I've built quite a few work relationships and gotten into some things I shouldn't have (black tie events, jobs in fine dining, two internships) just because people trust me. I go through life with the idea that the person I'm talking to should always be able to walk away and recommend me to someone else. Trust is a big deal to me so its a weird feeling when I'm not trusted. 


So it kinda hit a head when I wanted to go swing dancing. I see it as a hobby and the college my girlfriend and I go to has a good community. I figure if I live in a city that is known for music, I should do a little bit of dancing. Problem is, she sees dancing as intimate and I see it as a hobby. It's something you do for fun and to meet people. She pretty much convinced me not to do it because she didn't want me dancing with my roommate or meeting another girl. Again, that's a reasonable thing to think, but I don't swing that way.


 I feel like she's starting to limit me with what I do and I don't really like that after working overtime and doing an online physics class. I've talked with her about it and she still is ardent with her opinion. I'm getting stressed out and she's bottling me up, which I guess I haven't told her. It comes back to the trust thing, I want that in part so that she can let me go do those things and not worry because, in all honesty, she has no reason to. 


It's done a bad thing for our communication, which is where it gets me the most. If I bring up something fun I did with another girl that's a friend, even though it's strictly as friends, she starts getting mad at me and I'm pretty sure she has cried over it. That makes me feel like shit, then I'm worrying about my job (If I do things wrong, it makes many big booms) and I'm worrying about my class. See where the bottle comes in? 


I don't like holding back information. Honesty is a trait I look upon well and it's a part of being a genuine person. I love my girlfriend, but I'm starting to think more and more its love in terms of friendship, not in terms of relationship.


 It seems more dry now when I say it, she makes me say it after every nightly call. I wish I didn't have to say it so she would know it. I feel like I do good things for her in terms of making her dinners, taking her to see nice things, I keep on telling her it's not what I say but what I do. I'm not good at communicating my feelings through speech, but I try to do my best with attention to detail and care. 


I'm going to ask you folks to think about this because I've been thinking about it since the summer started. I feel like I've done well given the circumstances, but I'm going to the point where I'm feeling that even though I'm happy now, the balance is teetering. I think the bottom line is that I need a bit more independence and she wants to be a part of everything I do. That seems perfectly fine, but even though we aren't a twelve hour distance away like what would have happened had I stayed in my home state, a one hour distance still kind of is a long distance relationship in the idea that I can't just hop in the car and stop by. I don't like talking on the phone all too much with anyone and texting is a poor substitute for a human being. I'd rather just wait until I see someone.


Again, thank you for reading my wall of text. My question is what is your outside observation? I'm going to see her again tonight and I'm really happy she's coming down. I'm hoping to show her around a bit and get her breakfast tomorrow at a good coffee shop a stones throw away. Hopefully we can talk about some of this so I'll try to keep you updated if you want.  I feel kind of vulnerable for saying all of this, even online, just because I don't know if I'm going in the right direction or not.

38u5zs,1,2015-06-06,My life has been heading in the wrong direction. I need to turn it around,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38u5zs/my_life_has_been_heading_in_the_wrong_direction_i/,"I'm depressed. I don't want to put my family and friends through the emotional and financial stress of a funeral. All throughout my life, I've struggled to connect with people. My home environment failed to set me into a position where I feel comfortable in a group. I always struggle to find companionship but get caught up in my perception of how others perceive me and feel like shit. Family matters are fucked up. Everyone loves each other, but everyone has their own issues. My parents have both been constant loving figures in my life but their dynamics left me extremely fucked up. My Dad is extremely quiet and passive to an unnerving point. He struggles to ask for the simplest directions and fails to vocalize and thoughts or feelings. I love him but, I never felt as if I had a strong male role model in my life. As for my Mom, she's been the dominant character who goes overboard in protecting me. Her constant sheltering and cracked world view has obscured me from developing normal social skills. I love them both more than I could ever vocalize, but my childhood definitely fucked me up.

I can't blame my family for anything though. They have tried the best they could to help me. In eighth grade a started to see a therapist to help me with test anxiety. At least that was the cover. I was unable to vocalize that every day since I started school at my private school in 4th grade (the one I would attend throughout middle school and high school) I had been a living hell. With my lack of social skills, I only made a few friends, but I failed to connect with anyone else. I always felt like a stranger, an observer, the boy watching everyone else have fun when I couldn't. Eventually, in middle school this came to a head and I was severely verbally bullied and ostracized by my peers. I was ""childish nickname""(removed for anonymity) the incompetent clumsy kid who was book-smart, but who was quiet outside of class. I silently put up with the torture, only occasionally mentioning it to my Mom who would attempt to sort it out for me... in hindsight I should've delt with it on my own with playground politics, but I didn't and the hazing never stopped.

Although the faces of the bullies changed, their victim was the same. I never grew up. I never learned to handle myself. I'm still that same little boy who has been too scared to act.No matter what I do with my life, I never feel satisfied. Sure, I got into a good school to pursue engineering, but I have failed to make any friends in my first year, I kept to myself, and my second-term grades suffered. I went to school in California to start anew, having lived on the east coast my whole life, but I feel I've landed in the same shithole in which I've always existed.

The last two summers, I had an awesome internship at a prominent aerospace company, but now without any work, I feel depressed and worthless. I fucked in school and it's just going to get harder next year. I failed to make connections and now it's just going to get harder to make connections. I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I feel like a never grew up emotionally, my life is permanently fucked, and I'm too screwed up to ever properly function in society."
38u68d,6,2015-06-06,Getting into IT: Am I nuts?,arjo1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/38u68d/getting_into_it_am_i_nuts/,"I've recently been posting here and in /r/needadvice about some job/career issues that I've been having (check my profile for the threads). It's only been a few days, but I've been taking some time to soul-search and figure out exactly WTF I want to do with my life.

After lots of Googling and encouragement from the girlfriend to try something new, I think I've landed on a new career path: IT (Systems/Network Administration, specifically). I've always enjoyed screwing around on the command line, playing with hardware, and figuring out how to hook shit up. I also have a reasonably-high tolerance for bullshit, so I figure it's right up my alley. I've been dabbling in this sort of stuff since I built my first PC at 13 and I still find it interesting, so I figure it's a good sign. Plus, I feel like I'm decent at it (with some training I think I could be pretty kick ass). 

My basic plan of attack goes like this:

1) Continue doing freelance design work to pay the bills  
2) Get a few certifications (need some help with this one)  
3) Apply for internships and/or entry-level gigs  
4) Nervously wait for responses and contemplate my poor life choices  
5) Profit (maybe?)

I feel like this is both doable and affordable (since I technically don't *need* a full-on degree), but I'm looking for a gut-check anyway. Thoughts on this?

Assuming I'm not completely nuts and that I'm going to go for this, I'm going to need a few certifications. Which ones would be the most time and cost-effective in getting my foot in the door somewhere? Security+? CCNA? MSCA?"
38ubc0,9,2015-06-06,Love of my life gave up on us.,k3324,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38ubc0/love_of_my_life_gave_up_on_us/,I'm 24 f. I spent almost 4 years with a man I loved more than anything. We could have fun doing nothing. For the first time in my life I felt safe and whole. I was happy and life finally felt good. The sex was amazing. I had major issues with intimacy before I met him from a past trauma in my life. So trusting him was hard at first but he showed me what a good man he was and I opened up to him. I graduated college a year ago. I was an intern at a company and they were supposed to hire me. They ended up hiring a new executive that majorly cut the budget and they no longer would hire me. So I worked the part time job I hated and hoped to find a job. I applied to everything and went on interviews. But nothing worked out. I didn't get my big break. But through it all I had my man. He believed in me. I moved in with him and we were happy. We cooked together we shopped together and everything was amazing. Except I felt like a failure. I didn't leave the house except for going to work. I was depressed. He was the only thing that made me happy. He joined a school club and made friends and went on a club trip to Seattle where we planned on moving next year. He texted me and called me the whole trip telling me how much he wanted me there and how much he missed me. I picked him up at the airport and things immediately felt different. A couple days after he told me he didn't feel as into this anymore. He felt like he was going through the motions with no feelings. We talked more. I said it doesn't feel like this is done and he agreed . A little time went by and he was unhappy still. I said give us a month we can try to work it out. He agreed. Two days passed and he wanted to be done for good. I told him I would leave for a month and we can revaluate. I left. I missed him like crazy. But I worked on myself. I got an interview for a paid internship that happened to be near him. I was excited to be turning things around. I wrote a long letter and put together a box of memories including a Playlist to remind him of our love and left them at his door. He went through it and came outside balling. I came in and he held me and we cuddled in bed. We then had tons of sex. And then he told me he was moving and wanted to show me his new place. We went and had drinks and food and took a walk around the lake and went back to his new empty house and had more sex. Then he asked me to stay the night and we could talk when he came home from work. Everything seemed great. He kissed me goodbye in the morning. We got lunch when he came home. We watched tv. And then he said to me he thinks I know how this talk is going to go. He made up his mind he wants to be done. He said he'll always have feelings for me and that he doesn't think he'll find anyone better but he needs to find himself without me. I'm crushed. He took our whole life away. All our plans are gone just like that. I never felt like this with anyone. I trusted him. My life felt over  And he gave up on me. I don't want to live anymore. I want to go to our house curl up in our bed and go to sleep forever. I know what days he works. I know what days I can do it. I still have the key to our place. The man I planned on spending the rest of my life with is gone. And so is every hope and dream I ever had. I want to do it. I want to fall asleep and never wake up in the bed we spent so much time in. We lived in that bed. We ate there we binge watched tv there we cuddled our cat there. I want to end it all there. As soon as possible.

I am looking for some help in finding an apartment. I will be at a internship in LA and somewhere around that area and I was wondering if any one had any recommendations as to where I could find a good apartment (possibly furnished?) 

My max budget per month is 1600 and I am from the midwest so any form of city is a bit foreign to me, let alone finding an apartment. 

Does any one have any recommendations/places to look into or avoid? Or things to do on the weekends and what to expect of LA?

Thanks for the help!"
38ueyx,4,2015-06-06,Is it better to have worked at the same company for 3 years (following summer internship) or to have multiple summer internships at different companies?,thomasin500,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38ueyx/is_it_better_to_have_worked_at_the_same_company/,"Last summer I was able to secure myself a software development internship at a small, local dev shop. At the end of the summer they offered me a part time job that worked well with my class schedule. Now, over a year since I first started, I am still working with the company. Because of this, I did not look for a summer internship and instead will just continue working here full time (till classes start again in fall). I was given one small raise (to $15/hr, am in Florida) when I was offered the part time gig. My question is, post grad, would it look better on my resume to have worked at the same company for 3 years or to have multiple different summer internships?"
38ufev,4,2015-06-06,Dealing with depression associated with LDR.,toomuchmilkandhoney,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/38ufev/dealing_with_depression_associated_with_ldr/,"I’m in a pretty good position in life right now; I am 26, I have finished one master’s degree and am nearly finished the second. I am in a wonderful and very loving relationship and, at the end of the year, my boyfriend and I are closing the distance and finally starting our life together.

Despite all of this, I find myself feeling unmotivated, directionless, and alone quite often. I think it’s all due to the long distance and the disparity of the reality of my life versus what I expected it to be at this point in time. We had an end date last year. It was not a solid one but it was one we were going to try to make work. He was coming to live with me in the US after finishing his teaching job abroad. We planned to travel around the US, then to SE Asia, then he would come back to the US for me to finish the internship for my MA, and then we’d move to Europe for his MA. We traveled through the US an Asia for about 8 months and it was wonderful. About two months ago, though, we realized that the best thing for him would be to return to a place where he could work to minimize the amount of debt he was taking on for school. Because leaving the US before December is not an option because of my MA, that meant that we’d have to be apart.. you know, again. It was a tough decision but we were optimistic. The plan now is to see each other again in about a month for about a month. Then, in the beginning of December, I am moving to be with him for good. Like, we’re getting our own place together and we’ll be there long term.

I expected to be okay when I returned but the past month has been so hard and I’m afraid that my depression is taking over me. I feel as though I am now living a life that I didn’t expect to still be living; working in the same place, doing the same things, and having to deal with Skype all the time. I feel alone and I miss my boyfriend more than I’ve ever really missed him. I feel impatient and just really tired.

I know that the key to overcoming this and the key to maintaining our (always very healthy) relationship is for me to start trying new things and reconnecting with friends and older hobbies I’ve really enjoyed in the past. The problem is motivation; I wake up in the morning and feel lost. I don’t feel like doing anything other than the things I have to do (i.e. - work). I feel anxious at the thought of seeing friends or trying new things. I know that this isn’t great but I can’t figure out how to overcome it. My partner is incredibly supportive but this takes a toll on him while he’s also feeling similarly. I want to be able to have a great independent life again but my head is stuck in where I “should” be (or already starting the next chapter of my life with my boyfriend). 

Has anyone had this similar experience? How did you overcome it and get back in to the swing of the things, despite disappointment?

TL/DR: My boyfriend and I reached our end date, spent 8 months together, and now have to go LD again for 6 months. I feel depressed and unmotivated being back in the same place again. How do I get past that feeling to maintain my healthy LDR?"

38up2v,2,2015-06-06,Best path to follow with an MS in math?,christoffelcymbal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38up2v/best_path_to_follow_with_an_ms_in_math/,"Hey everyone! I'm a 30-year-old with an MS in math looking for advice on a career path in CS.

My bachelor's was in math, and I went to grad school for math. I passed my comps and oral exam, but after four years and a half-finished thesis, I burned out on the super abstract research. I also made some poor life choices that required me to have a full-time job to pay off someone else's debt. So I went on hiatus.

I spent the last three years tutoring professionally and halfheartedly planning to finish my PhD. Finally, this year, I came clean with myself that my PhD quest was over, and began thinking about a career.

I ran across some talks on SVMs and Neural Nets, and they rekindled my interest in CS. I watched all the online machine learning lectures from MIT and CalTech. I ran through Code Academy to brush up on fundamentals and I've been working through Project Euler in Python to cement them.

I love the combination of problem-solving challenge and real-world applicability that CS offers. My ideal job is heavy in math and making some kind of contribution to human knowledge. I imagine, however, that those ""cool"" jobs are reserved for people with heavy experience and qualifications, and I'm only packing one course in C++ from a decade ago.

I'll probably be moving to Boston this Fall to be closer to friends and family (although I was considering Seattle and open to other cities). I figure with the amount of colleges and tech companies around there, I might be able to at least score an internship. Going back to school to score a CS MS is very appealing to me as well. Concentrated study time and a degree would be incredibly helpful.

So I'm hoping for your advice. My main questions:

1. How do I address the issue of spending 4+ years and only coming out with a masters in math, for both employers and schools?
3. How do I know when I'm ""good enough"" to start looking for a job or internship?
4. Is there a good path to get to those kinds of cutting-edge researchy jobs?

Thank you all for your time! Sorry for the long read."

38uwog,2,2015-06-06,A few questions on a complete career change and for people who started school in their mid-20s.,IdkWhereToStart,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38uwog/a_few_questions_on_a_complete_career_change_and/,"I've read through the FAQ and while there was tons of helpful information, I was hoping to ask some more specific questions and get a few different perspectives on what I want to do.

I'm a 22 year old paramedic. Throughout high school I wanted to go to school and eventually work as a programmer. I ended up becoming a paramedic, and I just don't want to do it anymore. I make decent money but I'm miserable when I'm at work. My problem (it might not actually be a huge problem) is that I dropped out of high school and ended up getting a GED. Would my best route be to do a couple years at community college and take as many courses that I could take that would transfer to a university and then transfer and finish with a CS degree? Does the actual school matter nearly as much as the knowledge/degree/networking does?

I know HTML/CSS, PHP, JS, and I've been working my way through some texts on Python and I'm getting a grasp on it. I obviously have more to learn and I'll definitely tackle that when I get there. Anyways, all that to say that I know I have an interest in programming. If my end goal is being a Software Engineer, would a BS in CS along with being a good programmer be my best bet? I assume internships and portfolios carry a lot of weight as well when it comes to getting jobs.

Finally, my question for people who started a four year degree in their mid-20s (or later), how did you do it? Full time student while working? Part time student? Did you just take the debt and get loans and go full time? If you could give advice to a 22 year old with no other debt who wants a CS degree, what would you say? Like I said above, my current plan is to take as many classes at a community college and then transfer to a large public university and finish out with a BS in CS.

I know alot of this information is in the FAQ, but it really helps to have an open conversation and get advice. Apologies if the above was rather scattered, but I'm trying to get past the fear that I missed my chance to go to school and I'm just hoping I still have a chance. "
38v3cj,5,2015-06-06,[Day 1](kinda) Finally trying to go the whole way,ferret_80,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/38v3cj/day_1kinda_finally_trying_to_go_the_whole_way/,"Hey LoseIt, I've been an occasional lurker around here for a bit, and after much putting off I'm finally making my first post here. I'm a 21 y/o male, 279.5 lbs 5'11"". 

I've been on and off the weight loss train for a while. two years ago I went Keto lost weight, but I returned to school and lost all that progress. My internship the next summer was very sedentary and while I did do some exercise it wasn't nearly enough. This year was tough academically and once again I decided that ""eh, academics for 1 year is more important, I can lose weight after I graduate""

Here I am, graduate, now job-seeker, I am more than obese, and my physician says that the fat on my liver may cause some major complications in the future, so it is time to change NOW!

I've always been relatively fit and active despite being overweight, I like good food, so I know how to exercise and I've proven to myself from earlier diets, that I can commit to weight loss if I try and stick to it. This post is to make sure I stay with it. I don't like to talk about it with my parent's as they can be over bearing in my opinion. So this is my announcement. I WILL lose weight, I WILL become healthier, NOW! not tomorrow, not when i get a job, NOW!

For the past week I've begun eating less, less carbs, less ""snack food"", I've been going to the gym daily, I have a weight lifting routine, Arms/Abs, Legs/Back, I also usually do 30-40 minutes of cardio on the stationary bike. 

I know I should start counting calories in MFP or another app, and I hope this post(and possibly your replies;) will encourage me to start tomorrow. I'm also going to take some pics so I can have a reference point and at the end I will have an amazing progress pic album.

Thanks for listening and keep up all the encouragement, not only for me, but for all the other people in this sub. It's amazing this communities support of each other in our shared goal to get healthier."

I rather it be low-key between my supervisor and I but I know that won't be the case since I'm in HR. 

any tips from anyone who used to work in HR that had to resign? or any general tips on moving forward in giving my two weeks?

38v98q,1,2015-06-06,"I [21M] ended things today with my [19F] GF of nearly over 1 year, yet now I feel serious remorse and worry I might regret this in the future, as I had to really push myself to end things and break her heart.",aston_spartan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38v98q/i_21m_ended_things_today_with_my_19f_gf_of_nearly/,"Hello everyone. I would really appreciate any feedback/criticism/advice on my dilemma. I wrote a fuck-ton but I don't really know where else to turn to and the details are necessary for the best answer. I'm romanticize a lot of things, and I tend to be very inwardly emotional. I ended things today with my GF of just over a year (let's call her Amanda). Amanda really did not want to end things, and it was incredibly hard for me to push myself to end things. 

I'm currently a junior at university and will be graduating next year. I'm spending my summer right now (been here since May) several thousand miles away in a major metropolitan center at an internship, so it became long distance about a month ago. Amanda had planned on visiting me but that kind of changed with the split. 

I have been in two former serious relationships, one that was only 6 months and one that was 2.5 years, both of which ended on more or less mutual terms and not because of infidelity or something like that. 

Anyways, onto my current relationship, the one I could potentially look back to for the rest of my life. I met Amanda at university and went out of my way to reach out to her. I was ""that guy"" who would brag about not chasing girls or would be hooking up with different girls. In spite of that persona I portrayed, deep inside, I'm a romantic. Short-lived hookups don't mean much to me, and ""one night stands"" seriously fuck with my mind. To this day, I can't get around getting over an immense amount of passion in one night. I met Amanda, and the first night I hung out with her, I had sex with her. Here's the catch: **I was a virgin**. I had never had sex with any other girl prior; I'd always work to other things but never sex. Amanda and I kept on talking, and I ended up getting into a relationship with her. What would be the next year of my life with her turned out to be the best year of my life. I loved, and still, love her. I traveled with her. I partied with her. I played video games with her. I did everything with her. The chemistry, sexually and personally, was beyond what I could imagine. 

Amanda and I continued to date, and around last fall (around October), I got really drunk (I don't want to blame it on the alcohol) at a social event and hooked up with (made out, a bit of touching, nothing more, no longer than a minute or two) a girl who's been a close friend of mine since high school. I hadn't seen Amanda in over a week so I was kinda missing her, or sexual activity for that matter. In retrospect, I didn't really put in an effort to see her or meet her though... Morning after, I told Amanda what I did, and she hated it. Everyone I knew told me to NOT tell her. They told me it was a ""mistake"" and to ""move on"" and that ""telling her"" would be ""dumb"". I couldn't sleep on it. I had to tell her. I owed it to her, she's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'd say she knows me better than I know myself. 

We worked things out. She hated that I did it as did I. We continued, relationship went well. Over the winter break (late December), she went back home to Europe for several weeks. During that time, it happened again. With a different girl, at some bar that I had gone out to with my guy friends. It was much less severe, as it was just kissing that lasted 10 seconds. Still cheating, I guess, but I'm glad it didn't escalate. This happened the night before she came back from Europe. I told myself, I need to tell her again. I owe her the honesty and the confidence. I'm not going to be that fucking relationship that comfortably cheats on each other and act like everything is peachy. She came back from Europe the next day. I picked her up from the airport, took her home, and felt like shit. She was so excited to be back in my arms. All she did was think of me while she was gone. Yet, as we finally exchanged Christmas gifts, (we agreed we'd do it when we met again), I told her. I had to fucking tell her this while she gave me gifts. She gave me a scrapbook that she had put an immense amount of effort into and next thing she knows, I've cheated again. She slapped me, I don't blame her. She's never laid a hand on me or anyone else but I can understand why she did. We took a ""break"" although we kept in contact and cried to each other every day. That lasted for about a week, and we were back together again, and things finally seemed to be better. I spent NYE 2015 with her and it seemed like I could put everything behind me. 

Fast forward to May 2015. I've left my hometown where I live close to her and attend uni with her. I'm headed to a far-away major city for an internship that I had dreamed of getting. Amanda was really sad to see me leave, but I assured her and we believed that we would really work things out. The distance wouldn't be a problem. We could make things work out. Fast forward a month, to last weekend, late May. I went out with a male intern friend of mine (I almost always only go out with guy friends) and we meet these two foreign women at a bar. My friend's single so I figured conversation would help his chances and it didn't mean I had to do anything with this girl. But I didn't actually think that, in retrospect. I bought her a drink. Me, my friend, and these two foreign women went to a club, had a blast, and I had a night of passionate dancing and kissing and touching with this woman. We had great chemistry... We chatted so much and I was under this woman's spell. I think this is because of the romantic in me, and because I had never really truly lived the ""single life"" or ""gotten it out of my system"" since I had lost my virginity to Amanda. I don't fucking know. Whatever the fucking reason, I hooked up with this lady, and it was a night of passion that fucked with my mind the morning after. I didn't sleep with her, but I thought of her, and the way that she stared into my eyes from the moment we met to when she walked away from me but turned backwards to look at me, as if to imagine what might have been. It was a great night, but I fucked up. I felt terrible, and it weighed on me: I cheated again. After Amanda gave me chances twice before. After we traveled Europe, and after I spent an week with her before I left for my internship. After everything, I did it again. I thought to myself, there's no way I'll tell her. I'll damage her, and I'll ruin her trust. Furthermore, perhaps I'll lose her forever. I had told her that night that I need ""to talk to her"" but ended up just saying other things. 

I thought on it for a whole week, and we arrive at earlier this morning, a cool, energetic, windy morning in the city. I told her that I really do need to talk to her. I spoke with her for a couple of hours over the phone. It took everything in me to say the words ""I'm not the boyfriend you deserve"" or ""I can't be in a relationship with you right now."" Amanda is the fucking **love of my life** and here I am telling her this, giving up, and saying goodbye to her. I really do believe that this is the best for me, and ""us"", right now. I truly believe, that if I am to marry her someday (which I believe), that I need to do this now otherwise we'd crash and burn harder in the future. Plus, I cheated again and she still doesn't know. It'd break her, as if breaking up with her wasn't destructive enough. She, in a way, understood what I was saying, but she was so hurt. She put everything into our relationship and she would do anything for me. Her love for me is beyond scale. She found herself fighting to find a way to keep me; I just don't know if she could make me be in a relationship when my heart is tugging in a different direction sometimes. 

This is my dilemma, reddit. I really love this girl, I still care about her. I'm checking my phone every fucking second right now to see if she'll text me. As a matter of fact, she called me after we broke up, not too long ago, crying and again fighting to find a way to capture me. I told her the truth: I need the distance and the time, as does she, to introspect and really review my decision. Should I man-up and tell her that I cheated again? Won't she take it really bad? If I feel that I'll cheat again or that I'll hook-up again, isn't it better to be single? What if I love her forever? What should I do or think to know if I should really be with her? I feel complete depravity and loneliness right now... And this internship I'm doing will have me working ~70 hour work weeks so my head will be all over the fucking place. Reddit, please help me and give me some guidance. Hopefully someone's been through something similar. 

Please read my story... the tldr doesn't do justice and I really need help here. Thank you. It's a Saturday night in this god-damn city and I'm alone musing about this. 
   
**tl;dr**: Cheated on gf for third time (make out+touching) but didn't confess this last time. Instead, broke up because I feel I'm not mature enough. I'm also currently abroad for 10 weeks. Did I do the right thing?

38v9lc,3,2015-06-06,Trying to get an IT/Networking job but this is ridiculous -- where do people even start??,networkingnovice,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/38v9lc/trying_to_get_an_itnetworking_job_but_this_is/,"I have a bachelor's degree in computer networking and I'm hopefully going to get my CCNA in routing and switching sometime this year. That being said, I only have retail job experience (in management at least) and I am trying to find IT/networking jobs in a state I'm trying to move my family to. I have two kids and I'm in my 30's so it's not like I'm fresh out of school and can just take big job risks... 

So I'm perusing through tons of job listings on this state's job website, and there are all sorts of IT job postings but the requirements for most of them are so advanced. Like, I need in depth knowledge of a huge range of specific technologies and things... not just the basics of networking and IT systems. Each job is fairly specialized so a guy like me who knows the basics (and a little more) still could not just jump into a job without significant training. And I do have a lab at home that I am using to learn routing/switching and playing with servers, etc, but that seems to only go so far with what I have...

I know I've seen a lot of similar posts saying that one most likely will have to start out in a call center, but is that really the only way? I saw a few job listings for *temporary* call center positions that explicitly state phone support only, but how is someone supposed to take a job like that and expect it to lead somewhere further? 

Aside from finding a company to intern for or offer services to local businesses/churches (which is still very difficult to find by the way), it seems like truly the only way for someone to get any sort of moderately advanced IT job, you have to be connected to people that can get you in, or you have to have already been bounding around the IT world for years building up the experience.

I just feel overwhelmed and hopeless because I *want* to find a good IT job that leads to a career and not just some crappy temporary call center position where I'm disposable."
38vcxr,3,2015-06-06,Should I push back my graduation by a semester so I can do another internship?,JamesGold,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38vcxr/should_i_push_back_my_graduation_by_a_semester_so/,"Hi all, currently doing my first internship and scheduled to graduate in December. I'm toying with the idea of pushing back my graduation to next Spring so I can do another internship this Fall.

Pros I can see:

- get to try out another corporate environment before I commit to full time somewhere
- get to live in a new city on their dime (this is a requirement for me to even consider doing this)
- get more time to study for full time interviews :)
- strengthen my resume for applying to full time positions

Cons:

- don't make as much money? (not totally sure about this since housing will be paid)
- career starts later?

The classes available to me this Fall vs. next Spring aren't really a factor.

Or maybe I can keep my December graduation and then intern again after that?

Thoughts are much appreciated!

38vdt5,4,2015-06-06,I (29F) am having trouble dealing with a summer apart from my boyfriend (26M)-- Am I being too needy?,LDisabummer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38vdt5/i_29f_am_having_trouble_dealing_with_a_summer/,"This is my first time posting but I'm having a rough night and could use some hopefully kind advice or commiseration of strangers. My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months, we met online on OK Cupid. He is a graduate student and got an internship out of state for the summer and it's really hard. What I can't tell is if I'm making things worse, or if he is, or if there are red flags. Or I don't know I just need some perspective.

Part of the reason it is difficult is because about a month before he was supposed to leave he had a freak out and dumped me. He realized it was a mistake pretty quickly and was mostly a result of stress from exams and things between us getting pretty real. He was practically living with me and we decided to move in together this summer when both of our leases were up. 

Our relationship had been really good up until then, physically, emotionally and otherwise. In many ways I feel like he is my ideal match-- he is handsome, smart, funny, kind, and loves dogs (including my dog!) as much as I do. We didn't really fight, though we did have a few difficult conversations. But we are respectful, honest, and open with each other. We also both make efforts to recognize our own flaws. 

All of this said, the break up did some damage to my trust and security. He has apologized many times and tried to explain things to me so I could trust him again. He said he knew I would have some trust issues for a while and would do whatever he could to help with that. This included him promising to write me a letter every week and visiting once per month during the summer. Well, he has been gone three weeks and I haven't gotten a single letter and it looks like he won't be visiting until early July. This is extra disappointing because we had talked about him coming this weekend for a visit and to help pack. Also I thought it would be nice to see him aroun my birthday, which is a big milestone one next week.

So on top of everything else this means that I have to pack up all my stuff and handle the move into our new place all by myself. Well, mostly, he'll come to day after the movers come and help finish up I guess. It feels crappy to move by myself with no help to start what was supposed to be our new life together. 

We talked about all this for a long time last night because I told him how much all of this bugged me. And he said he wanted to make me happy and he loves me so much, but that he's more independent than I am. He says that his calling and messaging regularly is his way of doing things and that he has trouble remembering to write letters and that I shouldn't take it as a sign that he doesn't love or miss me. He asked me to be patient and instead of getting upset at what he's not doing, and let him surprise me in his own way.

So now I'm still over analyzing things because I'm miserable about this. I really loved how we were together in person and I can't tell if I'm expecting too much or he's giving too little. I explicitly asked him for thoughtful gestures which he agreed to and then he's not following through. And I'm afraid to complain too much (though I always says what's on my mind anyway) because I'm afraid he will dump me again. He reassures me that he no intention to ever ""make that mistake"" again. But still I feel off.

And so then days like today, when I think because it's the weekend he'll have time to talk and I get only two five minute phone calls, I just get so frustrated and hopeless feeling. Maybe I'm overthinking this or being too needy but I also get paranoid he's not as flirty or passionate. 

So strangers of reddit-- any advice, thoughts, or commiseration? Thanks for your help!

------------------------------

**Tl;dr**: My boyfriend of 7 months is gone this summer for an internship and I'm not handling it well, partly because of trust issues from when he broke up with me for a day a while back. Need some advice or cheering up..."

38vgay,22,2015-06-07,We met online...2.5 years ago.,fireducksalamander,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/38vgay/we_met_online25_years_ago/,"Well, it's been a while, reddit! I haven't been on here for like 2 years, I used to check this forum all the time and wanted to write a little something and also wish to all you online lovers out there the best of luck and strength and hope that you all get to meet each other and that everything goes the way you daydream at work or school :)

**How we met online:**

Over Tumblr, in November 2012. I'm from Austria but I went to uni in the Netherlands, and he's Chilean. We were both in uni, and the same age. We instantly felt a connection and flirted a lot, it was cute but bittersweet as we thought we would never meet :/. Since he's super shy we never even had a voice/video call!!

**How we arranged to meet:**

I was extremely lucky because at the time I was in my 3rd semester applying for my 5th semester, in which we could either do an exchange program or an internship of our choice, anywhere in the world. It was sort of a free semester, and I didn't get into any exchange program of my choice so I started applying for internships and thought, hey, why don't I do one in Chile? I thought about it for a long time, all over the Christmas holidays, and eventually asked my parents if they would support me, and they actually agreed. Since South America is quite a popular continent for young people to travel to, and Chile is the safest country, they thought it was cool of me to go, and of course I didn't tell them about my ulterior motives, although I really wanted to, they are quite old-fashioned and just don't get the online thing. Amazingly, I found an internship opportunity at an English language newspaper so I didn't even have to know Spanish, which I knew like 0 words of, but I started taking intensive classes anyway. When I told him he was in SHOCK! Even though we had agreed to be friends we talked every single day and night and were very anxious to meet. He even said he would pick me up from the airport, and I didn't even know what his voice sounded like :P

**Actually meeting:**

So august 21st, my parents drove me to the airport, they still had no clue and I told them my future roommate was going to pick me up from the airport. i don't have that many pictures but to prove that I really did this: [here is me being super nervous and excited on the plane](http://i.imgur.com/5JQX2KC.jpg),  and a picture of the morning before I landed [the sunrise over the Andes mountains](http://i.imgur.com/oi4Nu2Q.jpg). About one and a half days later, I arrive at 9 am in the middle of winter on the other end of the world. This is the exciting part! 

It took forever in immigration, unfortunately for him because he had been waiting for hours and didn't wanna miss me and had to go really badly (he told me later). Finally I arrived at the area to pick up my luggage, which is right next to the visitors area, and there is some kind of balcony with glass overlooking it where visitors can watch the arrivals like some sort of zoo :P. I had a feeling I was being watched so I looked up and standing there was...Jon Snow. But slightly slimmer, Chilean, and wearing jeans and a beige sweater instead of the black. 

I'm never EVER forgetting how it happened. He waved and I died inside, my heart was racing, but I still had to get my suitcase, and was too shy to look up again and went through the last part of customs and when I got out, there were a million people. I looked up and he wasn't there so I walked around and finally saw him so I just went up to him and we hugged for a long time and he said ""finally"" while hugging me and that was the first time I even heard his voice!!!! It was deeper than I imagined. lol. He smelled good.

We went to his apartment which was close to where I had pre-rented my room. I went to take a shower, and then we just talked, and he was *really* quiet and shy. It was awkward as we were both nervous and had been in denial about liking each other for months. But one thing led to another and although this is still a topic of debate it was clearly me who kissed him first *wink wink*. 

**About staying together:**
Everything was exciting, and perfect, and cute at first. We eventually told both our families, and made it official. Then after some time we had to face reality and have 'the talk' because I was obviously going to leave and go back to Europe in January to finish university. With this looming over us we tried to make the best of our time and traveled lots, to the ocean and to the country and eventually the south, it was amazing. Although I hate how I look here is [proof of us with Santiago in the background](http://i.imgur.com/kRxOS06.jpg)

 Uh sorry imgur is being annoying and I can't seem to upload any pics but I'll try later!!

The day I left was the worst day of our lives. I promised him I'd find a way to come back, but he was destroyed inside. The first week he could barely speak, it was like I had died or something. My obsession was only to finish the last semester of uni, and then move to Chile indefinitely, but he had huge doubts about that because he thought I couldn't actually live there, and would eventually just go back to Europe, or lose interest, or find someone else. But the truth is, I had thought about it long and hard and decided it's worth giving it a go, Chile is a breathtakingly beautiful country, Santiago is a nice city to live in, it's economically stable and there's lots of job opportunities, plus it's as safe as any European city.

Anyway the long distance was absolutely terrible for us, it wasn't like before where we were just waiting for a future together, it was crippling, we had fights all the time, he was doing really badly mentally and had to start seeing a psychologist, and I stayed in touch with his family members as well. At some point it just got too bad. I was constantly checking flights. At one point we were at such a low point, I spontaneously booked a flight and visited him for a week. I didn't even tell anyone, especially not my parents. It all went smoothly though and that week with him was so perfect and beautiful. This was around April, and in June he was scheduled to visit me in Europe, which was also amazing. I had booked a one-way flight to Chile for the same time in August. 

**Fast-forward to now**

This part is kind of important for people who are thinking of moving to their partners country and are worried about how to cope with the cultural difference, not knowing anyone and not speaking the language: it's alright, you can do it all. It's not easy but nothing worthwhile ever came easily, right?!

I now live in Chile indefinitely, and I learned to speak Spanish fluently (but we still speak English with each other, old habits die hard). It took a while but it is 100% doable, and man, Chilean Spanish IS HARD. It is NOTHING like Mexican Spanish. Mexicans don't even understand Chileans most of the time. 

I am finishing my bachelor thesis (online), but I want to study for a Master's degree for my career but don't want to go back to Europe and studying in Chile is not an option for me, so I'm applying for a long-distance online Master's degree in the UK. 

I have a part-time job at a restaurant. It's fun and pays alright, if I do enough shifts. I was looking for jobs and got 2 offers instantly, one required a bit too much time commitment for me, and the other one was pretty exploitative, with terrible working hours and low pay. I declined it but unfortunately this happens a lot in this country. You gotta be careful.

I don't actually live with my boyfriend, his living situation is a bit complicated, but I sleep over at his place several days a week. Instead I rent a room not too far away, in a shared house. 

I don't have a group of friends yet but my circle of acquaintances is growing. I volunteer at a dog shelter, which is something I did all the time before I got my job, nowadays I don't have as much time to go :/ I met some pretty awesome people including my current landlady who is a volunteer too. As a result, I live with her, some of her family members and foreigners, and about fifteen rescued dogs. Our house is really laid back and also showed me a completely different side of Chile as they are so different from my boyfriend's family.

Anyway, for anyone who bothered reading my novella, thank you for your interest, I hope you make it, whatever you decide to do. If you are really thinking of making the big move don't let anyone tell you not to do it, just go for it! Make sure you always have some sort of contingency plan, even if it's just some backup money to buy a ticket back home. Think about whether you would stay in the country if you broke up. If you do break up and move back, it will always have been a worthwhile experience. Stay in touch with your family if you can, don't let them worry about you too much or think you have given up on them. Also, get a Kindle. "

This is my first time posting here, I am so glad i found this group of like-minded people because as of now nobody in my life knows about my situation.
My husband and I have been together 9 years (married for 5). I have always known that I never wanted kids and told him so from the beginning. He had wanted kids but since he knew I didn't want them and he wanted to date me he put it off. However, he was always obsessed with my little nephews or other kids from people in his family. Always talking to them in baby voice and chasing them and playing around. Meanwhile I was like ""yuck"". Anyways we lived very happily until September 2014 when he started acting very depressed. He wasn't interested in his usual activities (soccer, video games), he was quiet and withdrawn and around November he stopped wanting sex (which he loved before). I thought it was just due to his depression but a few days ago I found emails full of pictures of him and some nasty girl kissing and hugging, etc. There was also pictures of this girl's little daughter and letter he had written which said he loved being with her during these past 9 months and couldn't wait until they are a family. Of course this girl has a 2 year old daughter and I believe she is married too (in the letter my husband wrote he said something about the girl having to put up with a guy). My first instinct was to kick him out right away but right now I am unemployed because I just graduated with a master's degree 3 weeks ago. I am of course looking for a job every single day but until then I need him unfortunately to help with our mutual bills (I always had a job but stopped last year during my internship). My plan is to find out who that girl is married to and letting her husband know as well as telling my husband's family the real reason why he will be out of my life. He loves to play the good guy and will surely tell them he was just going through depression. I have her email address and name but cannot find her on FB or Instagram. It makes me sick having to have him here in my house and pretend nothing is happening. The day after I found the emails I had a conversation with him to ask how his ""depression"" was going and he kept saying he could tell I wasn't happy and didn't want to hurt me anymore and that's why he believes we should break up. I asked me straight out if he was cheating and looked me in the eyes and said ""no"". I'm sooo mad. I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to write CHEATING BASTARD with spray paint on his new car but the more rational part of me knows I still need him at least until I have secured a job. Anyways I just wanted to vent, sorry it's so long."

38we0q,4,2015-06-07,Clinginess in friendships?,caladhielguar,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/38we0q/clinginess_in_friendships/,"Last year I did an internship at my dream job. My boss, Will, was really supportive and helpful regarding my mental health problems. He said I could talk to him any time if I was struggling, come sit in his office to have a bit of quiet time if I needed it, and gave me a week off when I was having medication-related teething problems. I can't explain how much I valued his attitude - I felt much better in work just knowing he was around if I needed him.

The internship didn't guarantee a position within the department and there were no openings when I finished, so I'm now working elsewhere which is alright. But I really miss Will being in my life. I am very introverted, I don't trust easily and I have an incredibly hard time talking about personal issues even to my partner. I don't make friends easily. When I left the internship, on my last day, he said if I ever needed advice or someone to talk to that he'd always be happy to help. And it's not like I've lost contact with the people I worked with - my parents live in the city the internship was based in so whenever I'm in the area I drop by and see everyone and they are always pleased to see me, Will included. Of course we all connect through facebook as well. 

My issue is that I feel this damned ache for the absence of him. I have had this a handful of times from ""mentor"" figures in my life. I feel like I need him in my life, even if we're only chatting about films or music or whatever, just casual conversation. But every time I try to initiate a conversation with him by email or facebook message, he seems very distant, very cold, and sometimes he just doesn't respond to me at all. I have tried just casually saying hello and asking how things are going several times, and once I asked him for advice on my career. 

I realise he has a very busy schedule. He is a head of department, he has two young kids, and he's had his own issues with mental health in the past. I try very hard not to be clingy because I don't want to be hassling him if he's busy and I don't want to scare him off either. But for some reason I can't manage to initiate a bond with him, or even get him to consistently talk to me. It really upsets me, though I am trying not to let my paranoia and lack of self-esteem put words into his mouth. He seems to talk to the other interns I worked with than to me. One of them is even such good friends with him and his wife that she goes to stay with them sometimes, and they went to visit her in her new job. I wish I could have that sort of friendship with him and I feel like there is something defective about me he wants to steer clear of.

I also worry that he is avoiding talking to me because since I left there have been two posts open within the department and I have applied for both of them, only to be turned down without even an interview or a response, just radio silence. The other manager and several members of the department pointedly asked me if I was applying for both of these positions, telling me to make sure I got my application in on time, and even when a position hasn't been in the offing they have said how they miss having someone competent around at work (the new interns got off to a rocky start from what I hear). I was given a glowing end of year review on leaving and when I've applied for similar jobs they have been excellent references for me. I just don't understand.

How on earth do I get him to just talk to me? How do I keep contact with him when he seemingly only randomly replies to me? 

He messaged me the other day to say he was sorry he didn't get to see me last time I visited and asked how I was. I said I was good, asked him how he was, asked if any of the sweets I'd dropped off for everyone were left when he got back and he didn't reply. After over a week I tentatively messaged him just saying ""Will?"", and he replied the next day just saying ""Hello Caladhiel"", without mention of my previous questions. I asked him again how he was doing. Still no response.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it hurts that someone I looked up to so much and found to be a comfort having around is so lackadaisical about talking to me. Maybe my need to not appear clingy makes him think I don't give a crap, but I have emotional issues that make me very wary of becoming clingy and judgemental. I don't want to fuck up this friendship. What do I do?"

38wltt,1,2015-06-07,I'm not exactly sure how I feel right now... but not good...,extreme_douchebag,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38wltt/im_not_exactly_sure_how_i_feel_right_now_but_not/,"I had been looking for a job for a little over a month.  I finally got a temporary position.  I originally expected to work certain hours for each day, but when they emailed me the offer, it ended up having different hours, and for some reason I accepted without thinking it through (completely my fault).

I don't have a car so I need to use public transportation, but the public transportation doesn't even run at the time I needed it to to start my shift today.  I also have only $50 in my checking account and around $20 of credit left on my credit card.

So, yesterday was my first shift, and it went OK.  I was considering quitting in the back of my mind, but for some reason when my supervisor asked my coworker and I if we were going to come back today I said yes, and then he quickly left before I had time to process what I just said (again, my fault).

So, at this point, every part of my body was telling me to quit because 

* This is a minimum wage job, and I'd have to spend half of my money I'm earning on taxis to get there for the early morning shifts like today and tomorrow (since I live far away, I don't have a car, and the public transportation doesn't operate at that time)
* The job requires me to interact with people and remain upbeat for at least 5 hours in a row, and I already felt drained from the first day, which was going to be far less busy than the next one.  I didn't want to be at work while in apathetic zombie depressed mode.

Anyway... I guess there are some more details but I ended up just quitting right before my shift started this morning.  I feel physically uneasy about this, since everybody there was super nice to me and I basically just abandoned them out of nowhere for reasons that are my fault.  I was the only one there doing my job, so me leaving unexpectedly is bad for them.

I feel like my brain isn't meant for the practical world.  I studied computer science and did two software engineering internships, but my plans to do software engineering full-time de-railed (along with my plans to graduate) when I got hit with mental illness a few years ago.  I've improved a lot, but the general rule that seems to hold these days is that I can only do around 4-5 hours worth of ""serious analytical thinking"" a week, when I used to be able to do 50+.

Just wanted to get this off my chest since I really don't feel so well and hate to let other people down, especially when they had been really nice."

38wv19,12,2015-06-07,Questions about very rapid weight loss,muwa,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/38wv19/questions_about_very_rapid_weight_loss/,"Hi /r/loseit I'm Male, 21, 5'10"" and 194 lbs. 

A little back story: In high school I was 165 lbs and a competitive swimmer on a national level (trained 4 hours a day 5 days a week). Once I went away to college I stopped doing cardio all together and just lifted on and off for periods of about 2 months at a time. I also partied....a lot. I would go out 5 nights a week and probably would have around 10 drinks a night on average and my weight more or less tapered off at around 190-195 lbs. My lifestyle was very sedentary and I would eat out pretty much every meal. 

After I graduated in May, I decided that I would pick myself up by my bootstraps and get fit. This summer I am working in Germany for two months for an internship before I start my masters and this has given me a lot of motivation because absolutely everyone under the age of 40 here is in very good shape. What I've been doing:

* Cut out drinking altogether (5000 cal deficit per week)
* I run for 30 minutes every other day (usually about a 5k which is 425 ish calories according to Runtastic)
* Started eating a bowl of cornflakes for breakfast (~200 cal) and usually having a salad for lunch and dinner (~500 to 600 calories each)
* Started doing a lot of walking since driving isn't and option (maybe a mile or more each day).

Doing some back of the napkin calculations I am creating a 11,800 cal deficit per week  which roughly translates into 3.4 pounds per week. I have read that it is unsafe to lose more than 2 pounds a week and I am worried that instead of burning fat that I will start burning muscle. Is what I am doing relatively safe or should I try doing something else? "
38xl44,1,2015-06-07,"Just Started An IT Internship, Am I being Taxed Too Much?",ShohLy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/38xl44/just_started_an_it_internship_am_i_being_taxed/,"Hi Friends,


I'm not sure if this is the right place but I'm a bit confused about my paycheck. I'm a 20 y/o Sophomore heading into my Junior year this Fall majoring in Computer Science. I started an internship last week making $16/hr. I received my first paycheck for the first week I worked (40 hours @ $16/hour = $640 before tax). I noticed that I was hit pretty heavily on taxes, much more than I'm used to when I was working at other places. After taxes, it was about $520. At my previous job, I worked part time for my school and was being taxed about 15%. It seems like I'm being taxed ~22%. On my paystub, I had to pay Social Security Tax and Medicare tax while I didn't have to at my part time job. Is that because I'm working full time now? I don't have much experience with this. 

Some info:

I still live at home with just my mom in New York City. She can't physically work and receives government assistance. Most of my college tuition is paid for via scholarships and grants (I go to a local state college neaby). I plan on saving 85% of the money. Is there anything specific I should be doing with it, which should be a little over 6k after taxes. 



Thanks For The Help."
38xlmn,53,2015-06-07,Saw Father John Misty Perform Last Night [Show Review/Essay],art36,indieheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/38xlmn/saw_father_john_misty_perform_last_night_show/,"So, I went to see Father John Misty in Pittsburgh last night. I only recently became interested in his music, but *I Love You, Honeybear* is my AoTY at the moment and ""Holy Shit"" is the best song of the year that I've heard thus far (just my opinion), so my expectations for the show are running relatively high.

Anyway, this show is interesting because it is being played in a small music hall in a 100 year-old library about 10 minutes outside the city. As someone who covers live music in the city, this is far from a normal Saturday night in terms of live music options; Taylor Swift is playing Heinz Field (stadium the Steelers play in), Dave Matthews Band is playing the 20,000+ capacity music amphitheater, and there are a plethora of other shows vying for the attention of music lovers and concert goers, but here I was with about 800-1000 other fans who decided to forego the other options that would seem more desirable to most folks to attend this show.

I didn't initially plan on posting a show review here or elsewhere. I was just going to share this funny sort of story of what happened prior to the show. As my buddy and I waited for the openers to begin their set (Mini Mansions), we had some drinks outside the venue (the volunteers from the library were selling wine and beer outside). It was a gorgeous summer day and we were enjoying the early evening drinking alcohol from solo cups before the show.

The venue is nestled on a hill that overlooks a Victorian-styled park with a gazebo and carefully-crafted flower beds. As my friend and I finish our conversation criticizing all of the shitty parking jobs along the street (About 20 yard away from where we are standing) I suddenly notice a man strolling carelessly down the street with cigarette in hand. As soon as I recognize that is Josh Tillman, Father John Misty, the man of the evening, he looks up and we make eye-contact. 

Now, I've worked in live music for several years (although I currently work in finance) and I know better than to make a scene or really do anything to cause attention or something unwarranted, I just smile and raise my solo cup as a nice kind but subtle gesture. He grins as he continues along the sidewalk and emphatically raises his hand with his imaginary solo cup to return the gesture. It was the perfect little interaction: nothing to get held up, no words were shared, but there was a mutual sort of respect and honesty that was really neat. I've had the pleasure of meeting several notable musicians in various circumstances (Alice Cooper, Chris Cornell, Tegan and Sara, and Matt Berninger among others), but this was probably my favorite and most candid interaction.

Soon thereafter we finished our drinks and entered the venue. The openers, Mini Mansions, were ok in every sense of the word. The lead singer, in a very gimmicky sense, played the percussion during their set. They have a very poppy sound, and for the first time in my life I honestly felt that a drum machine would sound so much better in a live show for a band than whatever this guy was doing. It wasn't a bad performance, though, but it was very forgettable.

We waited in our seats during the intermission and saw the stream of additional concert-goers fill into the music hall. The music playing during the intermission was almost entirely spaghetti western themed music, which was surprisingly very entertaining! The song prior to FJM taking the stage was actually the theme song from [Django/Django Unchained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAooXLAPoBQ)! As soon as the final notes sounded, the lights dimly lowered.

The set opened with the title track/album opener ""I Love You, Honeybear."" The song on the record is very sublime and not very anthemic, but FJM came running onto the stage and absolutely belted out the song. I had watched several of his performances online prior to the show, but this was very unexpected. He ran around the stage flailing the microphone stand and then crashing down to his knees as he sang. 

One thing I need to point out, especially to folks who've never seen Father John Misty live, is that Josh Tillman has a booming voice. The entire music hall rang with his words through each and every song. The amount of confidence and stage presence he had was on par with great rock frontmen like Mick Jagger. Most indie or folk frontmen are very reserved and let their songs do most of the talking, so to speak, but FJM's stage antics were very much an integral component of the show as he seemingly acted out each song. I don't think I've ever used the phrase ""Folk rock star,"" but that is precisely what he was and is. 

As the set continued, each song built upon the previous one, and there was no signs of him slowing down. Most shows I attend, an act may start strong or start slow, but then things tend to settled down, but this was never the case as each song continued to maintain the same level of energy and commitment to execution. Each break between songs was filled rapturous applause followed by friendly banter.

The final song of the main set was ""Holy Shit,"" and it was played to absolute perfection. The song started out with just him on stage playing an acoustic guitar, as the song progressed each member of his band slowly crept up to their position on stage and awaited what was to come. Just as the song crescendos on the album, the band began to essentially play shrieking noise (very similar to when Wilco performs ""Via Chicago"" live), and then perfectly continued in unison with the final verses. Tillman leaped out into the crowd as he belted out the final words and crawled over seats to stand. It was absolutely glorious to see a musician so captivated and seeing the true meaning of the words really wash over himself as he sang to the crowd. He returned to the stage with a huge tear in the right knee of his suit pant leg. I don't know if it was a cheap suit from Macy's or an Armani suit, but I don't think it would've changed FJM's mind to bear his soul to the audience.

And I think that is what makes Father John Misty' music so enthralling. Sure, I've heard and read that people think he is pretentious and whatnot, but he certainly does not lack sincerity. There's no doubt that he has a sizable ego, but his music certainly holds up to that standard in my eyes (and ears). It was beyond impressive to see an artist completely devoted to truly becoming the master of their own sound. It felt like seeing Dylan perform in 1964 or Neil Young in 1975. You truly feel in awe of an artist realizing and reaching their full potential.

My final words would simply be to go see him play live if he is touring in your city or nearby. It was a truly mesmerizing experience, and I don't say that lightly. I used to intern at a live music venue where I saw a few hundred performances, and I still go to quite a few shows (just this week I saw Tame Impala, My Morning Jacket, and Jenny Lewis, and I'll be seeing The War on Drugs next week), and this might've been the very best show I've ever seen. It was funny to think of, literally, the hundreds of thousand of concert goers who will be talking about their time at Taylor Swift or Dave Mathews come Monday, but I honestly feel that they missed what will probably be the best live performance in the city all year.

For the sake of discussion, though, feel free to share your thoughts if you've seen or plan on seeing Father John Misty live and if you agree/disagree with my synopsis. "
38xluu,2,2015-06-07,Web Local Dev Environment,Sraaz,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/38xluu/web_local_dev_environment/,"Hi,

I started a project as the sole developer two years back as an intern. It had all the problems you would imagine an intern project would have. No source control, a single server which was both my dev and prod environment, etc, etc. 

It got popular and I was handed a junior developer. I added a prod server, database, git repo with auto deployment to our dev server. Myself or the other dev could create a branch on our repo, and it would automatically be added to our development server. I've been meaning to make some improvements so we could do local dev before things arrived on our dev server. The problem with the current setup is you need to commit all changes to see whatever tweak you've done, and it takes 6-10 seconds for the changes to appear.

I've been told that I will soon have 4 more developers (2 interns, 2 full time employees. half Windows, half Macs), and I felt the need to spend some time on local development. 

I previously dived into Vagrant, got things setup, but things were incredibly slow (external db call returned about 80 characters and took 8 seconds). I left it for a bit since I got a little busy. I decided to pick it up again to see if I could fix the speed issue. As I tried to get someone else set up, I ran into issue after issue* and I can't convince myself this is easier or more useful than just telling everyone ""set up your own LAMP or WAMP stack with OCI8 and install node"".

The application uses Redhat OS, Apache, PHP (to talk to Application Database and Active Directory), and an Oracle Database. The server also runs some node scripts for some back end data collection and manipulation. 

What can I do to get all these people I am handed set up so they can start developing? Is there really no simple way to make changes and see them quickly?

**tldr; current dev setup is awful, vagrant is not easy to use, what can I offer my co-workers for local development**

Thanks!

*Incase anyone wanted details on issues I ran into while trying to re-install vagrant:

*  [They needed to install Powershell 3.0, despite the requirement not being mentioned in Vagrant](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3139)
* [Their path could not have a space](http://steve-jansen.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/tips-for-vagrant-on-windows/)
* [They were prompted for some password and told to try a fresh installation (which this was)](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5153)

At this point I gave up and decided to see if there is a better way."
38xtnm,7,2015-06-07,Computer Science with very little statistics background wanting to go into quantitative trading,csQuantTrading,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38xtnm/computer_science_with_very_little_statistics/,"I am a computer science major at a highly ranked school who has experience in mostly software development. Lately I've become interested in quantitative trading and had a few questions about how to get into this field. 

Although I consider myself to be a talented programmer, I don't have a background in statistics and have only ever had to take the intro cs stats class at my school. From what I've heard, getting an internship at a top quantitative trading firm requires some kind of mathematical genius in linear algebra and statistics.

 How true are these claims, and how should I prepare for this kind of interview as a cs major with little background in stats/linear?"
38xuct,382,2015-06-07,"My SO [24M] always pulls the ""If you really love me you would..."" card and I [22F] am so sick of it.",ifyoureallyloveme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38xuct/my_so_24m_always_pulls_the_if_you_really_love_me/,"I hear it at least once every two weeks or so, whether it be in text or conversation, and it's starting to piss me off. It's his way of asking me to do things for him, and here's the thing--*I would do them, if only he worded it differently*. I've already asked him to stop using the phrase, and told him in response that I love him with all of my heart, but to no avail. It actually isn't the asking me to do things that's the problem, it's the fact that he seems to have a habit of using that phrase. I don't want to blow this up and make it a bigger deal that it already is, but at the same time I hate how he seems to casually uses our relationship as leverage to get me to do things for him/us.


Obviously, our relationship is still very brand new (4 mo), and I am willing to take the time to work on and move past this issue with him. I think he's a great guy, but when I go to my friends for advice on this problem, they tell me to stay away, and that it's a hint about his personality and how he views me and my role in the relationship. They fear that our relationship will evolve into an emotionally abusive one, and that I'll end up as some sort of servant to cater to his needs.

   
**tl;dr**: BF constantly uses the phrase ""If you really love me you would..."". Is this something I can fix, or a sign of a toxic relationship worth breaking up over?



Edit 1: Wow I wasn't really expecting this to blow up as much as it did. Thank you all SO much for your responses. I'm sitting here in bed reading up on emotionally abusive relationships and I'm starting to feel like I've only given one side of the story. It's quite hard for me to believe that our relationship could escalate into something like what I’ve been reading, because I love him more than I've loved anybody else that I've been in a relationship with. And I know that he loves me, he tells me that every single day. I haven't explained adequately enough how great of a guy he is and how much I respect him and trust him with my life. The good and compassionate person in me has overlooked this problem every time it comes up, and right now I'm wondering if just a little bit more love, affection, and understanding from me will help him get over whatever complex he is internally dealing with.


In terms of ending the relationship now, it’s something I don’t want to think about. As I reflect deeper and deeper on our relationship, in these past couple hours I’ve realized how obsessive he is about having control over me and my feelings. The friend problem is a big one, as I’ve realized that my social life completely revolves around his. Our relationship has definitely evolved to one where I feel like I am in debt to him, because he’s helped me so much school and career-wise. Not so much financially, luckily enough, but it is because of him that I have my current internship and can go to my future grad school. So if we were to break up, if he wanted to he could basically make my life hell on earth.


I guess one more thing you guys should know and are going to go apeshit over is that he’s had a physically abusive past. When I first met him, he was going through a breakup, catalyzed by a fight he had had with his ex one night. He punched a wall and pounded his fists on the bed where she was sitting, giving her some bruises. Now when he asked me out he promised me he would never lay a hand on me, and that promise has been upheld. I do feel safe with him, as we have resolved arguments civilly and successfully, but at the same time I know the damage his unrestrained temper can cause.


I’m sorry this post is such a mess. I don’t really know what to do or think. Like I said before, I have asked him to stop using the phrase and told him that I don’t like it, but he responds as if he is acting in my best interest and that I don’t know what’s good for me. I’ve never pressed the issue any further than that, simply because threatening break up over a simple request for food seems makes me feel delusional and crazy, as well as a little bit scared of what could happen.

What are the job prospects for a fresh college grad who knows some Ruby on Rails? I'm willing to pick up new languages and frameworks based on whatever job I get.

I can't find anything in the r/montreal subreddit rules against this, but mods, feel free to remove.]

Hi there,

I arrived here in late April for a summer internship at a start-up. It turns out we weren't a very good match, which means my next few months will be very open. I'm trying my very best to get myself to daily events I find through Facebook in hopes of establishing friendship(s), but I'd like to exhaust every avenue for finding them, reddit included.

A little bit about me: I'm 21, a fourth-year university student majoring in Computer Science, minoring in French. I'm a small-circle-of-friends kind of guy; I have one very close friend back home, two a bit more distant, but apart from them it's just acquaintances. I'm very devoted to queer, feminist, and racial equality causes and have spent much of these last few years back home doing activist work. (I'd like very much to get involved with similar things here.) I'm a nerd who loves tech, but also language; sudden realisations that previously unlinked words in my mind have common etymology gets me as excited as unboxing my latest device. Late night talks with friends are some of my favourite things in the world; I'm infinitely happier waking up after having spent all night emotionally bonding through debate than rising at morning having bonded sexually. I don't speak French very well at all, but enjoy making a game out of finding the words to communicate existent in my present vocabulary (again, language nerd). Finding someone at my level (that of an early primary school student, perhaps) and amused by similar follies would be super.

As I stated, I have much free time, so it would be ideal to find someone who's similarly uncommitted. Excursions together at least a few times a week, dining at new restaurants, walking around new parks, spending nights together talking on the couch, etc., would be great. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm searching for intimacy, yes, but emotional intimacy, not sexual; I'm an ardent supporter of the theory that attraction takes many forms, some of which couldn't be more distant from genitalia.)

I think that's it for now. I'll edit later if I come to realise I've left out anything critical. Please, feel free to reply or inbox. I'm posting this on a Sunday afternoon (7 June), and would love to grab drinks or a cup of coffee together anytime, be it to-night, to-morrow, or this week-end!

Thank you kindly,

I use a 3d printer at an internship I have right now all the time, and I really want one for myself, and the simple metal looks to be the best option for me.  The one thing that I am worried about is the sound that a 3d printer makes.  I am still in high school, so I still obviously live with my parrents, and they are a little concerned about the sound that the printer would make.  I plan to have it in my room on my desk, and I personally am a very heavy sleeper that has slept through my step dad installing shingles on the roof above my head, but my mother and sister are both very sensitive to sound.  My basic question is on a scale of 1 to 10, one being something quiet like a computer case fan, and 10 being something like a clothes washing machine, just how loud is the simple metal?  Also, if anyone else has been in my situation what have you done to quiet the printer down?"

38yhrg,3,2015-06-07,"I [21M] was just dumped by my girlfriend [20F] of two years. Left on good terms, says she's always a phone call away. Wants to give things another go in the future.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38yhrg/i_21m_was_just_dumped_by_my_girlfriend_20f_of_two/,"Background: Started dating in high school, carried it into college. Been together for about 2 years and 4 months. I'm out of state for a summer internship. We did long distance for my entire freshman year of college (she was still a senior in high school).

My girlfriend dumped me. We're long distance right now and we recently had a pretty huge fight. I thought we had recovered, but I was really needy for a week and was constantly asking for reassurance. I think it annoyed her and she couldn't handle how overbearing I was being. We only lasted a week after the fight. Other than that, I really thought the relationship was going great and I think she would agree.  I'm so confused as to how a rough week can destroy everything. She was so overbearing at times during my freshman year yet I always stuck with her and helped her through it. I've RARELY had to lean on her for emotional support. Seriously, maybe only a couple times.

She says that she has some soul searching to do and needs to be happy with herself before she can be there for me again. She says that this isn't my fault, and that she doesn't expect me to completely understand, but to just give her some space for now. She also wants to give things another go when we return back to school in August. She wants to remain loyal to one another until then and she promises not to hook up with other guys (I would find out pretty quickly since we have the same friend group back home). She says she still wants to get married, have children, and live happily ever after with me. She swears that this is just her working through some personal issues before moving forward.

I'm absolutely devastated. I'm across the country living by myself without any friends or family. I have no idea how I'm going to keep up with work in addition to taking a couple online classes. She said she still loves me and that she'll always be there for me and that if I ever need to call her I can. As much as I'd love to take up her offer, I think it'll just make things more painful for me and only decrease our chances of getting back together. I feel so betrayed after everything I've done for her.


Should I call? Should I give things another shot after she gave up on our relationship so easily? How do I trust her to be in it for the long run if she can't tough it out for a week? Are all ""breaks"" bullshit?

**tl;dr**: Dumped by girlfriend. She wants to give things another shot when we return back to school (August) when she's done working out some personal issues. She says I can call her whenever I need to if I'm ever feeling lonely. Do I call? Do I give things another shot?"
38yjyb,2,2015-06-07,Moving without a job lined up or job searching after moving?,sailboatsairplanes,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/38yjyb/moving_without_a_job_lined_up_or_job_searching/,"This fall, I'm hopefully moving from FL to a town right outside of Austin, TX in hopes to close the gap with my long distance boyfriend of more than two years. We've been talking about me moving for quite some time and we're both antsy to make it happen. I'm just waiting for my SO to be done with his current military training. 

I'm 23 and have worked at my current job as a PR coordinator for a hotel company for more than a year. By the time I move, I should have 1.5 years experience at this job, as well as several years of internship experience from my college days. 

I know the general advice is to land a job before moving, and I will be looking online the months leading up, but is it really so bad to job search when I arrive? I'll have a good chunk of money saved ($20k+), and I'll be moving in with my SO, who makes a decent amount also. So bills and rent and stuff won't all be shouldered by me. I've just been waiting so long to close the gap with my SO, I really can't see myself waiting longer, but at the same time this is probably my biggest anxiety about moving. Also, after graduating college, I went straight into working at my job and I never really got a long break. I was kind of hoping I'd take time to settle in and that could also serve as a bit of a break. My other reasoning is that I know PR jobs can hire quickly, so if I move and have a local address on my resume, perhaps I'll have an easier time looking. 

I guess I'm looking for advice and experience from others who've experienced this before. Am I being totally naive about this?"

Let me start by saying I am 21 and in general I have been having digestive problems for about a month and a half. THe digestive problems started out with serious amount of nausea, constipation, lack of appetite, bloating, abdominal pain, and vomiting (that occurred once). Went to the ER and they did a CT scan where I had to drink a ton of contrast. The results of that showed that all of the contrast stayed in my stomach even after two hours so they suspected gastroparesis but referred me to a gastroentrologist. They saw nothing else. 

Gastroenterologist saw me for an appointment and on describing everything he told me he wanted to do an EGD and a Gastric Emptying Time Scan. He did some prodding around at my abdomen but I wasn't tender or what have you so I guess that was okay. EGD happens and everything is normal. Gastric Emptying Time Scan, normal. Even a barium x-ray thing that was similar to the gastric time scan (they tried to see how long it would take to fill my bowel), normal. Everything so far screams ""normal."" He told me I have a lazy colon and just need to have Miralax twice a day. Bisacodyl if I haven't gone in several days.  Through all of this the only time i have a full bowel movement (still until now) is if I take bisacodyl and miralax and get to where I have diarrhea. 

Now I am incredibly stressed because I was getting all of these tests done rapidly because I had to leave for Dubai for an unpaid internship with IBM on May 30th. The trip itself has been fine so far. I am still adjusting to the whole 8 hour difference thing but I am continuing on my path of being unable to eat, unable to have a bowel movement, nausea etc. What is changing is I am noticing that I am constantly going to the bathroom like I need to have a bowel movement (I feel like I can) but nothing comes of it. If I do manage to pass a small amount of stool there is a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper and this has been going on since approximately Thursday. I called my doctor at home on Friday. Also when I urinate (especially if I am siting down), when I stand up or start to walk a little I dribble urine. This urine complaint has gone on for about a week and a half but it didn't seem like anything but it seems to be getting slightly worse over time and to be honest like I said I am getting crazy worried so I can't help but think it is a huge problem now. They said to call again on Monday if it persists, which I will but due to time differences and when this doctor gets in I probably won't hear from them fully about what to do or think for at least another 14 hours. Looking at all the tests they did, they (I think) hardly really checked my colon and this terrifies me to an extent now as well.

Anyways I think I have given a ton of information and I hope that is enough for some of you guys to maybe help me out with regard to giving me a reasonable outlook on what is going on... I have done my best to ignore WebMD results that say things like cancer and mainly look at just symptoms to see what might match up with a Lazy Colon + something that isn't crazy. Maybe just IBS and a Hemorrhoid? I just don't know anymore. 

I also welcome any advice on how to receive international healthcare. From what I understand there is a Health Card I can apply for which I am going to apply for tomorrow but I am pretty sure Total Health Care (though the Governemnt, I am a poor college kid) will cover international medical costs so that is part of my stress too.

Thanks for reading. 


EDIT: It might also be worth note that I am 5'4"" and about 145 lbs.

EDIT2: I have been taking bisacodyl over the course of about a month in general by recommendation from him. Same with miralax. My miralax dosage increased to twice a day when he said. Also when it comes to food intake I am looking at STRUGGLING to have a meal and a half a day. "

38ypvc,3,2015-06-07,I wished I got into Computer Science,missgalvin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38ypvc/i_wished_i_got_into_computer_science/,"I always liked computers. My first contact was when my big bro, who was graduating at the time, got a PC so he could write his thesis. Very quicky I learned what I could - only the basics, how to run a game from DOS, simple stuff.

However, there was something that ruined the scenario: I never got into Math. We lived near an Engineering School - ended up knowing a lot of people from there, even dating some - and everytime I stared at the building, I got sad because I knew I couldn't get into computing and into that school because I was terrible in Math. So I grew up believing that I would end up studying foreign languages.

And now here I am. I'm 30 and back to my parents' place. Years ago I graduated from Modern Languages, finally ending the long ""suffering"": I never enjoyed my course and never believed I could change to another thing. I hated myself and had settled to a career in Technical Translation.
The internship actually helped me realize that I could learn what I wanted. Two years later, I gave up on Translation and stated studying on my own.

I tried what I could. Did a short course on Programming. Learned about the history of the Internet on Coursera. Started studying for certificates and got an CompTIA A+ cert. Still studying for network certifications. Meanwhile got interested in Web Developing as well.

Sometimes it hits me. I've read about the differences between Computer Engineering and Computer Science and my heart believes CS should have been my choice. I learned to enjoy Math, have been doing Khan Academy for a while... but here I am. On my 30s, accepting my bad choices, unemployed, without much money, struggling with Depression, watching my friends leaving the country or furfilling what they wanted, and what's there for me? Call centre jobs and getting the minimum wage (which is about 500 euro)? 

I just wished I had taken another path..."
38yqbo,4,2015-06-07,Me [24F] with my sister [19F] she refuses to grow up and take responsibility for her life (long),Ash_Fire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38yqbo/me_24f_with_my_sister_19f_she_refuses_to_grow_up/,"Hello. I will apologize in advance for the length as I like my storytelling to be thorough.

So, of my sisters and I, there's me ""Peter Perfect"" (24F), my middle sister ""The Rebel"" (20F), and ""The Oddball"" (19F). True to those nick-names you can guess how our family views us individually. I did all the things in high school, went to the family alma mater for college, and graduated and got a long internship right out of school. One can argue that where my family is concerned, I did everything ""right."" The Rebel also did a lot of things in high school, not quite to the extent that I did, but found her own expression different from mine (which we happily discuss when talking about our various projects). She's now in an art college, and doing quite well from what I can gather. 

The Oddball didn't really do much. For starters, when she was a young teenager, she was diagnosed with Aspergers, and had a specific medication that she hated taking to help her focus at school. Her social life wasn't great, and frankly it didn't help that she would get reamed by The Rebel at home when anything set her off (although some of that was a call to do her work). She started to do some extracurriculars, but quit many of them as soon as she figured out she didn't have to participate if she didn't want to. The only thing she stuck with were dance classes, that I think were the only thing in her life that gave her a real sense of obligation (but for whatever reason the school play did not- possibly because of my involvement years before). 

Her school work was a mess. If she wasn't satisfied with the work, she wouldn't turn it in, even if she knew it was something like a paper she would be getting back to make corrections before the final grade. Or, the more common case, if she didn't want to do homework, she would go play video games, particularly ones where it's not hard to lose a few hours playing. Not to hate on video games, I like playing them too (and even watch different YouTubers play the ones I'll never buy b/c I can't afford them), but she's totally in the whatever game it is to get lost in it. Even getting her drivers permit and license were tough because she just would not study, despite the direct correlation of its usefulness. She was finally convinced when Daddy said, ""Ok, let's walk to school so we know how long it's going to take."" She got it almost immediately thereafter. 

Between me, my other sister and my dad, we had a hell of a time convincing her that she must do her homework if she was going to graduate (she almost did not graduate with her class and was almost forced to take summer classes). Nearly every conversation that was about what she was going to do would end in her screaming and crying in frustration ""I Don't Know!"" shortly followed by her escaping back to video game land. (My mom was the only person who could convince her without or with less tears than we conjured. She passed a few years ago.) Through many tears, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, she did graduate high school. 

So came the inevitable question: what's next? She had applied to a few schools, but nothing too serious (also a hard time scheduling things like SATs/ACTs). Although if you asked her, she would say that she wants to professionally be on the storyboard team for video game companies. So, the summer started she had no idea what to do next, when she finally got an acceptance letter. Again with much badgering, we got the ball rolling and she was in college.  A new environment where she doesn't really *have* to do anything, she was put on academic probation her first semester. She failed to get out of it that next semester, and will not be returning next fall. Daddy has said she must get a job or he's going to kick her out. I don't like it, because she really has nowhere to go, but at the same time the only proven motivator for her is being forced into the worst case scenario. It's been a little more than a month since she put applications in. She's had one interview and didn't get the job. She has yet to continue job hunting.

Reddit, how can my family instill motivation in her, without resorting to the worst case scenario, when even she doesn't know what motivates her?



   
**tl;dr**: My sister is a massive gamer, and wants to do it professionally as a writer but is too lazy take the necessary steps to get there. She's now in the beginning of the downward spiral that will lead to the worst case scenario. How to motivate?"
38yqur,0,2015-06-07,[Under the radar] Arozak Salam Indonesia's first Mr. Gay world delegation on 2014. Will be any delegation on 2015?,drugar48,indonesia,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/38yqur/under_the_radar_arozak_salam_indonesias_first_mr/,"I know it's outdated, but it's worthy to share. Before i'm plunge into the main course, here's link that could give you a glimpse on what is Mr.Gay World, what are the goals and vision and mission [About Mr.Gay World](http://www.mrgayworld.com/about-us/) and [Mr.Gay World Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Gay_World)

&amp;nbsp;

Not much that i can tell you about [Arozak salam](http://imgur.com/PIBhxtm) because of the limitation of information that i could find. Arozak Salam was alumni of Institut Tekonologi Bandung (ITB) year 2005-2009 focusing on Ocean engineering, previously work as announcer at Oz Radio Bandung on 2007, had an internship as Coastal Engineering at Ausenco Sandwell on 2010 and now currently live in Australia. Ozak as he referring himself, enter Mr.Gay World pageant while he is still 26 years old. the pageant itself  was held in Rome from August 24 - August 31 2014. Voluntarily joining the contest, he seems has a high concern on LGBTIQ community in Indonesia.Even though he wasn't obtained a place in any category, but his deeds and spirit will be inspiring others LGBTIQ youth especially in Indonesia.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the transcript from his Q &amp; A that he made:

&amp;nbsp;

**Hi Ozak, I’m sure not many people know you at this stage. Can you introduce yourself to the world?**

Okay, in a short way, I’m a half hippy and half corporate

**What do you mean?**

Yeah, I am a free spirit. I’m not my hair. I’m not my skin. I am a soul that lives within. I like to sing and dance especially in the rain. On the other hand, I am a subsea engineer. I like to get lost infront of computer analysing wave fatigue analysis on the drilling riser. I occasionally like wearing a suit. So, I see myself as a half hippy and half corporate.

**Good to know. Let’s talk more about your participation in Mr.Gay World 2014. How did you hear about this event?**

I think I knew it before from the news. When I mentioned to my housemate that I wanted to join, his response was like “Is that for gay people?” and I just nodded. Apparently my straight friend willing to take part the competition as well.

**Hahahaha, he needs to confirm to the committee first for the eligibility. What made you decide to join then?**

 I have personal reason which I cannot tell you in this interview because I want to address this matter direcly in the competition later. But I can give you other reason which is “visibility”. In my home country, the majority of LGBT people still live under the radar. We do exist, but we are still considered as a joke sometimes. We are there among the society, but there is still a huge barrier to assimilate with them. It’s difficult to apprehend the good side of us when the stigma still dominate our portrait. The combination of social norm and religious perception towards LGBT people is still the biggest burden for us to make peace within ourselves.

After the visibility comes “tolerance”. I am grateful enough to be able to live overseas and do bit of travelling. While many asian LGBT still struggle with their identity to fit in to the society in home country, I find other challenges within LGBT community itself that sometimes the gay scene can be more cruel than you can ever imagined. No black, no asian, no white, no feminine, no over 30. Hung only. Hairy only, Manly only, Top only.

Well you know what, I am going to step up on the world stage for you all to see me whatever I am. I am all the rejection that you can address. I am all the unticked criterias that you required. At the same time, I am the reality. This shape, face, race, voice are there on the stage for you to see me. You don’t have to love me, you don’t have to accept me. Only this time, I ask you to see me. If thousands of me appear and you become familiar with it, I hope your tolerance level might improve slightly better.

**Ok, it’s getting too serious here and I’m not sure if I can digest all your information. Anyway, how is the preparation so far?**

So far so good. A good friend of mine helping me with the national costume. My friends keep sending the support through private message and online voting. The rest it’s just managing the expectation, really. Luckily I got upcoming holiday so I can indulging myself to refresh my mind. Hopefully I don’t go too crazy.

**Just random question, are you top or bottom?**

What kind of question is this? I will answer that on grindr if you insist.

**Just random question again, do you think size matter?**

I’m glad you ask. Ehmm, but why is it important for you to know? (awkward silent for a while).

**Well, it’s been a pleasure to have a chat with you then. Goodluck for the competition ahead.**

What? That’s it? No more question? Ask me more!!!

First of all thank you for your time.

**Background Information:** I am a 2nd year CS student. I'm doing well in my CS courses, I've completed many personal projects such as 3D OpenGL games, Android Apps, Websites, etc. Programming has been an area of fun and interest for me thus far.

**My Problem:** 

   I have recently started a Java Internship at a big company. It has only been my first week so far and my main boss (boss A) was gone this week. Boss A informed my second boss (boss B) of my programming task. This information is relevant because I have not been allowed to work on other projects until boss A returns. Long story short I need to work with a library called JRJC. I also need to use Maven in order to work with JRJC.

**Monday-Wednesday:**
During these days I spent my time getting situated in the company, researching my assignment, and waiting for an appointment to get JDK installed on my laptop. I had to first email a manager explaining why I needed JDK and then wait for someone to physically install it for me.

**Thursday:**
More struggle just trying to setup Maven with JRJC. At this point in time I've had two separate employees try to help me and they couldn't resolve the issues. I finally met with a third employee who sent me in the right direction.

**Friday:**
More struggle trying to setup Maven. I learned that another issue I was having was that Eclipse wasn't setup for the proxy / firewall that the company was under.

So at my first week I completed 0 lines of code. I still don't have Maven and JRJC working with Eclipse. When I wasn't bashing my head against the keyboard trying to get it work I was spending my times researching the technologies and APIs related and discovering alternatives to JRJC (and there are a lot of alternatives).

It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to setup an API. I have never had so much trouble trying to setup a project. I can't tell how much my lack of experience is effecting me or if I have been given a annoying project.

**Current Plan:**
So Monday I will meet with my main boss (boss A) and explain what my current situation is. I have plenty of alternatives to suggest and new ideas on how to solve the current Maven + JRJC issue.

**1.**
I understand that big companies need to be safe and careful but it's incredibly painful having to call the help desk every time I want to use command prompt in administration mode. How ss this the best solution for companies?

**2.**
Could I be doing something more in my situation? I already asked if I could help other employees with their work. How much time should I be spending at home trying to figure this out? As an intern is this expected?

**3.**
How can I demonstrate my ability to code without even being able to setup dependencies?

**4.**
What next steps should I be taking?

Thank you so much for your time and for reading.

TL;DR: I can't setup JRJC for Eclipse + M2E (maven). It's been a week now at my internship. It's extremely stressful spending day after day trying to setup dependencies for a project without being able to code anything.

I'm just kind of lost, and I don't know how to manage this summer in the best way.

About me:

Major in Computer Engineering, 3.81 GPA, ideally two more semesters left. I don't expect to get less than a 3.75 or more than a 3.85 by graduation.

I want to go to grad school for either Electrical Engineering or Robotics (Engineering), or something along those lines. I don't know where the connection between grad school and career is. Career-wise, I ideally want to do something medicinal/health-related like prosthetics or meaningful to life/science.

I go to a state school. (UMBC, if it matters.)

Two internships, last summer at NASA GSFC and this summer at JHU APL. Was a TA last semester for a circuits class. 

I did some research in Fall '14 and less in Spring '15, and I'm trying to finish my project this summer and hopefully get a paper done before applications -- I'm not sure how much time this leaves me. Honestly, I've been a pretty shit researcher; the project has been difficult to manage, especially since I'm basically the only one ""working"" (and I use this severely loosely) on it, and it's not exactly a career/study interest. Now, I feel as if it's too late to get onto a new project and expect it to help me with applications. Would it? (Even if it did, I would have to severely rearrange my classes, since next semester will be really bad.)

I intend to take the GRE this summer, provided that I need to. Which I'm assuming that I do.

I should be able to get pretty good/decent LOR from either internship supervisors, but I'm not sure if these matter. I could get a fairly good one from a professor I've taken several classes with, I think. My research mentor, no idea. Probably not, 'cuz I suck.
- - - - 
I'm not sure how I want to continue. If I get a job offer from a place I like, I think I'd take it.

Based on what I've said, where could I reasonably get into? If I stay in-state, I want to go to JHU. I've thought of Carnegie Mellon and some big-names, but, again, no clue how I compete.

Life is hard. Yikes."

I can finish my degree (Major in stats, minor in CS) in three semesters (including the current summer semester) and be done in April. A Major would take two more semesters on top of the two that I'm already doing anyways for the minor (and to finish the stat degree). My GPA is in the 3.7-3.9 range (It's hard to calculate because my school uses a weird GPA system). I'm interested in pursuing a career in programming. Anyways, I have a few questions. 

1. Should I do a CS major or just graduate as fast as possible with a CS minor? 

2. I have been advised to work on my own projects on my own time. How do I get into that? I feel like I have too many options and don't really know how to get into anything. 

3. I've been looking at co-op jobs and they seem really scary/I feel like I'm not really qualified. Is this normal/do you have any advice for me?


Thanks for any help you can offer. &lt;3

OK first off, I don't really know if he's really my ex, since we are pretty much in contact and he keeps saying he will come back to me when he's done growing up. 

So recently, James's father has not been well, and needed to get surgery. Living in Canada, health care is pretty much free, so hospital bills are not the problem. However, because of this illness, he will be unable to continue working for the next 3 years. James has just finished his bachelor in electrical engineering, but has no internships or related working experience. His mother who is also working, says she can't afford working alone to support their family of 5 and is pressuring him to find a job. I don't know what she exactly said to him because I wasn't there, but James last week, cried to me over the phone, saying he needs to find a job and grow up, and to do that, he wanted a break.

James, for the years I have been with him, has sort of slacked off, and would sort of treat me like shit occasionally, for which I would reprimand him. But I've always felt the need to help him however I can. It's partially my fault, that he has become the way he is, because I was the one pushing him to apply to jobs (I would make his resume and cover letters as well as apply for the jobs for him). He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them. Because of my success with finding jobs and his failure, he sometimes tells me ""you're only getting hired because you're a girl"". 

Anyway, he's been feeling really low on himself, but he doesn't really have anyone to support him except me, but he just wanted to be friends until he can figure things out. 

I wanted to distance myself from him so he could get the peace he wanted, but he calls me and wants my company, so I don't understand... Why he wanted a beak.

Should I keep supporting him, or do I leave him be?

Tldr; ex just broke up with me because he needed time to grow, but now he's showing signs of depression and wants and needs my support. What should I do? Leave or stay."

I had one internship, but it was IT based, and I wasn't able to find a 2nd because I didn't cast my net wide enough. 

Really not a great situation to be in, but I can't change what's in the past. After applying to a ton of places, I managed to get some interviews that are coming up for QA style roles. The way I'm viewing it right now, is that at least this is a job in the industry and not totally unrelated. I am not the greatest programmer, which is something I'm trying to improve. 

I know QA roles are different in responsibilities and scope than a dev role, but my hope is get into a development role at some point. 

Am pigeon holing myself if I got and accepted a QA position? I'd like to have some upward mobility and not stay in the same role for my entire career. From what I've read on this sub, QA can vary widely from good to bad. Or is this a situation in which I should stop caring so much what other people think and just go for it?"

Over the past year I've been learning iOS development with swift and I've become competent enough to make usable and functional apps, but clearly I need a lot of experience.

How would I go about applying to internships that'll help me develop this or related skills, what kind of internships should I be looking for, and more importantly how do I leverage the fact that I can develop competently for iOS in getting these internships?

I haven't been able to justify the $99 a year to submit apps to the store, will I be taken seriously if all I have to show is my projects' code on my computer and apps running in the iOS simulator? In the worst case I'm willing to jailbreak my iPhone so I can show them things I've made running on actual hardware.

I'm a CS major done with the 2nd semester and moving to the third in a month, so that makes it harder.

I'd like to apologize for the wall of text but these events have really devastated me and I am so confused.

A few days ago I went on a trip with my girlfriend of two months - just us two. We had a ""perfect"" time (as quoted by her friends) but when I came back I had to leave her place as I had to see another friend of mine. 

The next day I messaged her, asking her what her plans for the day were. She seemed quite reluctant to reply, which made me think something was 'off'. I knew she was seeing a friend who really wanted to meet up with her again and that she had a networking dinner so I understood that she might be busy.

However, she always has got her phone nearby and I know she saw the messages (perks of Whatsapp), let alone saw the notifications she got. I was concerned because she usually texts back anyone who messages her, and I would have thought that after such a trip, she would still ride this 'high' and be really happy to talk to me. 

Once when she actually did message me, she asked what I was doing, to which I told her what I did that day (mind you this is at ~4pm already). She gets back to me after two hours with a completely new topic, disregarding everything I told her. It felt that she didn't really care what I said - I was quite surprised and frankly started to get pissed off, replying ""whatever"".

We stopped talking and that night she said she would go out clubbing. I was still pissed at that point and I messaged a few friends and went out with them as well. I had a few drinks and couldn't stop thinking about what happened that night so messaged her flatmates boyfriend who was with my gf at the time at the club.

He said that she does not know what she wants and that I should keep my options open, which really pissed me off. I told him that I would come by my gf's place and take my stuff (this was at ~3am), to which he encouraged me to do so.

I came by and took my stuff while she was taking a shower, without saying a word to her. Her flatmates were telling me to calm down but I just left with my stuff in my bag. 

I messaged her afterwards and when she finally picked up her phone, she said I reminded her of her ex (who was quite abusive) and that my 'fit' at her place just reinforces her belief that she is ""not ready for a relationship"". 

I was devastated.

I mean we just came back from this great trip abroad and this happens in 24 hours? The next day we spoke very briefly, and she asked me to come to her place to ""chill"" at around 11pm. She never uses the word ""chill"" with me. I accepted and went over, where we spoke about what happened.

She said she is not ready for the relationship and thinks we should break off especially now that summer is coming up - she's actually leaving to do an internship two days from now. I admitted that I overreacted by storming into her place and taking my things, but I felt that this was just a bump on the otherwise smooth road that we were on. She said that we would make good friends i.e. friend-zoning me, which really hurt me. She even got me a birthday present (my bday is next month) and gave it to me then. 

How could it have gone from the best times in our relationship to the worst in less than 48 hours?

I know she still likes me and this is real hard on me as I don't know what to do. 

Help me Reddit.

Thanks so much.

390s5e,1,2015-06-08,My sadness and self hatred of my job is ruining my relationship.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/390s5e/my_sadness_and_self_hatred_of_my_job_is_ruining/,"So to start off, this is my first post here so I'm sorry if I break any rules. I marked this NSFW because my problem effects my sex life as well. I have not been diagnosed with depression or any mental disorder because my parents don't believe there's anything wrong. I don't know where else to put this, but if you know a better place please let me  know.

So I'm 21, senior engineering student at college. My boyfriend is 24 graduate student. We've been dating for 8 months and its clear we both have some problems, mentally, but for the most part we're still just normal under control people. 

Well I've been at a crap internship for the last 6 months, and this place has caused me so much stress and anxiety that I've sunken down as low as I've ever gotten. I rarely think of committing suicide, but it has crossed my mind. I've thought of drinking myself into happiness, but I've never done it. I vent my anger, frustration, and my sadness to my boyfriend a lot. 

Most of the time it's about self hatred and feeling like a worthless intern here. I get the vibe that everyone here hates me and can't wait to get rid of me. This job is in a field I'm not too familiar with doing work I'm not that good at. They've put a lot pressure on me to do work faster than I can do it, and when I make even the slightest mistake I get chewed out for it. I'm too scared to talk to my manager because any time I have talked to him the situation only gets worse.

So I'm stuck venting and crying to my boyfriend to the point where I just text him, ""well I'm crying again, I hate company X and everything else blah blah blah"" and he just tends to say I'm sorry or its ok and then we just stop.

We're pretty sure this is affecting our sex life as well because I have trouble finishing from anything else but my own hand. Whenever we try it always ends with me crying because i feel like I'm broken. So he told said we need to figure this out because he feels inadequate and not good enough for me. He said we shouldn't have sex until I figure this out, and while sex isn't important to me, it did make me feel closer and more loved by him.

I've reached the point where I can't run from my own internal problems anymore. I feel like I'm causing all of this stress and pain, ruining the best relationship I've ever been in. I don't know where to go or what to do or even who to talk to.

 I'm scared and now distracted by this problem while I'm at work. I've thought about therapy, but I'm on my parents insurance and I don't know how it works, I can't afford therapy out of pocket. Talking to my parents about this just leads to them saying I'm being overdramatic, and maybe I am but I can't stand this sadness and crying anymore.

I feel useless at work, at school, I can't make my boyfriend happy... I hate this struggle, this constant feeling like no one wants me and I'm in the way.

I'm sorry for the long post. Thank you for reading.

#tl;dr I'm sad and scared of everyone at job, I can't satisfy my boyfriend in bed, and my parents won't listen to my plea for help. I don't know what to do :( #"
3912bj,5,2015-06-08,Landed an interview for an IT internship what type of questions should I ask them? Also still a little hesitant about it,Sheehan7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3912bj/landed_an_interview_for_an_it_internship_what/,"I just finished my first year of college majoring in Information Systems. I quit my retail job 6 months ago and went hunting for an internship. All of the leads I followed and applications I submitted came up blank so I gave up and got a new retail job that's better but I still feel like it's a waste of my time, I'm not a sales man. 

Anyway one night browsing craigslist for internships I found one at a great company with a similar environment as Google (fun office doing similar work) and figured I would apply. Well they emailed me and I have an interview tomorrow! But I really don't know a whole lot about it other than its $9/hour so these are my questions for them. Any others I should ask? 

1. How long is it for?

2. What are the hours like?

3. What kind of training will I be getting?

That's all I got. Also I feel hesitant to take the job if offered. 1. I feel like I'm super under qualified having only done very basic IT problem solving in a CISCO class I took and working on my own PC. 2. I am hesitant to leave my retail job. It pays $9.80/hour and I work about 25 hours a week which is giving me money to save for a car next semester. I feel like with the IT job since it's in the city most of my money will go toward transportation. Also I only started the retail job last month so I feel its too early to leave however working alone most of the time, annoying company selling points, and the amount of children I have to call security to come get are getting annoying already. Also I think having an IT internship on my resume already would really help me. I suppose I could work both I was never hired as full time anyway. Any advice here?"

Aside from building my own PC and taking one CISCO cert class I have no knowledge or experience so I'm really worried the IT director is going to interview me and ask ""what would you do if __ happens?"" and i will have no idea what to answer.

391msq,222,2015-06-08,Update: Me 37m trying to deal with 24 f potential stalker,Dealing_with_a_Crazy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/391msq/update_me_37m_trying_to_deal_with_24_f_potential/,"From: [Link to previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38pr01/me_37_m_trying_to_deal_with_24_f_potential_stalker/)


So taking a few of your advices I reached out to the head of my department and shot him an email over the weekend explaining my situation and my talk with the HR Director.  After that I went about my weekend and put it out of my mind.  With that said, there were a few times when my phone would go off I go would get a bit nervous that I would get a message or call from her, but that subsided.  

In fact, when I walked through the doors this morning I really had started feeling better about the whole situation; like everything was back to normal.  An hour had passed then all of a sudden my department head pulled me into his office and sat me down.  He and I go way back to when I first started working here so he told me that he had talked to HR and that he was not allowed to discuss anything with me until they had spoken to me first.  He then told me to consider my options before I signed any paperwork, then walked me up to HR.

Now I am a grown man, but I have to admit that the walk and elevator ride up to HR was the most uncomfortable silence and nerve wracking experience I had experienced in a while.  It was like being marched to the Principal's office and you were not sure why.  My stomach was in knots and thoughts of getting a lawyer or finding a new job started jumping into my head.  By the time I had sat down in the HR director's office I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.

The HR director sat me down and went over what I had reported on Friday before leaving for the day.  She kept saying that she wanted to make sure I wasn't leaving out any detail or if I had any video or audio proof of what I claimed.  At this point I felt like I was on trial for something so I started asking why I would have any of that or be even prepared to document my life in such a way when up till her showing up to my house I had never put anything thought about her being anything other than friendly.  She then told me they found that my records had been reviewed as well as others, but I was the only one that had come forwards with anything.  As many of you can imagine I was confused at what was going on and a bit scared, so I asked her flat out what is going on.  

She told me that as of today the intern had been fired and if I wanted to pursue legal matters against her (restraining orders, breach of privacy, etc.) the company would provide me full support and back me up legally with lawyers.  I am also at this time getting 2 years free of credit monitoring and insurance.  The company would not bring up legal recourse against the intern unless I wanted to.  There was mention of offers for counseling and such, but I let them know I wouldn't be needing it as nothing outside of her showing up happened.  

They let me know I have 48 hours to take all the paperwork to my lawyers and think about what I would like to do.  But as of right now I don't think I have anything to worry about.  I talked to my director after the meeting and he told me that the company at this time is afraid I will sue, which he doesn't recommend, but I don't have to worry about my job.  I told him I wouldn't be pressing charges against her as she had already lost her job and well, I feel like that would be taking it too far.  He had a different feeling about it, but also told me that he might have handled the situation differently if he wasn't married and it had happened to him. 

Over all I feel relieved and wanted to thank everyone that had given the advice before

391ow4,1,2015-06-08,College Degree Choice Advice,btuman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/391ow4/college_degree_choice_advice/,"So my college journey has been unconventional for circumstances often outside my control and I am trying to figure out my next step.
As I am doing all of this I am seeking a job to work, ideally full time development work, but I am open to a CS internship as well (or even, if nothing else works out, a non-CS job). Basically, I will be doing school full time +work full time. 

 
I have 2 years into a comp sci BA. I could finish it in a 1.5+ years, but possibly more to due to my current university basing its bureaucratic structure on the less efficient parts of the Soviet union. 


Option two is as follows. Transfer to a CC, get an AA/AS in Software development (which will be faster then the BA). I also would continue going to University for a BA, but it would be in Near East studies, which i could finish within the year (I got a ton of credits from my gap year and a half of religious study in the Middle East). I would also consider starting a master's program in order to seem more 'legit' when job seeking. 


Beside general advice, I am asking which path will help me most/fastest with employment. I have had a lot of trouble due to lack of a degree, in fact I had a job offer rescinded due to lack of degree. 

Thanks in advance!
 Edit: A bit more info, I have some work experience under my belt, including full time work as a RoR dev."

I have an internship this summer, and it's the first time I've ever received Direct Deposit. I am receiving 7 DDs this summer (already received 1, so 6 left, including one this Friday). 

I see a lot of good offers for banks to open a new account [Nationwide - $200, Chase - $150, SunTrust - $150, and others] if I set up DD with them for 1 or 2 DDs. [Already opened a Discover Bank acct for that $50 bonus without DD!]

Is it ok if I just constantly change the bank is sending the DD to from company every two weeks? If I ask them to switch, will they be able to change my DD by Friday for this week? Does it hurt me somehow if I have multiple bank accounts? I am organized enough to be able to manage it if there's no downside.

Every second gets worse.,choking_myself,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/391ykm/i_am_lost_and_terrified_of_life_every_second_gets/,"I'm a 23 male and have no idea who I am or what I want to be or how to handle life. I graduated with a bachelors degree in something I am not passionate about, nor does it promise much opportunities without serious effort (communications, of course). I feel like I was forced into going to school because of my family and pressure of society. My whole life has been directed for me from the start, and I feel like I have never made any real decisions of my own, and now that I am done school, its all up to me to figure out what to do. 

I've been leeching off my dad for 6 months, as he pays my rent and sends me money, and I'm supposed to be looking for a job. I haven't been searching because of my major social anxiety and lack of work experience. I've never had an internship and the only job I've had is working at my dads restaurant that didn't involve dealing with people. I look at job listings on craigslist and feel like a worthless piece of shit when I see the qualifications and feel like I can't do anything. I'm WORTHLESS. 

Even when I do imagine getting a job I could do like a crappier low end one such as a dishwasher, I start to worry about even more stuff like will I make enough to pay the rent? (Im in nyc so its very very high here) Will everyone look down on me? Do I even want to stay in this city? Will who I am die and will my soul be completely drained? Will I still have time to do the things I enjoy? Will I still be close to my friends? Will I be taking the right path? Will it all lead to something better? And will I be able to pick up the pieces if it doesn't work out? SO MANY THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD ALL THE TIME AND IT NEVER ENDS. 

I started taking a low dose of celexa last week, hoping it does something for me. The only time I feel almost okay is when I lay in bed awake late at night when everything is calm and no one will talk to me, or when I lay in the shower for hours just trying to escape from life in a capsule where all my problems wait outside once I step out. I can't even enjoy the things I like to do and have been isolating myself from my friends.

I instantly have a panic attack when I look at my phone and see my dad calling because he's always had anger management issues and I know he's frustrated and pissed off at me because its been half a year and I have nothing to show for it. I bottle up and say something like ""still looking for a job"" or ""yeah, interview soon, no offers yet"" and then I feel just as shitty. I'm a terrible person, and am too afraid to tell him I've been falling into a dark and scary depression this whole time. I am a fuck up and a let down. 

My apartment lease ends in 3 months, and at this point I really don't know what my life will become. I don't know whether I want to somehow stay in this expensive city where I know one day I'll have to leave; go back to my home state and try to rethink my existence, or run away and become a homeless drifter. I'm just floating in the ocean with no direction, having the current take me where it may. All these thoughts go on while everyday I contemplate killing myself. I've battled suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I don't know if I am fit for this world, and maybe I should just leave. I don't know whether this post is a desperate cry for help or if I just need to see my thoughts down on paper in a way SOMEONE out there MAY actually read them. But I do know I could use ANY form of help, even if that means a stranger has heard me.

To anyone out there that feels as hopeless and terrified, you are not alone. "
391ywg,13,2015-06-08,The Rugby Player. Part I [f/m],nikkiblue6767,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/391ywg/the_rugby_player_part_i_fm/,"Longtime lurker, first time poster.  I was recounting the short version of this to a friend yesterday and remembered that I'd been meaning to post the long version here, for all of you lovelies.  It took place over 3 consecutive days so I'll tell it in three parts.

DISCLAIMER - everything is true but I've changed names and some location details for privacy.  Also, this first part isn't very sexy.  But it's background for the next two steamier parts.  You can skip this if you're just skimming for the sex ;)

____________________________________

One year during grad school I took a summer internship in a completely different city.  I'd recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend and intended to use that summer to really ""find myself"" in all the best and worst ways.  The city I was moving to for the summer is about 15 hours drive from my home so a good friend of mine and I packed up the car and set out for a crazy summer.  We made plans to stop and stay for a night at my uncle's house which was about 2/3 of the way there so we wouldn't have to drive straight through.  We had so much fun we ended up staying for two nights before heading off to our destination.  But that stopover is where the story begins.

My uncle lived in a coastal town and his roommate was a bartender.  We got in from our long drive and relaxed for a while before we decided to head to the roomie's bar for some drinks.  My girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised - apparently there was a rugby tournament in town because the bar was filled to the brim with rugby players.  Some locals, but mostly Europeans visiting.  I wasn't aware of this at the time, but I think its common in the rugby world for teams to go out at night ""dressed up.""  Some were in shorts but they all had on dress shirts and ties.  So here's my friend and I just thinking we're going to get a quick drink and take in the view and instead we land on a gold mine of hot, athletic, European men in ties.  I may have literally proclaimed ""JACKPOT"" as I entered the bar.  

Another tradition that's common is their rugby drinking songs.  Some of the raunchiest stuff you've ever heard set to a tune. But of course, to a girl looking for a good time, it was the best soundtrack there could have been.

My friend and I had winged for each other before -  we knew each other's type, our habits, our games.  It was custom for us to each select a ""mark"" early on, and while that target could change, there's just something more fun about the hunt.  This is probably a good place to stop and describe myself.  I'm 5'7"", long brown hair, brown eyes, freckles, curvy (was heavier then come to think of it, but not BBW, just big in the right places).  My friend is shorter, more of a tomboy, but she doesn't make any sexy appearances in this story so it's a bit moot.  She tends to pick the best looking guy in the room, and then by the end of the night end up chatting with the oldest, or the saddest (she's a magnet for sad that girl, I think she likes to play the healer).  Me on the other hand, I like the smartest guy in the room.  The one who thinks he's the most clever.  I need banter, fun, a challenge to keep me interested.  But smart is not always easy to spot in a bar.  So I tend to go for the loudest.  The one cracking everyone up.  The life of the party.  That's how my eyes landed on Billy.

Billy was not the tallest on his team but his body...well I mean I've yet to meet a rugby player with a bad body...but this guy....yum.  Curly brown hair, bright eyes (I would say hazel?), buff arms, strong hands, those muscular rugby thighs you see on all the players (I never thought I'd be attracted to a guy's thighs but damn!)  Just scrumptious.  And he was loud and brazen with this infectious laugh.  Dimples when his face lit up (which was nearly always).  I wanted him and I wanted him bad.

They were playing this game with a ping pong ball.  Not beer pong, it was more subtle.  Whoever had the ball would try their best to slip it into someone's cup without them noticing.  If they got you, you had to finish your drink right there and then.  In retrospect, this was not the most sanitary game and perhaps not the wisest to invite something slipped into my drink, but it was an in.  We positioned ourselves on the edge of their group and just kept chatting up whomever was around or passed by, biding our time.  Eventually we ""caught"" a player from our targets' team and got the conversation going.  Our strategy was correct - once Billy saw one of his mates talking and laughing with two unattended girls, he came prowling.  In my mind I was just reeling him in.  

We introduced ourselves and asked about their travels, the tournament, etc.  At one point one of his mates got Billy with the ping pong ball and he pounded his beer, which was quickly replaced by another.  I was genuinely engrossed in conversation with him (loving that smile) when he paused, held my gaze and said simply, ""Drink.""  The fucking ping pong ball was in my beer.  I'd forgotten he had it but this was all coming together nicely.  I chugged my beer (not too unlady like, but fast enough to show I was down for some fun) and smiled.  My beer was also quickly replaced.

Now - I should also mention that obviously these guys had their agenda.  Bang silly drunk American girls, right?  I was under no delusion that they didn't travel the country getting girls drunk and hooking up with them.  But I was young, newly single, and but for making sure I didn't catch anything I really didn't give a damn.  I wanted to make out with a naughty rugby player with a sexy accent. Or better yet, do more if we hit it off.  I would end up doing much, much more.

But not that night.  Billy and I continued drinking, talking, flirting but he was surrounded by his team and my uncle was feet away. He's a cool uncle, he wouldn't tell on me, but he probably would snatch me away from a random guy or stop me from doing anything too public when I was drunk.  Billy invited us to come watch their game the next day and mentioned what bar they would be celebrating at the next night.  I played it nonchalant, didn't want to come off too ""groupie,"" said we'd try to make it. My friend and I headed home with my uncle and announced that we were staying for an extra night before heading to my summer spot.  We explained that I really wanted to have some quality time with my cousin the next day (which was true) but naturally, what was really motivating me was the thought of Billy's cock.  I'd decided I was going to see it, hopefully taste it, and make him mine if even just for a little while.

Parts II and III soon.

3926yo,3,2015-06-08,How to build a competitive application for grad school?,iloveyuccafries,hci,https://www.reddit.com/r/hci/comments/3926yo/how_to_build_a_competitive_application_for_grad/,"Hi, I am planning on applying to grad school for HCI and looking at programs at Georgia Tech, CMU, and UM Ann Arbor. I am currently a psychology BS grad with a 3.6 major GPA, but a 3.1 overall GPA from a top 20 school. I have no experience in the field, but have a few volunteering and internships related to clinical psychology. 

Briefly looking through some of the current students' resumes at these schools, my current situation does not seem attractive, and I feel overwhelmed by these resumes. Current students seem to have prior internships within the field, or even years of job experience! It has been difficult to break into the field, and I have tried applying for internship positions related to design and HCI, but have been turned away or not even receiving a response. I believe this may be due to my major. 

So, other than studying to get a very competitive GRE score, what other things can I be doing to make my resume more competitive for these top HCI schools?? Any suggestions are welcome."
39279o,4,2015-06-08,I'm bored with everything,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39279o/im_bored_with_everything/,"I'm so incredibly bored with everything.  I try to change things up and make life more interesting but it doesn't seem to be working.  

I was bored with my job, so I quit and decided to go to graduate school.  I am finding that boring but found a summer internship at a reputable, Fortune 500 company.  Was excited about doing that but after three weeks, I'm bored out of my mind.  I find most of my days trying to invent things to do since my manager is basically never at work since he's constantly traveling or whatever.

I'm bored with my girlfriend.  We moved in together six months ago and it has made the relationship harder.  She's fine and all but the spark and excitement is all but gone.  I've been with her for two years and find most of her antics tired and boring right now.  She tends to have a breakdown every other month, whether it be about work, her mom or her sister, and I just can't muster up the brain power to care or to do anything about it.  When I do, she just snaps at me because ""I just don't understand.""  Tedious.

I don't get much enjoyment out of hanging out with my friends or family.  I can only stand them for a little bit until the point where I just lose interest or can't find anything interesting to talk about.  

I don't find much enjoyment in my hobbies anymore that I used to.  Video games have lost almost all appeal.  I'm too lazy or tired to drag myself to the gym.  I just find myself drained and tired the second I wake up.

I think I'm depressed because of this boredom and I so actively want to find something stimulating to do but I'm so tired from all the efforts that I've put in over the past six months.  I'm just exhausted.  I dread most social interaction and don't find many things fun or interesting anymore.

TL;DR - I'm either depressed because I'm so bored OR I'm bored because I'm depressed."

392g14,1,2015-06-08,How to get the motivation?,itsTbod,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/392g14/how_to_get_the_motivation/,"Hi everyone,

I am a 20 year old male going into my senior year of college. I have been slightly over weight my whole life and not really happy with my body. I'm 5'4"" and my weight fluctuates from 165-175 pounds.

  I currently have an internship that usually has me working different hours each day (9AM - 6/7/8/9/10PM) and so its hard to get a steady workout schedule started. Usually I have a regular schedule, it becomes much easier for me to be consistent in working out- but this job makes it so difficult for me. Especially when it is lunch time and the only place to eat is a small, very unhealthy deli (which is located in an extremely small town were one of my offices are located).

My main question is how can I (or how do you) get the motivation to lose weight and stay on track? I've wanted to just stay dedicated for years (and have steadily worked out daily for 1-3 months at a time), but I always lose the motivation and go back to self loathing. I'm sure this question comes up a lot on here, but I've yet to find a solution and something that works for myself.

TL;DR: How can I get the motivation to work out and continue with it?"

Before entering college I was trying to find a career that pays good money but does not require graduate school. And quite honestly what attracted me to actuarial science was the exam process, believe it or not. I just liked the idea of passing exams to advance in my career. I personally like studying and passing exams. The third reason was the mix of different subjects that you would be learning. Like probability, mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, financial economics, and computer programming. So it seemed like the best career choice for me.

So far I had 2 actuarial internships (in the middle of the 2nd one now) and 1 exam passed (p) and I still have 2 years left to graduate. So far I do not regret it and I enjoyed studying for the first exam. 

To summarize why I like the career:

1- Good money without a degree beyond B.S.

2- Exam process

3- Learn a mix of different interesting subjects

So what is your reason?"

I am a Canadian student studying Computer Science, currently in third year, heading to 4th year at the end of this term. I have done 1 year of work experience through my coop and at my last placement, I was given the opportunity to work part time (worked there for 8 months on coop and (will be) 8 months afterwards). This is a software development role at a non-software company. I plan to quit work, focus on my studies starting Fall 2015. 

Route 1:

I have planned the rest of my terms and calculated that I could graduate Fall 2016 (I enroled Fall 2012) with a double major in CS and Stats. 

Then I thought, should I go for another internship? Or should I graduate ASAP? 

Route 2:

I've been looking at IBM postings and I think it can dramatically improve my work experience if I were to have IBM there. Also, there are a lot of IBM positions offered to students. IBM prefers to high students for 12-16month terms, I'd be looking at graduating Fall 2017-Summer 2018 (depending on course availability). Also, I may or may not major in Statistics if I choose this route.

TL; DR: Should I graduate in Fall 2016 (w/ CS and Stats double major) or delay graduation so I can work at big companies like IBM (and possibly only a CS degree)?

edit: I should add that tuition isn't an issue."
392q5y,1,2015-06-08,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/392q5y/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (a few paragraphs, and generally I can play out each scenario in anywhere from a few hours to a few days). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

1) You're an intern at the office I work at. You've caught my eye before, as a young college/university student (18-21) with huge breasts, a great ass, and a slim body that looks like it's built for sex. However, we've never had much of a relationship, outside of a few stray chats around the office.

I'm not a manager, just a mid-level employee, so lately, I've picked up a side job editing some videos for a few clients to pick up some extra cash. One was pretty shady but offered good money, so I took it. It turned out this guy is acting as a manager for a chain of strip clubs and had videotaped auditions of girls dancing on poles and the laps of ""customers"" to show the president. This has gotten pretty hot, and winds up being more enjoyable than my full-time job...when all of a sudden, I realize one of the girls working the pole.

Her big, possibly-fake breasts are barely contained by her bikini top, and her ass swallows a G-string as she grinds and gyrates around the stage. A few minutes later, her ass and tits are bouncing on top of a man in a chair, one whose erection makes his pants pop up like a tent.

The girl...is you.

I wait until after work the next day to say something to you, all the while feeling REALLY turned on all day long every time you walk by my desk (knowing what's under your clothes). Finally, it's 5:30, and everyone else has gone home for the day. There are no security cameras here, it's just you and me.

""Hey,"" I say, with a tinge of nervousness. ""Can I see you in my office?""

---

2) You're at a wild party or club. Take your pick: Pool party, nightclub, strip club, etc. Wherever you are, you're wearing that one outfit in the back of your closet. You know, the outfit that does a great job of covering up very little. Maybe you're a horny college co-ed on spring break, or part of a bachelorette party, a cougar looking for a young guy, or, if you want to get really raunchy, a stripper/hooker who just wants cock.

Regardless, you see me. I'm easy to spot: I'm tall (6'3""), with blonde hair, brown eyes, and a VERY big erection in my pants. I'm in the VIP area, with plenty of booze to go around. Come see me, have a drink (or seven), and let's get filthy.

---

3) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

4) Any scene where one of us (you or me) is just moving into a new place. We can work out any number of reasons for it: One of us has a new job, just broke up with a BF/GF, going to college, etc. Either way, the scene would start out with one of us discovering the new neighbor, and hopefully end with lots and lots of cum. ;)

I'm open to any sort of scenario based on this premise, and as such, I'm open to a lot of different age groups. If you're moving in, maybe you're a college student living on her own for the first time (or living with roommates if you're open to playing multiple parts!). Maybe you're a post-grad who's just found a job. Maybe you're the neighborhood MILF or a lonely wife who's desperate for companionship. I'm also willing to play different age groups as well, if that's something you're into (I can also do a few characters at once as well, if you're seeking THAT kind of action!).

---

5) Anything else you'd like to do that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you!"

I got this car during my senior year of high school when I got very good marks on my SAT and ACT. I was supposed to get it back sophomore year, except a fender bender ruined that prospect. My parents, out of overprotectiveness and just not knowing how trivial a mistake like this is (they're Chinese immigrants who grew up poor) overreacted and said no car indefinitely. And in my college town, which is one of those driving towns (little transport, spread out, bipolar weather) not having one takes a HUGE toll on your daily life and independence. On top of everything else including engineering school, anxiety and depression, social anxiety, lack of close friends, etc this whole incident and it's ramifications have driven my emotions through the roof time and time again. Now, I am hoping that they have changed their minds, and have learned to trust me again. I am in a very peaceful state emotionally right now with the help of therapy all of last school year. This year I am starting my core major classes, really upping the search for internships, and I am also starting a job and summer school session 2 when I go back in a few weeks. I hope this situation works out for the best so I can have a great head start on it all, and if it doesn't I hope I don't fall apart again emotionally or sink back into the depression I overcame a few months ago. I know some of you may think that this whole thing is really silly or that I'm incredibly spoiled for feeling all this about some stupid car, and I would understand why. But I can only hope others will wish me luck :)"

3934mr,0,2015-06-08,UCSD vs UCI for Econ Majors? Which one should I chose? Please help?,UCSDorUCI,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/3934mr/ucsd_vs_uci_for_econ_majors_which_one_should_i/,"Hi guys,

I am going to post this into both subreddits because I'm having trouble deciding where to go.

I got an extension for my SIR deadline so I have until this Friday to choose.

I have visited both UCSD and UCI and I understand that both can be socially dead, this is not a huge factor for me because it's only 2 years so I don't mind.

My main concern is that I am going in the Econ major without 1 of the pre reqs completed (Econ 3). Also, I worry that the econ courses at UCSD are really tough and competitive.

As far as job prospects go for Econ majors, I heard that UCSD is the place to go because they get recruiters from the federal reserve and some big companies.

How is the job market for UCSD students? The networking? Any current alumnis out there that can tell me?

I have a friend that currently goes to UCI and he says the job prospects are pretty bad over there. 

The thing is I am looking to work in LA where I am originally from. Would UCSD's internships be mainly focused in SD?

Also, housing wise I am looking for a place to myself. I've dormed before and I did not really like it. I just need some space to myself.

Would it be a problem to get a place a couple mins outside campus and just drive to campus for class?

Or are there any cheap options when it comes to studio apartments near campus?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you so much guys :)

I recently secured an internship for big company. I have been working there for about a week. I have been doing tech support and when I spoke to the previous interns they said that's what you will be doing for the rest of the internship( Another 15 months). I really don't want to do that for my internship, would it be possible for me to quit the internship early because it doesn't align with my future goals, without me being blacklisted from applying to the company again?"
3938cl,0,2015-06-08,I'm [30/f] and my best friend [42/f] is a narcissist and I'm a codependent in hell! Helpful advice please!,rgreene2043,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3938cl/im_30f_and_my_best_friend_42f_is_a_narcissist_and/,"I met my friend 3 years ago and it felt like an instant deep connection.  We did everything together and we were often mistaken for a couple.  It felt like we were a couple.  She ""hooked"" me instantly because she was/is charming, has an outgoing personality, always captures everyone's attention when she walks in the room, very articulate, all the guys are interested in her.  I admired her right away and always considered myself so ""lucky"" that she was my friend.  Once the ""honeymoon"" period of our friendship ended I began noticing her real personality.  I actually thought this meant we were getting closer in our relationship and she was letting her guard down.  I began to notice she ONLY talked about herself, never asked me personal questions, had a way to turn the conversation back to herself, ALWAYS looked in mirrors or windows when walking down the street, and also had a really short temper and would explode into rage (I actually never saw this happen but she told me stories about it).  On several occasions we were out for drinks with a group of friends and if she didn't have center attention she would make a scene and storm off and usually leave.  One time she was so pissed she decided to walk home.  I soon learned that to make her happy the group needed to let her talk most of the time.  Thinking back about it now I feel like a fool because I would often whisper to people in our group and plead for them to just let her talk so she wouldn't flip out.  I always felt (and still do) responsible for her outbursts and for her being upset about things.  Another time I remember the two of us were eating dinner at a restaurant and behind me was a panel of glass.  She literally talked to herself the entire night.  She wasn't making eye contact with me, rather looking past me to talk to her reflection.  Something that should've been a red flag right away is that none of my other friends liked her...or they could only handle her in small doses.  I often told myself, ""Oh, they just don't understand her like I do.""  Now that I think about it, I think they saw something I never did.  I would still like to know what they saw that I didn't.  

She has recently moved to a new city and I don't see her near as much as I did before but we text everyday.  I decided to visit her for a week shortly after she moved and that was the first time we spent that much time together (we went to China together for 10 days and stayed in the same room but the ""thrill"" of vacation made it a different experience).  It was also my first chance to see her in her own ""space"" and in her own routine.  On my way to her house I took the train.  On the way there the train CRASHED....I'm not joking.  It crashed and was on the national news.  When I finally arrived to her house she not once said ""I'm so glad you weren't hurt,"" ""I'm glad you made it,"" ""Tell me what happened.""  Instead I had to listen (for two hours) about how her neighbor made her angry right before I arrived.  I sat there dumbfounded.  How could someone NOT ask about a damn train wreck?!  That turned out to be a week from hell.  She and I butted heads a few times and by the end of the week I was ready to go.  It was also that trip that I finally started speaking my mind and calling her out on things she did to piss me off.  I think things got worse when I did this and let her know I had enough of the way she would treat me.

She often jokes that she knows she is a narcissist (I don't know if this is a common thing they do but I found it weird.  If you know you are one why not change??  It's not a good thing!) and she practically brags about it.  I don't think she would be officially diagnosed but she definitely has MANY characteristics.  A few other things about her: she's 42 and has never been married and her longest relationship lasted 3 years, she keeps her exes close by because she constantly needs sex, she told me she has slept with over 50 men, she trash talks about most all of her other friends to me (this makes me think she talks trash about me too to someone else), we've never had a conversation about anything related to her emotions (we've talked about mine).  The last thing that bothers me is that she is currently sleeping with her ex and she knows I completely disapprove (bc of all the trash she told me about him earlier). She tells everyone else but won't tell me.  I've called her out on this because she tells me EVERYTHING else about her life...EVERYTHING.  She said she doesn't tell me because she cares about me as much as she cares about her mom.  That response didn't make any sense to me and it only pissed me off.

So enough about her...here's what's wrong with me in this friendship.  I have realized I am addicted to her.  I have severe panic attacks when she does something to upset me and if I we don't text for a while I feel the panic starting.  For example, yesterday and most of today I've felt anxiety and panic because she didn't text me at all yesterday until I texted her that night and she gave me a one word response.  I've become so dependent on our texting chats that it interrupts my daily life if I don't hear from her.  I don't think she knows she has this power over me.  I've never told her and I never will.  I'm mostly angry at myself for so many things with this relationship.  I'm mad I let her have this much control over me (she's the first person I've felt like this for), mad that I now resort to self harm (cutting) when my emotions get the best of me after something that happened between us (she knows I've cut but she doesn't know she had anything to do with it), I'm mad that I completely change my personality when I'm with her (I let her lead and have all the attention and I sit back quiet and it feels very obvious that I am the inferior one), I'm mad that I was happy (happier than I am now at least) before I met her.  I thought for the longest time I was so damn lucky to have her as a friend because I had so much fun with her before she moved away.  I hate that I feel responsible for her emotions and outbursts and I hate that I am constantly living my life with her in mind.  The bad part about all of this is that I don't know how to change anything.  I've developed a fear of abandonment that she'll forget about me, not want to be my friend, etc...  I've never cared this much about someone leaving me.  I've also developed this crappy habit where when I am lonely I get panic attacks.  I constantly wonder what she is doing and why she is not texting me (for the record, we typically text throughout the day with at least 150 exchanges...it's constant).  I'm embarrassed my life has begun to revolve around her but I don't know how to make it stop.  Finally, I am in her city this summer doing an internship.  I thought it would be great because I could see her often but so far it's off to a rocky start.  We went out for drinks over the weekend and she got so mad when guys started talking to me and not her.  It is on her body language, she stopped talking to me, and she got pissed off at me because she wasn't receiving the attention.

I could go on but I will stop.  Please provide helpful advice...sarcasm and joking won't help me or do any good. Thanks!    "

3939om,1,2015-06-08,Me (23f) with my close friend (23f) and the same man (28m),almostloversnh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3939om/me_23f_with_my_close_friend_23f_and_the_same_man/,"I'll try to keep this short and I'm on my phone so forgive typos please.

Sarah(23), Ryan (28), and I (23) all went to college together. Ryan was a grad student in our department. Sarah and I became very close during school. Sarah and Ryan only hung out when I brought Sarah to various parties and events etc.

From the first time I met Ryan I was pretty into him. We had this weird unspoken (so I felt) thing going on between us that just never worked out timing wise... We went on a date but then I had to leave for a semester abroad, I get home and he's seeing someone, that ends and we hang out once but then he has to go off for an internship, that sort of thing. Goes on for two years and this whole time I'm carrying a sort of torch for him for some reason; albeit a muted one, as our lives take us in and out of other relationships, states, and countries. Sarah knows all about this and was already my friend during the times Ryan and I did go on dates. 

About a year ago I moved away for work after school. Since then Sarah and I have talked every couple weeks and texted weekly and Ryan and I less frequently, every two months or so we will talk on the phone for a couple hours. 

So I'm headed home in two weeks and am really excited to see them both, Ryan and I had a really great long talk about a week ago and I told him I would be in town and we made plans to see each other that night, get our old group together and all go out. Secretly I'm hoping this leads to alone time with Ryan of course and given our last interaction in person (long talk in my car too 3 am and a goodnight kiss, although it WAS a year ago) I'm hoping he is hoping for the same. 

Sarah calls me today and tells me she and Ryan have been seeing each other. She was extremely nervous to tell me, I could tell, and kept asking if it was okay. I'm not exactly sure why but  I was really disappointed and also felt hurt that she didn't tell me right when she started developing feelings for him as it's been going on a few weeks and we have talked since then; plus she obviously knew it would upset me. I care about them both as friends a lot and I have no right to be upset as I don't even live there and Ryan and I never actually ""dated"" (never even had sex) but now I don't really want to go hang out with them both. I think it will be hard to act normal, plus it will be hard for me to not act a certain way in front of Ryan, you know, the way you act slightly different when you're around someone you like? Like my interaction with him will not be platonic in its motivations. Ever. And I don't think that's fair to my friendship with Sarah.

I don't really know what to do or how to communicate my feelings to her because I don't want her to feel bad. But I am upset. She still wants to hang out my night in town and says we don't have to see anyone else but I feel like... I don't know. I don't really want to be friends if they begin dating seriously and that  sucks because  she's one of my BEST friends. 

Does anyone have any insight or input? I'm pretty bummed out and I don't know what the ""right"" thing to do is. If I see Ryan I will 100% secretly be wanting him to like me. I don't know if by default that means I should avoid him. Sarah is my priority. 

**tl;dr** had a crush on a guy for a few years, moved away, best friend starts dating him and tells me two weeks before I have plans to visit them both 

Edit I want to add that Ryan is innocent in all of this, since I moved away all our conversations have been completely platonic and we have discussed our love lives with one another ( he didn't mention Sarah, but she did say it was very recent) "

I recently graduated as an EE - I've had about three internships during my time university, and I just completed one last month. 

They've all been tied to the software side of things; some of it was programming in Python (instantiating classes to make use to functions), creating a string console output for selecting certain things to run, ect.

I've taken Mechatronics, and programmed a little bit of our state machines in C using a PIC32 microcontroller. Taken C Programming Class, but that's about it.

I really want to freshen up on coding, but I'm not really sure how. I've considered a Masters Program in Computer Engineering, other than that maybe playing with an Arduino and tie up some sensors together.

Any suggestions/advice would be appreciated, thanks!

393k6m,3,2015-06-08,Me [25/F] with my friends [20'sF]. The bachelorette from Hell.,Ohwhoaeskimo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/393k6m/me_25f_with_my_friends_20sf_the_bachelorette_from/,"Okay, so I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now, but I'm going to try to keep this as to-the-point as possible.

One of my very good friends, L, is getting married this summer to the best guy ever.  They're a great match and I'm over the moon for her.  She could only have a small bridal party and I wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid.  Initially, I was really sad about this, but never told the bride because hey-planning a wedding is enough stress.  She later asked me to be a part of her ""house party"" which in the South, is being in the bridal party but not a bridesmaid.  I'm thrilled to be a part of her special day and instead of sulking about not being a bridesmaid, have tried to be as helpful and supportive as possible.


Because I live in a beach town and work in hospitality, I took on the responsibility of the bachelorette.  It's the first time our group will be together in over a year, so everyone has been looking forward to it.  We budgeted for a specific number of girls, I offered a few options, and we picked an option that would fit everyone's budget.  The bachelorette is this coming weekend.


About two months ago, it became a question whether the bride's sister and Maid of Honor, K, would be able to come.  K is still in school and just got her dream internship.  About a month ago, we figured out that it just wouldn't work out for K to come.  We tried to invite someone else to keep the budget the same, but it didn't work out so the price for everyone went up about $40.


Today, I went to invoice everyone for this trip, since I am paying for it with my card and really didn't want to front $2,000 and wait for everyone to pay me back.  It then came to light that one girl, N, said she actually was going to be a day late and didn't want to pay the whole amount because she wouldn't be using the room last night.  This would have raised everyone else's costs even higher.  The bride offered to pay for her share of the room the night she wouldn't be there.  


I obviously didn't think the bride should be paying to keep everyone happy and told N that to please remember that everyone does have really tight budgets.  She basically responded that she was broke and we could pick up the slack because we have ""real jobs"" and she was completely broke. (She just graduated from grad school and started a well-paying full time job that she said would approve her to be there the full trip.)  Then she said she was pulling out of the trip completely because she was so broke.  She even mentioned that she didn't own a black dress for the night we were going out and would have to wear a swimsuit coverup if she went.


Normally I'd be sympathetic, but N has taken overnight trips the past few months, adopted a pure bred puppy, and generally done some pretty expensive things.  She's always been flakey about money since I've known her and it's pretty clear that she just didn't budget.  She offered to pay a portion of her share of the trip (because that's all she has) so everyone wouldn't be screwed over money-wise.  I'm just so mad at her and don't know what she was expecting.  Did she think everyone else would be paying her gas, food and drink bills?  Why did she wait until the last minute?  If we knew from the beginning we would have planned something different but she approved of this trip and budget months ago.  I haven't said much to her because I don't want to completely ruin our friendship or make things awkward for all the wedding events that we'll be in together that are coming up.  

The bride is understandably, very upset.  She even offered to pay money for N's expenses if she didn't go.  However, like me, she is also extremely angry and doesn't know if she'll be able to trust again.


I don't know if I should accept payment from N that she isn't even coming.  She wouldn't be able to pay me until after the trip (even though she said she had money saved for the original cost.).  Since she isn't going, should I accept it to alleviate the cost increase to the rest of the group?  Am I a total bitch for not being sympathetic?  How can I best support the bride during this?  I just need insight from a different group of people please, anything is welcome.


**tl;dr**: A girl on our upcoming bachelorette was flakey and bailed and I don't know whether to accept money from her to offset the cost of everything else."
393kur,6,2015-06-08,Me [21 M] getting sick of flatmate [20 M],Britito,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/393kur/me_21_m_getting_sick_of_flatmate_20_m/,"Ok, a bit of background first.

I'm a student in the UK, just finishing my 2nd year now. During my 1st year, I became close friends with two other students, lets call them Chris and Nick, living in accommodation close to mine. Now then, during the 1st year, Nick would break down, a lot. It would be 1 in the morning, I'd be climbing into bed, and I and Chris would get a suicidal text of some kind from Nick, usually resulting in a quick meetup and walk around a quiet portion of the town to see what was wrong. Other times we'd be walking down from Uni to our accommodation blocks and Nick would start talking about how he messes everything up and can't keep going.

Other times it would get rather more personal. Nick tends to get very emotional very easily, especially after drinking. He'd often claim that because I exist, he shouldn't because I do everything better, apparently. He'd say that I was the bane of his existence or that my tendency to be positive was the thing wrong about the world. We notified the university about this, and after a couple of incidents in his flat he was sent to meetings with a therapist, and was pronounced perfectly normal, somehow.

But, and here's the odder it, when he wasn't in the midst of a breakdown, he was normal. We'd play Civ 5 together, joke about things, go on nights out, help each other with schoolwork. There's be absolutely no indication that he despised me as much as he would occasionally claim.

In 2nd year we lived in the same student house, with Chris and a few others. While the breakdowns had mostly stopped, they'd happen when work got tough and he'd been drinking. He'd slump against my door because Chris had closed and locked his and talk about how pathetic his life was and how he had no friends. We'd at least try to dispute this, point out that he did actually have friends, but he'd usually change the subject. 

Fast-forward to now. I'm packing to go home, but spend most of the night eating and talking with friends, Nick included. After the others had gone home/to bed, a slightly drunk Nick started talking, quite viciously, about why he apparently hates me so. Below are reasons he gave, worded in how he gave them:

I come across as emotionless because I have never broken down or lost my temper in front of him.
That I'm afraid of people because he's never seen me break down or lose my temper.
I feel and act positively about life and things, as opposed to (as he was explaining) thinking about how much war and destruction is going on.
I try to solve problems before they arise, like applying to internships early.
I, using money saved from a part-time job, went on a backpacking trip around Europe, that he ""just couldn't do"".
I only really talk to people about my problems when I believe they can help solve them, rather than wanting to let people hear my problems just to vent. (I explained that I prefer not to put undue stress on people by telling them problems they have no ability to fix nor help with, and was once again met with accusations of being emotionless).
I ""act in a logical manner"".

There were other things, but explaining them would take more time than 1:20am requires. Honestly, for most of his complaints I see nothing wrong at all, except for simple personality clash that shouldn't be this drastic.

Bother of us are going on our industrial placements soon, and are unlikely to see each other for a while. Nonetheless, while I'm fairly sure the problem lies with him, considering he's like this with other people as well, and I've never had people react in even a vaguely similar way before, I'd like to see what people have to say, and maybe see what I can do to help. I can't really tell you what I act like in everyday life, but I don't think I act emotionless. I laugh, I smile, I get sad, I occasionally cry, I hug cats at 5am. Whenever I become angry or sad I tend to isolate myself to prevent lashing out at people, so I rarely display anger to others. 
He has often talked about a rough childhood, parents splitting up early, a mum who went through 12 men growing up, each of whom he was told to treat like a new father, and who may be near sociopathic anyway..

Tl;dr

Friend who may/may not have been suicidal claims I'm an emotionless robot that is the antithesis to his being, I don't think I am. Has done this to other people. Referred to a therapist, was pronounced normal. "

Also plan to attempt to get whichever certs I can get, at the very least I'm sure I will be able to get an A+. Anyway it wasn't until I recently started my research for something to intern in, that I realized my degree seems pretty generic. I have no idea what specific jobs this degree leads up to other than low level tech support things, which doesn't seem very in demand anyway because right now I can't even find something to intern in involving that. It seems that IT everything ultimately requires programming, which I am really bad at and dislike doing. I'm best at the stuff that involves hands on hardware and technical problem troubleshooting, but as far as I know those are all low level jobs that don't pay well and aren't exactly career material. 

TL;DR: what are some specific names of IT jobs that someone with my degree and skills can expect to obtain?  Do any exist that don't require programming? Both to start out with and for a longterm career."

Thinking of jumping from a fast sinking ship to a slower, slightly larger sinking ship",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3940hv/advice_23_new_grad_thinking_of_jumping_from_a/,"First off, I am really grateful that this sub exists. It warms my heart thinking there are people with their shit together who are willing to help people like me pick themselves back up. 

**Background**
I just finished my undergrad in Journalism and Political Science in May. Being the first in my family to get a degree is great, but I could only finish school by taking on an aggressive amount of debt. 

Before graduation, I had an internship at a major newspaper, was the editor of my college newspaper worked at a large law firm, and went to university in foreign countries for two semesters. I was certain I would be a superstar and work for a big company making good money like older friends.

Then graduation happened. 

For the last month, I've applied and applied and applied in my city with only one response. I can't afford to leave my parent's house to try to get a job in a bigger media market. 

Right before I finished, I talked to a law school advisor who agreed to help me apply in January for Fall 2016. I had taken a couple of international law schools and really excelled in them, but I've never seriously considered Law School because of the avalanche of negative news about unemployed lawyers. 

My plan is to find a job in pr, marketing or social media management until Aug. '16 so I can start saving and stabilizing my debt while working on my application and (hopefully) be able to move closer to a Top 50 school. But unemployment is a wakeup call. My parents have been understanding but I'm not sure if I should get a job at Arby's until I find a job in a field I have experience in. Is a month too short of a time to freak out?

I think I could make it as a lawyer and I would enjoy the work. But as I sit in a Starbucks and refresh Indeed, I worry that I'm warping Law School into a golden parachute to stay upbeat. Is Law School a golden parachute that's actually made out of gold (so it wouldn't work...) Should I just take a Xanax and just calm the fuck down?

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did. I learn a lot from this subreddit.

*tl;dr* Graduated with journalism and poly sci degree but debt means reporting jobs are off the table. Is a month too short of a time to worry about unemployment? Is going to Law School realistic?

39414p,1,2015-06-08,"19 with a year of corporate Web-Design under belt, sudden promotion to Web Manager -- deserving of being put on salary?",mytren,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39414p/19_with_a_year_of_corporate_webdesign_under_belt/,"Hey thanks for taking a look at my post! 

To start off, I'm 19, and have been working at a multi-million dollar corporate that specializes in a medical manufacturing field. When I started, I was hired as an intern for Data Entry, however after a couple months I was put on a project to create an E-Commerce website with a Sr. Web Dev. I was given a raise to $13 an hour at this point.

Fast foward 8 months, and now our Sr. Dev is leaving, leaving me the only one with the knowledge and skill set as he does. I'm a full-time student (willing to change for evening courses) and also work full time at this company. 

Now that he's leaving, I'm curious if anyone with more corporate experience has a clue as to what could happen next.

My assumption is they bring in another Sr. dev and place him above me -- but I have expectations to leave/find another job if this occurs; leaving the company in a not so optimal position.. but I mean hey, what's best for me is most important to me.

The other possibility is the company decides to make me the new Web manager, coming with new roles and responsibilities that I didn't have before. This would come at a sacrifice to my education (graduating later than anticipated) thus in my opinion requiring sufficient compensation. A salary would suffice for me, however I know that's pretty far fetched of me to want. 

Thanks for reading, and if anyone has any advice as to what course of action I may take, or if they've been in a similar position?

PS: I know I'm very fortunate to be in the position I'm in. My major is Computer Science and this company has given me a great step forward in advancing my career. If anything, I'd like to remain here."
3947ns,1,2015-06-08,Previous manager is unappreciative but is offering a new job,minktheshrink,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3947ns/previous_manager_is_unappreciative_but_is/,"I found an internship in college and worked for a nice company in my town for about 9 months as an intern. At the end of that time I was offered a full-time position making a good amount of money.

My manager as an intern left the company and created a position for me at the new company. 50% increase in pay and I've worked with him previously so I switched.

9 months after starting the new job there are layoffs and he is sent packing along with myself and 7 other people (out of a 24 person team).

If I find a job on my own, I'm looking at making monetarily what I did at my first job or maybe even as low as I did as an intern. 

Or, my old boss has a new job and is offering a new job for me this week where I'll probably make 2 or 2.5x what I'd make on my own.

In addition to the fear of job instability, he also undervalues everything I've done for work. He regularly treats me and refers to me as his assistant even though I have a lot to offer.

Should I take the risky, high-paying job and deal with it or should I try to make a name for myself other places where it would take substially longer to find work and I would make less?

I have a job at about 20 - 25 hours a week outside of uni to support my family. I got 'promoted' to a managers role about 6 months ago, but all that means is more responsibility and stress (yes stress from a restaurant job. Every week or so my job gets threatened and when my family relies on me that is stressful) for no extra pay.

It's really close to my home and uni, which is a plus, but I've applied for a data entry job which has better pay with around the same hours (20 - 22 hours) but its much further away.

My question is, when I get a software dev job or internship, how can I explain going from a 'manager' at a restaurant to a data entry job which is much better for me, even though it doesn't look it on paper?"
394jxu,20,2015-06-09,More stories from Boyfriend #2,[deleted],hotpast,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotpast/comments/394jxu/more_stories_from_boyfriend_2/,"I knew that my wife hired a professional photographer and did a ""naughty"" photo-shoot for ex-boyfriend #2.  She told me about it but doesn't know that I found them on her computer a while back.  When we went out this weekend (and got a bit tipsy), we talked about our random past experiences and I asked her if she's ever been naked in front of a stranger.  I assumed she was going to bring up the photographer because I wanted to hear more about that, but instead she told me that she was naked in front of strangers (plural!) twice (more plural!), and neither involved that photographer I knew about!

My wife and I went to the same college, she met Boyfriend #2 at a summer internship but he was at a different college.  They decided do the long distance thing and visited each other's campuses often.  During one of his visits, a campus bar had a foxy boxing/oil wrestling contest, it's mostly visited by freshman (18 to enter but 21 to drink).  To get more girls to enter the contest, the girl and the guy that brought her in got to drink free the entire night.  Boyfriend #2 had never been there and wanted to drink free that night.  She agreed to go, strip to her underwear, and wrestle while a random guy poured oil on her.  I couldn't believe it when she told me since I've heard stories about how crazy the girls get.  One of the unwritten rules was that to win, you had to rip all the clothes off your opponent and the winner gets an extra shot.  I couldn't believe she did it because she was a senior at that point and was also a teaching assistant for two periods of physics.  I just imagine some lucky an underclassmen being taught by her, going to a bar, and got to see my wife covered naked (and covered in oil) before I did just because she wanted her boyfriend at the time to have free drinks for a night.  

The second time was for his graduation and she visited him.  Him and his friends celebrated by playing poker.  These were pretty high stakes apparently, like $200 to buy in.  Anyway, at the end, they were all pretty drunk and started betting non-cash items because one of the guys was really good and they didn't want to stop playing.  Someone wagered their car even.  Well boyfriend #2 had a really good hand and nothing to bet with. So he said he'll streak the campus if he loses.  That offer was turned down because no one wanted to see him naked, but would take him up on his bet if my wife did the streaking.  Of course, she said no.  But after a lot of prodding from her boyfriend (claiming he couldn't lose), encouragement from the two girls that were there, and her negotiating the terms... the bet was that she would be a ""runway model"" and would wear 5 outfits that the girls picked out to model for everyone in the room.  As you might have guessed, the boyfriend lost and she had to do the runway walk.  There was two caveats that she didn't realize.  One of the guys was in a frat and had a bunch of his frat brothers stop by for the show.  The other was that one of the that girls lived there was a theater major and she had a large wardrobe.  She doesn't remember all 5 outfits she wore but the first one was a sexy Halloween maid custom.  It wasn't too revealing and the guys got rowdy and asked the girls to pick out more slutty clothes.  The next one was her in her thong underwear and a red body stocking.  By the last outfit, she wore elbow long gloves, knee high socks, a choker necklace, high heels, and a large hat... nothing else!  When I asked if she felt uncomfortable, she told me that she liked it after a while because if felt empowering, so much so that she ""wore"" the last outfit for a couple hours until they decided to leave.  I couldn't really relate to the empowering part but it's crazy hot that she was just lounging around naked for everyone because her boyfriend lost a bet.  

P.S. She said she's going to recreate the last outfit for me one of these days!"

Okay, back to the point.  Talked for 5 months, found out she was still with her ex (kinda), after we had talked about being together.  She left for an internship (out of state.) I stopped talking to her about a week and a half ago.  Got a text sunday saying she missed me and wanted to talk to me.  

So me being me, I respond.  We chat she asks why I did not talk to her, I tell her shee has a bf, and that she drunk called me while away on her internship and told me she was going to go back to her boyfriend and for me to not wait for her.  She tells me when she drinks she does not know what she is saying.  But I am a firm believer in drunk words= sober thoughts.   She tells me she likes mee and wants to be with me.

Now my second issue.  Checked her bfs twitter today, and a week ago (when we stopped talking and she stopped texting me, and deleted me from snapchat.)  Was a tweet that read he was leaving for her location from his hometown.  Which means too me that we did not communicate because he was down by her internship and i was deleted from snapchat because she wanted to hide me from him.  She has told me SO MANY TIMES they were broken up.
She also told me she deactivated her snapchat because of some bullshit, but I am speculate that she deleted me because she did not want her bf to see us snapping or something.

I feel like I got played for a fool and we have been texting the last 2 days because she told me she was single.  I know this post is all over the fucking place, but I hope someone can understand where I am coming from.

 I was happy with no contact with her.....  I was moving on, then she tels me she wants to be with me then I see her ""bf's"" twitter that he was visiting her a week ago (the week we didnt talk.)  I am just dumbfounded that I can be so fucking stupid....

Sorry for the long post reddit...  Really just needed this one off my chest.

Thanks guys

Edit:  Sorry for grammar, just mad as fuck with myself right now for being a complete fool, and wanted to type this out as fast as possible and try too not make it a snooze fest of a story.

TL;DR-  Girl told me she wants to be with me, has bf, says they broke up, bf visits her a few states away a week ago, feeling kinda dumb"

394whu,3,2015-06-09,"I'm pretty happy where I am right now, but I feel like people look down on me if I try to express it (warning this is super long and meandering)",missfishersmurder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/394whu/im_pretty_happy_where_i_am_right_now_but_i_feel/,"I've always been ambitious. I wouldn't call myself cutthroat or ruthless, but there's been very little in my life that I wanted that I haven't been able to get through sheer willpower, hard work, and luck. I would consider myself selectively competitive; I don't feel the need to be the best at everything, but when I take an interest in something, I have no interest in coming in second or lower. My parents sent me to an incredibly expensive private high school and I took out some loans and got some scholarships to continue at a private college. All of my friends are in white collar jobs and have little to no experience working for minimum wage; many of them are in finance, law, securities, or...other industries that I don't really understand.

Anyway, I dropped out of college in my last year due to mental health issues. I ended up hospitalized for a little while, but since I was legally an adult and didn't seem too unstable, I was put back in school, which was a huge mistake because I was in fact extremely unstable and I self-destructed big time--hence the dropping out. Since then I've moved states and have been working as a dog walker for the past two years.

And frankly, I'm really happy with this job. I love animals; if I could tell my younger self one thing, it's that there's more to me as a person than a desire to write novels or draw comics. Also, starving is not fun. The hours are flexible, my boss is accommodating, my fellow walkers are really sweet people. A lot of clients are pretty nice. And honestly, I'm getting paid to run around all day with dogs and take them to the park and take pictures of them looking cute and happy.

But the job doesn't pay that much, it doesn't come with health insurance, it's physically demanding, and the hours can be long and unpredictable. I don't get sick days unless I'm dying, and I've definitely gone to work running a fever or had to pull over to throw up into a trashcan. Vacations are basically something that have to be requested and are not guaranteed.

And, let's face it, my parents invested so much money and time into my education; in addition to putting me in private schools since birth, there have been private tutoring sessions and summer classes and nepotism internships. They're both really disappointed that I've been working as a dog walker for so long; I haven't talked with my dad since I started, and my mom lies to her friends about what it is I'm doing. I've technically applied to go back to school in the fall, but I haven't sent the transcripts in, and they're several months late at this point and I frankly don't want to. School was hands down one of the worst experiences of my life, I'm terrified that re-entering that competitive and achievement-focused mindset will just result in me self-destructing in a more permanent fashion.

Idk, I'm really happy where I am right now. It feels like my life has been really fast-paced and I'm finally able to catch my breath. I don't think I'd be able to work in an office environment at all, actually; interacting with people makes me tired and cranky and unproductive, and after a certain point physical stuff starts kicking in because I take such shoddy care of myself when I'm depressed. But I can't talk to any of my friends about this--it feels like all of them are waiting on me to shake off this stage of my life and join them in the six figure salary zone. Saying that I would be happy to run around as a dog walker for the rest of my life feels taboo.

The attitude is pretty pervasive. Clients have asked me what I ""really"" do...and yes, technically, I am a freelance writer and I do partially support myself that way, and I'm more than glad to talk about that. But I don't know why I can't just say that I'm a dog walker because I like dogs and I want to work with them.

Why is it so wrong to say that this job makes me happy? It doesn't come with fancy perks, it doesn't sound that impressive when you talk about it, but it's the first job I've had that I've genuinely enjoyed and wanted to do well. I'm not even sure why I feel so upset about this.

**tl;dr**: whine whine i love my job but it's a shitty service job and ~~everyone in my life is condescending about it.~~ internalized classism sucks."
39572c,4,2015-06-09,Sales job offer advice requested.,sugawaterpurple,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/39572c/sales_job_offer_advice_requested/,"I have an offer and I would like some input. The position would start at the end of July. It's for a 5 years old company in San Francisco, CA with maybe $30mil in revenue and has millions in funding. (end stages of startup) It has very big growth and also doubled its size and revenue year after year. You may have heard of the company.    
  
I need help deciding... I've been up late for the past couple days trying to make an important decision. Experience salespeople in software, tech, saas, startup, etc. etc. who want to give me advice, itll be appreciated.  
  
  
I'm a new graduate with some sales part-time, retail and corporate sales internships as well as other work. My degree is in Business. While I have done every sales related job function like flyering, cold calling, etc. this will be my first full time commission based job. I'm fairly confident I will do ok ESP since they are incoming leads, I have done well in the past but I have doubts for things out of my control related to the company itself.
  
For this particular startup of 5 years.. what are some potential redflags/downsides (mainly related to risk)? What are the chances that I'll be out of a job in 3 years? or that sales will experience major shifts and growing pains and it'll be very hard to make the quotas? bad management? Other risk associated with a younger company i'm not thinking of?  
 
  
Currently their base salary is $32,000 and commission is at 10%. $10000 is their minimum quota and if you hit $20,000 twice consecutively, you get promoted. The promotion moves you out of SMB into middle market. It raises your base to $45k and the OTE they give is $100k. Your commission goes up as well as the min quota but I don't know the numbers.  
From there if you hit $25,000 6 times in the year, you get promoted into their corporate consultant position. OTE is $150k and I'm guessing base is around $70k.  
If you manage to hit more goals, then their last level is enterprise sales where the OTE is $315k.  
  
A few concerns:  
- job stability and risk. there is tremendous growth but unsure how long it'll last. 
- Is there a possibility of the company exaggerating the OTE? possibly at the higher promotions. They dont have ANY current sales staff at the enterprise level, so it kind of makes me think they put it there to motivate everyone but in reality it'll be next to impossible to get there. But they are a young company. 
Out of 65 sales people, they have 4 at the corporate consultant level and they are outside sales people. So it's doable but not easy at all.  
- stress of losing job or making little money once the golden years runs out?  
- The company's main business model is to target the SMB market. Their software allows small businesses leverage to compete with the bigger corporations. This makes me hesitant to believe that there is true opportunity at the Mid market or corporate level. If their business plan is to corner the SMB market, then they must think that the corporate or bigger fishes are not viable, or have strong competitors right? Is the pay/promotion structure just a motivational scheme?  
  
Opportunity cost - I have a job offer to work in accounting audit making $65k a year. It has stability, a proven promotion schedule that will ultimately lead to $100k+ if you put your years in. It's boring, it's long hours, it's full of travel, it's not as fun, I dont enjoy it as much as sales. But it's a damn good secure spot so if this job with the startup sounds like something too good to be true, I'll take the safe route and kiss sales goodbye. I also may be able to go from audit back to sales, but next to impossible to go from the sales opp back into public accounting for my situation.  

What are your thoughts?"

395dk6,15,2015-06-09,NSis is still going nowhere... But I'm on my road to recovery. Could I ask for more advice?,thisisbutamask,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/395dk6/nsis_is_still_going_nowhere_but_im_on_my_road_to/,"Hello, you may have seen my post nearly a year ago. I just want to thank everyone for their support and words of wisdom. I really couldn't have come to this point without it!

Here's an update: after some more observation and conversation, I think my sister either has some heavy FLEAS or is a full blown N herself. Her eating disorder hasn't improved, and neither has her neurotic personality. It's unfortunate I can't help her but it's out of my hands. And that's lifted a great weight in my heart. Being in college and away from my family also helped.

That being said, I've got some FLEAS myself. I find it hard to take criticism, I mortify myself with social blunders of any kind, minor or major, and I still have outbursts of unreasonable anger. But I can finally take phone calls and I'm much more comfortable being out in public. I've become more adventurous and outgoing, even causing people to believe I'm some sort of extroverted fun person! Can you believe that?

But that seems to fall apart in anything vaguely 'adult'. I've been looking for internships and volunteering opportunities but I freeze up whenever I'm handed responsibility. I also panic at handling my own finances after being dependent on my parents to take care of anything. I can just hear my NMother saying, ""Can't you do anything right? This is why you shouldn't do things by yourself. Why didn't you just take the job dad offered?"" Ugh! Get out of my head!

This whole thing upsets me greatly. I thought I made great strides in improving myself and getting ""detoxed"" but I'm so afraid of failure and messing up. What if she was right? What if I'm doomed to be irresponsible and terrible at everything?

What do you all do to get rid of this heart-stopping anxiety? Or stop the hurtful comments swimming in your head?"

3967rg,2,2015-06-09,Me (27M) with my girlfriend (26F) of almost 6 months; giving each other space this week to figure things out by not talking,fartnoisesthrowaway3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3967rg/me_27m_with_my_girlfriend_26f_of_almost_6_months/,"Long story short: my girlfriend and I are giving each other space this week by not talking Monday through Friday in order to “figure things out.”  It’s a short term plan for an issue that just recently popped up.


Some background: We’ve been dating for almost 6 months, and things have been perfect.  There’s so much I like about her and the relationship, however the past few weeks have been tough for several reasons.  We are both under extreme amounts of pressure, which in turn has applied pressure to the relationship.  She has been incredibly busy and stressed out with work, family visiting from out of town, personal illness, and traveling.  I have been incredibly busy with moving to a different city for the summer, starting an internship, moving into a new apartment back home, traveling a lot for work, and dealing with family illnesses.  During all of this, I didn’t expect for things to be the same for when we were starting out, but I did expect to feel like a boyfriend – right now I feel like an accessory.  She is a naturally introverted person, and with so much going on, she has been seeking her own personal space and in turn has started to push me away, which is what has made things tough and not seem normal.  She has difficulties dealing with stress, and her solution is to just be by herself and sometimes cut off contact with others.


Speculation: She mentioned that she is so used to being by herself that she is having a hard time figuring out how to satisfy another person in a relationship.  Could it be that since she had been single for so long, she is starting to fall for me and it is scaring her and in turn she is pushing me away?  What hurts the most is that she said I did nothing wrong in order to push her away – I in fact had been pumping the brakes on the relationship a little bit in order to give her the space she needed.  It also hurts because I myself have been so used to being single – I hadn’t been in a relationship for 5 years before meeting her.  I took a leap of faith and opened myself up to her because I felt so comfortable in the relationship, and now it feels like she is shutting the door on me.  I feel like I’m falling in love with this woman, but I don’t know what to do.  I do also feel like this is a temporary setback for us, as she won’t always be this busy with work and my internship ends in early August.


Next steps: The problem that we face is the next few weeks are going to be even harder – she will be even busier with work, and I will be traveling 2 weekends in a row and won’t be able to go home to see her until the 4th of July weekend.  We spoke on Sunday and agreed to take it week by week.  I am going home this weekend and we are going out on a date Saturday evening and then will resume our conversation later that night.


Advice: I need your advice on what to do over the next few weeks, and for the remainder of the summer.  We both agreed that we want each other and that we are committed to making this work.  She is unsure about what to do, so I’ve tried making this easy on her.  What is a reasonable approach to communicating with each other but giving each other space?  If she is afraid of getting close, how can I help her navigate through this?  How can I communicate that this is hurting me and I need her input without upsetting her?  I don’t want to lose this woman, and I’m remaining optimistic, but I do need some insight.


TL;DR – Girlfriend of almost 6 months and I are not speaking this week in order to give each other space and time to think.  Approaching weeks look to be even more difficult with time being spent away from each other.  Need help organizing my thoughts and feelings, as well as figuring out a game plan to navigate through the rest of the summer with her."

**The employer:** Garment production house.

**The story:**

Young woman interned at business for two years unpaid while studying at university for relevant program in fashion. Internship was not approved or arranged by university. In that time, her “training” included working on garments that were sold for profit, and she did work that would generally be done by a paid worker. Interns are barely supervised by boss and are generally taught by other interns.

As compensation for the internship, the boss offered to produce final collection for the woman’s fashion program, free of charge. (Assembly of garments by other sources is permissible in program; student is charged with design/production process/everything else.) However, halfway through final production, the boss decided it must be paid for. No written contract or agreement was ever made, but given that not completing the final project would essentially result in failure, her hands were tied and a verbal agreement was made to continue. It would cost thousands, apparently, but it is under 10k.

Post-graduation, the internship became paid employment, though it was paid under the table in cash as a “contractor.” There was a somewhat shaky agreement that some hours worked would be put towards the amount owed, but no one in accounting/payroll ever kept track of this. However, on top of that the boss expected overtime (44+hr weeks) even though she would only work four days a week and be paid for 32h at slightly above minimum wage. To be honest, I am unsure if there is any record of official employment with company, as the company’s paperwork is miserably out of order, and finances are in absolute ruin. Even so, over the course of six months she accrued hundreds of hours of unpaid overtime. (I myself was working 60h weeks for 40h pay, but that’s a whole other story.)

After leaving the company late last summer, communication was largely cut off, but boss still sent occasional reminder email asking for payment. She has ignored these emails.

Today she gets an email threatening to sue for the amount owed. Boss namedrops a law firm that is potentially completely irrelevant – sports law! This firm is owned by clients of boss. These lawyer clients may have no idea they are being roped into this; boss has a habit of using clients in law for this purpose – he will threaten people who haven’t paid their bills with legal action from xyz firm without actually consulting with that firm. Irony: these clients are also in arrears to boss by a couple thousand dollars. If the lawyer clients are aware that their firm is being used, they may be in some sort of agreement to wipe away the debt in exchange for extracting payment, but I also find this doubt-worthy, as it is only a couple thousand on both ends. Boss is very much in financial tailspin and this strikes me as a desperate bid to get funds with a threat; he doesn't have the money to be playing with lawyers.

**Current action:** She is drafting an email telling him to sod off or she will expose him for his illegal business practices, which go far beyond what has happened to her. (Like I said, I am also a former employee. The horror stories can go on and on, lmao.) 

Thoughts? Suggested plan of action? Should she tell him to fuck off or just ignore him? Is she threatening him (legally speaking) by saying she'll air his dirty laundry? Could that open her up to backlash? Should I get involved? Depending on where things go, I would not be opposed to being involved legally, but for now I’m staying on the sidelines of this."

396qko,2,2015-06-09,Ignoring my narcissistic mother.,floralpapers,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/396qko/ignoring_my_narcissistic_mother/,"I have been ignoring my parents for a week now; the only person I speak to is my older brother.  We are both ignoring our narcissistic mother.

Our fallout began with us telling her that we wanted a dog or cat.  But all our mother could focus on was the fact that the pet would be a nuisance to her; she didn't consider our feelings at all.  She even had the gall to say that my brother and I were irresponsible children that did not respect out parents' wishes, despite the fact that I had never disobeyed her once.  

A little background information, I had always been the stereotypical Asian “star-child:” perfect grades, great college, obedient to a fault, never dated or stayed out late, etc.  The rest of my family would always herald me as this perfect girl that they wished was their daughter; my mother always bragged to her friends and even strangers about me.  I literally got a near 4.0 at a very difficult university known for grade deflation; however, all of my achievements just seem “normal” and expected of me.  On the other hand, the rest of my family sees my brother as a fuck-up: “sub-par” grades, not familial at all, disobedient, etc.  Except, he is not.  He is the actual normal child.

At this point, I just can't wait to go back to college for the fall semester; I won't have to interact with them on a daily basis.  I will be employed this summer: part-time sales associate and an internship beginning in July, all of these opportunities that I have found for myself, without any family help or guidance.  I had always been relatively independent, but now I am trying to be completely self-sufficient.

My brother suggested I start seeking some counseling, since he believes that I have self-esteem and self-worth issues that go much deeper than this.  Is there anything else that I could do?  I don't want to completely cut off my family, but it is as if I can never fully communicate my feelings to them (the language barrier doesn't help either), without them making it about themselves and guilt-tripping me into thinking how ungrateful I am being."

**Here to buy only? Skip down to the table.** 
I have noticed that some people are not happy that I am selling samples of shaving soaps. I would like to share with everyone a little about why I’m doing this.  I am a University student struggling to get done with my bachelor’s degree and I’m currently out on summer break. I have been looking for summer jobs and internships but I have had a hard time finding stable jobs. I have been working odd jobs trying to support my family and myself but that has not been enough.  I have been trying to get money anyway I can even if it’s a little bit, as in the case of selling soap samples.  I combine everything I get in money to make at least something for the week.  I do not want to get stuck in getting welfare from the government, as I feel I should be able to work for myself. Once I get a job with my degree (about 2 more years) my hope is that me and my family’s economic status will change for the better, but for now I will keep doing what I can to sustain my family.

I created this resume using LaTeX and moderncv package. I wanted to avoid ""deedy"" resume as i did not like the look/style.

Other people have told me the following:

1. To not include contact details below my name in the top right of the resume. They said people would question if it's the same as the bottom and could be confusing.

2. To include only relevant hobbies that have ""produced"" a product. My web dev hobbies have a website I'm messing around with, but nothing thats close to production. My game dev is ongoing and is off/on based on how busy I am. During school it was hard to devote time to it, so its been just a learning experience (with some working code and frameworks I've made along the way). I want to include these to show I have diverse interests related to the field and take initiative to learn new techniques/standards, etc.

3. Don't include my job history as it's not ""professional"" programming experience (the job types i'm seeking).


I also have a few projects from college:


1. (Software engineering class) An android app that helps developers plan out and coordinate goals for a project. (app is not complete as we couldnt get a proper webservice to a database running)

2. (Mobile software development class) An android app for planning out stories/books/diaries, etc. (has workable features and could be finish given a decent amount of time investment, but is not play store worthy)

4. (Web software development class) A simple church based website with javascript, jquery, and php for a login system. Church users could log in, change profile info, upload photos, search photos, etc). This website isn't production worthy, but does demonstrate some working features if connected to a MySql database).

What should I do for an e-portfolio / put on my resume for these?

What do you guys think and what are good/bad parts about this resume?

What should be removed / added?

396wa9,2,2015-06-09,I(/19) still miss my ex,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/396wa9/i19_still_miss_my_ex/,"Hi Reddit,

I really need your help.
At the end of 2014 I was together with this internetguy, we'd developed feelings for eachother especially during the summerholidays, and we were very good friends before and even after that. Around October we decided we'd just start dating and all went ok, until he started to get emotionally abusive towards me. I'd already lost a lot of friends over the summertime because I grew closer to him, but he'd always change my view on things by talking it out of me. I never realised it until our close group of friends had split up and people that used to be my best friends now really disliked me. 
Since we'd met on the internet, I was already packing up and planning to move in with him and get a job there. I had everything planned out, there was an internship waiting for me over there I could do first and then after a few months decide whether I'd stay or not. 

Around November he started sending me screencaps from dating apps/sites he was still on.. and he did a lot of other things I didn't like, another example would be him sleeping over at girls' their houses, watching movies with them until they'd fall asleep. Just what the fuck? I started to feel awful about going to meet him for the first time.

I guess I didn't know what to do or what to think. I had no friends left but him. I decided to download the same datingapp as he was using and I met a guy on there I'd never seen in real life before. A mutual friend of our is a girl I used to hang out a lot, and she told me she used to be best friends with this guy. Since my relationship with the internet-ex was a secret anyway, I met up with the guy. We didn't do any intimate things - I knew I could if I wanted to, because no one would find out. But I didn't want to.

Thing is, my ex always said 'we were not really together anyway', because we'd never met in real life. He sure was right, but I felt committed. I wanted us to work out. When I met this new guy, I saw a way out - and I kept 'chilling' with him. We'd watch series together and just have fun in general. I saw my life get better everytime I'd see him.

When he kept going on calling me out on things, just being the emotionally abusive dick he was, he started to realise I wasn't going to stay... I guess it made him angry. We had an argument about a person that he thought was a 'waste of space', he wanted to know what that 'waste' had told me about something. I lied at first, then I refused to tell him what the 'waste' said.
He turned every-single-person that used to be my friends against me. Even the people that didn't like him. It made me realise how two-faced people can be. 

I am very happy with the guy I met during those dark times. I love him an incredible lot. We've been going strong for quite a while now. 
But when I lost my ex, I lost a lot of friends too. I lost a community of people who were very close together. I have been shunned. I can't seem to get over the feeling they got rid of me as if I was worth nothing, because I did care about every person I knew.

I know all of this shouldn't bother me. I know some people feel like 'internetfriends aren't real'. But some people actually *were* a huge part of my life. I can't get my ex out of my head. We were so strong for a long time. We had our ups and a LOT of downs, but for some reason, when I remember those times, I only see pink-blueish skies and unicorns dancing around. What is this? Why?

TL;DR - I miss my shitty ex I've never even met, my boyfriend is absolutely amazing and we never even fight, but I still can't let go."

So after stumbling across this sub, I have decided that I want to try my hand at home brewing. I have done a bit of research, and I am at the point where I think I am ready to start looking at starter kits. Unfortunately, money is the biggest obstacle for me. I am living at home during my unpaid internship and have no job yet to provide any kind of income. I do, however, have about $50 in amazon gift cards.

 I found a starter kit at my LHBS website for $49.99 that allows me to pay through amazon. [Here is a link to the kit.] (http://wineandbeermaking.com/product/brewing-equipment-kits/10-gift-certificate-copy/) 
That seems like a really low price from what I have seen at other places. What I really want to know is:

*  Does this kit actually have everything I need to get started with homebrewing? I know that it is likely about as bare bones as it gets but at this point I really just want to get a feel for the process.



* Will this kit allow me to upgrade further as I gain experience and more money? I would like to expand and upgrade in the future, so I want to make sure that some of the stuff included in this kit will still be useful to me and I am not going to have to completely scrap my $50 investment. 

I am really excited to start down my personal home brewing journey! Please share your thoughts on this kit or any other alternatives that I should consider. Thanks!"

397dnn,1,2015-06-09,Not enjoying my job/life abroad. Advice is welcome.,casterapple,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/397dnn/not_enjoying_my_joblife_abroad_advice_is_welcome/,"Hey, all. Buckle in--it's gonna be a long one.

I'm a 20-year-old girl, I recently graduated from college, and I'm currently living in Antofagasta, Chile. I've only been here for a month so far, and I've only been working for two weeks. When I say ""working,"" I mean at an internship rather than a real job. I'm teaching English at a small language institute. I don't get paid much, but that doesn't bother me. Going into this, my expectations were that I would just about break even on this whole venture.

My motivation in coming here was to learn Spanish, experience a different culture, travel, gain work experience (both for my own benefit and for my résumé), and discover if I wanted to teach English as a career. I definitely feel like my Spanish is improving, as well as my teaching skills. However, I feel fairly certain that I don't want to teach as a career.

Also, the institute I work for is pretty disorganized, which makes my job more stressful and less enjoyable. I do often enjoy my classes, but I feel like novelty might be a strong factor in that. I also would say that I don't look forward to my classes; I'd much rather not teach than teach. I don't get paid much, but my hours are very flexible and I often get a lot of free time.

I've been considering alternatives to my situation because I don't feel fulfilled here. I know that nine months is a short time, but when I think about doing this same thing every day for nine months, I can't imagine it.

However, there are some solid benefits to staying here. I'm living nearly rent-free in a nice apartment downtown, close to my job, with the sweetest roommate in the world. Like I said, I get a lot of downtime--I'm not working 40 hours a week. I've been able to practice my Spanish. I'm making friends with students (who are about my age) and other teachers, plus I'm friends with many members of the organization that matched me with this internship (again, my age).

Obviously, there are plenty of downsides as well. The institute is so poorly organized that I can't plan classes until about 10 minutes before class starts. I don't always work with the same students; a single student could be taught by a different teacher every time, making consistency impossible. Students are roughly divided by English fluency level, but these assessments are inconsistent, and an ""upper basic"" student might speak English easily or might have a lot of trouble with speaking and comprehension.

Another downside is that the city isn't really that interesting. It's beautiful, but I haven't found much to do other than go to the library or mall. I go out on the weekends with friends, which is lots of fun, but by myself there's not a whole lot to do. I think I'd prefer a more modern city--or maybe one with more greenery. Either way, it's not my ideal place.

The bottom line is that I don't know what to do. I know that I haven't been here long, and I plan to stick it out for as long as I can. But at the same time, the main reason I did this was to have a fun adventure, and there are very few times when I consider this a fun adventure. I'm only 20 years old; I have a bit of money saved up, and I feel like this is my time to travel and make stupid choices, rather than resigning myself to nine months of doing work that is bearable, but that I don't particularly enjoy, in a city that is all right, but that I don't particularly enjoy.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

**tl;dr: Moved to Chile to teach English for nine months. I don't really enjoy the work or the city, but I don't want to give up. I also haven't been here long. What should I do?**"

397h5w,2,2015-06-09,Not enjoying my job/life abroad. Advice? (X-post /r/solotravel),casterapple,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/397h5w/not_enjoying_my_joblife_abroad_advice_xpost/,"Hey, all. Buckle in--it's gonna be a long one.

I'm a 20-year-old girl, I recently graduated from college, and I'm currently living in Antofagasta, Chile. I've only been here for a month so far, and I've only been working for two weeks. When I say ""working,"" I mean at an internship rather than a real job. I'm teaching English at a small language institute. I don't get paid much, but that doesn't bother me. Going into this, my expectations were that I would just about break even on this whole venture.

My motivation in coming here was to learn Spanish, experience a different culture, travel, gain work experience (both for my own benefit and for my résumé), and discover if I wanted to teach English as a career. I definitely feel like my Spanish is improving, as well as my teaching skills. However, I feel fairly certain that I don't want to teach as a career.

Also, the institute I work for is pretty disorganized, which makes my job more stressful and less enjoyable. I do often enjoy my classes, but I feel like novelty might be a strong factor in that. I also would say that I don't look forward to my classes; I'd much rather not teach than teach. I don't get paid much, but my hours are very flexible and I often get a lot of free time.

I've been considering alternatives to my situation because I don't feel fulfilled here. I know that nine months is a short time, but when I think about doing this same thing every day for nine months, I can't imagine it.

However, there are some solid benefits to staying here. I'm living nearly rent-free in a nice apartment downtown, close to my job, with the sweetest roommate in the world. Like I said, I get a lot of downtime--I'm not working 40 hours a week. I've been able to practice my Spanish. I'm making friends with students (who are about my age) and other teachers, plus I'm friends with many members of the organization that matched me with this internship (again, my age).

Obviously, there are plenty of downsides as well. The institute is so poorly organized that I can't plan classes until about 10 minutes before class starts. I don't always work with the same students; a single student could be taught by a different teacher every time, making consistency impossible. Students are roughly divided by English fluency level, but these assessments are inconsistent, and an ""upper basic"" student might speak English easily or might have a lot of trouble with speaking and comprehension.

Another downside is that the city isn't really that interesting. It's beautiful, but I haven't found much to do other than go to the library or mall. I go out on the weekends with friends, which is lots of fun, but by myself there's not a whole lot to do. I think I'd prefer a more modern city--or maybe one with more greenery. Either way, it's not my ideal place.

The bottom line is that I don't know what to do. I know that I haven't been here long, and I plan to stick it out for as long as I can. But at the same time, the main reason I did this was to have a fun adventure, and there are very few times when I consider this a fun adventure. I'm only 20 years old; I have a bit of money saved up, and I feel like this is my time to travel and make stupid choices, rather than resigning myself to nine months of doing work that is bearable, but that I don't particularly enjoy, in a city that is all right, but that I don't particularly enjoy.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

**tl;dr: Moved to Chile to teach English for nine months. I don't really enjoy the work or the city, but I don't want to give up. I also haven't been here long. What should I do?**"
397hkc,2,2015-06-09,What to sacrifice: love or dreams? [23/m],DeepDish815,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/397hkc/what_to_sacrifice_love_or_dreams_23m/,"Hey there r/relationshipadvice. I'm kind of reaching out in the darkness here; I remembered how supportive and helpful the reddit community can be in bad times, and so here I am. First, the background.

I'm a [23/m] in a relationship with a [24/f]. We have been dating for a little less than a year at this point, but we have been best friends for about 8 years. She was my first girlfriend in high school, but that relationship ended poorly, I broke up with her over the phone on the bus. We were 15 and 16. Since then we've been best friends and both been in and out of other relationships, but we've had a sexual relationship ourselves intermittently during that time. She took my virginity when I was 18. 

We both went through college at different places and went through the ups and downs of college romance. She is now done with two years of law school, and is in the middle of her summer law internship in the large midwestern city that we grew up in. She will receive an amazing job offer from this firm to return upon graduation after one more year of law school. I've been in the city we grew up in for the past year since graduating, trying to make it as a singer/actor.

The next year of our lives is what is inciting all of my uncertainty. This Satruday, I am leaving to perform with a summer stock theater company for the next 11 weeks. By the time I get back to the city we are from, she will be gone studying abroad in Europe for the fall semester, and then will have one more semester of law school in upstate new york. This past year has been a somewhat trying time for both of us while trying to build and maintain a relationship at a distance. 

The rest of my uncertainty stems from the different places we seem to be at in our lives. She is about to be done with law school and is totally committed to her career and making a life in the city that we both grew up in and both love dearly. She isn’t ready to be married or engaged, but she is ready to be with the person she marries and start making a life. I, on the other hand, have this desire to try to make it as a performer, to live in some other cities and maybe countries, probably go to graduate school in another city for at least two years, and to just have some more diverse life experiences before I am ready to settle down. I do ultimately want to end up in this city-its where my entire family and many of my friends live-but I want to do and see some other things first.

If I had to choose today, there is no one else that comes close in my mind to someone to spend the rest of my life with. She is my best friend; we seem to think with the same brain a lot of the time. I respect her, I admire her, and I feel the closest thing I’ve ever felt to love for her. But I have intense doubts. She stopping by my place after she finishes work tonight, and she has noticed that I’ve been upset lately. 

So…reactions? Advice? Am I crazy? Thanks.

I will be transferring to ECU this fall as a sophomore and majoring in Information and Computer Technology. 

1. How competitive are the paid IT internships/co-ops? Does having lots of certs help? How picky are employers about experience and references? Any rough idea on what percentage of ICTS majors get paid internships/co-ops? 

2. From what I understand the unpaid ICTS internships are with ECU's IT Dept.  What kind of positions do interns usually end up working?  How much do certs determine the kind of position that you'll be working? E.g. Would you still be likely to work a tier I help desk or desktop support position, even if you're CCNA or MCTS certified?

Also, I need some advice/feedback until the applications.

I am an international Computer Engineering (we don't have CS here) student with a GPA of 3.36, though my CS-only gpa is 3.25. I did my exchange semester in UT Austin and I absolutely loved it. The university, the people, the city, the music, everything.. My CS classes in UT are graded A, A- and a C. I am currently not planning to stay in academia(although that might change if I do an MS) so my main reason to get in to an MS is to expand my knowledge in the field, get to live in Austin more and maybe get a job in the US(Austin preferably :)). I am mainly interested in machine learning/big data, that's why I want an MS in CS or stats.

I also did a (kind of)research internship at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona if that helps(related to networks). I also talked to one of my professors here lately about working with him over the summer related to machine learning/statistical analysis etc. I believe both of these professors will be willing to write a good recommendation letter for me. I am also going to write to my lecturers at UT Austin about a recommendation letter, but they will barely remember me, so I am not so sure of that. Unfortunately, when I was in UT, I took classes from guest lecturers from industry instead of CS faculty members at UT(pretty stupid, ha?).

I know my GPA is low for a top tier university but I think that doing an exchange semester in Austin might increase my chances to get in. I might apply for different universities like NYU or USC(I think my chances to get in to Stanford, Berkeley, Georgia Tech etc. are really low), so if you have advice or feedback about any other universities, they will also be appreciated. To summarize:

- Do I have any chance at UT Austin?
- Do I have a chance in a different but comparable university?
- What do you think I should do until the applications?

Thanks for taking the time to reply."
397oze,4,2015-06-09,Host has come back and is making ridiculous threats about legal action over what they believe is an unclean room,crazycrazyPeople,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/397oze/host_has_come_back_and_is_making_ridiculous/,"***Update for anyone interested***

Since I posted this, the host escalated the complaint so that airbnb were involved and a case manager looked at the complaint. Airbnb has ultimately sided with us and is not pursuing us for payment. They informed us that they believe the pictures the host posted just show general wear and tear and they have advised the host in future to add a cleaning fee to their listings. In a last act of douchebaggery, the host posted practically everything they could find in their small apartment including a small rug with splotch marks on it (this could have been from absolutely any point in time I doubt this was inspected before she left), sweeping dust together on the floor and then taking a photo so that it looked like large clumps were just laying around (we then sent a photo to airbnb of the small hand vacuum she owned), and a photo of the oven which is so old that I doubt the marks on it could be removed short of sandblasting it. To be fair, it does look like a shit job (lol) was done on the toilet seat, but the bowl itself was clean so I guess the underside of the seat was missed, but either way it does not require $30 to fix just a wipe with disinfectant. 

As I said earlier this is our first experience with Airbnb so it does suck a bit but I am just putting this down to a nutty host who has unrealistic expectations. Your apartment doesn't get a makeover just because you had guests staying there. Oh and if there is still talk of legal action we will contact the landlord. Anyway thanks for your comments and support.

************************************************************************************

Hi,

I've had only one experience using airbnb and I just want to find out what I can do to make a host basically go away and leave my gf alone. We stayed at her place and left about 8 days before she arrived home from overseas (she was doing an internship). Before we arrived, someone else had stayed there after she left and we were her second occupants.

Long story short she arrived home yesterday afternoon and called my gf in a weird kind of way. My gf said the host wouldn't state her name or why she was calling until about two minutes into the conversation. She then expressed some complaints about her dissatisfaction with the cleaning regarding the toilet and the oven and also things like dust and blood on one of the bed posts (this was real wtf as neither of us bled while we were there that we can recall). Anyway the chief complaint was that there is now a stain on her mattress and also two pillows and a blanket were left there that weren't hers. My gf asked her what was the problem and what  was she expecting as a fix as the host had already cleaned the mess. In a round about way the host finally suggested we get a groupon coupon for house cleaning for about $40. Upon hearing this I fired off an email in (in reply to a follow up email she had sent) basically telling her she was nitpicking and we left the place as clean as we found it. For the mattress I told her that we had no idea that the pillow and blankets weren't hers and just assumed they were (why wouldn't we) and that we also went straight out to downtown to by some sheets to use on the bed, which don't have any stains on them so we don't know how her mattress could possibly be get stained but our sheets didn't. I then said we will not be paying any money. 

I said I would cut this short but apparently I am unable too. Anyway she is now emailing my girlfriend and texting her, saying she recorded the conversation and is threatening court (over $40 its ridculous lol). She has also requested $30 through airbnb.

What is my best course of action to close this down quickly. Should I contact airbnb or would this make me look bad? I really think we did the right thing and we did clean the apartment. I just think she is a little crazy. For example she doesn't have a vacuumn cleaner but wanted us to get rid of the dust. We're travelling for fucks sake we don't have a vacuum cleaner! I think the real issue is her landlord, once or twice during our stay her landlord was mentioned as being difficult and the host didn't want the landlord to know she was subletting the apartment. I think she is now trying to scam us to pay for her place to be cleaned.

Can anyone please give some advice. Thank you"

PROS:  

* $103K base salary. Made $135K last year with bonuses/overtime

* Short commute

* Help people get better when they are at their worst

* Close relationships with colleagues. 

* Very flexible schedule. 12-hour shifts allow for 3-4 shifts/week, maximum. Vacations without using any vacation time. 

* Nights I'm off I can chillax at home and play games, etc.
 
* I'm damn good at what I do. 

* Job security.

* Hourly. Any time I'm in the building I'm on the clock. 

* Hopefully buying a house soon and changing jobs would gum up the loan process. 


CONS:

* Labor-intensive: patients are getting larger and larger. Back hurts from time to time. Tore an ACL once. 

* Depressing: most patients do not do well or we are keeping alive needlessly. 

* Toxic/backwards corporate culture at current hospital were nurses are powerless and bureaucracy is infinite. 
 
* Intellectually unfulfilling: 50% of my shifts are making sure the appropriate checkboxes are checked for the rare audit or court case. Literally no other persons will look at said checkboxes. Knowing at times what patients really need and not being able to facilitate it for any number of reasons not limited to but including interns, family drama, stupid policies, etc. 

* Ever since I've been on nights, I've had odd medical issues ranging from near-constant eczema, what seemed to be IBS for several months, insomnia, fatigue when I'm off of work, weird sleep-induced achilles tendonitis. These issues may be completely incidental to being on nights the last few years, but their correlation should be noted. 

* I can't see myself doing this for 30 more years until I'm retirement age. 

* High-deductible health insurance with HSA.   

* I work a fair amount of holidays and every other weekend, so I miss out on many extended family gatherings, local festivals, etc. 

* No real upward mobility without seeking advanced nursing degrees which are about 90% fluff and depress me to think about. 



**PROSPECTIVE JOB: NURSE EDUCATOR/SPECIALIST FOR LARGE BIOMED PRODUCT COMPANY**  
PROS: 

* 50-75% travel: Explore different areas, rack up frequent flyer/hotel points. Eat at awesome restaurants on company dime. 

* Company car: If I sell my current car, I would save approximately $600/mo in gas and carrying a car note. New car every 3 years. No worries ever for maintenance. 

* I already know the product well. I'm a tech geek and this appeals to me greatly. I'd be good in this role (at least as described). I'd be educating ICU nurses, so right up my alley. 

* No office 9-5. I'd either be remote out of home or on-location with a client. 

* I would return to a diurnal lifestyle and hopefully above-mentioned health problems would improve. 

* Essentially labor-free. 

* (Most) weekends and holidays off. Rarely might need to fly/drive out on a Sunday afternoon or something. 

* Slightly better health insurance. Stock. 

* Other fringe benefits: cell phones, laptops, etc. 

* I can see myself doing this for many years if it works out. 

* Upward mobility though it's in a corporate environment. More results based than requiring pointless additional degrees. 


CONS: 

* Initial offer expected to be 85-90K. Up to 10% annual bonus. Unclear of what cap is. It is salaried, so any overtime worked is unpaid. 

* Travel: I have three children. If I have to be gone for long stretches, it ~~may~~ will put undue burden on my wife. After a year of training, the travel requirements will hopefully be more local and car-based, so hopefully this is minimized. I also have to account for the fact I'm essentially gone for 12-16 nights a month as it is merely by working them. 

* Huge multinational conglomerate. Stock prices are stagnating. Concern for long-term job security (although I guess I could always go back to being a bedside nurse in the interim).

* I've never been a corporate pawn and I have no idea how to fit into the norms of such a lifestyle. I've worn pajamas (scrubs) to work all my adult life. 

* Isolating -- any colleagues to speak of would be via conference call from another state. I'm probably okay with this, though. 

* Loss of flexibility with schedule. Vacations may depend more on when I can work it into calendar with product rollouts than when we would like to go. 

* I want to buy a house soon and changing jobs would complicate the loan qualification. 



**MY THOUGHTS**  
If salaries were equal, I'd chose the latter in a heartbeat. It has the potential to be more fulfilling to me as a person. The travel would be fun, at least at first, and if I were to move up the corporate ladder, its requirements would decrease somewhat. However, the thought of going from potentially $135K to 85K as the sole earner scares me. That's a *huge* potential decrease. That said, overtime at the hospital isn't as available this year as it was last year, and therefore I should base my salary expectations on what I am guaranteed- namely, 103K. In that context, I have to consider whether the fringe benefits and possible bonus on a salary of 85K would basically even out the differences. 85K with $600/mo savings in auto and a 10% bonus would be an additional 13.5K, so that's already 98.5K. I wonder, with taxes coming into play, if it's a wash.   
  
  


TL;DR: I have to choose between soul-crushing and back-aching for 135K or potentially fulfilling for 85K+fringe.

I've been working closely with the Producer (a professor of mine, and how I got the internship) as well as the Executive Producer/Director since early auditions in April. Mostly as a rhetorical and creative consultant, I've since been placed in charge of social media outreach and edited the newly created kickstarter campaign for the film. I've been working weekly with the crew, especially with the Exec. Producer/Director, and have recently been credited as Assistant Producer for the project!

Now, all the way back in April when I was offered this internship, I brought up the question of payment, and the Producer/professor of mine darted around the question, saying they would talk with the director about the matter, as well as offering me other ideas for payment in our partner studios-- which I haven't heard any more from since.

I've been keeping track of my hours since the start of pre-production, but as we are getting closer to production (and I'd be out of any other part-time work I can find for the entirety of production) and haven't heard from my producer/professor any more on the matter.

I tried subtly bringing it up to the Exec. Producer/Director who I've been working with, but they didn't seem to know what I was referring to. I don't know if my producer/professor ""forgot"" to talk to them about it or what, but I am getting worried as there are still bills of mine to be paid.

The experience has been amazing so far, and getting the Assistant Producer credit is huge for me, so should I not rock the boat asking about payment? Or should I bring it up again to my Producer/professor?

If so, how would I word it delicately, so they don't think I am pressing or ungrateful for the opportunity?

Thanks so much, hope to hear back soon."

Even if you're gainfully employed and not thinking of jumping ship, you might still want to consider dressing for success, keeping your resume up-to-date, or even asking for a raise.

#1. If you're a student who is free this summer and haven't done so already: get yourself an internship!

Taking an internship or co-op in your undergrad is by far [one of the most important career boosters out there](http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/04/15/when-a-degree-isnt-enough), and can still benefit you even if it's unpaid. It allows you to network, get real world experience, get professional feedback, and [other important things](http://www.laneterralever.com/the-benefits-of-internships-before-college-graduation/).

So if you haven't done so, consider padding your resume with intern experience, especially if you're free this summer. Speaking of resumes...

#2. Keep your resume up-to-date and constantly get feedback

Even if you're not jumping ship, optimizing your resume and keeping it up to date is still important. Here are some good resources for resume building:

* [from Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/emcs/oce/alumni/resume-writing)
* [from resume-help.org](http://www.resume-help.org/resume_writing_tips.htm)
* [from the /r/resumes FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq)

If you have a professional profile (like LinkedIn, professional societies, or trade societies), make sure you update that too!

And final thing: Don't forget to polish up your interview skills if you're going to go job hunting.

#3. Remember to dress for success

In the workplace, you should keep your hair neat (facial hair included!), your clothes should have the proper fit, and your outfit should be clean. Appearances and first impressions matter, and one source states ""41 percent of employers said that people who dress better or more professionally tend to be promoted."" ([Source](http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/07/30/cb.dress.for.success/index.html?eref=rss_latest)) 

If you are out interviewing, make sure your suit or outfit is appropriate. There is also /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice to help you on your way.

#4. Consider the best time to ask for a raise or promotion

Remember to **do your research** on this one before acting on it. A lot of raises are dependent on company policy, timing, negotiation skills, negotiation tactics, and several other things.

3987e2,2,2015-06-09,"Me [21 M] revealing my secrets and talking about moving forward with my Ex[20 F] who keeps trying to reconnect, without acting on it.",Brightsided,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3987e2/me_21_m_revealing_my_secrets_and_talking_about/,"Hey r/relationship, I've found myself(21 M) in a precarious position with my most recent Ex(20 F) and I'm really hoping for some sage advice, wise words, or perspectives to figure it all out.

The relationship started in the end of Winter last year (2013) while we were both University students and to say the least I was in a bad place when she came upon me. I was smoking weed every day, playing league of legends every day, only taking one class because I was to lazy to schedule my classes on time because frankly I had stopped giving much of a shit about college. Somehow this chick liked me though and we hit it off almost immediately, we went the whole 9 yards and became seriously dating almost instantly. Let's call her Kat from here on. 

So as I said my own life was in a precarious position, and I handled what went from there even more poorly. I was accused of plagiarism in the single class which scared my shitless and I was so deep in my hole I did not sign up for classes the following quarter. This was a shameful but worse I went along and decided through inaction to not tell a single soul that I was in such trouble including Kat.

Somehow this went on for more then a whole year of my casually pretending I was still taking classes, lying to anyone who asked, and generally doing fuck all to fix my problems, which understandably led to some depression and a lot of anxiety and stress and overall left me feeling how I can only imagine a Bi-polar person would, intense highs and normal times and then the opposite where i felt so ashamed of myself i considered suicide. Yet through all this me and Kat had quite a wonderful relationship going, we stayed together most nights, enjoyed going out and doing activities together. What we had had grown into a beautiful thing I still regard as love on a level I had yet to experience, I would have done anything to her, and without her I thought I might simply die.

This lasted until around the beginning of winter quarter, when maybe I got worse, but Kat also had her fair share of stresses, between family issues and working , and school she had very little time for me, she would stay over a few nights a week, but the novelty was lost and things became more strained, even when she was around it was as if she wasn't all the way there, with her head stuck in her stresses.(this is probably how I often seemed to her.) 

Then the weekend spring break started right before she was supposed to go with a family vacation with me to Mexico she broke things off. She didn't have many definitive reasons but said she was dealing with too much. Many tears were shed, I tried to convince her otherwise for a short time, but we both knew it was over.

Now here I am, two months later with sporadic contact in between(text and fb only), since the break up both of us expressing that we still feel deeply for one another and her even expressing many regrets saying she may have made a mistake.

Moving on for me has been tough and it has caused me a lot of pain, but I honestly have made it into a good thing in some ways. I came clean about my deceit to my family, and some friends(ones I care about) I have re-enrolled into my university(I somehow was not kicked out) and am working full time with an internship for the summer. I've kicked some of my more dangerous habits and I'm doing my best to commit to my self-improvement. 

This is where things get hairy because I originally was going to see her and talk to her because I wanted to come clean with her as well. Needless to say that not being honest about being in school is a huge deal, and she deserves to know, especially if we were ever going to be together again, which may be a naive thought but is something I've truly wanted. Yet somehow through our texting I found out that despite her saying how much she still cares for me and wishes she could rewind the clock, saying she thinks I might have been the best thing for her ever, she has been seeing another dude ""casually"" for who knows how long. When she first told me I was quite sad, and it still pisses me off, and after I decided not to see her to explain, feeling pretty bad about I and myself. 

Now a week later she texts me to essentially tell me the same thing, this time even more definitive, expressing her feeling for me, and again O ask her if she is still seeing this dude, and it come out yes. I just don't get why she thinks she can try to bring me back emotionally while sleeping with another man. 

So we are talking tonight over the phone, and I plan to tell her how I lied to her during our relationship, and to get some finality out of it all because my heart has been hurting for to long.

This hasn't been the best retelling and I plan to clean it up when I return home. But I'm hoping I can find some words of wisdom from r/relationship folks over how I should proceed and that to think of this allm I have plenty of my own ideas but I haven't gotten to talk to anyone about this in depth at all really.



   
**tl;dr**: I had a 1 1/2 year long relationship with a girl who though I wad in college while I was not. She broke up with me but talks as though she wants to try to get back together but is simultaneously sleeping with another guy."

PROS:  

* $103K base salary. Made $135K last year with bonuses/overtime

* Short commute

* Help people get better when they are at their worst

* Close relationships with colleagues. 

* Very flexible schedule. 12-hour shifts allow for 3-4 shifts/week, maximum. Vacations without using any vacation time. 

* Nights I'm off I can chillax at home and play games, etc.
 
* I'm damn good at what I do. 

* Job security.

* Hourly. Any time I'm in the building I'm on the clock. 

* Hopefully buying a house soon and changing jobs would gum up the loan process. 


CONS:

* Labor-intensive: patients are getting larger and larger. Back hurts from time to time. Tore an ACL once. 

* Depressing: most patients do not do well or we are keeping alive needlessly. 

* Toxic/backwards corporate culture at current hospital where nurses are powerless and bureaucracy is infinite. 
 
* Intellectually unfulfilling: 50% of my shifts are making sure the appropriate checkboxes are checked for the rare audit or court case. Literally no other persons will look at said checkboxes. Knowing at times what patients really need and not being able to facilitate it for any number of reasons not limited to but including interns, family drama, stupid policies, etc. 

* Ever since I've been on nights, I've had odd medical issues ranging from near-constant eczema, what seemed to be IBS for several months, insomnia, fatigue when I'm off of work, weird sleep-induced achilles tendonitis. These issues may be completely incidental to being on nights the last few years, but their correlation should be noted. 

* I can't see myself doing this for 30 more years until I'm retirement age. 

* High-deductible health insurance with HSA.   

* I work a fair amount of holidays and every other weekend, so I miss out on many extended family gatherings, local festivals, etc. 

* No real upward mobility without seeking advanced nursing degrees which are about 90% fluff and depress me to think about. 



**PROSPECTIVE JOB: NURSE EDUCATOR/SPECIALIST FOR LARGE BIOMED PRODUCT COMPANY**  
PROS: 

* 50-75% travel: Explore different areas, rack up frequent flyer/hotel points. Eat at awesome restaurants on company dime. 

* Company car: If I sell my current car, I would save approximately $600/mo in gas and carrying a car note. New car every 3 years. No worries ever for maintenance. 

* I already know the product well. I'm a tech geek and this appeals to me greatly. I'd be good in this role (at least as described). I'd be educating ICU nurses, so right up my alley. 

* No office 9-5. I'd either be remote out of home or on-location with a client. 

* I would return to a diurnal lifestyle and hopefully above-mentioned health problems would improve. 

* Essentially labor-free. 

* (Most) weekends and holidays off. Rarely might need to fly/drive out on a Sunday afternoon or something. 

* Slightly better health insurance. Stock. 

* Other fringe benefits: cell phones, laptops, etc. 

* I can see myself doing this for many years if it works out. 

* Upward mobility though it's in a corporate environment. More results based than requiring pointless additional degrees. 


CONS: 

* Initial offer expected to be 85-90K. Up to 10% annual bonus. Unclear of what cap is. It is salaried, so any overtime worked is unpaid. 

* Travel: I have three children. If I have to be gone for long stretches, it ~~may~~ will put undue burden on my wife. After a year of training, the travel requirements will hopefully be more local and car-based, so hopefully this is minimized. I also have to account for the fact I'm essentially gone for 12-16 nights a month at my curreny job merely by working them. 

* Huge multinational conglomerate. Stock prices are stagnating. Concern for long-term job security (although I guess I could always go back to being a bedside nurse in the interim).

* I've never been a corporate pawn and I have no idea how to fit into the norms of such a lifestyle. I've worn pajamas (scrubs) to work all my adult life. 

* Isolating -- any colleagues to speak of would be via conference call from another state. I'm probably okay with this, though. 

* Loss of flexibility with schedule. Vacations may depend more on when I can work it into calendar with product rollouts than when we would like to go. 

* I want to buy a house soon and changing jobs would complicate the loan qualification. 



**MY THOUGHTS**  
If salaries were equal, I'd chose the latter in a heartbeat. It has the potential to be more fulfilling to me as a person. The travel would be fun, at least at first, and if I were to move up the corporate ladder, its requirements would decrease somewhat. However, the thought of going from potentially $135K to 85K as the sole earner scares me. That's a *huge* potential decrease. That said, overtime at the hospital isn't as available this year as it was last year, and therefore I should base my salary expectations on what I am guaranteed- namely, 103K. In that context, I have to consider whether the fringe benefits and possible bonus on a salary of 85K would basically even out the differences. 85K with $600/mo savings in auto and a 10% bonus would be an additional 13.5K, so that's already 98.5K. I wonder, with taxes coming into play, if it's a wash.   
  
  


TL;DR: I have to choose between soul-crushing and back-aching for 135K or potentially fulfilling for 85K+fringe.

I graduated in December 2014 with a B.S. in applied math and statistics and a second major in political science. I was planning on seeking out a data analysis job or research position at a non-profit in NYC. I was recently diagnosed with MS and my mobility and fatigue levels are too unpredictable to commute the 2 hours (each way) to NYC every day. I've decided to find a job closer to home, but there are very few data analysis/quantitative researcher positions in my area. That aside, I don't really enjoy statistics or data analysis and I'm not very passionate about it.

I've wanted to learn more about web development for a while, but I've been focusing on my data visualization internship, which just ended a week ago. I've always enjoyed programming and discrete math way more than statistics and data analysis. I took the core Computer Science I/II classes in college (taught in Java, focused on programming fundamentals, OOP and data structures) and discrete math for CS. It doesn't count for much, but I was always among the first to finish programming labs in our lab classes - it clicked with me and I think I am good at it. I also took applied math classes like graph theory and computational geometry, which required writing an encryption decoder and a program to run a Graham scan (I did them both in Java). I am comfortable with the logic behind computer science and the concepts that cross over into programming.

I am not really interested in software engineering and pursuing Java, but I am very interested in web development. I'm not sure which aspect yet, but I think I would tend towards front-end/web app stuff. I know there are tons of jobs, some of which can be done by telecommuting and freelancing, which is very important to me based on the unpredictability of this disease. 

I know from searching reddit and elsewhere that the general path is HTML -&gt; CSS -&gt; PHP or JavaScript.

My question in general is: is this a viable career path for me to pursue, as someone with limited programming experience in Java? Is there any other path I should look into (like maybe Android development)? What do I need to learn to be as employable as possible? I know I need to start with HTML and CSS, but what comes after that?

The first thing I would like to do is to make a personal website for my portfolio of data visualizations and stuff made with ArcGIS. I already have the host and domain name, but I have not started learning HTML/CSS to build the bare bones of this website.

I have nothing but free time to learn, but I want to be absolutely sure that I am learning the right things in order to turn this into a career. I have no qualms about teaching myself and I'm ready to throw myself into this 100%, as long as I know it is viable. Any book, blog or video suggestions that could let me know what I'm getting myself into would be great!

Any advice would be appreciated so much. Thank you in advance!"

I have only worked retail as of now and want to get out. I went browsing on Craigslist and found a really great IT internship and applied for the hell of it. Well I got contacted for an interview a few days later! I had the interview today and here are the details:

* interviewed with HR, then IT manager, then IT assistant. All of them were really interested in my life and my hobbies and all of them seemed to like me especially the manager. 

* the manager asked me why I wanted to be in IT and I told him that I love helping people. He was really surprised and happy with my answer as its a rare one. 

* he seemed to not know how to select a candidate for the internship stating that an interview doesn't show him how the person actually works. 

* they all have me their cards and said to email them if I had any questions (what questions could I have?) and I sent a thank you to each of them. 

* before I left they all went into another room and the HR person came back and said ""I forgot to ask are you ok working __ hours?"" To which can I said yes. Then told me as I was leaving I'd hear back soon and then they responded to my thank you saying they are all meeting tomorrow and I will be updated. 

* the manager had said they had other applicants to interview but now I'm being notified tomorrow already? Something happened though after that was said. The manager noticed on my resume I had a basic IT cert. and I wrote in going for a masters and seemed super impressed to which his answer changed to ""we will be making a decision soon""

I can't think of anything I could have done better or anything I messed up on. This place is a great environment with a solid business model and people I clicked with instantly unlike my current job. I'm just so nervous and excited because it seems like a sure thing but I've been stood up on jobs before. What does his sound like to you? I'm concerned with the fact they will be notifying me so soon even though they said they have other people to interview 

EDIT: I'm also worried because they never asked me how long I could intern there and I forgot to ask "

I was smart enough to make it to a relatively good university and get relatively good grades, but never to make it to the top tier: the 1.1s and the good internships. I'm okay at most sports, not terrible at any but nor am I particularly outstanding at any. I am quite active: I play sports and I go to the gym 4+ times a week, yet I spend days at a time eating junk food and watching Netflix in an apathetic haze. I'm not good looking enough to be awarded a seond glance, and I have accepted it as an established fact that I will never be someone's crush just from looks alone, or approached in a nightclub by a girl, although (in my honest opinion) I'm not ugly enough to suffer for it (as unfortunately often happens in society). I mostly don't click with people, sharing the awkward strained jokes and the even more awkward pauses, yet click with about 1/20, so I guess enough that people know my name and some of who I am. I have a few friends, but I'll never be considered popular. I'm a nice guy, but with a crude streak which I find difficult to suppress. I have limited job opportunites once I graduate from university, and I have little interests which could translate into a good job. I have many interests yet I am oftentimes a boring person. I have never, and probably will not any time soon, been in a relationship (except for one short car crash which suggests maybe I should avoid them in future), and instead what passes for a relationship to me is daydreaming about girls who I cannot seem to take down from a pedestal. I don't feel motivated by anything, as it seems that for anything I am even quite good at, there will always be a close friend or family better at it. I love to read, and it would be nice to become a writer, but I am not creative. I have had a relatively privileged childhood, and have not been left wanting for material things, and so I am guilty whenever I feel like I am depressed. I have no confidence. I feel like if I were to die tomorrow, the only people who would be sad would be those ""obligated"" to, i.e. family and people I went to school with. I feel like a nonentity, and what frightens me is that I feel like it is all I will ever be. And that one day I may be okay with that all being all I will ever be. I doubt many will read this, but that's okay. It was important to me that I wrote this for myself. "

actives, if you have any other misc advice you want me to add leave a comment and i'll put it on the list. feedback is welcome too.
It doesn't matter whether you are ex military, socially awkward, 46, poor, or anything other than a rich non-white 18 year old. You should rush.
What do you expect from a fraternity?
I can think of two main reasons to join a fraternity.
You want to make friends, party, brotherhood, connections etc...
Your only goal is to make connections to help you get a job after college.
If your main reason is number 2, you should look into joining a professional fraternity. Beta Alpha Psi is the national accounting fraternity and are highly recruited at my university.
If your main reason is number 1, you should join a social fraternity. lambda chi, pike, fiji, sigma chi, etc...
Rushing a Social Fraternity
Answer these questions:
What interests do I have?
Do I prefer smaller or larger groups?
1- Try to find a fraternity where the members have similar interests to you. Are you a country boy? Find the fraternity that best fits that characteristic. Like video games? There's going to be a fraternity for you. If you're a gym rat, sports star, or an alcoholic, there will be a fraternity for you. You just have to do your homework and find the right one.
2- The size of the fraternity can be a big factor. If you don't do well in situations with a huge amount of people, you should look into the smaller fraternities.
Misc. Advice
You have to be willing to make compromises. There will be a lot of events that you will hate to attend but will anyway. You don't have to compromise your morals. Any fraternity worth a crap will be willing to work with personal beliefs/personal aspects of your life that might be affected during the pledging process.
It is what you make of it. You get out of it what you put in. If you're a dead beat pledge who never puts an effort into anything, expect to have a terrible time. If you go to all your events with a good attitude, pledgeship will be exponentially better.
Don't be a fuck up. I can't explain this one and you will do this at some point. Just try to minimize the damage.
How fraternity life has affected me
My junior year I received an internship for an accounting firm in my hometown. While I was there I worked with a supervisor who was in charge of new hires. During conversation she told me she saw on my resume that I was in a fraternity and immediately put my resume in the call back pile because she was in a sorority herself. I received a full time offer after the internship and will be moving up North after I finish my degree. It didn't matter what fraternity I was in, just the fact that I was in one put me at an advantage in this particular circumstance."

For the past two years my husband and I have been gaining agricultural experience to run our own farm business.  We're now at the point where we need to make a move out of the city into the area where we'd like to start farming.  At first we'll rent in the area and search for suitable farms over the next couple of months.

I work from home and my husband is f-unemployed but looking in both areas.

We want to grow apples to make our own hard cider.  Just pretend this isn't a completely insane idea for the moment.  Apples grow really well all over Ontario near the lakes, but the main apples growing areas are up near the Bruce Peninsula and around Prince Edward County.

My husband did his farm internship near Owen Sound last year and we both really love the area, but I know that Prince Edward County has a lot of benefits to it too.  They are both really beautiful parts of the world, property prices are pretty comparable (PEC is slightly cheaper) and are both close enough to cottage country regions that we could attract potential customers to our business, while being close enough to city centre to sell.

It seems like it's going to come down to the place we find to rent, but I'd love to hear any other thoughts and opinions.  If anyone's had experience living in both places, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

I had an internship for a year under a reputable manufacturing company doing digital marketing/product content on the website and expected to get hired, but ended up not learning much and ultimately didn't get an offer, which is okay because the position would drive me insane. I graduated from a reputable school w/ a 3.0 and I literally lead all my marketing groups and I had fun doing it. I got along with everyone and felt comfortable in groups working on assigned projects. In terms of job opportunities, I get calls from recruiters for unreliable companies (consulting, recruiting, cold-calling). About 1/5 times I get a call from a good company for a phone interview, and end up butchering, stuttering, and forgetting how to convince HR. But, I’m just having massive anxiety because I feel I can’t find the right job and my true potential. I don’t want to do sales and calling, I want to be working with teams. But, at the workplace, I felt I had little confidence and felt the fear of opening up. Kinda weird considering I loved working at school groups. I want to learn but I just feel afraid when I speak out in a place full of older people that know what they’re doing. At my internship I was exposed to all sorts of concepts, marketing and non-marketing related, but communication needs to be worked on, I just cant get myself to do it. Digital Marketing and working with CPG brands is something I love and feel I can be good at it, however I feel I wouldn’t know what to do when I first step in the door of a job, making my anxiety skyrocket."

A few questions about my chances of working in the US, here is a short summary of my current situation:

- I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business
- I'm going to have a Master's Degree from one of Europe's best universities in Accounting and Finance in August 
- My work experience is mainly internships in Banking (including Investment Banking)
- I spent the last five months in the US on a study abroad exchange semester in a MBA program

I'd love to go back to the US to work there, but I also found a girlfriend during my stay there. I know about the H-1B options, but since it's June, is it true that the earliest starting date for work would be October 2016? Are there any other options I don't see? Would doing an internship for half a year in the US (and applying for H-1B in the meantime) be an option?

I'd really appreciate any help you guys can offer

3993zl,1,2015-06-09,"Supposed to start at Big4, they changed my start date, now thinking about switching or other options. Need advice!",DrunkenBlowfish,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3993zl/supposed_to_start_at_big4_they_changed_my_start/,"Sorry in advance for the length of this post. I'm anxious and just want to lay out the whole situation so I can get the best advice possible...

So I did my internship at one of the Big4 last summer in Audit. Decided tax would be a better fit, and got the offer. I was supposed to be starting this October, after graduating this spring. 

After again confirming my October start date in the beginning of the year, I later was told that I would have to start in July instead. I really freaked out because I was planning to take my CPAs over the summer and have them finished by the time I started. I will have FAR done (and hopefully passed) by the time I start, but would need to take my other 3 while working full-time. 

As I'm seeing how much time studying for the CPAs is taking, I'm really starting to worry even more. I'm studying full time right now and already feeling stressed. I don't realistically think it will be possible for me to pass the other 3 exams while working 50-60 hour weeks (several people in the tax department at my firm said these are their usual hours/week). I'm a bit of a slow studier and although I have been/am smart, it can take me a bit longer than other people. I'm not sure I could handle this for a full year or so that it would likely take me to pass the other 3. I have depression and anxiety and I really fear it might put me back in a bad place to have Big4 stress on top of the stress and time pressure of the CPAs.

I'm trying to figure out what to do at this point. I see my options as:

* Start at the Big4 firm, see how it goes with trying to take the 3 remaining CPAs. If it's not working, quit and try to find work at another regional/national firm, possible taking some time off to complete the exams. (I fear that I may not be able to find a job elsewhere after only say, 6 months or so at the Big4. How common is it for other firms to hire people not directly from campus recruiting at the staff level? I never see staff job postings on their sites and am worried I would have to resort to industry. Any experience with this?)

* Just tell them I'm quitting now, and apply at the regional/national firms that would have me starting later in the fall instead. That would give me time to get some of the exams out of the way. (Most firms have already hired for their new staff so I don't know how feasible this is. I did apply at a Top 10 firm today for either Fall or Winter start, but that will probably go nowhere).

* Ask them to defer my offer and go for my Masters so I could get gain some time. (Doesn't seem like a great option because of the loans, and it might look bad)

* Ask them if they're willing to let me start later (unlikely, but most of the other people starting with me have finished their CPAs as they graduated earlier, so perhaps they wouldn't need me to start as soon?)

* Anything else anybody here can suggest!?!

Thanks to anyone who can offer some helpful suggestions or relate their experience. I feel so lost and confused about what to do here.

Finals gotten in the way, but since it is almost summer, more tales for your enjoyment. On to the (recent) story!


About 2 weeks ago, Systems came in to upgrade some local servers (because they are improving all the firewalls and Anti-Virus because there has been some security breaches. (aka some code kitty's decided that a .ini file is cool) in addition to some needed firewall improvements, they also installed local, internal file servers. One for everyone, then a teacher, also a “Classified” staff server. Now, as crazy it seems, they are using OpenMediaVault.





WTF.





Consequentially, I already know the basics of OMV. (If you are wondering, it is ultimately the same as OpenNAS) Everything was running smoothly for a week, until...


Sysadmin ($Sys)

&gt;$Sys: GEEK! SHUT THE FUSKING SERVERS DOWN NOW!

&gt;$Me: Calm down bro. Which servers are you talking about so that I down cause the IT civil war.

&gt;$Sys: ALL OF THEM! KILL THE PSU! YOUR LOCATION IS IN ALPHA RED.


Now, alpha red means is not taken care of in 5 minutes, All the locations go down. Automatically. Now I know that this is a bad situation.


&gt;$Me: Seriously, calm down. What is it? Is it the Firewall, VVPS (Another tale), or the Fileserver?

&gt;$Sys:*Breaths* Someone dumped an unknown file that is gaining the SDR (Student Data Repsoitory) clearance. Unplug the server it has it's own UPS. You can't miss it, it's the spanking brand new one.


Internally hoping that the “secret” door is unlocked...


&gt;$Me: so I am here. I see the new equipment. There is also a terminal. OMV. Do you just want me do to a system halt?

&gt;$Sys: Wait, you know what OMV is? AND WHAT A SYSTEM HALT IS???


Facewall


&gt;$Sys: Okay then, send a halt to the server. Once done, kill the switches. After that, pull the Data Arrays out and have them in the front office with you.


Initiate me trying to type on a crusty, dust lined HP keyboard. Joyfully Pulling all the Fiber connections I can find, and flip the “ARRAY SWAP” switch. That was satisfying.


20 minutes later, $Sys, $Sys' intern, and the SUPERINTENDENT. (And pizza)




WTF^2




&gt;$Sys: You, just saved the entire network. All 50 locations. You've got the drives, right?

&gt;$Me: Of course

&gt;$Sys Int.: That sir, was live saving.


Now, due to privacy issues, I wasn't allowed to help dissect the file system. But, what I did find out that a Senior placed a hidden script into the startup folder, considering the server restarts every night that was an easy deploy, launched a Port scanner that found all the IP's for all the servers on the extended network. It targeted the Student Confidential Data server and started picking off of it and uploading to pastebin. It wasn't able to get any data.


Now, this is the first time I've ever talked to the superintendent, but he seems pretty chill. All four of us ate pizza explaining what happened. At one point, $Sys said,


&gt;$Sys: Geek, you just saved my job.


TLDR: Clara saved the Doctors job, again

I wake up, struggle to motivate myself to get out of bed, wander to my computer, and try to find some way to keep my mind off my life. I left my old job because I felt abused(restaurant life), my new job has been delayed two and a half weeks now, and I was told I'd be trained to be a bartender but I don't believe it. Shit doesn't go my way ever. I used to smoke weed to kind of fill in the spaces between but it was getting expensive with no job, and it felt like abuse to me. 


Financially I'm ok, but I have almost no cushion. I used a third of it to bail my sister out of probation so she didn't go back to jail, and she's paying me back but its slow. Another third has been spent through housing, food, and a couple of set backs I didn't forsee. I haven't seen my family in months, most of my friends are too busy to interact with me so socially I feel so fucking alone. 


My ex broke up with me in February and its been a mess because we both love each other but she can't get over her ex of 6 years because that was 25% of her life. I fucking hate the guy and I've never met him because he has everything I want. His parents are rich and pay for him to take casual trips to Europe between school they pay for, he has my ex because they were together first even though he treated her poorly and no one wants them together, he went to the best school we're they're from and has been handed all the tools you could ask for to succeed. 


Meanwhile, my family situation would require a post just as long as this to describe how fucked up it is. I have to pay for school my self out of my own pocket, and I was denied entry into the university I want, even though I'm in a program that guarantees admission to it, because I took a few classes there before going to the associated state college. So now my only chance at getting the degree I want without starting all over AGAIN is to get a degree at this school in a related subject I hate, then try again to pay double the price of the first degree. 


I have one girl I was interested in for awhile, and she really likes me, but she's my room mates cousin and tried to get me to cheat on my now ex while we were together, so I don't trust her. Not like I could even do it though, I go to sleep and wake up every day thinking about my ex. Wouldn't be fair to anybody. 


My only solace in life is the gym, but that only fills up 2/24 hours in the day. I'm trying to lose weight so I'm eating less, so I don't have the energy for more. One of best friends is moving from 4 hours away to 2.5, so that's good I guess, but he's a third year med student with a gf so that won't change much anyways. 

I'm laying in bed right now with a test tomorrow and I just want to say fuck it and get drunk. But I know I need to avoid abusing drugs and alcohol. I had someone offer me a possible internship but I just can't muster the effort to go out of my way to make it happen. If I wasn't so depressed I could get 2, 3, or even 4 times as much done in a day. Unfortunately, I'm just going to keep ruining myself.

A little background. 
I worked help-desk and with a small team that handled special projects, guest accounts, and deployment of new computers for a uni for about 3 years while I pursued my BS in CS.

I dropped off an actual resume to the IT departments of local cities. I figured if I'm going to go for it may as well go for a job that should have benefits. A long shot because I have no degree or certificates, just some job xp and references out the ying-yang (I believe its not who you know its how you know them).

So today I get a call from the secretary of ""local city #2"" informing me that the IT manger looked at my resume and while there are currently no openings if I would be interested in an internship.

So a few questions: 

1. Anyone one have any experiance with with IT internships?
  
     a. How did it go for you?

     b. Did you get the job?

     c. What did you gain from the internship?
2. Are government jobs as stable as one would assume?

To start this off, before I graduated (with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science) I did two internships with one company and received an offer from them. After a lot of thought I felt like the company was not the place that I wanted to start off my career.

I don't want to regret not accepting an offer from a company that I did not want to work for.

Right now I have been applying to countless of companies. Whatever few companies that I end up receiving interviews from I tend to make it to the last round but unable to receive an offer.

Now 6 months after I graduated I still have no offer. Will this start effecting my job search in anyway?

During these 6 months I have worked on a few projects on my own time (some freelance web development projects). Will this help fill in the gap of not being employed during this time?

Currently I am starting to learn Android development in hopes that increasing my skill set on my resume will help in landing a job.

Is there any advice on what I should do from now and on in my situation? I have been applying through website job postings, is there anywhere else that I can look into finding a job? 

I am unbelievably stressed from all of the pressure that is on me to get a job. Whether it is family (saying that I should have accepted the offer from the company I interned at) , the fact that soon I will have to start paying off my student loans, or simply the fact that this gap of no job can even make it more difficult to find a job.

Any help is much appreciated!

**Questions:**

1. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare myself this summer? The fall recruiting season is just so soon. 

2. What sorts of job titles should I be applying for? I applied for general Big4 internships this year--I got an internship offer at one doing implementation (not what I want to do)

We are Anglicans. For those who are unaware of our history, Henry VIII is more or less irrelevant, so stop bringing him up. 

*(The following text is reproduced without permission from the Church of England [Website](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-faith/being-an-anglican/anglican.aspx).)*

**History**

Anglicans trace their Christian roots back to the early Church, and their specifically Anglican identity to the post-Reformation expansion of the Church of England and other Episcopal or Anglican Churches. Historically, there were two main stages in the development and spread of the Communion. Beginning with the seventeenth century, Anglicanism was established alongside colonisation in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. The second stage began in the eighteenth century when missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

**Organisation**

As a worldwide family of churches, the Anglican Communion has more than 70 million adherents in 38 Provinces spreading across 161 countries. Located on every continent, Anglicans speak many languages and come from different races and cultures. Although the churches are autonomous, they are also uniquely unified through their history, their theology, their worship and their relationship to the ancient See of Canterbury.

**Theology**

Anglicans uphold the Catholic and Apostolic faith. Following the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Churches are committed to the proclamation of the good news of the Gospel to the whole creation. In practice this is based on the revelation contained in Holy Scripture and the Catholic creeds, and is interpreted in light of Christian tradition, scholarship, reason and experience.

By baptism in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, a person is made one with Christ and received into the fellowship of the Church. This sacrament of initiation is open to children as well as to adults.

Central to worship for Anglicans is the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, also called the Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the Mass. In this offering of prayer and praise, the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are recalled through the proclamation of the word and the celebration of the sacrament. Other important rites, commonly called sacraments, include confirmation, holy orders, reconciliation, marriage and anointing of the sick.

Worship is at the very heart of Anglicanism. Its styles vary from simple to elaborate, or even a combination. Until the late twentieth century the great uniting text was *The Book of Common Prayer,* in its various revisions throughout the Communion, and the modern language liturgies, such as Common Worship, which now exist alongside it still bear a family likeness. Both *The Book of Common Prayer,* and more recent Anglican liturgies give expression to the comprehensiveness found within the Church whose principles reflect that of the via media in relation to its own and other Christian Churches.

**Today's Panalists**

/u/adamthrash I'm a member of the Episcopal Church in the United States. I've been more or less Anglican in my theology for about three years, but I've only gotten the chance to begin attending Episcopalian services in the last year and a half. I'm formerly from the Baptist tradition (SBC) where I was a youth minister, and as such, I love trying to mix a bit of evangelical flair with my Anglo-Catholic leanings.

/u/VexedCoffee I am an Anglo-Catholic in the Episcopal Church. I grew up nominally Baptist, converted to Roman Catholicism in high school, and then to the Episcopal Church at the beginning of college. I've been Anglican now for 8 years and have begun the official discernment process for ordained ministry. I have a BA in Philosophy and currently work in edtech. I am also one of the mods of /r/Anglicanism and am on my church's vestry (essentially a board of directors).

/u/TheWord5mith I am 24 years old, having been an Episcopalian for the past 8 years. I identify as an ""Anglo-Catholic"", though I have a respect and familiarity with the ""Evangelical"" and ""Progressive"" branches of TEC as well. I currently serve as an assistant youth minister and assistant parish administrator (basically a glorified intern).
I had a sporadic religious upbringing as a youth, spending much of my time in the faith tradition of my father: ELCA Lutheran. In middle-school I left Christianity after a few bad experiences and a few poorly answered questions. I eventually “reconverted” back to Christianity by way of my mother’s tradition: Anglicanism (more specifically, The Episcopal Church). I was a regular and committed layperson for the remainder of high school and, to a lesser extent, college. Towards the latter half of college though, I started attending a new Episcopal parish that really catalyzed my “active” faith and eventually lead to me to having a “crisis of faith” about my secular vocation, which was National Security. After my graduation and some uncomfortable soul searching I decided to join the Texas Episcopal Service Corps to explore the one thing that I knew I was still passionate for: ministry. My year with the TESC will be coming to a close this July and I hope to continue working in ministry somewhere in Texas.

/u/Shivermetim  I'm an Australian. 23 years young. Registered nurse by trade, so I bring a lay perspective to this AMA. I've been an Anglican since my early childhood and so I've been in and around a bunch of different churches. There was a period where my dad was preparing for ordination, so we traveled around a bit. I was confirmed by the then Bishop of Gippsland, Jeffrey Driver, and I've had a strong Anglican identity ever since. These days I fit more in the liberal and Anglo-catholic camps rather than the evangelical camp where I was brought up.

/u/ThaneToblerone I am an American currently working on a BA in Religious Studies at a well ranked, public university. My childhood was spent in the Southern Baptist tradition, being raised by a SBC pastor, up until I became an atheist in high school. I was non-religious (and even anti-religious at times) for about four years, but ended up taking a couple of classes in Christianity because I figured they'd be easy. After accidentally falling in love with religious studies, and changing majors I began attending a synagogue both due to an interest in Judaic Studies, and in probing my own spirituality. I was introduced to the Episcopal church some time later and felt I had found my home. Through the guidance of my priests, rabbi, and others I returned to a life of faith.
I was confirmed into the Episcopal church by Rt. Rev. Michael Curry not long ago, but also identify as an Affirming Catholic. The Affirming Catholic Church is a liberal strain within Anglo-Catholicism which supports the ordination of any qualified, called individual regardless of gender or sexuality. Excluding these issues, I maintain a relatively traditional faith in affirming the creeds, transubstantiation, the intercession of the saints, the seven sacraments, etc.

/u/UncommonPrayer I'm a member of the Episcopal Church, currently 32 years old and a member for around 5-6 years. I grew up in a theologically conservative evangelical church, and I found myself searching for something that was both historically defensible (i.e. kept some of the earliest ideas of the church like the importance of apostolic succession, the Real Presence in the Eucharist, etc.) but which was still capable of evaluating its doctrines through consensus and discussion.
This led me to the Episcopal Church and more broadly speaking, the Anglican tradition, especially both the ""Latitudinarian"" divines and the Oxford Movement. I identify as being Anglo-Catholic, with progressive social attitudes and support for the rights of GSM within the church. I appreciate the Anglican tradition of theological inclusiveness, willingness to be in dialogue even when we disagree, and (of course) our choral tradition. I've lived in several dioceses that have had a wide variety of churchmanships from our more protestant, evangelical tradition to more those that trended to more ""catholic"" worship. I'm most at home at a place that has a relatively choral mass and brings out the incense for high feast days or special seasons in the church year.

/u/JosiahHenderson I grew up, was baptised and was confirmed in a charismatic/evangelical Anglican congregation, itself belonging to the rather more liberal Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) Diocese of Montreal. In 2007-2008, most of my congregation (myself included) left the ACC and constituted an ANiC (Anglican Network in Canada) congregation. ANiC is now a diocese within ACNA (the Anglican Church in North America), an ecclesial province ""in formation"" created for North American Anglicans who felt unable to worship and minister under the authority of theologically liberal bishops. ACNA was created with the help and under the authority of several South American and African Anglican bishops and their provinces, and aligns itself with the declarations of the Global Anglican Future Conferences (GAFCON I &amp; II) of Anglican bishops from the ""Global South"".

Last month, I graduated with a Bachelor of Theology from a secular university (where I studied under several liberal/Anglo-Catholic profs and alongside a number of ACC ordinands). I am now at the very beginning of a discernment process towards ordained pastoral ministry within ANiC. I currently work at a day shelter for homeless people, run by my ANiC congregation (out of the building of the ACC church to which we formerly belonged). I have previously worked in children's ministry in parishes across the ACC."

I'm doing an internship at frankfurt for the summer and I've been looking for an apartment to live in since May. Unfortunately with no luck. 

I've mainly checked WG-Gesucht, but also Airbnb and immobielenscout24.

Budget for the housing is max 550€/month and it should have a bed. No allergies, special needs, just a place to rest my head and sit in front of the computer while not working ;).

I don't speak German that well, and my colleagues believe that's one ofthe reasons there aren't that many people answering back to my applications. We have also called to some of the apartments with my boss and no luck.

So if someone you know is looking for a roomate between **june 14th and sept. 4th** please msg me for contact info. I'm already in Frankfurt so I'm available to see the apartment whenever.

Thanks!

For reference, the database is used internally buy a small team. It holds data for the inventory of over 1200 active servers we have. The team would like to be able to modify the file when servers are removed added and it is a pain trying to keep the file organized through a file share.

Most seem to be small firms who aren't even hiring full time employees. I've emailed a number of them, but haven't heard back from anyone.

im a Computer Science Student from germany currently working as an Intern for a Consulting Company near Zürich. So far i love it and Zürich is one of the most beautiful Cities i have ever been. Unfortunatley i do not have a drivers license, so i did not get around much yet.

However, this weekend a friend of mine is visiting with a car. So we figured, lets try and get to see as much as possible this weekend. 

First ideas have been to maybe go to Genf or Basel Saturday, and go towards Luzzern on Sunday to take in the countryside and lakes and stuff. Do you have any other recommendations? We cant really afford a hotel, so day trips starting from Zürich are preferable. "

I'm 23 with no formal education beyond A-level and I've managed to find myself working as a BI consultant through a bit of luck and putting in hard work after making a good impression during an internship on a consultancy firms support desk.

ETL work has been my mainstay in my day to day consultancy, as well as building models to spec and adapting our existing clients models as business needs change.

I've been working in the field for about 8 Months (not inculding my time as an intern and support desk tech) now and would appreciate any input on the best things to learn and focus on to develop this into a solid career direction.

I currently have experience with cube based solutions but I've seen a few post around claiming that it's 'a dying methodology', what leads people to say this?

It also seems that the big thing at the moment is Tableau (at least it gets the most reference on this subreddit) is it something I should be trying to transition to over time?

If it helps at all my current companies focus is the use of data for budgeting forecasting and statutory consolidation in the financial sector.

Many thanks.

39axd0,3,2015-06-10,I[19F]'m moving in with my boyfriend [26M] for 3 months. Worried about how it will affect our relationship.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39axd0/i19fm_moving_in_with_my_boyfriend_26m_for_3/,"So, a bit of background on us. We first met 2 years ago, but we didn't live in the same city. We sent messages that became increasingly flirty. It turned out he was moving to my city (coincidence, the plans were made before I met him), so we dated for a couple of weeks before he told me that he wanted to be single. That hurt a lot, but I got over it, went no communication etc. Then it transpired that I got an internship in the city that he would be moving to (lots of moving around I know), so I had gotten over my upset by then and wrote him a friendly message. He was the only person I knew in that city, so I figured having a friend would be a good thing. 

We met up twice in my hometown before he left and ended up having sex again, but we were very clear that it was purely casual. Then he left, and I followed a couple of months later. We met up, and I told him that I didn't think our relationship should be sexual anymore, because I needed to keep him as a friend. Low and behold, we had sex that night - oops! 

I saw him a few times over the next few weeks, and he told me more about how he was still in love with this girl that he had had a brief fling with 18 months before. I was doing my best not to fall in love with him again. 

We got closer, especially in the last month of my 3 month internship, but there was still the issue of this other girl (who had been ignoring him for 18 months, and he still hadn't gotten over). I moved back home for 1 month, and we stayed in contact, then I moved back. I admit that a good part of my motivation was him. 

Then it turned out that over that month, this girl had got back in contact with him, but she wasn't who he remembered her being. We soon became exclusive. Then, a month later, he's visiting her hometown for work, and they arrange to meet. He wants to clear the air one last time and hopefully get over her. She bails, which convinces him she is not a nice person, and he finally gets over her. In the month following that we got increasingly close, until we finally got together officially. 

That was 2 weeks before I had to go home for 3 months to take some exams. Brilliant timing. So we have been long distance, but I've done 3 visits back to see him. In a few weeks I will be done here, and moving back to his city.

We finally decided to move in together, because it felt stupid for me to be paying rent on a place when I stayed at his 5 times a week anyway. 

Sorry for the total wall of text, but I think the long history between us is important to get a feeling for our relationship, with the key point being that I am much more emotionally invested, because my feelings started developing much sooner. 

So I'm a bit worried about moving in together for a few reasons:

1) I have never felt very secure in the relationship, because for so long it was 'casual' and he was very clear about not liking me in a relationship-y way; this means that I find it very difficult to tell him if I'm upset with him or anything, even though he is properly with me now. I tend to just not say anything and wait until I get over it. 

2) He gets moods sometimes (I guess most people do), especially if things are hard at work, where he is a bit reserved and not affectionate and it makes me worry, even if I'm sure I'm not the problem. I am a consistently happy person, so I guess I find it hard to understand, or know how to act when he's like this. 

3) He is crazily clean and tidy, and I worry that I'm going to piss him off, despite my best efforts.

4) I'm moving into his apartment, so I'm worried it's going to feel like an invasion of his space, and that it may make him resent me. 

5) He says he will need some alone time, which is perfectly reasonable, but I worry I'm going to end up just hot-footing it out of the apartment every time he is in the least bit cold towards me because I'll think he wants alone time!

6) I want to contribute towards food and rent and all the rest, but I don't have a job lined up out there, or a whole lot of savings, so it may get tricky. He has a very comfortable income and likes to go out to nice places a lot. I'm not sure how to discuss this with him. 

I know it's only for 3 months, but I've never lived with anyone before, and I guess I'm getting a bit skittish. This man is genuinely incredible, to the point where his awesomeness kind of intimidates me! He makes me the best version of me I can be, and I learn so much from him. I just want to do whatever I can to make living together as wonderful as it has the potential to be, and not let it drive a wedge between us. 

So Reddit, sorry for the total wall of text, but it also feels good to tell the whole convoluted story of our relationship, even if it is to internet strangers :) I would really appreciate any advice on how to make this transition easy, and any experiences you want to share about moving in with people.
   
**tl;dr**: Moving in with my boyfriend, we have a slightly complicated relationship history, but it has a lot of potential for the future. How do I make the transition go well and avoid resentment on either of our parts?"
39axt4,11,2015-06-10,Am I being financially abused?,Kel-ahrairah,ACON_Support,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACON_Support/comments/39axt4/am_i_being_financially_abused/,"OK, ACON_Support, here's the sitch.

I've been living at home with my mother since I graduated college two years ago to help pay the bills. I am not sure if she is an N, but she displays N traits for serious and for sure. During that time, I've had three jobs (well, two jobs and an internship). The first one was temporary, and paid well for five months. Then I spent eight months unemployed and looking for work (while getting constantly berated about how I wasn't trying hard enough to find a new job while *she* didn't do much in the way of looking either - you know, that whole song and dance). Then I got my internship, which was part-time and *paid*; that lasted five months per the terms of the internship. I was lucky enough to get hired two months later at the same place that I interned at, and have been working there since January.

I make decent money for living on my own in this area, which has a pretty high cost of living. Note that I say ""living on my own"". Living at home with my income means I get to pay the mortgage and HOA fees. Combined, those wipe out 75% of my income. My mother gets SSI once a month and does a few odd jobs for friends and family for supplemental income aside from (allegedly) looking for work. All of this could be solved if she could get a job in her field, but she's 65 now and not many orgs in her field are going to take her on even as a consultant (allegedly).

I have no qualms about pitching in, and have offered to pay some of the bills if she pitches in with mortgage, but, well...I have my own bank account now (and she took that news quite poorly, and sniped at me about it this morning). Thing is, I have *just* enough to pay the mortgage, and I'll *still* need to draw the meager amount I'd stashed in savings to pay it. Then I will be *dirt broke* until I next get paid on the 22nd - which is a problem since I still have therapy and medical bills and IRS payments and student loans that just came due. I don't want to ask her for the extra money to pay the mortgage, even though she has a few hundred dollars right now, because I don't want her to feel like she can wield that kind of power over me.

(Spoiler alert: she just spent God knows how much money on more bullshit non-FDA-evaluated ""health"" products. Such bills. So responsibility. Many financially smart. Wow.)

I feel bad because I spent money on myself at AwesomeCon the other week, and with that extra money I could take care of this no problem. I feel like I'm not allowed to spend any money on myself at all.

I'm planning on moving out, but I know if she doesn't get a job she won't be able to support herself if I leave. But I just *cannot* live there anymore. I'm nearly 25 and my mother is invading my medical privacy and getting angry when I try and assert financial control of my own life. I haven't told her that I want to move out yet. I'm not sure how or if she would retaliate.

So is this financially abusive, or just Kel's good ol' paranoia kicking in? I tried to google ""financial abuse of adult child"" but all that brought up was articles about elder abuse and how nasty adult children can be to their poor needy parents, which wasn't helpful.

ETA: I'm at work right now (and was when I posted this, oops!) but all of these comments are so, so appreciated. I have a fabulous support network both online and off, who are going to help me move some of my things out when my mom is out of town at the end of the month. (Mom's been bugging me to clear stuff out of my room for a while, so she's gonna look at that like it was all *her* idea. This serves my purposes quite handily.)

I'm going to push the refinancing angle for her so the payments are easier for her to deal with on her own. I'm also going to be asking the family friend who tentatively mentioned a part-time job for her a while back if that job is actually going to happen, giving mom enough money to maintain the place on her own in conjunction with her SSI, or if it's just wishes and unicorn dreams since this friend can be a bit flaky.

Before that my son was the only child mostly since my 8 year old lives with his father most of the year. We were doing time outs and spanking for discipline. When I say spanking, I mean hand smacks on the butt, outside of the pants and that was only when he was doing something really bad like chasing the dog with things.

 This was working great until the baby came and now spanking doesn't fazes him and he flat out refuses to sit in time out. I can't do much in the means of physically picking him up and moving him to time out since he's 30lbs over my weight limit and when I do pick him up my bleeding comes back for a few days. I'm exhausted and alone 5-6 days a week while my fiance is out of town doing an internship until August so it's up to me to discipline him. The problem is when I ask or tell him to do something he tells me no or when he tells me he wants to do something and I don't allow him he'll start screaming and throwing a huge fit and hitting. I ignore it for the most part but it's getting so bad that he's even starting to act out when I go to get him from daycare. His teacher had to carry him to the car kicking and screaming yesterday after he'd been throwing a fit for 20 minutes inside while I was trying to get him out the door when my one free hand. 


Clearly what I'm doing isn't working and I'm at a complete loss for what to change. Would he be old enough to understand the concept of a rewards system? Any ideas would be appreciated since my next plan of action is selling him to the circus for wine. "
39bji9,2,2015-06-10,Considering a conversion Masters in India with a life sci undergrad,chocolatsnow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39bji9/considering_a_conversion_masters_in_india_with_a/,"Sorry for the wall of text! I tried to break it down, but thanks in advance for reading!

I'm a recent grad from the University of Toronto - I got a BSc, but in Life Sci. I don't want to do the whole PhD/postdoc route, and I'd prefer to start working as early as possible, but in life sci career growth is severely limited with just an undergrad degree. So I want to kind of change fields a bit and do a CS masters to diversify my skill set, with the general goal of working in bioinformatics or health care systems afterwards. 

I'm looking at a program in India, and I'm looking for some feedback on it. I understand there are conversion Masters programs in the UK/New Zealand/US but I haven't found any in Canada. Also, cost is an issue - I would really prefer not to take out more student loans - I already have about 30k to repay from my undergrad. I have the equivalent of a dual citizenship in Canada and India, and I have family there so it would be easier logistically. 


**What**

It's a Masters in Computer Applications (MCA) - a 3 year masters degree for people who have undergrad degrees in areas that aren't necessarily computer science. I'm looking at doing it through IGNOU, which would entail distance based education. I'd be living in the Pune area, which is a tech hub from my understanding.

**Why this**

1. It sounds like it has a good foundation - [this](http://i.imgur.com/tcSFceu.jpg) is the program overview. I don't have background in computers, and this starts from the basics.

2. I'll have time for side projects to add to my portfolio, and internships, because I won't need to be in class full time (distance based)
3. It's cost efficient - it'll only be about $2000 total over 3 years, compared to and I won't have to start repaying my student loan debt (30k CAD) for another 3.5 years. 
4. It's a masters degree, so looks like forward progression.

**Concerns**

* How much theory do I really need to work in CS/bioinformatics? At what point does it start to give diminishing returns? Do I really need 3 years of study? 

* How would this kind of degree combination (BSc+MCA) be perceived if I wanted to come back to North America and work here? Visas aren't a huge issue - I'm a Canadian citizen. But, I'd like to know if I would be hurting my chances by having an Indian degree.

----

**tl;dr:** recent Canadian grad considering masters degree in computer applications (MCA) from India. What would Canadian employers think of this? Is it worth a 3 year degree or should I look elsewhere? "

A year ago I started reading this sub after going through a break up with somebody, who in retrospect, was needy, whiny, stressful, and not worth my time. The following is a reflection of the past year, with a few key insights on what somebody can reasonably expect to gain from applying TRPs concepts in their ""freshman"" year.

**HEALTH**

Improving my health and establishing the habits of an alpha has been by far the most difficult transformation to make. I signed up for a gym. For the first few months I honestly fucked around. I'd go for an hour every now and then, but more often than not, I'd justify NOT GOING because *&gt;&gt;queue male hamstering&lt;&lt;* I had a ""hard"" day at work and deserved a ""break."" A break meant rolling a couple fat joints and cozying up with the computer.

After those first few months I got serious about improving my health. I was having pins and needles issues in my extremities and regular nerve pain. This was because I was spending some 15 hours a day in a chair -- whether at work or at home. My mattress was shit because I didn't care about my surroundings. My food was shit because I didn't care about my diet. My lungs were shit because I was always on a ""break."" 

I purchased a standing desk for home, a new mattress that alleviated back pain (go foam!), started taking more walking breaks at work, and for the first time in my life, established a regular gym routine. Because of my poor health, I was rather skinny. I promised to gain 35 lbs over 5 months and then cut 10 lbs over 3 months. I subscribed to r/fitness and started reading their sidebar. I read u/gaylubeoil's posts and other posts concerning lifting and nutrition. 

My diet changed substantially in this timeframe. Turkey, chicken, brown rice, fruit, veggies, eggs, legumes, quinoa -- these foods took the place of pizza, take-out, Chinese -- basically junk food. I was going to the gym 4x per week CONSISTENTLY, taking a yoga class 1x per week, and finally had my weed habit constrained to weekend use only. The weight came easy and quick. And for the first time in my life, 8 months after reading TRP, I discovered I had biceps.

On a side note, the first time I woke up with a boner in the morning, I almost cried. My T levels had been so low for so long, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to wake up pitching a proud flagpole. 

There's still a slight layer of fat over my belly and chest, but my arms and legs have never looked better. I am cutting to try to shave the remaining fat, but I have never felt more energetic. The pins and needles pain is gone. A month ago a girl told me I was too muscular and she needed to feed me so I could look like a real man. Then we fucked.

**WOMEN**

I've slept with five women over the past year. One was an HB7 (easy going, liked to toke and chill) -- we were seeing each other for eight months -- she recently de-plated herself because she wanted exclusivity. What really happened is I fell off my alpha routine for a month or so, allowed myself to get close to her, and started acting beta. Nobody is willing to share a beta, but she was willing to share me when she perceived me as alpha. This was a good mistake to make though, as it has reaffirmed my dedication to myself and my sense of mission.

The second was an HB8 who I met at a party two cities away. We didn't fuck when we met, but then she visited my city and called me up one day to let me know she was in town. We hung out, I escalated, things went down. Here I learned a crucial lesson: if a girl wants to fuck, she will take a bus five hours and drive it straight up onto your dick. I made another mistake here though by showing too much interest afterwards through phone and text. We haven't really talked since.

3-5 were sixes or less; one of them is a friend from childhood and she's actually rather talented with ropes (I enjoyed the experience, just wish she was hotter). The other two I had beer goggles on for and regretted the experiences the morning after. Learn from Hawke34: do not feed the chub chubs.

I've made some key errors with all of these women, but I've been overwhelming sexually successful compared to the prior few years. Some notes in no particular order: cocky/funny and agree/amplify are two of the most useful tools in your arsenal. If you haven't internalized an alpha state of mind, just saying ""OK"" or ignoring shit tests altogether is perfectly acceptable. Avoid PUA gambits, she's heard the cube before. Online dating is only your friend if you're attractive and have good pictures, don't waste your time if your SMV isn't top 20%. Fail one shit test and more will come. Listen to your nature: if you want to grab her ass or twist her nipple just do it and laugh when she tries to counterattack. Never take what she says seriously, listen to her tone of voice. Remember to reward positive behavior -- over-negging is a legit issue (but it's better to go overboard in the beginning just so you can recognize it). Don't let your feelings cloud your judgement -- oneitis set me back a month or two.

More notes: always be escalating. If she holds eye contact from the other end of the room, she's DTF. If she adds you on FB immediately after meeting you, she's DTF. Fuck her friends hard enough and she'll want to fuck you after hearing the positive reviews (even though you're a ""player""). Always hold your frame. Avoid pointless debates, she's not going to be logical. If she pushes for exclusivity, just say no. Her opinion doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

**SOCIAL**

There are two kinds of people in this world: those that will increase your SMV (social synergy), and those that will decrease your SMV (social entropy). In the past year, I've culled the most toxic individuals from my life, while at the same time, building relationships based on mutual benefits. Some examples:

 *SMV - entropy*

Let's call him J. J lived five min away. We would often smoke together. He worked an internship and often complained about how he needed a real job. I stopped hanging out with him when I upped my gym routine -- he would often text begging to hang out, so I invited him to the gym instead. Well, J ended up getting very depressed. His mother decided he should move home, and like a good little beta, he obliged. After all, he applied to six ""real jobs"" and didn't get any of them, so he was ""struggling.""

R. R is a drug dealer with an apartment she can't afford without help from her parents. She is a ""freelance makeup artist"" who doesn't get work and regularly complains about having to always look for it. R is extremely unhealthy and likes to spend the day on a high dose of ketamine. Her closest friends are also drug dealers and she likes to sleep around with whoever is interested. Cutting her out was one of the smartest things I ever did.

*SMV - synergy*

N. N is my best friend these days. We met a year ago, he recently lost fifty pounds and decided to move into the city. My apartment opened up and he asked to move in, I said yes. He's still in a half beta phase, sort of in the anger stage, but is on a mission to improve himself. I invited N to the gym, he signed up for a year. N has a car and loves to travel, so we now travel together regularly and go see music. He's asked if we can live together for the next few years, I've said yes because seeing him improve his body and health is inspiring to me, and it's a joy to adventure with him. He takes charge whenever there's a situation and has accepted ownership over his life.

H. H is an older fellow (42) who sells pot to the local college and works as a set designer. He knows massage as well, and has a number of personal clientele. The man worships his health and looks like he's 25. H likes to host parties at his large studio apartment that has a beautiful lawn that he takes amazing care of. There's a garden, an archery range, stone benches, and a small altar. The most eccentric and interesting people come to these parties. I like to hang with H every now and then, smoke a bowl, and shoot the shit. He's got great life experience and wants to be a helpful mentor in any way possible. He takes no shit and I saw him in action once when some ladies dog shit in his neighbors grass -- he yelled at her to curb her fucking dog and stop disrespecting the neighborhood. Alpha as fuck.

As you can see from the previous four examples, there are people who add value to my life and people who subtract. SMV neutral people exist, and are good for friending to build a social circle, but if you already have a developed circle they'll just waste your already precious time.

Some notes on social: when you fuck the women in your circle, the beta men will complain. Ignore them. Just last week my friend said to me ""Hawke34, you do not share the girls..."" -- it was playful and teasing, but there was a very real truth in his joke. I wanted to spit back ""Tim, the girls are right over there, go talk to them,"" but I just laughed. Read the 48 Laws of Power, and then read the condensed summaries of each law daily until you've memorized them. Men with high SMV typically are very hard working and value respect. Women with low SMV are your most dangerous social competitors because you aren't sleeping with them. Cultivate 5 good people in your life. Fuck social media, it's garbage. If you're not happy at a party, go home and hit the gym early in the morning. Always say less than necessary. Avoid talking about yourself seriously.  Drinking for the sake of drinking is ok every now and then, but hosting and organizing activities really earns the respect and trust of others. Keep your nails trim and cultivate daily hygiene. 

**PROFESSIONAL**

In the past year I've gotten two raises, a promotion, and I'm expecting another this fall. The first raise I got simply by asking for it, my supervisors praised my work ethic. It's amazing how much we undervalue ourselves: if you think you deserve a raise, and live in the U.S., look up the metropolitan numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and ask. The second raise I got with the promotion.

There's a lot of excellent career advice on Reddit and I don't really need to go to much in depth. The basic things: dress to impress, approach your work with stoicism, focus on solving problems rather than creating them. If the firm needs somebody to step up on a project, BE THE MAN. Perfect your craft every day. I've been very successful at a young age because when I'm working, I'm fucking working, or I'm developing the skills that will get me the next big raise.

Pick a career with hard skills, depth and advancement options. I started as a designer, now I'm doing motion and sound design, the next step is evolving 3D modeling into the workflow. There are great subs/online resources that should be bookmarked on your computer (if you're a desk jockey like me). Be curious. Try to improve work processes.

There's always going to be workplace politics. I've found that the easiest way to win at them isn't to ever directly engage, but instead become an invaluable member of the firm who can't get fired. If there's a conflict, it's easy to flex when you have the power.

--------

Well that's the year in review, gentlemen. Because of TRP I'm happier, healthier, richer, and on the path to becoming the man I want to be. Some general notes: when you start out, read the sidebar and the highest rated posts. Then stop by this sub every week or so. Ignore the anti-feminist posts as well as the ""AF/BB"" x-posts from r/relationships or r/deadbedrooms, this is a waste of time if you read the sidebar.

Areas I want to improve for next year: physical development (shaving that belly fat), building a soft harem (need to approach more...) without getting the itis. Disconnecting completely from social media and reading TRP less (applying more). Taking life less seriously.  

Thanks for reading."

i wanted to ask you, how should i prepare? two months ago i failed  a live coding session  with another company because it took me too long to resolve something with active records because of my lack preparation and they got this idea that i wasnt skilled enought for them, before the coding session they asked me to prepare in OOP and some other small stuff but at the coding session i was asked to resolve small things to harder and harder things until the point i wasnt able to do what they wanted at the time they wanted, i dont want this to repeat but this time even though i have been practicing and working in a lot of stuff to be able to get an interview with them.

TL;DR: i just need some advice of how to properly prepare to show my coding skills in general and i know because of a previous experience that i didnt prepared that well.

Thanks


EDIT: so i just had the challange and it went ok, at everypoint i knew what to do but im worried because the interviewer asked me a lot of stuff like ""how would you do this......, imagine that you have a library for this"" and then the questions went to something like ""imagine that you are recieving a stream of data and you want your function to work the same way it already does"" i managed to handle a solution quickly before my time ended up but after the interview ended i saw what i did and it wouldnt cover what they wanted exactly, im pretty worried about this =("

I want to start building my resume so I can get bigger and better internships and eventually a good job that I love and that pays well. One way I plan on doing this is acquiring various certifications. Some basic certifications I have looked into as starting points are CompTIA Network+, ComptTIA Security+, CCNA Routing and Switching, and CCNA Security. 

Can you give me some insight as to which certifications would be best for me to get, or which ones would prove to be less useful than others. I would like to study for these courses on my own using relatively inexpensive study materials, so any good information on how to help learn and prepare to take the tests would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and please feel free to request more information if I left anything out that would help you provide an answer. "

The only way we ever contact each other is over text so should I let her know that way and write a formal letter and leave it on her desk (or just do that without the text?).

I do like the animal care field and I've applied to veterinary school, but I've been rejected the past 2 times. I applied to school for medical technology as a back up but I'm on a 3 year waiting list. I'm thinking about computer science since I'm good with computers, but I'm starting to feel like nothing will ever get me anywhere.

When I first graduated I was so hopeful and confident, applying to tons of jobs, but got absolutely no response. I got desperate and signed up for a temp agency doing random crap until I got my shelter job. I enjoy it and feel like I make a difference, but I can't live off it (live with my parents at 24 years old). I thought with all my experience I'd get into vet school but I didn't, and now I'm just at a loss. My people skills and interviewing skills are absolutely horrible, I have no network to speak of, and everytime I look at the indeed job listings it makes me feel so hopeless.

And it seems like you can be a complete idiot, but as long as you're gifted socially you'll get all the gravy these days.

I'm currently going into my sophomore year of college studying Math and Computer Science, heavy emphasis on CS. I didn't get and kind of internship because I lack any kind of projects on my resume that would make me stick out. I'm pretty fluent in Java and want to move on to my next programming language and start building things to put on my resume/just for fun. Problem is, my major GPA is pretty low from Calculus classes (slightly below a 3). This next semester I'll be taking up a C++ course, and I was thinking of learning C++ to get ahead in the course while making my summer project. Game plan was, make a few C++ programs/game, then learn HTML/CSS/etc. to build a website and sort of showcase what I've made, and build up from there. But now looking more into the world of programming, it seems I should spend more time learning Python or other more up-to-date languages instead of C++. 

TL;DR - 
So basically my question is, should I learn C++ and get ahead for a higher grade in my future class, or learn Python for more functionality in the real world?

side note - sorry if my post is sloppy, first ever post on reddit. Constructive criticism welcome!

Edit: Thanks for all the input guys! I decided I'm going to go for JavaScript first, build the website and smack my project onto that, and learn C++ towards the end of the summer. "
39c51i,1,2015-06-10,Expediting a Job Search,ZXfrigginC,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39c51i/expediting_a_job_search/,"Major: Computer Science

So, my story is that after about 3 years of working in college restaurants, I left it to motivate myself to seek out my Internship, on the basis that I was too comfy in a job that I'm required to leave upon graduation.

It turns out that this may be the worst idea I've ever had. A few months later, nothing has happened, and now I'm sitting in debt and trying to find a non-campus job that I can at least keep post graduation to be financially stable again.

So, a few questions revolving around this situation:

1. What steps do I need to be taking to make the general job search go quickly?
2. What steps should I take to expedite my search for an internship?
3. How far into the future should I be planning ahead (up until I receive an internship offer)?

There are a lot of prejudices I had about a job search, such as applying to stores 1 at a time, committing fully to it, and that there will be a response of either denial or acceptance eventually. I'm wrong on all fronts, so this is more about what routine I should be putting into action, and how long I should expect to keep up that routine."

I just landed an IT internship at an awesome company. They never specified how long it is however the guy I interviewed with said they hired him after he graduated while interning there and that they have had a bunch of college interns. So I was wondering what happens after an internship when I have to go back to classes? Is there a possibility of coming back in the summer? Should I attempt to make my classes night classes to continue the internship? How does this work?

It will be 5 days a week until (I assume) I go back to college in the fall but they didn't specify how long it was. The IT guy I interviewed with said he got hired there after he graduated so I suppose there is a chance of that. What will happen though if I end up doing really well here. Is there a chance of interning the following summer or does it end and I look for a new one the next summer? Kind of lost how this all works.

I managed to land an IT Internship for the rest of the summer starting in 12 days. I will be working 28 hours to start at $9/hour and then it will bump up to 40 hours (mon-fri)

However I'm not sure if I should quit my retail job. I could still work weekends there and then once the internship is over I could work while in school. However I'm taking classes from 8am-3pm every day this semester so I need time for homework and studying. The income would be nice but I don't need it. 

I'm lost on what to do and I need to decide in 24 hours if I should quit or not as my manager is doing the schedule for the month tomorrow and I don't want to screw things up even more. Should I leave the retail job for good or do both/negotiate a time off?"

Also, I don't have previous CS experience, but have taken an online course to learn Python in prep for 61A.

39crep,1,2015-06-10,"88 Websites and Stuck, Now What?",zincH20,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/39crep/88_websites_and_stuck_now_what/,"Ok now I have 88 websites, mostly music and urban based. Some are news sites, a few sports, a few net worth dot coms with celebrity net worth, etc...all using wordpress for the design, but all different designs. Some of them have contributing writers that are interning with me or just want to write, some have feeds from the other sites and some just don't get updated but maybe weekly or less frequently.

Now I did have over 200+ but I have let some expire, sold others on flippa and other sites. The reason I had so many initial is because I would build them up with interviews and exclusives from musicians, mostly rappers, and then my partner at the time would sell artists spots on my sites. so for example we would have an interview with Ice Cube on such and such dot com. then he would get them to pay for placements online, they would see their name on the same website as an exclusive interview with Ice Cube or whoever, and they would get happy. It turned into selling spots on blogs/websites for anybody, and we made a ton of money doing it from about 2006 to 2010. After 2010 the money slowed down from over 200k a year to about 75k then down to under 50 last year and even last year my partner was out, he was actually in college the whole time and wanted to be camera man for the nba but that's another story...but really the market we were in just got flooded with people doing the same thing we were, some just copying, others doing their own type of things, and I watched some of the people I started with 9-10 years ago turn into millionaires. I didn't, but whatever.

So now I have 88 average sites. Some are under a million on alexa, most are google page rank 2-5, but that doesn't matter. Some still get nice traffic which is like 2k a day. the worst get about 200 a day. So obviously they aren't worth anything on flippa or to sell. Since we put music on them that people could usually download, we lost our chance at google ads a few years back, but that money wasn't impressive, couple hundred here and there...

sometimes music labels buy articles, postings, and sometimes ads. It does suck maintaining them, hence the interns and some not getting updated.

I do have another source of income, but I know these sites are still worth something. I am just lost on what I should pursue.

I am def willing to network with anybody. These sites are great for SEO purposes, but I know I am missing something big.

So I ask, entrepreneurs of reddit, now what should I do?"

39d27r,1,2015-06-10,"Reddit, Never work for family. (Lengthy)",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39d27r/reddit_never_work_for_family_lengthy/,"**Introduction**

I was hired after being frustrated with my job in my hometown in Utah. I was given a chance to move to a new state and start fresh living how I wanted for working for a promising startup company working with a distant relative that i'll call Ben.

Ben growing up has always worked in the fire service and that's all he knows. His Mom passed when he was 21 and his Dad disowned him for various reasons. He has constantly searched for help with lots of his issues that affect the workplace. All of the which have proven to not help.

**Rant**

I've been working here for almost three years now and I have had my absolute ups and down with this job and my family relationship with Ben. He's an asshole, manipulative, and down right an abusive person and I don't take any of it from him.

Many times I have had a sit down conversations about my employment with the company to see if 'I still want to work here'. I've invested so much time, into this company by going above and beyond what is expected of me. On some occasions absolutely nailing it, and some occasions absolutely bombing it.

Last October I had a vacation planned to go back to Portugal with a good friend to visit some friends that we had not seen in some time. During that time I was fired over email by Ben for not launching our online store in time and not having marketing material to use for it. Numerous times during the building out of the store I had expressed that I wanted to be removed from the project because I knew nothing about it, and did not feel comfortable with doing it because I am not a coder. I made it all work out but it was complete shit and I recommended for it to be sent out because it's not my profession. Long story short, Ben was not please about any of the result from my email announcing that it had been completed. When I landed in Portugal I was told I had two weeks to find a new job and coincidentally.... I was on vacation for two weeks... so thanks for the grace period.

My job role is a Graphic Designer, but that doesn't even encompass a fifth of the items that I do on a daily basis. I am the office admin making sure contracts are signed, dates and files. I am the janitor making sure everyone's trash is being taken out and the 3 bathrooms in the office are clean. I am the receptionist making sure everyone who steps into our office is quickly helped. I am the marketing specialist who pushes out all of our content to the internet. I am the graphics designer who makes all content for the company and for our customers. I am the IT guy who fixes everything when it doesn't work including for the 2 other companies in our same office. During fire season I sit in a trailer and make sure that everything is working and keep the coffee pot full, and I make sure the trailer is towed to location and setup.

When my co-workers (3 others) found out that I was canned they immediately were up in arms saying they would quit if I did not get my job back because I am instrumental to the company's success. During my vacation I didn't even waste a minute thinking about being fired, I enjoyed myself and my down time. I flew back to California not knowing what to expect, or what to do. I showed back up to work and thought, ""if I just keep working... maybe nothing will happen."" In the middle of my campaign for City Council I thought... well I am just going to have to figure it out. Here I am almost a year later still working and being paid. Ben has never explained why I was fired, and what I was allowed to return to work. 

Fast forward to now. It's still the same gruelling day to day work but we have an intern that is supposed to alleviate all my work but he's utter rubbish and I spend more time helping him with things he should have learned in college than I do finishing my work. 

My Day Yesterday --
Because we are in the middle of a company merger I agreed to head up trailer operations freeing Ben from anything. I sent him an email giving him a heads up saying I was going to prep our trailer for deployment due to a large lightning storm coming through the county. I setup an appointment for the company who maintains our copiers to come do a checkup in case we are deployed. I took the time to clean up, organize, and get us roadworthy. On my lunch break I invited our new city manager up to see the trailers, but the hangar that we went to show it's derelict condition and quickly get back to work. I later show up to the office after all has been done and wash my hands. I get pulled aside saying I took too long to work and there is more important things to be done.

I ended up staying until around 8PM so I could get a large jump on a project coming up and called it an evening very pleased with my full day. I get home and get an email from Sam on my city council email regarding how displeased he is with the city no taking the effort to see how the hangars look and said some rather rude things about myself, the city manager, and overall conduct of the city. Then I get a call from the alarm company at our building saying that it needs to be reset because someone triggered it and it has to be manually reset and I send a text to Ben, and two others asking if they can do it and I am told that it's my responsibility to care for the building. So I drive back to the office and reset it.

During the evening I responded to two medical calls for the fire department. Both were very aggravating because they are honestly pieces of shit doing drugs and are literally killing themselves. I got to bed roughly around 3AM.

8AM comes and I get numerous calls saying I have to open the office for the someone. I didn't get the call until my alarm went off at 8:30 and ran as quickly as I could to get to the office to let him in. Ben was there to cut me down saying that I dropped the ball and I needed to go home and look more professional for work. (I left without showering and my hair was messy.)

I come back and as one of my additional responsibilities is doing copies in the office for the public. I start on a project and establish a price for the customer and get to work. I get chewed out for not doing my 'other really important work' that was started the night before, and competed in the morning and I get a nasty email from Ben and the customer is attached to it saying that I have to prioritize my work better and was completely thrown under the bus.

I'm burnt out from doing everything and getting zero respect / appreciation for it. Conditions have been the same for 3 years and I have no reason to stay where I am not happy.

1. High School:
Volunteered for aviation museum in high school, graduated from high school with honors diploma, spent a lot of time in music programs

2. College: went to state school on music scholarship. Graduated from state university with a BA in Music (in 2013) and roughly $15k student debt. No internship during college, infrequent work during college, mostly in hospitality. I also took a year and a half from college to examine myself, I bicycled across the continent from coast to coast, and worked at a restaurant during that time.

3. After college: I moved out of my college town, held a part time job at a new city for 3 months, hated it, moved to LA for an internship in music. Hated it, moved back to my college town, held 2 different part time jobs, including attempting to be self-employed. Most recent experience was in an office at a non profit, was laid off after 6 months because of budget cuts. 

I'm having terrible luck finding new employment. Frankly, it's because I'm not really sure what I should be looking for. I know that I have a lot to offer, but I don't know how to package it, and I don't know what to apply it to. I feel that my background is eclectic and spontaneous and most employers don't want that. I don't feel at this moment that I have a ""trade"" of any kind either, so when people ask me what I do... I'm not really sure what to tell them. 

I know that I have good writing/editing skills, high computer proficiency, I'm an attentive listener, a highly critical thinker, goal focused, mission and values oriented, and very physically healthy (mentally... in a bit of a depression right now, but I'll get through it.). 

I want to do something that is more direct work, whether it be more physically direct, or more engaging with people... not behind a desk. I'm currently broke and any advice will help. I am willing to post pictures of my resume or answer any questions if that may help.

39dahu,1,2015-06-10,I (21 M) in peculiar relationship with her (20 F) and am unsure how to proceed.,love22jumpstreet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39dahu/i_21_m_in_peculiar_relationship_with_her_20_f_and/,"Hey! 

So, we're both in college and we live on the same street as one another. 

During last year her house came over a lot and we drank and had fun and I had a girlfriend (20 F). We started to text a lot (we have a good amount of common life and career interests), and started to idk get a little handsy (not sexually) and I realized I was going into emotional infedelity. 

Eventually -- I took too long --, I broke up with the girlfriend not only for this reason, but also the relationship with the girlfriend was stagnant for a while. To note, my girlfriend and this girl were acquaintances too, as they went to high school together, but not in the same class.

Also, I didn't break up with her expecting to immediately get with the new girl I knew that it was no guarantee that it would occur.

So, anyway the last weekend of the summer occurs and the girl came over. It was about 3-4 weeks after the break up and the first time we hung out where I was single. 

Anyway, eventually at the end of the night it was just us 2 hanging out, and I kissed her. She kissed back -- but that was that. We talked some more and then she left. 

I tried to organize a dateish thing (more of a 1-on-1 dinner to a place we both wanted to go) but it was only about a month before school ended (we were Juniors) and with finals and other things going on we could never get it scheduled. While I don't think she was necessarily creating excuses not to go on the dateish thing  with me, I also don't think she was making it a priority to go on the date with me, if you understand what I'm saying. 

So, I left for the summer going to an internship about 3 hours away thinking that our chances for anything passed what we were were slim and I accepted that. We stopped texting and I was OK with it, come last week. 

So, last week she texted me for the first time in a while, and we got to talking again. I was going to the school to hang out with the roommates this weekend and she said she would be down to hang out again. I know as soon as I see her the feelings are going to come back and I'll try to pursue something. I'm getting excited about seeing her. I'll only be there for this weekend, and then will be gone for the rest of the summer except maybe one other weekend this summer.

 Is this futile? Does she just see me as a friend to play with her hands and hair when we get drunk? Idk, it's just an odd thing -- all of my buddies say we act like a couple when we are together because we tease each other a lot too.  

Come this fall she'll be moving off our street to another place 10-15 minute walk away where it'll be more unlikely to maintain what we have/had. 

Should I be more blunt about my feelings with her? I think we're at the point where I think she knows I like her, but maybe not. Maybe I should just tell her frankly, and see what she says. 

Thanks for responses! 

tldr; Met girl while in a relationship - liked her - ended relationship, not as quick as I should have - now unsure of future of current relationship with new girl."

I am graduating from college in a few days, and my mom is coming up expecting to have a big talk about my future. Since high school, I've wanted to be a veterinarian, and basically all my internship/job choices since then have been about that. Recently, I've had a change of heart and decided that I no longer want to become a veterinarian. While I enjoy my internships at animal clinics and I love being around animals, I am not particularly drawn to it anymore. 

But the hard part is telling that to my mom, who is expecting me to apply for veterinary school this year. If I try to tell her that I might want to try something else, she tells me that I'm going to be giving up on my dream and makes me question what all the work I've done since high school is for. And in the past, I would also question what all the work I've done is for. If I tell her straight out that I no longer plan to apply to grad school, I feel like she would lose it. While I'm okay with trying different jobs and taking the time to figure out what I want to do, she believes that grad school is necessary and time spent doing anything else is just wasted. How do I tell/convince her that I don't want to go to veterinary school anymore without the conversation turning ugly? 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you! "
39dj14,0,2015-06-10,Technology investment banking?,alazar221,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39dj14/technology_investment_banking/,Hi reddit I'm looking for someone who can provide me with some insight into technology investment banking. In a nutshell i'm a high school junior and over the course of the past year I've been in between a lot of things that I want to do when I'm older. My first passion is technology. I love computers and phones and all that and reading up on whats new and updates. Everyone knows me also as that guy that can fix there computers and phones. My 2nd love is business. I did an internship at an accounting firm last summer in NYC and will be doing it again this summer (payed this time) and I really loved the atmosphere and work. Now here's the issues. Technology has always been more of a hobby for me the more I looked into engineering I realize I don't necessarily want to be designing this stuff but still it be a part of my career. And the accounting side I can see over time how It can get very boring. So after meeting a multitude of people and researching online a lawyer I met at a wedding who I told my story too suggested Technology Investment banking. He told me to look into the field and people like Micheal Grimes and from there I was very interested in the field. The thing is the information for this job online seems very limited you can't simply find information like most other jobs from big databases. From what I've determined is that i will most likely major in Computer engineering and go from there but I'm still unsure because of this lack of information online. SO USERS OF REDDIT what do you think? Is this a good field too go into and what are your opinions. Thanks :)
39dopw,5,2015-06-10,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Summer '15 - Week 10,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/39dopw/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"Despite three new movies, not much changed this week in the Summer Movie League. Everyone held their position, so this may be an abbreviated CRUMDUM. In completely unrelated news, news which will in no way hamper our laser-like focus on providing insightful SML analysis, there's a basketball game on.

**1st Place - Amtrekker - $491M ($64M last week) - $100 Spent - 4.9 Multiplier**

Amtrekker pushes their lead to $53M on the strength of $29M from *Spy* and $23M from *Insidious 3*. *Spy* didn't hit projections of $35-$40M, c'mon take it to the hoop but with great reviews and *Ted 2* the only adult comedy until *Trainwreck* in mid-July, it should have a good run. And *Insidious 3* has the horror field to itself as far as the eye can see, which may help stave off the genre's typical quick burnout. And John and Brett will need strong legs from these two, another first quarter lead, let's see if they can hang on as their next film doesn't open until... the Winter Movie League. That's right, week ten of nineteen and Amtrekker is all in; their complete slate is out there, fending for itself, the comfort of the nest called *potential* left behind.

**2nd Place - GFQ - $438M ($21M) - $63 - 7.0**

It did better than *Queen's Boulevard*, but after a respectable $8M over Wednesday/Thursday, *Entourage* went on to fade a Cav injured, that's new over the weekend, dropping to a daily average just over $3M to end the five days at $18M. Still, after a quick Ari Gold-like tantrum where he fired half a dozen people who didn't work for him to begin with, Andrew realized that GFQ is hell yes that's a foul--he had more shirt in his hand than I did in every date in high school combined still comfortably in second place with potential big guns *Magic Mike XL* and *Paper Towns* still to come.

**3rd Place - Frogpants - $369M ($35M) - $72 - 5.1**

Frogpants' mid-May trio of *Pitch Perfect 2*, *Mad Max: Fury Road*, and *Poltergeist* pulled in $35M, drawing them gotta hit those foul shots $14M closer to second place. As that earning power winds down though, no, no good, Curry, the clock reads zero it's Brian and Scott's turn for an extended wait on their next film--seven weeks between *Poltergeist* and the July 1 release of *Terminator: Genisys*, when, you could say, they'll be back... to earning real money. You could say that, but don't. Friends will abandon you. Strangers will kick you. If you use an Austrian accent, expect a full-fledged beating. Many states will refuse to prosecute your assailants.

**4th Place - Night Attack - $126M ($20M) - $47 - 2.7**

We no longer have to coerce our interns to perform; a twenty-point lead! holy crap! they are in full on thespian mode. This week on *Night Attack Fourth Place Theater*...

""*Inside Out* is going to turn the standings upside down!""

""How does our movie put the first place team in sixth place?""

(pause) ""Well, not everybody goes upside down, just us.""

""You know that just moves us from fourth to third.""

(pause) ""Yeah, so... that's on the medal stand. What's wrong with that?""

""It's gonna have to make, like, $300M to get us there. Probably $400M to keep us there.""

(pause) ""You know, there are times I don't like you very much.""

**5th Place - DTNS - $98M ($37M) - $34 - 2.6**

Their first release, uh-oh, Curry found his stroke *San Andreas*, has done about as well as Jennie and Tom could have get in his face! hoped. $98M and a 6.1 multiplier after damn, he's on fire like 90's downtown Detroit on Devil's Night only ten days, possibly destined for $150M and 9.0+. Everything a twenty point lead is down to one? is going to plan, so we obviously expect DTNS how is this game not over? who's running the clock, Salvador Dali? to slip back into last place this week. Why? How about...

**6th Place - Cordkillers - $37 ($0.08M) - $16 - 2.3**

...Star-Lord vs Megasaur!^1 Two months of waiting oh my god, Dellavedova made that shot! comes to an end for Mulango and Kristi with their release of *Jurassic World*. Projected for a $100M+ weekend, Cordkillers' first he stole the inbounds pass! big movie of the season could propel them two spots in the standings in just three days. Like Amtrekker, Cordkillers bet on a three movie slate, rebound, Cavs! it's over! with two of the movies and eighty-four percent of their budget going into play in the next month. The tall--*Jurassic World*--and the small--*Minions*--will determine their fate.

^1  We would be stunned if this isn't an actual Syfy title.

39dsj1,12,2015-06-10,"My parents are taking this badly, what should I do next?",Faelynn_s,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/39dsj1/my_parents_are_taking_this_badly_what_should_i_do/,"Hi, everyone. I posted a bit ago about planning to tell my parents I was transgender, and writing a letter to them (https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/37ajxt/coming_out_to_my_parents_about_being_trans/). I came out to them last Friday, we sat down together and I read the letter out loud to them. They took it really badly. At first, I thought they'd be accepting, they hugged me when I broke down crying and told me they'd always love me, but since then they have been morose and asking me not to transition at any chance they have. 

They both haven't slept in days, have eaten very little or not at all, and seem very depressed. My mother took my hands two nights ago and begged me, on her knees, while crying, not to transition, and it was a hundred times more scary and heartbreaking than imagining her screaming at me. She asked me not to ""mutilate"" my body, that I'd be unhappy, and that she was scared about my future; she asked me to forget about my feelings and ""be happy"" the way I was. I tried to talk with her, to explain to her how I felt, but she broke down crying and began saying horrible things about not wishing to wake up again, about how I was ruining my life, my future, and everything I've worked for in my career. One in particular that hurt a lot was her explaining how difficult it was for her to become pregnant and have me; it involved years of therapy and insemination attempts, and she blamed herself for having gone through with it, insisting that the hormone medication she took had to be the cause of my feelings, and ended her venting by saying that ""maybe I should never have existed in the first place"". 

Dad has been taking it a little better, but he took me aside the day after I came out and asked me not to transition, too. He said it'd break my mother, break our family apart, and that he felt he'd have to intern her with a psychiatrist on a permanent basis if I did this, that she'd never recover. He told me that he didn't doubt trans people existed, and that he had read about the topic and understood it hurt me to present as male, but that he believed a truly strong person would bear it inside and hide it to protect their family. I felt like he basically told me right there to choose between my family's happiness or my own. He mentioned that they were concerned about me not being able to find a job in my career (electronics engineering), and that they'd both die and leave me behind with no means to sustain myself, and my college loans still unpaid because I wouldn't be able to work. I've tried to show them examples of successful people that happen to be transgender too, to give them hope that it's not as bleak as they think, but...they tell me they don't want to see anything related to the topic every time we talk, and act as though I had just told them I was going to die in a week. Mom actually told me that she had seen dad crying for the first time since my grandfather died the night after I told them, in bed, and that he had told her he would have preferred to hear his mother had died than to hear what I read to them.

I'm not sure how to handle this situation, or what to do anymore. I'm certain I want to transition, that I need to transition to actually be happy with my life someday, but now...how can I ignore my parents, too? I'm not financially dependent on them, and live on my own in USA; I'm visiting them over this month only, so I could very feasibly go on with transition without their approval. I feel horribly selfish, and confused, and scared of the consequences of any choice I make, though. It's horrible, no matter whether I choose to transition or not, I feel like I'm either breaking their hearts or breaking my own. I managed to persuade them to start seeing a mental health care professional, but mom came back in tears from the first session and won't tell me what happened. They want me to see a psychiatrist of their choosing in this country (Costa Rica), too, they believe that I can ""overcome"" these feelings with help from a professional, instead of seeing the therapist back in USA that is ""influencing"" me to choose to transition. I agreed to go, if only to try to calm them down a little. Throughout all of this, they keep coming into my room and hugging me while crying, telling me they love me, and then adding to that the ""please don't transition"" lines, and...I feel horrible for hurting them, I love them so much, too, but their words hurt me as well?

I guess...I just want to ask for advice from people here? They aren't terribly computer-literate, so it's hard to point them towards online resources, but they refuse to look at anything handed to them by me. Does anyone have any idea of what I should do? Is there even a right course of action anymore? "
39dtu0,3,2015-06-10,Help understanding Step motor driving with Arduino,steponmyline,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/39dtu0/help_understanding_step_motor_driving_with_arduino/,"To make a long story short I started an internship last week. I'm an undergrad CompSci student but I somehow landed this internship that would probably be better suited for an EE student, whatever, I have the job.

While I do have a little experience with Arduino, I am lost as to Step motors and there isn't exactly anyone else at the company that knows both the software and hardware side.

Basically I am building a 2-Axis gantry system to dispense some thermal paste on boards. I was given two stepper motors in order to do so along with a gantry already built that will arrive in two weeks. So basically I just need to figure out how to drive them on the software side.


My method was as follows:

  ` #include &lt;Stepper.h&gt; `

   *declaring the stepper and all that goes here*

`stepper.step(20); ` to move forward twenty steps and 
`stepper.step(-20) ` to move back twenty steps



However my boss says this is incorrect as I need to be giving the steppers both *step* and *direction*. After some tenuous google searching he recommended I use the AccelStepper library to fix this problem. After looking through this library I'm unsure how this will give me anything I need (distances are so small acceleration is useless) and how I am not giving it both *step* and *direction* in my original example code, I give it steps (20) and a direction with my negative/positive coefficient. 

Am I correct in my thinking? Is there a better solution neither of us have found? I'd love to understand not just that I'm wrong, but why I am."
39dv0b,0,2015-06-10,Mech Eng New Grad: Looking for Jobs and Losing Hope,ShupUt,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/39dv0b/mech_eng_new_grad_looking_for_jobs_and_losing_hope/,"Just graduated from mech eng. I am not prepared for the job market at all. I have no personal or professional connections, nor do I have internship experience (I have tried but the closest I got is an interview). Because I used to think of doing Master's, so I focused on school work (useless 3.82 GPA) and did undergrad research before changing my mind. Right now everywhere I look, I see either internships for current students or entry jobs that require 2 to 5 years of experience. It doesn't help that I am looking for jobs closer to Montreal but I don't speak good enough French for a workplace.


Admittedly I made mistakes of not going to tech fairs more often because frankly talking to the strangers like that is scary to me.  ideally I could get rotation engineer or engineer-in-training jobs which are reserved for new grads like myself. But the company doesn't list them on website.


I am losing hope. I have no standards right now and would literally take any relevant jobs anywhere. But even with attitude that there is little to nothing. I joke about taking some burger flipper jobs to my friends and they think it's stupid. But now it seems to be becoming a necessity

39dv5q,0,2015-06-10,In light of recent discussion: a shitpost by Zach Jesse,[deleted],magicthecirclejerking,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/39dv5q/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_shitpost_by_zach/,"I had originally hoped that issues concerning my brutal rape of an unconscious stranger in her own apartment would not become as viral as they clearly have. I had not planned on making any public statement on the matter, fearing that doing so would only cause more people to hear about that time I raped someone. Unfortunately, I’m not longer sure that is a viable option. Assuming that Magic authors may make a point to talk about my circumstances (which is how I'm going to refer to the fact that I'm a rapist) over the coming days, I feel compelled to make some sort of statement on the matter.

For those unaware of what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the following:

I did really well at a magic tournament recently, much less importantly, I'm a convicted rapist.

Before I get to what I hope to accomplish with this post, I am going to take a moment to stress what it is not intended to accomplish.

The purpose of this post is to dismiss or minimize my conviction in particular, and to downplay sexual assault in general. For this reason, I do not plan on discussing in any depth or detail any aspect of the circumstances that surround the original incident. For instance, I'm not going to tell you that I received a sentence that was very likely shorter than the length of time it took my ""victim"" (that's such an ugly word) to physically heal after I brutally sodomized her.

The purpose of this post is not to act as an AMA (or “Ask Me Anything” to those unversed in Reddit-ese). I will not be answering questions or otherwise contributing to the commentary below. I don't really care about how you feel about what I'm about to do to you, as should be obvious by now. I’ll be frank; unless I am strongly urged to do so by my friends, it is unlikely that I will return to this thread to read the comments at all. In fact I'll leave you without a thought, as if you were slumped, unconscious, over the toilet in your house.

The purpose of this thread is to get you to like me. Don’t get me wrong. Your feelings, or the feelings of anyone that's not me, have not, and will not, enter into what I choose to do. Ultimately, however, if you remain unmoved, so be it. I'm going to do this anyway.

First and foremost, I hope to address the sole connection that I have heard people make between my conviction and my participation in Magic: the Gathering events: the issue of public safety. After all, there's no way that an unapologetic rapist being welcomed with open arms by this community could have any negative effects on anyone, most importantly me. To that end, the only way thing that I can think to do is to emphasize how successful and unaffected by consequences I've been since raping an unconscious stranger. 

I was 18 (a legal adult) in August of 2003 when the underlying incident occurred. I refer to it as an incident because I don't see it, and I don't want you to see it, as something that I did, but instead as something that happened to me. In April of 2004, I accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecutor in this case. I had rejected his previous offers because the thought of being made to face even the most perfunctory of consequences for my actions made me sick; however, I ultimately accepted this offer at the advice of my extremely expensive attorney who encouraged me to do so in order to mitigate the risk that I face any real punishment. After suffering basically no consequences for raping someone, I am profoundly thankful for this advice.

The plea deal entailed pleading guilty to token count of aggravated sexual battery and serving a three month sentence. Its start date was delayed to allow me to finish my semester at UVA. If that sounds strange to you, it's important to know that I am very wealthy. Therefore, the criminal justice system showed me extreme deference in deciding when and how I wanted to go through farce of pretending to pay my debt to society. Although the woman I raped was unconscious for the entire event of my raping of her, I think it's important to point out that I would not have shown her anything close to that kind of deference is she had asked me. The sentence also allowed me to serve my time in a work release program so that I could continue the internship that my parents had set up for me, despite the fact that there were presumably a wealth of non-rapist candidates that could have been given that internship. To elaborate, I was allowed to leave prison every day and then come back when it was convenient for me.

In closing, I'd like to clear up some misconceptions. While I have expressed regret about my circumstances, I think it's important to point out that that regret is pointed only at the fact that I got caught. I am not sorry, and have not apologized, for raping this stranger and then using the threat of a protracted legal battle, during which my very expensive attorney would have certainly dragged her name through the mud, to blackmail her into asking for leniency for me, her rapist. Furthermore, while I do admit to raping, both vaginally and anally, a complete stranger while she was unconscious in her own home with such brutality that she was visibly injured afterwards, I want you all to feel free to come to your own conclusion, despite all other facts, that I am, in fact, innocent and that my rape victim, who you know nothing about, is actually a lying whore.

I have written this to hopefully convey that I have attempted to make amends by being extremely successful, as my parent's great wealth almost assured my of being.  If you chose to continue to dislike me, feel free to do so. If you’d like to shun or vilify me, I can’t stop you. Unlike my victim, I can't sneak into your homes while you are unconscious and inflict my will upon all of you. Although I would if I could. I will continue to do what I am doing, being an unapologetic rapist."

I'm going to try and make this as coherent as possible but I might have a little bit of a difficult time. I've had minor issues in the past with anxiety, when I was in high school It was over grades and things of that nature. It wasn't too bad I would have a panic attack from time to time but all In all I could manage it.

Nowadays it seems to be getting worse. College was a big step for me and I'm thriving academically. The whole ""what am I going to do with my life"" question has caused me to have many sleepless nights where my heart would be racing and I wanted to pull my hair out. Many times I feel like I'm just breaking down but I talk about it with my parents every so often and that calms me down a little.

However I recently started an internship and everything has gotten worse. I get along great with my coworkers that's not an issue but I'm doubting and questioning myself at every possible moment. My heart is constantly racing. Even now lying in bed my heart is pounding in my chest and I can't control it.  I'm so nervous and worried and frustrated.

I hate living like this. I want to try an enjoy life and try to worry a little less but I don't know how. "

Nmom is the only child of my disturbingly wealthy Ngrandmother. Though my parents come from wealthy parents, they went through a shit divorce and are now both broke because my mom got all his investments, cashed in, blew it on a house she couldn't afford. 

I'm 18F, and am off to college this fall. I've made my decision that once my 4 years are up, I am OUT OF HERE. Why? Because my parents make my life a living hell. Ndad lives with his girlfriend, her 7year old, and my 15 yr old sister. I live with Nmom who is moving in with Ngrandma in July due to her financial situation. Ndad does not want me living with him because I make everyone miserable. I've been in treatment for anxiety since I was in 3rd grade, I've got endometriosis which puts me in heinous pain all the time, and apparently I bitch too much about being in pain. Sorry, dad. I didn't choose this. I do not want to live with Nmom and Ngrandma, but I'm sensing it's my only option. I despise my Ngrandma more than anyone I have ever met in my life. At least my dads parents have the decency to leave us alone! Why do I despise this horrible woman? Many reasons, but 2 events stick out the most, and I think you guys will be amused/horrified by these.

Event 1: In August 2013, a childhood friend committed suicide while I was on a mission trip w/ Ngrandma's church (I go because we do construction in areas of disaster and I have friends there, not the religious aspect like some). I was a wreck all week. In August 2014, on the anniversary of his death, I was on another mission trip. I teared up a bit after seeing some Facebook posts dedicated to him, and Ngrandma told me I better stop crying because I was embarrassing her, and I shouldn't be sad because he wanted to die and I should be glad he got what he wanted. Ignorance must be bliss, grandma. 

Event 2: April 2015, Ngrandma took me to Paris for my 18th birthday. I had recently switched birth control to help w/ my endometriosis, and had a bad reaction while overseas. Did I get treatment while over there? No. Did I get to go to a pharmacy for painkillers? No. Why not? Because Ngrandma didn't spend all this money for me to mope around and waste her time. Instead, I spent my days in the hotel room with no room key or money to prevent me from leaving. Flowers in the Attic type shit right there. I had my doctors number, so I called her office from my hotel room to explain my bad reaction and she told me I needed to get to a hospital ASAP. So you know what I did? Called the front desk, had a key made, and marched my ass over to a hospital not 3 blocks away. GOD BLESS THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. Wasn't given everything I needed but at least I got a prescription that my insurance would cover for some relief. 

I could write a novel about this woman, I really could. Having to live with her for the month before I leave for school, which Ndad is paying in full for (part of my parents' divorce agreement) and the summers that follow is driving me crazy and it hasn't even started yet. Have no fear, I have a plan! I have a job right now and my pay is divided into thirds. 1/3 goes to checking. 1/3 goes to long term savings. 1/3 goes to apartment savings. I figure that if I get an on-campus job, and continue to get jobs/internships over my college career, my savings plan should give me enough to move from the Midwest to either Seattle or Portland (I'm studying finance, I think I will be able to get a decent job so long as I work hard in school and with internships). RBN, wish me luck please! "

39eemk,0,2015-06-11,[19/F] My boyfriend [21/M] and I of a year broke up a few days ago. He cheated... three times...,jgiggelson,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/39eemk/19f_my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_of_a_year_broke_up_a/,"So my boyfriend broke up with me about 3-4 days ago and I had no idea why and I was devastated. I mean, I thought this was the guy I was going to marry. We had been together for a year now and he just went to New York for this summer internship.
Monday, he called me and told me why he broke up with me. He had cheated on me. This isn't the first time this has happened. It has happened twice before. The only reason I didn't break it off right then and there was because 1) he told me about it and seemed remorseful (any other douche would have not told me. PLUS he was crying the entire time he was telling me) 2) I had faith in the relationship and I thought he would change and 3) it was just a kiss every time (kissing someone else is cheating in my eyes).
I warned him ""three strikes and you are out"" and this was the third time.
He was drunk each and every single time and refused to take my advice of 1) not drinking and 2) not going out. Of course I can't control what he does, so clearly I was wrong to believe that he was actually going to change.
I had to cancel flights to New York because I had planned on seeing him. Not only is he upset but his mother is also upset.
But my real issue is that I wasn't the one who cheated, but he would get really jealous and overbearing when it came to me talking to other people. It felt like I was the one who cheated.
It is just tough. The relationship is over and I know I can't go back, but part of me still thinks that he is going to realize that he could change, but he is going to realize it when he is too late. 
I spend my days on Tinder just talking to people because my friends and family tell me the same shit and I just want someone to talk to; a fresh face that knows nothing about me and can just listen. 
I know I am doing the right thing. But I just want to know if there is a possibility that there could be a future with him someday? I want to be over it, but I don't. I want to move on but I don't. I want him to come back.... but I don't want to answer the door when he wants to see me. I don't know what I want. "
39ehoh,32,2015-06-11,"Advice for computer engineer ""rebooting"" career in software? (additional wrinkle: 1.5 years unemployment)",simple_denim_chicken,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39ehoh/advice_for_computer_engineer_rebooting_career_in/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions,

This is going to be pretty long, so I really appreciate if you take the time to read it, but I'll give a TL;DR at the bottom since I'm afraid I won't be able to compensate you (...yet???).

I'll start with some background (warning: gratuitous sob story)...I have a CE degree from a top 10 CS/CE/EE university (3.5 GPA). I took roughly 50% CS courses, 25% CE courses, and 25% EE courses. I've had 3 software-related internships at big companies (Medtronic, IBM, and Qualcomm) and a firmware-related research assistant position. I got hired right after graduation for a prestigious aerospace contractor doing FPGA development, but I left after 2 years without having another job lined up due to a mental breakdown caused by the intense workload (bipolar disorder did not help). I essentially did nothing productive for about a year, which I was fully aware was horrible from a rational standpoint, but I had savings and I was extremely disillusioned with the idea of returning to work.

THAT SAID, I've been struggling for the last few months to get even an entry-level position. It seems my skills and experience are far too broad and not nearly deep enough. When I chose my degree, I thought that would be a selling point, but in retrospect I probably should have gone with CS since I focused more on that, anyway. I have a little high-level software experience, a tiny amount of firmware experience, and a little FPGA experience...almost all the jobs I've seen want a lot of one.

I have had a large number of first-round interviews/phone screens, but as soon as they find out about the unemployment and/or the fact that my only OOP experience is academic they lose interest. I finally had a second round interview yesterday that seemed like a perfect fit, entry-level C++, but they went with someone with stronger C++ and Java skills. I have no Java skills, so I can't blame them.

I know the long-term solution to my problem is to actively develop my C++/OOP skills through projects, etc., but in the short term I am out of money and desperate.

So how do I market myself? How do I explain my unemployment without mentioning the words ""mental breakdown""? What kinds of jobs should I be looking for? What can I do in the short-term to make myself a more desirable candidate? What is the meaning of life?

Thank you so much for reading and I sincerely appreciate any advice you can give me. Mockery of my life decisions is also more than welcome.

**TL;DR: Skills too spread out, didn't work for a while, struggling to start a software career with CE/EE ""baggage"", seeking advice.**

39elkj,0,2015-06-11,"Me (25F) with my brother (22 M) and his GF (23 F), a year ago the GF and I had a big blowout, and she may be resurfacing soon...HELP",LetsgotoThePig,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/39elkj/me_25f_with_my_brother_22_m_and_his_gf_23_f_a/,"Hi, relationship_advice, this may get long so you may skip to the tl;dr at the bottom if you wish. 

So relevant backstory: My brother used to live with me and then seemingly overnight, he moved in with a new girlfriend. They lived together for about 10 months before she backed out on renewing the lease after her parents offering her to live with them again....behind my brother's back. 2 months before the lease was up, his GF gave him 4 days notice to move out with no one to go to except for me. 

I had a 1 year old at the time and was finishing up school so I bargained with him. He could live with me rent free if he was my babysitter during the day. Monday thru Thursday, 8:30 to 1. After a few short weeks, his GF would come over to visit while he was home. However, it became more of a problem as she would stay from, literally, 9am to 11pm. Most days of the week. I didn't say anything because at the time they weren't causing any trouble so why make it an issue?

Then the fights came. They would go all day seemingly fine but when it was time for her to leave, as per her parent's curfew (and their rules for her living with them), she would purposefully stay later through God knows what logic...and she would call him on her way home and they would have absolute terrible fights. 

I started realizing something was off about her when she would seek other men's attention because my brother pissed her off, and one time she threatened suicide. While I was in class, the landlord called because my brother was yelling profanities. I threw down the gauntlet and told him that it stops now or he can't live with me anymore. And no more complaints were had but, they started leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen and when confronted they would fight about who was supposed to take care of the dishes! Ugh. 

Anyway, we were getting cramped so my husband and I decided to move into a larger place in the same complex. The move was hard. I was taking my classes and my husband was working 2 part time jobs so he was gone all day and night....so when I got home, I did most of the packing and cleaning and moving into the place. On top of taking care of my 1 year old in the process. I was so burnt out that once I got all the boxes in the new house and mostly unpacked, and after cleaning the old place so we could retain our deposit, I was burned out. My brother handled his own things during the move and got set up relatively quickly and spent the rest of the time gallivanting around town with GF. 

Shortly afterwards, I started my internship which turned into a full time job. So my brother was nannying Mon thru Fri 8:30 to 5. I had a pretty short fuse as a lot was on my plate. Brother fought with me about changing the mailing address because it was around his birthday and he wanted to wait until he got his b-day cards even though I told him everything would be forwarded, he still wouldn't hand over his key...so I yelled at him in front of his GF who started scowling at me...

Then, once again dishes became a problem as GF was using them and expecting Brother to clean up AGAIN, but this time she scratched up my cookie sheet and ruined the non-stick finish and I just had it and told him that I don't need more work to do and to not use the kitchen unless they're microwaving shit. GF didn't like that and angrily said she'd buy me a new cookie sheet. I told her that it wouldn't be necessary, I just don't want people cooking in the kitchen anymore. And she blew up getting mad that I apparently wouldn't let her rectify the situation, when that wasn't my angle at all. I wasn't even yelling at her, I just vented to my brother and then calmed down. He was the one talking to her about it anyway. 

So, one day, in the middle of my internship I get a text from her stating ""You told (Brother) that he didn't have to watch (Son) today. What do we do with (Son)?"" Long story short I immediately called Brother asking what was going on and that I didn't have a back-up and he tried telling me that we talked about it the night before but that's odd because that was the first time I was hearing about it. It just didn't sound like something I'd agree to the night before a workday...it resulted in a fight in which GF ended up taking it upon herself to take the phone and get involved and tell me that Brother can't be worked so hard, he needs a day off, I have a dirty house, I'm a terrible mother and she has been tempted to call CPS on me...amongst other things. All of the ""terrible"" things (i.e. running out of diapers and having no money to buy more) she witnessed were during the weeks that I was solely moving everything into the house and was burned out.

I immediately banned her from the house to which she hemmed and hawed about. She has since snuck in while I was at work and asked my brother for current pictures of my son because she's ""worried"" about him. For the record, I keep up on all his Dr. appointments, he's not neglected, we've since gotten everything out of boxes and organized our house. We regularly have family and friends over. No one else is worried about my son. He's very loved and very healthy. I ended up kicking Brother out for letting her come into my home after not only threatening my family but after I banned her.

Now, a year has passed and she's started getting Brother to contact me about some things she's apparently left at my house...they're stupid things like a pair of shoes or headbands that I've long since given away. She's started adding family members on FB and has been viewing my profile. 

Tell me I'm just being paranoid but I don't want her drama in my life...is there anything I can do? Do I just drop it and let it roll off my back? 

**TL;DR**: Over the past 2 years, my brother found a GF who appears to be somewhat crazy and we got into a fight where she threatened to call CPS on my family and is now resurfacing asking for things that are of no consequence that I don't even have. I don't want her in my life, I don't want to deal with her drama. WHat do?"

A rather large part of our relationship has been her seeking advice regarding her problems or just generally venting about her life. I'm not naturally inclined to talking about myself, and she definitely is. Lately, this trend has intensified due to her poor grades, lack of a boyfriend, weight gain, and general self esteem issues. In response to this I've tried to help her in small ways, such as helping her find an internship this summer which she initially seemed to be enjoying. Today, however, she told me that she finds it too challenging, which scares her, makes her doubt herself, and apparently adds to her existing self esteem issues.

I should add that we've definitely had fun times together, and I don't want to cut ties altogether. 

In general I'm a pretty happy and optimistic person but I've found that whenever I've hung out with her recently, I come away quite sad. Mostly because any time I try to introduce some more substantive conversation topic, it always ends up circling back to how pathetic she feels her life is, which makes me in turn consider the problems in my own life. 

I even suggested therapy. She insisted that she's not depressed but is simply sarcastic and has a poor attitude. She told me that others have told her that she's depressing to be around, and I fear the consequences of me - one of her closest friends (she's referred to me as her best friend before) - reinforcing that. I suggested that voicing negative thoughts may magnify them, but I'm not sure if she really got the hint. 

What should I do? I need to safeguard my own mental health, but I want to help her as well. I'm not sure that it's my place to outright suggest that she's depressed though. 
   
**tl;dr**: A friend of mine is either depressed or just has an extremely negative attitude, and I always come away from conversations with her in a bad mood. Starting to feel both like a therapist and someone who needs therapy myself. Not sure what to do. "
39f3mv,1,2015-06-11,Just starting weight lifting,MrBottle,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/39f3mv/just_starting_weight_lifting/,"I'm a skinny fat Asian dude and I started following Stronglifts in January, as part of my new year's resolution to get fitter and more muscular. From January to April, I was having difficulty coping with the programme from January to April because it was hard juggling internship and stronglifts. Since my internship ended, I've been doing stronglifts seriously since 1 month ago. At the start of the year, my weight was 69kg and now my weight is 74kg. Not sure whether that's an excellent or poor gain. Everyday I've been eating 1800 calories and tracking my calories using MyFitnessPal.

Since I started the programme a month ago, I could some changes in my body like my thighs and arms started to get thicker and my chest is not as flat as before. It's nice seeing some progress but is the progress as fast as I wanted it to be? I would say it's a no especially my chest. It still seems flat and whenever I wear my shirt, my chest still looks flat and I could see my belly.

Considering my visible belly when wearing a shirt and constantly seeing those fitter and leaner gym goer (They're dragon boaters fyi), it makes me want to go on a cutting mode. I want to quickly lose my belly fat as it's quite discouraging to see my belly whenever I sit down. My belly fat quite thick when I sit down. I could just pinch it near the belly button and it'll be like 2-3 cm thick.  So I thought I'd start swimming 3 times a week as my cardio workout.

Looking at how I want to bulk and be more muscular and at the same time, I want to cut to lose my belly fat. (I envy those with flat tummy with visible abs :( ), I am starting to get confused. I am not sure whether should I bulk or cut first. Any advice?

My current stats:

height: 1.77 m

weight: 74 kg

TDEE: 1800

**edit:** 
Since my workout days are Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, should I swim and or HIIT on my rest days? 

Also, what are some recommended abs exercises? Currently I am doing 4x30 seconds of plank with 1 min break in between. So that's 5 minutes for plank. And also 1 set of crunches till failure."

39g0mo,0,2015-06-11,"23 w/ credit debt, student loans, and no job. What's the best way to pay it off, if that's even possible?",itsmattlee,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39g0mo/23_w_credit_debt_student_loans_and_no_job_whats/,"Hello, redditors. I'm coming to you because I've seen someone of the wisdom a few of you possess when it comes to giving advice.

I've lived a very inexperienced financial life, and it's now coming to bite me back. 
So I'm in a bit of debt with no job anymore, and no real way of making an income. The stupid 18 year-old me decided to get a credit card, and since then I've only been recklessly spending, bringing forth the spawn of satan they call ""debt."" I've managed to make my minimum payments, if not more, on time, and haven't missed a payment to date. Unfortunately, that season of having money to pay off my CC debt is coming to an end. I no longer have a job, and my credit debt sits somewhere around $2,000-$2,500. I know it might not be much to a lot of you, but being a guy with no source of income, paying it off seems impossible. I used to be in the ""sneaker game,"" so buying and selling J's and other sneakers was a solid way of making money. Granted I think I spent more on myself than I did trying to profit from it. I no longer have any more shoes to sell for money. Having been out of that game, as well as bring jobless, it only leaves me with a slowly shrinking checkings account.
As for student loans and whatnot, that's something that'll be handled in it's own time. I'm still in school, so my loan payments right now are deferred(?). That's not much of a worry...for now. I'm more worried about the here-and-now, which is my credit debt. I would say I have a couple months left before I'm completely drained of all my money. I'm freaking out!
I also have a friend whom I've borrowed a hefty amount of money to pay off my CC debt at one point. The card balace was zeroed out, but in time, I've managed to raise it back up, making it no different from where I started. The only difference is that now I owe that friend a little money still. Now I'm sitting on that number mentioned above AND I now owe my friend some money still. I've somehow managed to make a horrible situation worse. He says I can pay him back slowly because he has an idea of what my situation is. 


So yeah, got any pointers on how I can handle this situation? Again, I'm aware that there's no money coming in for me, thus making my situation hard, if not impossible, to resolve right now. I just want to clear my credit debt...right now would be a good time for Tyler Durden to blow up these credit buildings.

Second note: I don't really care about my credit score and all that jazz right now. According to soruces, my FICA score is around 750-760. I'm taking that as a good thing. Anyway, like I said, I'm not worried about my credit taking a hit. I just want this balance to be gone. I hate living with the thought that I owe thousands of dollars, and there's nothing I can do it about it.

Side note: I know there are some of you guys who are &lt;23 years old with a solid job, salary, etc. Sadly for me my parents spoiled me as a kid, never really let me live independent, and babied my my whole. I've been given allowances for no reason when I was younger, so money, to me, was something that just fell out of the sky. 
I'm also a little hesitant to go to my parents to ask them for help because, well, it's a bit embarrassing, and I don't want to burden them.

Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading.

Edit: I forgot to mention that finding a side job is really hard for me. It's not that I don't want to work, but more of the fact that I can't. With full-time school, and being a full-time pastoral intern at my church (fri/sat/sun I'm at church for every living minute), finding a job is hard to imagine. That's actually one of the reasons why I'm having a harder time than I should. I'd be working my butt off over the weekends if it wasn't for my future becoming a pastor."

I'm not sure if any of you guys run into this problem and I'm not sure how your teams are set up. But I'm in QA, so in our project team we have 4 developers and 2 QA's. It's a smaller company (about 300 employees total) so each QA is only on one or two projects at a time. I'm also just an intern, majoring in software engineering. Anyone else have a similar experience? 



Just to clarify: I'm not complaining about my work, I love my job and this company, I'm just wondering what you guys like to do on your down time.

Moving Soon,unbreakable0013,tampa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/39gbol/please_help_struggling_to_find_a_place_to_live/,"Hey Tampa, I am making a move to your area in the coming weeks for an internship that I hope may become a full time job after a few months. I am a fresh college grad and I will be working on Channelside. I have been looking at Craigslist and Roomster for a place to live because as an intern I will not be making much. And it's an indefinite internship so it could go on for a long time or end after a few months. However, most of the posts seem to be bots or I have not gotten any responses. I was hoping you guys might be able to direct me to a cheap places to live that would be close to work. I have a car, but it is a piece of crap and I don't know if I want to try to make the drive to Tampa with it, so the closer I can be, the better. Does anyone know of any other reliable websites that I might be able to find a room? I don't know officially what I will be paid yet, but I doubt I will be able to afford more than ~$600 per month. Thanks for any and all help and advice!"
39ghtl,9,2015-06-11,"I'm sorry, I told them...",downwithdawn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/39ghtl/im_sorry_i_told_them/,"I have to share this story in hopes that if I die tonight, I will die knowing that others who have experienced this won’t feel alone.

It all started happening halfway through my last semester in college. I have been in school studying Interior Design in hopes that I can eventually design hospitals and education buildings to impact the people around me, and make a difference in their lives. 

So I was sitting in a meeting at my internship that I am required to take to graduate, and the lady I have been working under tells a group of us interns that the best way to get experience in design is to help design theatre stages. I thought this was amazing because I did theatre all throughout high school. So I developed the perfect solution to getting experience. I decided that I would go back home for a few weeks and help out my old theatre group with their upcoming play. 

I was on my way to my hometown, which is a small, almost forgotten town in Indiana, with my father, who insisted that he pick me up and take me there. While we were on the road he decided to stop at some run down hardware store out in the middle of nowhere. It was getting dark out and I really didn’t want to go inside, I kind of just wanted to go home and deal with this in the morning but he insisted on going in tonight and told me that if I wanted to I could stay in the car. 

Me being the stubborn person I am stayed in the car. I wish so hard that I could tell you that something came out of the cornfield that night and scared me shitless, that I heard a scratching noise at the door, or even that I saw glowing red eyes out there and I couldn’t sleep or move or SOMETHING. Instead I fell asleep in the car while I was waiting. My dream was like one of those really creepy horror movies, like the Hills Have Eyes or some fucked up hillbilly movie. There was blood everywhere. It was all red, dead animals all over the place and there was a flashing light, kind of like those old motion picture reels. I woke up with a start as my dad opened the door. He made some joke about it looking like I saw a ghost and I just furrowed my brow wondering what the heck that dream was about. 

When we finally got home, my brother was in from college as well and I told him about the dream. He laughed at me and told me I needed to quit binge watching True Blood, and that I was getting the opening scene confused with a nightmare. I playfully punched him in the shoulder and laughed, which felt good after feeling so tense after that weird dream. After a few hours we all settled into bed.

There it was again the flashing light, the blood, and the animals. Everything was moving by so fast I don’t know what is happening and suddenly I stop. Like something that was spinning that you stop with your finger. It was so abrupt that I am thrown off balance. Then I see what stopped me. I stop breathing with a sharp intake of air. In front of me with both hands on my shoulder is a man. His face is scarred all around the right eye like some farm tool was used on his face. He had one hazel colored eye and the other one was pure white on the scarred half. He then begins shaking me and yelling “Don’t you DARE tell ANYONE about me again, or you will die!” 

I jerk awake covered in sweat, but I am back in my bed. I am home. I decide right then and there that I will not talk about this man because I fear that maybe, just maybe it is not just a dream. The only reason I even begin to believe this is because I believe that there are monsters out there, that there are ghosts, that not everything in this world has a good side. So for nights I stay awake for hours with the light on, not wanting to ever cross paths with this man again. 

Time passes though and as the show is coming to a completion the dream of the man begins to fade. If you have even done some work in the theatre it takes weeks to develop a stage design and then to build, paint, and add props. Where I went to school we would have little gatherings some nights too. One night I was talking with my ex who originally got me involved in the department and he still helps out with them when he has free time off from the police force he works with. We decided to meet up with a couple other alumni and just have a good time eating junk food and shooting the shit as they say. 

We started talking about the paranormal and nightmares. I remembered my dream, and since I hadn’t really had any more of them I decided to tell the group. As I was telling them I could feel the goose bumps on my arms and the air was so still it almost felt static with energy. I could tell that one of the other alum was scared from the look in their eyes. When I finished there was a silence. Then finally my ex started laughing and we all calmed down and laughed until our guts hurt. 

After eating 3 bags of Doritos and drinking almost a whole giant case of pop we all went our separate ways. Knowing that I wouldn’t be able to see the show performed I decided to spend the night in the theatre just so that I could look one last time at my design and take a few pictures for my portfolio. I ended up easing down onto the coffee table in the middle of the stage, it wasn’t the most comfortable thing to lay on but it was better than the floor. 

Suddenly I jerk up from the table to see there is blood everywhere, flowing off of the stage and onto the carpet. There are dead animals nailed to the walls surrounding the small theatre and I scream. I don’t know what else to do but to run out of the room. So I jump off of the coffee table and run up the short set of stairs, out of the theatre, and across the hall to the teacher’s lounge. Suddenly I felt that pressure of hands on my shoulders. I look up to see that man again and he just smiles and says, “I told you not to tell anyone about me.” 

I feel pressure around my ribs at this point and I jerk awake. I don’t know how I didn’t realize that I was dreaming but I’m still laying on the coffee table. I can’t get up, I try but there is something holding me down. I start sliding up on the table like something is pulling me off. I look down to see arms wrapped around me. These arms are coming from under the table and they are pulling me off. I grunt as I try to wiggle my way out of the grasp. I get to the point where my head is fully off the table and I glance down to see that man from my dreams. I have some leverage so I try to hit him with my head. Luckily I make the hit and his grip loosens. I break free and I run. I run so hard that I’m still breathing heavy writing this.

I got in my car and I drove to my house. The first thing I did was grab my computer so that I could let you know what happened to me. I don’t want to stay here too long in fear that this man is right behind me. Maybe, just maybe I’ll survive this but I really don’t think I will.

39gkob,2,2015-06-11,Is a Masters in Public Relations worth it?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39gkob/is_a_masters_in_public_relations_worth_it/,"For a little bit of background:

I have an Bachelors in Criminal Justice, a degree which has proved to be quite useless.  However, I was fortunate enough to land a great internship which led to a full time job, albeit in a different field (politics).

  I've been in my full time position for 2 years now, and, despite getting a few interviews, I have been unable to land a better paying job.

Being that much of my job is centered around communications and public relations, I typically have been searching for positions in government affairs/relations, communications, and public relations (generally politically focused).  Despite my experience, I am getting a feeling I am losing to candidates who have a more relevant undergraduate degree.

I've recently been accepted into a Masters in Public Relations program, and am trying to weigh the cost/benefits of it.  I'd love to get some outside opinions, especially from those who work in PR.

Thanks for taking the time to read!"
39gp7v,1,2015-06-11,First attempt at internship left me feeling defeated,xabe13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39gp7v/first_attempt_at_internship_left_me_feeling/,"I recently found a potential internship position that I was excited to apply for, as there aren't a lot of internships where I'm from (Oklahoma City).  I emailed them with my resume and they responded in what I felt was a condescending manner.  They told me that ""internships are filled by college students wanting to augment their studies with real world experience"". They mentioned that in my resume, they didn't see ""programming training or experience and you seem to be at a spot in your life where you need a job that pays the bills, not an internship."" In my resume, I not only discussed the computer languages I'm familiar with, but I also emailed them a letter describing some of my projects and personal, extra curricular education I've been pursuing.
While it's true that I am 29 and need more than an internship, I'm currently enrolled and pursuing a BS in CS.  I am not in a financial situation where if I interned and worked a part-time job, that it wouldn't be enough.  So my questions are: is this something that happens and since I'm just finally getting my resume out for internships, that I shouldn't be so easily discouraged?  Is there a way that I can tailor my resume to reflect my interests and/or experiences in schooling better?  Any help would be appreciated.

TL;DR - got possibly rejected for an internship and am needing advice on how to continue."

I'm not going to be coding or looking at code but I will be running tests and not much else. Will this internship help me get an internship at any of the bigger companies? (intel, qualcomm, amd, etc.) Or am I better off pouring my energy into a personal project?

I'm really hoping to get a development  internship next year and I feel like being labeled as a SW validation engineer will only hinder my efforts because employers will want me only for validation.

I'm not from a top school or anything prestigious. So that won't help. 

If something seems unclear I'll do my best to clarify."

I applied earlier this year for a position teaching english in Asia, and got the job! Which is great, but 2 months before I leave, I'm let go from my current job. 
I haven't been fired before, so I'm really lost on what to do with myself. A few tech recruiters have contacted me, and I'm hesitant to follow through with interviewing for full time positions knowing that I'll be leaving soon.

I haven't worked a part time job in years, so I don't know how to get back onto the market, though that seems like the most logical choice. Still, my last server job was 4 years ago, and I'm afraid my degree and recent work experience would make me overqualified/undesirable. 

I suppose part of this is me venting, since I'm having a hard time deciding what to do with myself until I depart. Any advice would be appreciated."

I never realized how fucking lucky I was, the last two years, to have close and free access (with my tuition) to all the gyms on my college campus. The main gym is massive - 5 cages, 5 more racks you can squat on, tons of benches and incline benches and weights and all kind of shit. I've never taken my fitness very seriously - always been ""skinnyfat"", essentially. Underweight, but not much muscle on me. Getting in shape has always been something I'll do next week, or next month, or after this midterm, or this summer.

Well... this summer finally came, and I can't find a fucking gym. I moved about an hour away from my college town for an internship. The first week I was here, I actually found a gym I loved, but it was just too damn expensive. It was a training type gym, not a do your own thing gym. They wanted $130 a month for three classes, or $170 to do unlimited classes, and I just can't justify spending that much money. I've been searching endlessly for another gym, but they just don't seem to exist.

I don't want a wall of cardio machines with a 15 foot TV. I don't need a ""women's only"" area so that I don't feel intimidated (not a woman, but that shit just seems unnecessary). I don't need someone to watch my kids. I don't want to pay a 80 dollar signup fee in addition to the monthly cost. I don't want to do a year long membership when I'm only here for two more months. I just want a gym that's cheap, that has plenty of racks and benches and weights, and that's close to my house and work so I can go there without wasting a ton of gas. Apparently, that's just too much to ask for.

Fuck, man. I was really excited about gaining some weight this summer and I've been putting a lot more effort into eating more (still don't track my calories but eh), but at this rate I'm just gonna get fat if I keep eating like this without finding a gym.

I was hired as a marketing intern in college, and moved over to the sales side after about a year. It's a very small technology company with a start up feel to it, very flexible hours, very laid back culture, etc. However, the product I have been trying to sell for the last 2 years just isn't selling, and I'm losing motivation. I generally like working in sales, for example I loved retail sales, but this job has just become boring and discouraging. Moreover, I commute an hour and half to get to the office. My fiance and I have talked about moving, but ultimately I really really love where I live now and I don't particularly want to move. 

I was offered a job at a larger company about 6 months ago and I was thrilled. It was almost double the pay and a big career opportunity. The hours would be have been awful, and my commute would have been even worse, but atleast it was something different. But, the company I am currently with made me a very very competitve counter-offer to stay, which was more than what the large company offered me. Being only 23, I just saw dollar signs and decided to stay. 

Now it's 6 months later and once again I am miserable. I am making good money, but I hate going into the office everyday. I do the bare minimum of what I am supposed to do and it doesn't feel good. Every week I tell myself I will push more this week, but I can't seem to muster up the energy to do it. I know this isnt what I want to do for the rest of my life, but if I walked away from this, I don't know what I would do after. Also, I am making such good money and have such a flexible work/life balance, that I think most people would think I was crazy to walk away. 

What should I do? One thing I considered is seeing if they would let me drop to a part time work from home sales consultant, while I tried doing some other things, but I'm not sure how they would take that after they just fought to keep me full time. My job isn't difficult, but it does take a lot of training to learn the space, so it would be difficult for them to bring in someone new, so there's an element of guilt as well, that they've invested so much in me that I owe it to them to tough it out. 

Any help or insight is much appreciated! For reference, I am 24 with a BSBA. "

I graduated from a college that is ranked top 10 in computer science, but because I came in as a different major, and was pressured by my parents to graduate on time, I didn't learn a lot of the material really well. I was lucky to land internships through connections during the summer between semesters, so my resume is pretty solid. However, I have never read Cracking the Code, and tanked in my Data Structures and Algorithms courses in school, and generally have been a terrible programmer over the course of college.



**Now**

Despite being terrible at it, I've always loved and had a passion for programming. I spent the first week after graduation properly learning Java (I read Head First Java, and plan to follow that up with more hardcore Java books), and signed up for and plan to complete the Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms course. While waiting for the course to start, I started reading and working through every single exercise from Sedgewick's Algorithms (the text using by the coursera course).



**My question**

I was offered roughly ~100k from the decent tech company that I had interned at previously, and just to be safe, I accepted it. However most of the people on my team are middle-aged men who have stagnated, and are happy just working 9-5 jobs. The work is definitely not mentally stimulating. The company is not innovating, and I don't feel like I'll be making any impact on the world at that company. I feel like if I took a few more months off and completed the Data Structures and Algorithms courses (part I and II) and then really drilled the last 2 editions of Cracking the Code, I'd be better prepared for interviews. I yearn to work at one of the Big Four, or in a fast-paced startup that's doing well, and offers work that will be valuable to me in the long run.



**tl; dr**

CS graduate with a solid resume, from a good school, with no interviewing skills whatsoever, accepted a job right out of college at a decent tech company. The work is mind-numbing and not good for my career in the long run.  Working my ass off now to fix my interviewing skills. Aspiring to work at one of the big four/solid startup.



**Side note:** I live in the Bay Area (currently at home with my parents) so money is not a factor. I just want good experience at a good company that will help move my career forward.

I am currently in college and working in an internship and I'm starting to read more about saving for retirement and I would like a little clarification that I haven't gotten from the wiki yet. 

After I graduate we will use a hypothetical salary of 100k for ease of math if any seems to follow. I know I need to be contributing to my company 401k because the company match is very rewarding and practically free money. 

Once I max that out (I believe it's $5,000 year) where should I begin to save my money? I've read that contributing to a traditional IRA for someone who has a high taxable income is more beneficial due to being taxed at a lower rate once you retire because it assumes that you are going to be withdrawing less than you currently make. But a Roth IRA is good for someone who will withdraw at a higher rate than their current salary. 

For the hypothetical example let's say I want to retire with 150k/year withdrawal. Is there a way to contribute to a Roth IRA now since my salary is less than my withdrawal amount and later in life when I am making more than the 150k should I change my deposits to a traditional IRA to prevent being taxed on my higher income? 

What determines if I am considered a high earner and should deposit to a Roth IRA or am I still a lower income tax bracket and should add to a traditional IRA?

Thanks for the help and please correct me if I've said anything incorrectly or misunderstood something."

My family was rather prominent in the local political scene, and my grandfather was the mayor of our town for 16 years (before I was born through my fifth grade year).  Around my sixth grade year, he was indicted on public corruption charges.  Within 18 months, he was in prison – where he would stay for eight years.  He lived next door to us, and we were close, so this was especially hard on me.  I was also really into politics as a kid, and the conviction pretty drastically changed our family’s involvement in that world.  We found out how many of our friends were actually just “political” friends, and our social circle got a lot smaller.  Plenty of people did support us, but any chance of my actually being involved in local politics ended.

Near the end of grade school, I started to distance myself from the friends I had in childhood.  I went into total self-preservation mode, which was aided by my family’s “us against the world” mentality at the time.  It’s hard to fault them for that, since our name was in the news a lot and fighting the federal government can make one feel very helpless.  Unfortunately, all of this happened right when I was entering high school. I don’t specifically remember when things changed inside of me, but I know that by the time I got to high school I had no friends, and almost no social interaction with people my age.  The shame and sadness that I felt stopped me from ever feeling comfortable letting people into my world.  The people involved in the trial became like characters in our lives, and most of them were villains.  I started to see the world in that light, and so I avoided getting close with anyone. 

I was not involved in many extracurricular activities in high school, and the one or two I did partake in were not helpful in expanding my social circle.  I don’t recall ever hanging out with people after school, going to sporting events with them or going to school dances/events.  At lunch, I would sit with different groups, but I always felt out of place and never really had a relationship with anyone.  I’ve always had a really sharp and sort of intellectual sense of humor, so while people probably thought I was funny, I never related to them enough to make them comfortable laughing with me rather than at me.  Because I normally dealt with people older than I was, my sense of humor was always more geared towards them.  My peers, if they noticed me at all, picked on me and made fun of my social anxiety.  Strangely, I didn’t rebel or show any outward signs of distress.  I worked, got average grades and stayed home (when we weren’t visiting my grandfather in prison 500 miles away). 

Those four years shaped who I was for a long time.  I feel like I missed out on a real rite of passage by not having a social life in high school.  At times, I feel like it’s a fatal flaw in my personality that I can never fix.  Looking back, I don’t know how I got through high school without losing it.  I guess I was being strong so my family wouldn’t worry about me.  College wasn’t much better, but I was able to get an internship which turned into a full time job. I had “work friends” there, but  I still never really addressed the issues that my high school years caused and I ended up getting into legal trouble for some of the coping mechanisms I developed.  I lost that job, and essentially had to start over at age 30.

I have since gone through a lot of internal turmoil, therapy, etc. and have a pretty good grasp on how I can avoid sliding back into those patterns.  I realized, among other things, that my childhood religious and political beliefs were not actually mine, but my family’s.  I am now very comfortable with and open about my thoughts on those topics, and that makes a big difference.  I was able to make friends after college, mostly thanks to the internet and the live music scene.  A lot of the friends I have today, I owe to that.  Even my girlfriend, who I’ve been with for seven years now, came into my life through that group.  So, while I am doing OK now, there is always this feeling that I’m somehow forever broken because I had hardly any social interaction from age 12-22.  It’s just such a formative time, and it was almost a total loss for me.  Anyway, I’ve never written all of this out before… so, thanks for reading.

**TL;DR**… I had no friends in high school and I'm afraid it fucked me up for life."

As we studied concepts in physics lab, we learned that time is relative.

Now we are the scientists. Where did the time go? 


&amp;nbsp;

I knew the day would eventually come: four years – no more, no less – after that first day as a resident of Troy, New York. Four years after meeting classmates for the first time, figuring out how to navigate campus, joining a club, making friends, taking that first exam.

Wasn’t it just yesterday that I learned how to spell “Rensselaer?” Now, this word is staring back at me, written in a fancy font on a piece of paper. This document, supposed to represent the “knowledge and thoroughness” that has been imparted by this institution of higher learning, will never come close to embodying the intangible lessons learned over the past four years. 

These real world lessons were learned both inside and outside the classroom. Leadership. Accountability. Responsibility. Decision making. Should I change my major? Should I become the president of a club? Will I be successful as an intern? How do I become a better public speaker? How do I balance academics and a part-time job? 

RPI has taught me to keep asking questions, to keep learning, and to never give up.  

&amp;nbsp;

Saying goodbye is always the hardest part. To whom should I say “goodbye?” To whom should I say “see you later?” Friends and classmates are now scattered like seeds to different corners of the Earth, ready to take root and grow outside of the campus community. 

There have been many “lasts:” the last time enjoying the gorgeous sunset over Troy, the last time studying in a favorite study spot, the last time eating at a favorite restaurant downtown. Now, it is time for many “firsts:” first day of grad school, first day of a real job, first opportunity to explain what it feels like being a graduate of RPI. 

Sure, you can come back to visit, but it’s not quite the same, and never will be. 

Enjoy your time at RPI. It may just be, relatively, the best four years of your life.

Landed my first internship recently. This is my third week here. I work around 20 hours a week, but very little of it is actually programming. We work in a federal building with many floors, and we are the ""systems"" division. 

I find myself doing a lot of IT work, such as imaging/deploying computers, inventory, helping employees fix their computers. The only programming I do is some website programming, which is honestly very easy and just copy/pasting code or troubleshooting simple syntax problems. A lot of time is spent responding to e-mails and working with excel.

On my downtime I am just waiting for service calls or reading up on my own interests in programming. Now I did learn a couple of new things on the job -- computer networking and proxies (zenworks/novell), how to use git, basic web programming.. But my interests are rooted in Java, C++, actual debugging and problem solving.

Its an easy $15/hour, but I don't know if I'm wasting my time and should start looking for another internship ASAP. There are also expenses that don't make the $15/hour really worth it ($60/month for parking, dealing with LA traffic), but on the other hand the other interns are cool (and are leaving soon, so I may have to code more) and the hours are lenient. They are also willing to let me work until I graduate, and I should mention we work really close with the city.

Mostly gaming for stuff like Elder Scrolls Online, Witcher 3, League of Legends, Total War, Indie Steam games, and others. Will use it for other entertainment purposes like watching movies online, but its primary purpose is for gaming.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Max settings, 60+ FPS, single 1080p 27"" monitor. This is all just what I'm leaning towards, because I don't have much experience with PC gaming beyond WoW on my laptop. I'm interested in the idea of a 1440p monitor or dual 1080p monitors, but I don't know what kind of upgrades that would require.

Basically I can't afford to pay anything expensive for weekend parking on top of what I'm already paying. Is it free without a sticker? I'd love any advice or references to give me reliable information. 

Thanks very much, I look forward to my first city experience

Edit, in case anyone else has this question and comes across this post---

After speaking with someone from the alderman's office for my zone found with this link 
https://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/ezbuy/getgeoWardLookup.do

I was informed that as I have out of state plates I do not need a sticker, and should be fine if I park legally. Check with your specific zone. Horray, parking!

So would it be a good idea to try even though I have very limited knowledge of a very small portion of the subject?"

 I'm super excited to do these projects and have put some good time into them. I'm struggling learning the new technologies before starting my projects, I just jump into them and find myself googling a lot and I feel like I'm not learning anything.

I love challenging myself. I love optimizing an algorithm. I love taking the time to learn a new language. I love making cool products for people to use. I don't, however, love the CS culture.

I only have a few friends in my CS classes. Plenty of friends in other majors. I just can't seem to click with most of the people I've come across in CS. I've gone to ACM meetings and they're not enjoyable. I'm not really friends with the other interns I'm working with this summer. Even the full-timers out of college are awkward to talk to. I tried my best to get to know the other interns, but after I while I began to realize how much I didn't enjoy hanging out with them. I don't want to play video games every night, I want to go hiking or play a game of flag football or watch the NBA Finals. People have different interests, I get that. I'm not saying mine are any better than theirs.

Another thing is the arrogance. It's like there's this cloud of arrogance floating over everyone and I hate it. A lot of the time I can't even ask a question without feeling stupid for it. What's wrong with genuinely helping someone? Why does everything have to be a pissing contest? Oh, and everything has to be debated! Everything!

Have I just had an unfortunate series of experiences? Does anyone else feel this way? Like I said, I do have a few friends in CS and they're awesome, so I know there are people to get along with. But overall I'm going nuts and it makes me reconsider my career at times."

First of all, thank you for any comments you can give me or advice.
I graduated college in December and have a job with the company that I interned with. I make 50k pretax. I have approximately 40K in student loans from my degree. My car is completely paid off, so I don’t have any debts from that. Insurance is minimal( just under 60 bucks a month) since it is an older car, but it is in good condition and I take decent care of it. I have no plans to replace it in the near future.


My student loan payments are roughly 400 dollars a month right now, and I plan on making the payments while I build my credit so that I can consolidate the student loans next year with hopefully less interest. The reason I haven’t done that yet is that my credit score is low. (I didn’t get any credit cards until I was hired full time for my own state of mind)
I currently live with my parents, but there are apartments that are right across the street from my job that I will be moving into at the end of June when they are finished being built. This will change my commute from a 45 minute drive to a 10 minute or less walk. The apartment is 720 a month, but the lowest cost for one bedroom apartments in my area is around 650 and in a not so great area. I drive a gas guzzling SUV, so the gas costs of changing from my home to these apartments is pretty much the difference in cost between this apartment and others in neighborhoods further away.

I have minimal credit card debt, just 150 bucks that I will be paying off from a purchase next month.

I have no real emergency account to speak of, but I don’t live paycheck to paycheck and I keep a decent buffer of money (roughly 1k) in my bank account above the costs that I have for the month. This will continue to get bigger, but I have been putting most of my checks into paying some money I owed my parents for various college expenses. Those debts are done now, so I don’t have those either.


My company offers 6% matching 401k and has since I was an intern. As of today, I have 4k in my 401k, and I am meeting the matching but not going further.

I developed a budget that shows me saving roughly 600 a month from my paychecks. This will be going into a couple things, the first is developing an emergency account, and the second is paying for a wedding sometime next year.

I do pay for a Netflix subscription and a Kindle Unlimited subscription which I guess could be eliminated but I don’t think I am in a place where I need to be on a very tight budget.
 
I have estimated some of the costs in my budget, because I can’t really know them until I move in and begin making payments, but I think I estimated things at least in the ballpark for the costs.


Item | Monthly Payment/Budget
---|---
Total Post Tax Income  | $2725
Student Loans Payment | $391
Car Insurance | $57.50
Apartment Payment | $720
Utilities Estimate | $125
Water Estimate | $50
Internet Bill | $119
Food,Gas,Dates,Miscellaneous Costs | $660


 
Leaving me around 600 a month of a buffer/savings
 
So with all of that, and I apologize for all the text. Do I look like I am in good shape? Am I missing some glaring problems/mistakes that may not have occurred to me?
 
Tl;DR Just graduated college, about to move in to first place. Making 50k a year, matching 401k, 600 bucks of savings per month on top of expenses. Am I being dumb?"

This past week, his son was getting married and I was in charge of holding down the fort for the full week while he was away. 

I casually made my rounds around the office, performing the daily and weekly tasks as well as fulfilling the demands of users. The week was sailing by smoothly, until the head of Purchasing calls me on the workbench phone in a panic.

&gt;$PurchasingLady: Help! One of $OfficeManager's reports is printing out of the purchase order printer!

She's on the less tech-savvy side of things, and it was a short walk from my location to hers, so I told her to wait and I'd be up in a second to stop it. I left the workbench and climbed the stairs back up to the office. The entirety of the Purchasing office was waiting for me by the stairs. 

&gt;$PurchasingLady: I stopped the report, but now nothing else will print!

At this point, I started to feel uneasy about how she stopped the print job... I walked with them over to the print in question, and was slightly horrified with what had happened.

**She had opened the lid and ripped the toner cartridge out mid-print.**

I sighed, and began picking the jammed paper out of the tray and roller. After putting everything back together, I wrote out a note for the Purchasing department to press the button with red X on it next time something wasn't supposed to be printing, complete with drawing of the button. I suppose she did stop the report from wasting all the purchase order forms though."

39isra,7,2015-06-11,"I'm an adult, and I wish someone would tell me I'm doing a good job. [Warning: Really Long]",CapricornWithButter,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39isra/im_an_adult_and_i_wish_someone_would_tell_me_im/,"As it stands, I am currently in school in an attempt to finish my bachelors; in due time, I will pursue my masters  as well (probably during an internship). At the moment, due to not having parking passes for either of the cars and our new place being much further off campus, I take my sister to and pick her up from school so that she has a reliable and safe mode of transportation. As her classes sometimes end later or earlier without warning, I usually have to modify my plans in order to accommodate the lack of consistency in her school schedule while still trying to do my own school work and getting the apartment clean and situated. I am accustomed to working anywhere from 24-32 hours a week at a part-time job in addition to school in order to assist my parents with the expenses that come with them giving us a place off-campus to stay. I'm used to doing this by providing myself with the funds needed to keep gas in my car, cover smaller bills such as water or cable, and rely on them less for non-essentials. I will be starting a new part-time job soon (at the end of the month), and plan to put some of that money away toward rebuilding my savings, which I had to empty out in order to cover a parking ticket that was completely my fault because I was in a rush and wasn't paying attention.

Over the years, I have made sacrifices for my family and friends, given up time sleeping to help them work through problems or assist them in some way. I have damn near lost my childhood best friend because, in addition to just plain being busy, I'm pretty sure she's been avoiding me because she knows I want to be more than friends, although I have on many occasions put that aside to assist her with whatever guy problems she is having and would do it again if it meant just being able to sit down and watch TV together and talk about school and our futures.

I take on the  financial responsibility so our parents don't have to sacrifice so much. That's why I worked so hard to find a job, and although it doesn't begin until late June, it's something.

 In  August, if I hadn't screwed up on my grades, I would be going into my first year of engineering school and would have almost completed my physics degree. I spent all my time studying and making good grades so I could get into a good school that I ended up screwing up and dropping out of anyway and having to transfer to the same school my sister is in, where she is a few years behind and watching her friends graduate and move on with their lives.

I just turned 21 in September, and my sister will be 23 in a few days. Of the two of us, I am better with finances and time-management, but I can also be a bear to live with because I need a clean and spotless place to live in order to function. I'm diligent about my school-work, and as of writing (11 June 2015), I'm in the middle of finishing a class that I could not finish during the Spring semester due to being ill.

My sister and I recently had to move apartments due to safety concerns. During this process, it ended up falling on me to turn in the 30 day notice to our previous land-lord, negotiate the pros and cons of the places we were looking at, call in to the place we finally chose to tour it  and have our parents tour it, call in to double-check the upfront payment, pay the final rent on our old place, begin the process of cleaning up the old place and moving into the new place, turning in the old set of keys, and having my stuff moved to the new place quickly (so that when our parents came, there would be less for them to do). The only things I could not do were pick up the boxes (which I promised I would do the next day, but our parents ended up delegating that to my sister because I couldn't do it that day) and get the cable moved over (because it's in my sister's name).

My boyfriend and his brother also had their wisdom teeth removed during this time, and I had to split my time between helping my boyfriend recover (because their mother had her hands full with his brother and his father couldn't take off) and get my own stuff together, preventing me from doing my school work and having to put it off.

All of that is to say this: I am unhappy with my life. I know if I said this to my family, they would respond, “Why are you being ungrateful? Your parents are paying a lot in order for you and your sister to have a place to live and go to school. Why aren't you happy? You should be thanking them instead of complaining.” I understand where they're coming from, but that just doesn't factor in. I am unhappy with my life. I understand the sacrifices my parents make; I understand what it takes for them to support my sister and me.

And knowing all of that just makes it worse. It makes me more unhappy because I know I'm making their lives harder by being unemployed, by being in school, by not giving them tangible justification or compensation for their hard work. I'm also unhappy because I can rarely afford to “go out and enjoy life”, as my mom says, because what funds they put in my account go toward necessities, and it's rare that I have extra funds or time to go out on a date (and I'm grateful for my boyfriend being understanding of this, as his siblings and grandmother became his priority after high school due to parental absence, which prevented him from going to college and has him in a low-paying job that doesn't pay nearly enough for how many hours he works). I'm unhappy because I sacrifice time and energy and patience and my feelings to benefit the people around me, and I feel like only my boyfriend notices and appreciates it. 

**tl;dr:** Despite my sister being older, I am shouldered with more responsibilities because I made an effort to improve my time- and money-management skills so that I could be prepared for life. I offered to bring my sister to school so that our parents could save a couple hundred dollars this month because moving is expensive. I split my time between helping my boyfriend's mother take care of him and his brother after surgery. I try not to ask for extra funds for dates or to go out, which means I'm always strapped even when I am working because most of my funds go to necessities. I am infinitely blessed to have parents that can provide for two young adults who are trying to fix their lives, and I am grateful for their support. But I feel like all of my hard work is going unnoticed and has become simply expected of me, and there is no way for me to express my unhappiness without being viewed as “ungrateful” “spoiled” or “selfish”."
39iswx,14,2015-06-11,"So after years of making other's miserable, my deadbeat brother is succeeding in life and I am sitting here alone, sick and working a dead end job. I hate life.",orbitalpottery,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39iswx/so_after_years_of_making_others_miserable_my/,"I have younger brother. To say we do not get along would be an understatement. We're polar opposites, with the exception that we are both gamers. He loves soccer to the point of obsession, I can't stand watching sports, as it bores me to tears. I love reading, he doesn't even read comics. I love science, he failed biology and chemistry 101  repeatedly and was eventually forced to attend a different school as his grades were too bad.

Now I would have felt sorry for him back then, accept that he's an asshole. He's confrontational, aggressive, rude, bullied and beat me as a kid, chose shitty friends, and  finally,as a teenager, he almost got our dad sued for fraud. How? He sold stuff online he didn't own and he did it under our dad's name. Fortunately, a friend alarmed me before the police got involved, and somehow I managed to defuse the situation by paying for everything. He never apologized for it, never even talked about it. He never reimbursed me. 

A few years later,  stuff started to disappear from our local gaming store. The Owner and I are pretty much convinced that he stole it, but we cannot prove it, since the store doesn't have CCTV. At that point my brother, Me, and the Owner had been friends for years. He was banned from the store, and even so he was given the chance to apologize and make amends in light of said friendship, he never even said sorry, in fact he just broke off contact with the owner and just acted as if nothing had happened. He almost got me banned too, but luckily the owner believed me when  I told him  that I had nothing to do with it (which is the truth). Otherwise I would have lost the majority of my friends I had at that point.

Shortly thereafter my mom kicked him out. He was 22, still living at home and my mom just lost it. Several times he had come home wasted in the middle of the night, barfing all over the bathroom. Another time he had sex with his then-girlfriend in my parent's bed. The list goes on. But he found a flat of his own and my mom forgave him.

Then there was the time when he decided to break off contact with our parents for no reason at all. He just stopped calling and never answered any calls. My mom almost had a nervous breakdown, as she started to imagine what might have happened to him. Again, I calmed down my mom and after several weeks I somehow got him to call her. Again, he never apologized.

So why am I listing all of this. Because two weeks ago this fucking asshole got a job with a starting salary of almost 40.000 $ with a great company. He has a drop gorgeous girlfriend who's on her way to become a teacher. Apparently she loves him? I want to know what  she sees in him. 

NO, he didn't change. He is still the same idiot who hated school, who made people miserable and who never admits any wrongdoing, even if he is caught red-handed. He still hasn't apologized to me, my parents or my friends. Nothing  about him is different.

Oh, and the kicker? 

I had to drop out of college. Not because of my grades (I aced my final examen), but because I couldn't do the required internship. I called dozens of companies. Not one was interested in hiring an intern. Mind you, my major was environmental engineering, not philosophy.  I was diagnosed with glaucoma and allergic asthma. the glaucoma drug makes the asthma worse . Since  I am a college drop-out, I now work in a call center answering questions that are so moronic that half the time I just want to ask the caller if his/her call is a prank. The other day I talked to someone who had used a cactus as a dildo. Yes, I am serious. Someone took a cactus and shoved it up his bum. Yelled at me and wanted to sue someone for his suffering.

I have no girlfriend. I hate my job so much, that I want to scream every morning. I am poor. I am sick and there is no cure.  

AND MY SCUMBAG OF A BROTHER IS GETTING EVERYTHING IN LIFE. FUCK. THIS. SHIT.

How can I maximize my chances of getting a medium or big law firm job that could lead to an offer for 2L summer (and hopefully a post grad offer)?


Here are my specifics (top 25% of the class, very well respected regional law school in T50, federal 1L summer internship), but I am posting this for the many others who will also likely strike out at OCI. Because of my status, I still have a chance at landing something at OCI, but that chance is quite slim.


From what I gather the most important thing is networking. Meeting people, trying to make a decent enough impression that they would be willing to talk to me, and trying to develop a relationship. Along these lines is to try to figure out any friends or family (if possible) that can lend a hand in introducing me to people and/or putting in my resume somewhere for review.


Any other suggestions? Anyone here strike out at OCI and still land something in big or medium law? If yes, how did you do it?


Any help is appreciated!"

What do I do to set myself up for success in internship/job in a year?",programminghelp9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39j01i/so_getting_a_cs_degree_on_the_side_outside_full/,"So, long of the short, I am currently 27 and working in a finance job as a licensed rep.  While I have learned a lot about investing on the retails side, trading stocks, etc. it's not really where I want to be long term.

I began pursuing a CS degree on the side (basically an undergrad without the fluff classes, as I already have a degree that isn't STEM related) outside my full time job a while back.  I have completed a few classes doing the program part time part time (Basically know C++ pretty well know on a basic level).  Also, I learned some Ruby and Java in the past, but its been a while since I used them.  Been doing well in my classes so far and really enjoy learning this stuff.

However, doing this part time really slows down learning this stuff.  So, I am very much considering leaving my job to finish the rest of my degree off starting in January 2016.  If I started full time, I would have completed all my classes by December 2016.  Although, they're really are only 10 classes I need to take to complete everything starting in January (again, because I eliminated the fluff courses with my past degree). 

With all that said, I really want to set myself up for sucess in the coming year.  I have been through college once and did it wrong.  Did the wrong degree, didn't go for the internship, etc..  Now, I know what I should be doing.  Getting an internship in the Summer 2016 and aiming to have a job by or before December 2016.

So, the main question I have is what do I need to do between now and May 2016 to land in internship at a good company realistically?  Please, keep in mind that I am basically limited on doing my classes outside work until December 2015.  I wish I could pursue massive side projects, but full time job+part time CS degree=not a lot of extra time to do stuff.

Second, what should I do to get a job lined up by December 2016?  

Last, around say January 2016, what side projects should I be aiming for and when should I am to have them completed by?  I realize the answer is, ""whatever your interested in"".  Well, I'm interested in a lot of things.  I think there must be some groups or websites that allow you to contribute to open source stuff.  Are there any good websites like that?  Are there any websites out there that list different paths you could take with a CS degree?  That way, I could explorer the different paths and see which one fits my interests the most?  

I hope these questions make sense.  Overall, I really want to get into this field because I enjoy coding and learning CS.  I have taken basic programming intro courses, done discrete math, doing assembly this summer, and moving on to data structures and algorithms soon.  I enjoy all this stuff.  But, I would like to set myself up for success come next year.  

Can someone out there guide me in the right direction for my situation?  Thanks for any information.

Need reassurance,Sheehan7,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/39j57l/i_got_an_offer_from_a_dream_job_but_im_more/,"Last year I put in my two weeks at a retail job because I got a new office job at my college. However just 2 days before I was about to start the office job (and now being unemployed) they told me I couldn't work there because I was ineligible due to me having loans and they don't give work study jobs to loan students. I was pretty devastated and had to lie when people asked me how it was because I was embarrassed. 

Fast forward to know I have a decent retail job but I applied for an internship (paid) at pretty much my dream company and they called me and that they loved me and that I got the job! I have since signed and scanned back the written offer (still an at-will employee) and I start in a week. I gave my weeks notice at my retail job and they are PISSED because they don't have enough staff now. 

I'm now terrified that what if the offer I got some how ends like the last one did and I'm out of a job. I can't even use this retail job as a reference now as I doubt they will give me a good review. 

Basically I have an irrational fear because of what happened last year and am terrified it will happen again (even though I know that's deeply unlikely). Help reassure me? "

All of this material seems interesting, but I am not sure whether all of it is relevant to my goals, which are to code projects in order to have a chance at landing an internship (possibly in distributed systems) or conducting research next summer. Is it possible to postpone any of this material, because I will inevitably have to take a lot of courses covering this exact material in college. Out of these prereqs, which can I expect to read just for the sake of knowing the material and which can I expect to read in order to make projects vaguely related to distributed systems like a server implemented in C or a chat application. For instance, I’m not sure if after learning about operating systems, linux kernels, and unix programming I could actually code something significant or contribute to open source. If all of this systems knowledge is not too helpful in learning DS or coding projects vaguely related to DS/networking I would rather hold off on the material until I take the courses in college.

39jcd8,2,2015-06-11,Me [21 M] with my gf [21] of a year and three months went to study abroad and now wants to be alone and put us on break after almost breaking us up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39jcd8/me_21_m_with_my_gf_21_of_a_year_and_three_months/,"The past few days have been pretty shit, it all happened three days ago when I was having a pretty good day at work for once and a pretty good morning altogether.Through out the day my girl friend who recently went to Germany to study abroad finally got good wifi to skype to me that day and I was pretty excited to go home and finally talk to her. Got through the day and raced home. Showered and we got on skype.

She looked amazing, I said hi first and started to ask how her run before the skype was and how classes were. But the silence was there, the look on her face was something I could tell was wrong. Not the one you would make if you were excited to see your boy friend.

She then started to talk from a piece of paper that she wrote it down on, I guess she couldn't do it from the top of her head because she wouldn't be able to do it at all.
She read it and I shouted for her to stop and that it wasn't happening. It was hitting me, I could see the signs that we needed some space, but we weren't the kind for taking breaks and we were almost always together when one of us had a free day. Almost never apart and I knew we needed space to develop ourselves again.

One part of me felt like it was people around her or she fell in love with somebody else. Or that she just lost her mind, but no it's not that I feel like she just doesn't know herself anymore.

I was insecure from past relationships about breaks since my ex went around with other guys during one and I just didn't believe in it and that two people could rationally talk out how they feel and I don't know, just love each other without getting too worked up about something that rational minds can fix. That's not exactly how humans work though.

She hadn't thought about taking a break or asking if we could instead of breaking up which hurt me most after we talked about how a break would be best. We talked and cried for each other, man it stings still to think about it. We cried so hard to hold each other and to be together during that moment. 

We both were together for too long of periods and it seemed so real and too mature for her, I never intended to get to that point. But I noticed how grumpy we got around each other during winter since she never got out much and I worked a lot, I knew we needed space but by that point she was afraid to be by herself and her mind. I was her safety though, I protected her from thing and she did as well. We helped each other when we were at our lowest and now all the time and memories can't help us here. 
I tell her people change every year, me a year ago thought differently than I do now, it doesn't mean a month away will completely change you into a new person void of all love and memories for another person.


That was the first sign that this was eventually going to happen. Now we're at a point where we are both together on facebook but she's afraid I'll reject her when she gets back or if she'll even still love me when she gets back. 

She didn't want me to wait for her to return and to be somebody completely different. To which I said is bullshit since it's just a month long trip and she'll be back and happy to see me like she always was, and who she is is who she is. Just have new things to talk about is all and to have all the space she needed and that when she gets back we'll be cute and lovey with each other because that's what's probably going to happen. She agreed with me there and said it could be something in her gut that she doesn't need to follow but she has to and needs to know that I won't be stuck here waiting for her.

But, she's going to another state in the south next year after a semester for an internship, we already had a long distance relationship, but that was large. I would've prepared for it and we would talk about our options. And that hurts her more knowing we don't have much time left.

She said I was the best thing she's ever had in her life and that everything I am is what she wanted and that I deserve better than her, she's not happy with herself and wasn't when she left. Personal things and insecurities slowly ate away at her during her junior year and it really took a toll on her along with constantly being with me to feel safe from herself.
I just want her to be happy, but the one part of me cannot accept losing her forever and after a year and three months too. 

We were so happy together when she was here and I helped keep her bad thoughts away, I just don't know how to feel about this whole thing. I personally feel as though her depression got the best of her and made her think that she wasn't being the best girl friend and that the distance was hurting her wanting to be with me and feel better. She was happy there and I loved seeing her pictures and how her day was.

Now I can't call her cute names or be cute with her, now I have to just be her friend and let her breath and wait until she comes back so we see what happens.
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend showed signs of losing herself over the last few months due to being with me constantly and now that she's in Germany for a month studying abroad she wanted to break up, but we decided on bending our break rule and are now on a break but I'm afraid to lose her. I wish there was a way to help her feel better, but I also want to not talk to her and give her some space to breathe. I'm so lost right now and scared."
39jd66,30,2015-06-11,A Different Path,bold78,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39jd66/a_different_path/,"First of all, I want to say that this is not an anti big 4 or anti big firm post.  I have just noticed that most of the posts on this subreddit come from people who work for those companies (which makes sense since those firms are bigger) and I want to show that there are other paths in this career.  I am not saying what I have done in my life is better or worse than what people who have decided to go to larger firms; it is just different and I would like to share it.
 
That being said, this is my story.

I graduated college with a GPA of just under 3 and a GPA in my businesses classes of around 3.2.  I went to a school that isn't heavily recruited by the big four (i believe Deloitte is the only big four firm at our recruiting event), and I believe that only 4 of the top 25 firms recruited at my college.  In college it was drilled into my head during school that the only way to be successful in public accounting was to go to a national firm. Because of this I basically sent my resume to the national firms that come to our events and no one else.  I had a few interview but nothing came of them.  I was depressed as crap.  Like many of the students who post on this subreddit, I thought I was up shit creek without a paddle...

Then, during class one day, a friend told me to email the owner of a small firm (8ish full time people) in town and tell him I was interested in an internship.  As luck would have it, he was still looking for an intern during tax season and after an interview I got the job.  Throughout that tax season i did simple tax returns and I was under the impression that April 15th would be my last day and then I was on my own.  Apparently, throughout the year, the small amount of knowledge that must have accidentally sunk in during school and/or my work ethic was noticed by the owner (or my good looks and charm... who the hell knows).  I was hired on full time at the end of my internship.

I have now been their 2.5 years.  I have done some interesting things so far in my career.  I work with many small business owners, some just doing their returns every year, others I do all their accounting including their general ledger work.  I help with transition planning.  I have potentially saved a family millions of dollars because a larger firm botched an estate plan.  That family had paid tens of thousands of dollars to get this estate plan done by a larger firm (top 100) that is a major player in their specialty area.  Me, an accountant, not 8 months after graduating found the multi-million dollar error in their work that would probably have gotten thrown out by the IRS when it was examined.  I am very slowly becoming our firm's expert in an area of government regulation that deeply affects our clients.  I have worked with the leading experts in this area of regulation.  I work with wonderful people and I rarely work more than 42 hours a week in the summer or 60 hours a week during tax season.  I have learned many things that I never would have if I had gotten into any of the jobs I had wanted to during school. 

I have my good days, and I have my days when I would like to throw myself off a bridge (and take my supervisors with me). I have never done an audit.  In fact, I am certain that I would be completely lost if I was ever asked to do any assurance work more strenuous than a compilation (I have done a total of 1 review, but that is it).  I know that there are many things that those at large national firms know much more than I do in many subject areas, but that doesn't mean that their experience is better or worse than mine in any way.  I wish them success in all their work.  

I just want all the students and people just getting started to know that there is more than one path into public accounting and I am sure they are all very rewarding in their own way.

As always, please excuse my spelling and grammatical errors.


tldr: Everyone out their worrying if their 3.4 GPA is good enough to get a job.  There is more to public accounting than just the big 4... some of us are perfectly happy outside of the big 4, big 10, big 100, or big anything."

39jue7,1,2015-06-12,I Feel Myself Getting Sucked Back into this Cycle,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/39jue7/i_feel_myself_getting_sucked_back_into_this_cycle/,"I was in a huge cycle for a long while, then I had a 38, 67, 58 and now a 11 day streak. This downward trend worries me. What am I gonna do? I am gonna list my reasons here and read it. 

Probably I am writing all these out of ""the relapser's remorse"", but anyway. I was a late bloomer, and I gained my sexual drive much later than my friends had theirs. They were all talking about how amazing porn is and bragged about how they masturbated daily, and as a young boy I wanted to be like my friends. I started watching porn daily, although there was a missing detail, porn was disgusting me, I didn't even have my sexual drive yet, but I was watching these objectifying spitty penis focused videos. I was not even orgasming, I was just rubbing my dick, hoping ""something"" will come out eventually. What I didn't know was by watching porn, I was delaying this even more because I was increasing my tolerance every time I had the dopamine hit. I was always a high academic achiever and was a decent student athlete. All my life seemed perfect from outside, all of the successes, a loving family, outgoing personality, but deep inside there was always the little kid who was trying to escape from his biggest insecurity: His sexuality. I am not saying I'm gay, and I'm indifferent to whom acknowledge themselves as such, but I was becoming extremely insecure about my sex life, though I had not had one yet. I wasn't even courageous enough to kiss my first love, who broke up with me because I was extremely distant from her sexually. Though she didn't say this openly, I was acting as her best buddy rather than her boyfriend. Being dumped by her got me upset, especially when combined with the fact that I was going to study abroad for 4 years in the US. In my home country, there was my parents, a more limited pornography access, and a structured life, yet when I got here, I was completely undisturbed and extremely unsuccessful at making friends, so I did what all of us here did: I gave myself to porn. I sold my soul just to feel a little bit better, just to feel a bit of a pleasure. Then in the summer I got back to my country, with a Dean's List GPA in spite of my habit, then met this girl. We clicked together, dated for a month (no sex yet), then I had to go back to US. She was extremely jealous and hard to get along with especially when you're overseas away. That fall semester was the worst semester of my life. My roommates didn't like me much (they were all random because I hadn't made real friends the year before and the fact that I was only leaving my room to get food and water didn't help). That semester was the beginning of the 6-7 month cycle from which I was able to get out only by confessing to my parents. In the winter break I and my girlfriend got together, and I was extremely happy. I had my girlfriend besides me, We've made out before which felt pleasurable at the time, and I was home! Then the time came, she was lying naked in front of me, looking at a limb dick and a frustrated guy who didn't have any knowledge about the matter at all. Deep inside I thought I was gay or asexual, and she thought she was not pretty enough to arouse me. Then I've made some research about the topic, emailed urologists trying to figure out what's going on. Eventually I was able to figure out I had PIED, combined with TMS. Yes, I may have forgot to mention until that time I always masturbated by grinding to my bed. I guess I wasn't insecure for no reason.. That fall semester, my GPA went down to 2.9 from 3.7. I had no friends. I was a 19 yr-old physically healthy dude with a limb dick. That gentleman, was my so-frequently-mentioned ""rock bottom"". After that semester, I came across Nofap thanks to my research, had a 25-day streak and when I met my gf I was able to feel the changes substantially (No sex, only foreplay). Unfortunately I was not able to get along with her because her jealousy was unbearable, nor was it manageable from
overseas, so I broke up with her. In that summer I was not able to get from my cycle, however I met a girl with whom
I sometimes exchange snapchats currently. To get out of that huge cycle, I once had a nervous break down, and confessed my parents crying. One of the worst moments of my life. That day I made them a promise, which is in danger of not being held if I maintain overconfident and keep slacking off from my Nofap journey. From that day on, I substantially reduced my porn consumption, my GPA is 3.3, this semester being 3.9. I have an internship which is directly related to my major and I have important responsibilities. I've gained great friendships, in which my friends care about me and I care about them, and love them. 

Look at my life back, I've done nothing wrong. I fulfilled all my responsibilities, have not engaged in a behavior I knew was wrong. All I did, all these years, was to watch porn, starting with only a little, not even for my own pleasure, but to feel as I belong to the environment in which all my friends were. This long-ass post, is my reason for starting this journey. As I improved my life I realized I started forgetting it. How miserable I felt back then. How I seriously weighed pros and cons of killing myself once, and how challenging was to convince myself to fight back. But that's what you do with life. If it gives you lemons, you make lemonades. If it hits you and makes you fall, you spit that blood out, smile
with your red teeth, and keep getting back up. That's what I did so far, I did not regret it yet. I am a good man, who has unknowingly did some mistakes, which became his reason to cling onto life. Because that's how winning is done. It's all about how much you can take and keep moving forward. 

From now on every time I doubt my reasons for quitting porn, I will come back and read this long post, the length of which I apologize. I will not forget my reasons. 

What is your reason? "
39jzvl,1,2015-06-12,Is attempting to force a 50/50 gender split in a workforce a good or bad idea?,gavinok,PurplePillDebate,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/39jzvl/is_attempting_to_force_a_5050_gender_split_in_a/,"In some industries and fields, there is a gender imbalance to one side. An example would be that over 90% of kindergarden teachers in the US are female.

Do you believe, that in hiring practices for such fields, a gender cap should be imposed? This is specifically what I mean.

Say in the summer, Google hires 1,500 software engineering interns. When the open up the application process, they accept applications as they normally do, regardless of gender. However, once they were to hire 750 male, or 750 female interns, they would switch to **only** hiring interns of the unfilled gender, and reject any applicant of the filled gender(the one already at 750), regardless of their credentials or experience.

Do you think overall this would be beneficial? Or in other words, do you believe that any workforce of a split 50/50 gender ratio would be superior in terms of efficiency, intellect, and organization than any workforce which **did not** possess a split 50/50 gender ratio?

If you have any specific examples, feel free to share them."

Jason and I ride BART to meet her.  We have half an hour to kill and sit outside in the bay wind with the wandering tourists and screaming gulls.  I sprawl out on the bench and sip a bagged bottle of beer while Jason perches on the back rest above me, smoking and reading mail.  


My city revels in it's architectural glory from this spot.  The bench gives us commanding views of the Bay Bridge spanning over a bumpy, jade sea.  As the sun sinks slowly in the west, the clock tower behind us begins to glow.  Somewhere within the arched Roman arcades of the Ferry Building's Great Nave, Kym is locking up her cafe.


I contemplate what marvels we can achieve with our prehensile thumbs and math as the first star of the evening grows visible through the fabric of the approaching night.  


""Check this out.  Dear Mr. Severson-"", reads Jason.


My ears perk up because I'm Mr. fucking Severson!


""We have received your dissertation on applied mechanics for the 1997 summer internship program.  Out of 300 qualified candidates, we are pleased to inform you that your application was accepted...""


I look up at Jason and grab my letter.  Course requirements include applying for internships but I never thought I’d actually qualify.  Rowan University in New Jersey…Hmm.  


Then Jason and I both jump as the backs of our skulls are simultaneously slapped with a resounding SMACK!


""What's up BITCHES?!"", taunts Kym as she hops over the bench and plops down between us with a thud. 


I slip the letter in my jacket as she shoves Jason's legs out of her way.  She growls at me and snaps her teeth before slowly moving in for a kiss.  Her face softens and she is so beautiful in the light of our disappearing sun...I move towards her lips which are slightly parted and her eyes close gently for the kiss...but she turns her head at the last moment and I kiss air. She chuckles and I smell the freshly ground coffee mixed with her scent and lunge at her neck like a starving animal.


""Jesus! "", complains Jason as he looks around and then lights a joint.  ""The Japanese tourists are staring.  You're ruining the moment!""


""Mine!"", snarls Kym grabbing the joint and sucking a huge hit.  


She passes it back to Jason and kisses a lungful of ganja into me that ends with her biting my lower lip.  


Ah Kym...I want to tell you how lost I am in your deep, sea blue eyes...How your carnivorous smile at the end of a day proves how perfect the Universe is...but instead I cough.  This weed is so fucking harsh.


""Goddamn!"", I choke and gag so hard my balls hurt.


“Hey!  You guys hungry?  Check out the haul!"", smiles Kym proudly opening up her bag.  


On Saturdays, the Great Nave of the Ferry Building is an open air farmer's market.  Anything from quail eggs and local produce to artisan cheeses and smoked venison.  At the end of the day Kym can score large amounts of gourmet food by simply handing out a cup of coffee to the right farmer.


Tonight we dine on an free range spit roasted chicken, sourdough bread, plums, minestrone soup and sodas swiped from Kym's cafe.  We watch the red glittering traffic lights sparkle and hum across the Bay Bridge.  Kym dips bread into the soup and feeds me as Jason tosses crust to the cyclone of gulls screeching for scraps.  


This is my life.  A good life.  New Jersey seems far away.  And fuck, it's New Jersey.  I look at Kym.  She holds a piece if chicken in her hand as a brave seagull hovers above her slowly flapping and descending....


""Closer..."", commands Kym.  A Japanese tourist starts snapping pictures of the girl with pink hair calling seagulls from the sky.  More birds heed the call.  


The seagull's flapping wings make all the bags, tourist maps and paper trash whirl up into the air like a twister as Kym slowly coaxes birds to her and hand feeds them chicken.


""Cannibal!” yells Jason, ""Abomination!""


Kym, bored with her power over birds tosses the last hunk high in the air.  The sky explodes in a chaos of wings, feather and bones which rain down on us as she shrieks with delight.


On the BART ride home I show Kym the letter.  She grows silent and points her face out the window away from me.  I see her huge wrap around sunglasses reflected in the train window as we shoot through the tunnel.  Halfway home she finally looks at me.


""I think you should go.  Don't you?""


""I wanted to intern in the city.  Not New Jersey...""


""But wouldn't it be good for you?""


I nod.  Yes.  Kym turns back to the window but she also holds my hand.


Jason and I smoked H before we went to the Ferry Building.  I think Kym's been taking oxy but as we near home we are all a little antsy.  Bouncy, jiggly, nervous knees and every other sentence includes how fucking cold it is.  The anxious twitchiness is coupled with endless cigarettes.  We were supposed to meet one of Jason's connects at the BART station but after an hour Jason yells ""FUCK!"" and punches the black DevL tag inked above the ticket machine.  Two BART cops walk over so we leave.  Back home the cupboards are bare.  Kym scrapes our glass straw, Jason scrapes bags.  We share the meager bounty and then Jason takes off to the park.  


Two hours later I can't concentrate on my English assignment.  And poor Kym looks absolutely miserable on the couch.  This creative writing assignment drive me nuts.  Waste of time.  


I look at my letter again.  Paid internship, dorm room and three meals a day.  I cover incidental expenses but I can use my student loan for that.  


And then reality rushes in and SLAPS me.  Boy...you're a goddamn DOPEFIEND.


An addict.  Just sitting here with my ear tuned to our porch waiting for Jason's footsteps like a fucking dog waiting for his master...and what if Jase can't score?  Highly doubtful as he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to finding smack but What if...?  The thought terrifies me.  My spine aches.  I CAN'T sit still.  There is only one way out.


I stand up and grandly announce, ""I am going to kick!""


Kym looks up with her hazy, lazy, sleepy, dopesick tired from working all day face and arches an eyebrow at me.  


""Really babe...?""


""Yes"" I vow solemnly.  


I feel better now that I have said it.  


And then...I hear his footsteps.  Boots bouncing off the wooden stairs with the chains he wraps around his waist a-jingling...


""BOOM!"", Jason cries dramatically as kicks open the door.  


He tosses a plump little bag to the couch.  Kym reaches up with one hand and snatches it out of the air.  The next bag is tossed to me and I hyperfocus on the arc as the prize sails into my open hands.  I look at Kym.


""Taper"" I mutter opening the bag.


Jason and Kym are rabbit quiet when they see me use.  But I can feel their thoughts.  When I am grouchy I believe they are smug.  When I am high I think they are sad.  Am I projecting?  Do they actually care about anything other than H?  


I stop getting REALLY high.  No more nod.  My spirit no longer bounds wildly across the threshold of sanity.  The endless poppy field is beyond me.  But life is a circle.  I start my day with Kym and end my day with Kym.  I smoke a tiny ball just to push away the cold, the pain and the sadness.  Kym smokes HUGE looping Van Gogh spirals she lighter dances across foil.  And Jason...the fucker shoots dope.  


I wish I had ECP rather than tar.  Just do little bumps.  I'm dopesick but I'm sick of tar!  I ask for ECP.


""Hmm now?  What?"" questions Jason who is clutching the kitchen chair so he doesn't slide off to the floor.  God, I never realized how fucking drugged out my roommates are.  I've been having a lot of one sided conversations lately.  


""I SAID can you get any powder?""


""Naw man.  Just tar.  Oregon Ed had some of that dragon pearl but he and Patty got busted creeping cars at the park.  So...""


I wait for him to finish but he doesn't go on.  I go in my room and find Kym on the futon with her arms lifted over her head, just serenely staring at the ceiling.


""Babe...come cuddle with me"", she smiles all sleepy, euphoric kitten-like.


I lay down and she curls into me.  Her fingers feel like tin spikes probing my fevered flesh.  My twisted and frayed spine nerves transmit pain to my shoulders and back.  My stomach is all fucked up too.  I feel ill and Kym is talking so quietly I can't hear her.  And I don't care.  She rubs my back with ice hands.  I squirm away and sit up.  Kym stares at me with her lazy lioness grin.  She has euphoria.  I have nothing.  But then I realize Kym is waiting for a response.


""Sorry.  What?""


""Internship?  When?""


I stroke her hair and her face.  Fuck, I almost feel normal doing this.  Almost.  


""A month and a half.""


""How long will you be gone babe...""


""2 months.""


""Oh"", her voice is small.  I sense melancholy but her pin point pupils staring at me make the pain seem dull and far, far away...


""Kym.  When you're at work do you ever use?""


""H?  No...nope.  Nopey, nopey, nope...""


“What do you do?""


""Oxy and X and weed babe.  Mostly oxy!"", giggles Kym.  ""Oxy makes my day fuckingA OK.  Put some oxy my bullet and take a few to chew...chew, chew, chew Mr. Magoo..."" and I lose Kym to giggling.


Oxy.


I have been taking these for fun.  Unlike the droopy, sedated pleasures of smack, these little pills bring a buzz to the party.  I score some from Ari and find about 50 - 60 mgs takes the edge off the H craving. 


But I go through them so fast.  As pills dwindle I try my best to make them last by breaking them up.  I start to avoid Kym before and after her work because she is so high it breaks my soul and resolve.  Fuck I am dopesick.  Holding her when she nods out is as good as it gets.  I find myself stealing her oxy when she passes out.  But it's just not enough.


By the end of the week I am going insane.  


Night class was a blur.  I have no idea what happened.  All I can think about is how miserable I am.  No H for 4 days and the oxy is almost out.  I have two 30 mgs in my pocket.  I keep clicking them together.  I laugh because these 2 little fuckers are SUPPOSED to last me three days.  No fucking way.  I can already feel the chills vibrating their way across the Earth to stab me one million times.  


These thoughts plague me as I cut through Capp Street towards Bay Mart to get smokes.  The prostitutes are already out but they ignore me.  This is a rough area and I keep my head down as I plow through like a good city dweller.  I pass shuttered storefronts and the foggy night air gives me violent shivers.  I sniffle and hate life.  


But why?  I don't have to put up with this.  I reach in my pocket.  No.  


But...I've been good.  Right?  Without another thought I grab both pills.  And the gods mock me.  Two pills slip apart in my grasp and shoot off in opposite directions.  I watch one bounce across pitted concrete and land near trash cans.  I chase it and send three cats scurrying.  The pill rests on a lump of gray cat food.  I rub off the wet meat and pop it.  The fishy taste gags me but I chew to release the chemical tang.  


But the other pill...I look around.  Stopping on Capp Street anywhere between 18th and 24th is just not a good idea.  People notice.  What is that mohawked freak doing?  I study the gutter.  The other pill could be in the dark water by the squished, dead pigeon.  I trace my fingers through the water trying to feel a pill.  Two women and a man across the street stare...so I stagger off feeling vaguely ill.


As I walk through Mission smoking cigarettes to kill the cat food taste I start laughing.  The laughter is like drowning as I sink into the hysteria my cackles turn to a crazed ROAR.  I hoot maniacally like a loon and start to choke.  Two women walking towards me quickly cross the street.  


And light fills my path.  It floods the earth and drives the moths and darkness away.   


A car blasting Eazy E trails me.  WHO'S KICKING ASS?  I look over and see Kym's red Acura slowing down.  She leans out the driver's window wearing my black 49er's beanie with wisps of her pink hair trailing out wildly behind her as she bounces along to the music.  Dev sits in the passenger seat.  Her head is tilted back, mouth hanging open as she stares blankly forward at god knows what.  Jason's in the backseat laid out from a fat shot.  He cynically flashes the Norte XIV westside gang sign.  The car stops and Kym reaches back and pops open the door.


This is not the best part of town for a car with 2 white suburban punks and a hippie chick blasting TOO MUCH POSSE!  They obviously just scored and Dev and Jase are staggered.  Kym probably had just enough to see sideways as she drives through one of the worst neighborhoods in San Francisco blasting NWA.  The dome light casts an eerie shadow in the empty seat.  Is that Jason's shadow sitting there?  An illusion?  I wish Dev was conscious so I could ask her.  Fuck it.  I get in the car with the shadow.  


Kym peels out and cranks the stereo to eardrum damaging levels.  There will be no talking.  She tosses her Lancôme makeup bag at me.  Jason's studded black belt is still on the seat.  I unzip the bag and see alcohol swabs, three bags of tar and a rig with half a shot left.  Her blood is still suspended in the amber liquid.  Light from traffic illuminates her wide blue eyes in the rearview mirror.  Vampiric mascara smeared over these penetrating eyes feast on my predicament.  Well?  But she knows.  She just wants to watch…I think of Jason's pet name for Kym.  The Devil's Daughter.  


Kym is like a star in deep space.  She draws you into her power, her glory and light.  But at the end of the day I chose this path.  So I wink at her and pull my arm out of my leather jacket...  


I mean for fuck’s sake it’s New Jersey…    "
39k0wa,41,2015-06-12,The Power of Heaven,morbo2000,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/39k0wa/the_power_of_heaven/,"Kym's manager is on vacation which means she’s in charge of the cafe at the Ferry Building.  Jason and I ride BART to meet her.  We have half an hour to kill and sit outside in the bay wind with the wandering tourists and screaming gulls.  I sprawl out on the bench and sip a bagged bottle of beer while Jason perches on the back rest above me, smoking and reading mail.  


My city revels in it's architectural glory from this spot.  The bench gives us commanding views of the Bay Bridge spanning over a bumpy, jade sea.  As the sun sinks slowly in the west, the clock tower behind us begins to glow.  Somewhere within the arched Roman arcades of the Ferry Building's Great Nave, Kym is locking up her cafe.


I contemplate what marvels we can achieve with our prehensile thumbs and math as the first star of the evening grows visible through the fabric of the approaching night.  


""Check this out.  Dear Mr. Severson-"", reads Jason.


My ears perk up because I'm Mr. fucking Severson!


""We have received your dissertation on applied mechanics for the 1997 summer internship program.  Out of 300 qualified candidates, we are pleased to inform you that your application was accepted...""


I look up at Jason and grab my letter.  Course requirements include applying for internships but I never thought I’d actually qualify.  Rowan University in New Jersey…Hmm.  


Then Jason and I both jump as the backs of our skulls are simultaneously slapped with a resounding SMACK!


""What's up BITCHES?!"", taunts Kym as she hops over the bench and plops down between us with a thud. 


I slip the letter in my jacket as she shoves Jason's legs out of her way.  She growls at me and snaps her teeth before slowly moving in for a kiss.  Her face softens and she is so beautiful in the light of our disappearing sun...I move towards her lips which are slightly parted and her eyes close gently for the kiss...but she turns her head at the last moment and I kiss air. She chuckles and I smell the freshly ground coffee mixed with her scent and lunge at her neck like a starving animal.


""Jesus! "", complains Jason as he looks around and then lights a joint.  ""The Japanese tourists are staring.  You're ruining the moment!""


""Mine!"", snarls Kym grabbing the joint and sucking a huge hit.  


She passes it back to Jason and kisses a lungful of ganja into me that ends with her biting my lower lip.  


Ah Kym...I want to tell you how lost I am in your deep, sea blue eyes...How your carnivorous smile at the end of a day proves how perfect the Universe is...but instead I cough.  This weed is so fucking harsh.


""Goddamn!"", I choke and gag so hard my balls hurt.


“Hey!  You guys hungry?  Check out the haul!"", smiles Kym proudly opening up her bag.  


On Saturdays, the Great Nave of the Ferry Building is an open air farmer's market.  Anything from quail eggs and local produce to artisan cheeses and smoked venison.  At the end of the day Kym can score large amounts of gourmet food by simply handing out a cup of coffee to the right farmer.


Tonight we dine on an free range spit roasted chicken, sourdough bread, plums, minestrone soup and sodas swiped from Kym's cafe.  We watch the red glittering traffic lights sparkle and hum across the Bay Bridge.  Kym dips bread into the soup and feeds me as Jason tosses crust to the cyclone of gulls screeching for scraps.  


This is my life.  A good life.  New Jersey seems far away.  And fuck, it's New Jersey.  I look at Kym.  She holds a piece if chicken in her hand as a brave seagull hovers above her slowly flapping and descending....

-YahudiConglomerate in-game (EdmundV is my br90 on VS on Emerald)
-Edmund V on g+
How old are you?
-19
Where are you from?
New York City, my family is from Baghdad
What do you do IRL
-Study sociology, political science and Russian theatrical realism, intern at an art museum
How much experience in gaming?
-I have played ARMA since it was Operation Flashpoint, Battlefield since the early days, and on Planetside 1 I played Vanu. I have been playing Planetside 2 consistently since its release.
Why did you join NCIv?
-I have largely been a lone wolf player since Planetside 2 came out, but feel I have been missing a lot in regards to team play. Emerald's VS outfits and squads are largely disorganized and zergish, and I have long admired Moukass' slick squad play on his YouTube channel.

39knc2,1,2015-06-12,Finally got my B.Sc at 27. What should I do?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/39knc2/finally_got_my_bsc_at_27_what_should_i_do/,"Hi,

It took me almost 8 years to finish university. I was mostly just not present during the first 4 years, no valid excuses, was just depressed and lost.

Anyway, finally got my shit together and graduated but of course the damage was done. My GPA is shit, my self-esteem is at an all time low. I am much behind where I should be.

That being said, I have a versatile degree in manufacturing engineering from one of the top 5 unis. in my country. I have a short - 2 months - summer internship under my belt, at a relatively prestigious multinational.  I got a few interviews through online applications, contacts. etc. but thanks to my damaged self-esteem and inexperience, those interviews were shit. I did not get any offers.

I'd like to think I have some redeeming qualities but I don't know how/if those would translate into job prospects. Now, nobody thinks they are stupid but people seem to think I am smart. I am relatively well-read for sure and they might just be confusing the two. I speak 2 foreign languages, English and German. During my internship, I felt that I was much more qualified than the people who actually had the jobs in my dept. but again, I might just be delusional.

Another problem is the mandatory military service, companies over here expect you to have completed it unless you are an exceptional candidate they'd like to grab quickly. My initial plan was to get a job and enroll in a MBA program so I wouldn't have to do the military service for at least a couple of years longer but I can't do that now because I have no job/money.
 
My short-term plan now is to go and get this military service thing done. It lasts 6 months and I'll almost be 28 when I come back.

I plan to focus on getting relevant certifications etc. when I come back while looking for a job. Even now, I can probably get some insurance sales/call center etc. type of jobs. I don't know if I should just get one of those while looking or focus on searching.

My question is this: How can I explain to potential interviewers that I am not a total moron as the 8-year-long uni. adventure implies? How can I show them that I might be a better candidate than the next? What few interviews I had, they never got particularly technical so I doubt that'll be the turning point. I know I really need to polish my social/interviewing skills a bit for sure. But what else can I do?

39ks8j,8,2015-06-12,What is the better internship project?,snared-120,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39ks8j/what_is_the_better_internship_project/,"I have two choices:

(1) Work on a dashboard. This is more web-based and I'll be my own boss, reporting to my manager each week and asking for code reviews/mentorship from my manager's subordinates. It'll be primarily writing software. (2) Work on a two-man team on another project. This is more test-related, but I'll be able to work with two other people. It's unclear whether it is more software-based or testing-based, but I think it is more testing-based. I am interested in testing but it is only secondary to writing code.

The issue is that I really want to know what it is to work with people who write code in the industry, which is something I'd benefit from with (2). With (1) this will also be true but not as frequent. The thing about (2) is that it is more testing-based, and I prefer to write code b/c that's my internship and I'd like to tell employers this is what I did in my internship... so that's more valuable to me. I'd be fore-going the working (constantly) on a team part, though, which is also personally valuable.

I value writing code, but also working in a team. And it seems like I can primarily have only one or the other during this internship as far as I know. Which one is going to be more valued by tech companies in the future?"

Because it is a Complex Samples dataset, I cannot use a simple t-test, I need to fit it as part of a regression model.  I have read linear regression is appropriate, but since it is a dichotomous outcome, shouldn't I use logistic regression?  To complicate things even more, the estimates of the percentage of respondents who smoke is different in the logisitc model, linear model, and when I just do a frequency analysis.

Can anyone help? I've asked several people at work and keep getting passed off to different people."

This morning I decided I'd show up early so I could go back home early and get more than 5 hours of sleep for once. Anyways, I show up about an hour before anyone else gets there and i see one of my manager's trucks there, forgetting that the day earlier he took an RV that was parked outside to a client in Ohio. Since that thought wasn't in my mind, I assumed he was already there working on some stuff, and that he already disarmed the security system. Now my fuck up. I walk inside, arms still full with food, my key card, my phone, and my car keys. The second I open the doors, the warning that I have to disarm the security goes off. I immediately remember that the car was left there overnight and I start putting everything down so i can go into my pockets and grab my wallet which has the security code for me written down. I remembered that I threw it on the passenger seat while buying breakfast, and I grab my car keys and i sprint to my car so i can grab my wallet. And then it hit me that I forgot my security card to get into the building and the second i turn around I hear the door click. With my phone, my key card, and my breakfast inside, alarms blaring. 20 minutes later the cops showed up and said they couldnt get me in, and then just left. Spent the next half hour sitting by the door until the other intern came to save me. 
Lesson Learned: don't come to work early."
39l8xu,87,2015-06-12,Two of of my [25f] co-workers [23f; 31f] have asked me to set them up with my boss [35m]. I said no and they won't let it go.,RedVelvetRevolver,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39l8xu/two_of_of_my_25f_coworkers_23f_31f_have_asked_me/,"I am the single staff member to a young politician. I have been friends with my boss, *Mark, for years and met him when he first ran for office. I hold my boss in the highest regard and I owe him a lot. He's been my mentor and my professional cheerleader. I have no formal training in political science, which made it extremely tough to break into a competitive field where applicants with political science degrees and relevant internships get turned away on a regular basis. But he took a chance on me and offered me the job at a time when I really needed it. 

Mark is articulate, extremely kind and good natured, and very good looking. He is single. Mark and I get along great, but our relationship is quite formal and professional and we don't discuss our private lives beyond chatting about what we did that weekend, etc. 

Mark gets a lot of attention. While most of the lawmakers we work with are older, paunchy, balding men, he stands out and more than a few of my co-workers have the hots for him. At first, people would just joke around about how he's the most eligible bachelor in these parts, but recently it's gone beyond that. 

One of my good work friend has always carried a torch for him, and a few weeks ago she asked me if I would set her up with him. I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, and she switched gears, asking me to create opportunities for her to interact with him. I conceded and let her know once that he was in the office and she could come say hi if she wanted. Big mistake. Now, she wants me to do this on a regular basis and asked me if I can bring her up/speak highly of her/mention she's single. I think that would be awkward and unprofessional, especially since Mark and I don't talk about our personal lives much. I don't even know if he's available (by single I mean unmarried) and it's none of my business whether he is or not!

Three days ago, I was walking with another co-worker when she started asking about Mark, if he's single, talking about how attractive and nice he is, etc. She said ""well you know I'm on the market, could you set me up with him?"" I told her that's not my style and his personal life is his business, but she laughed it off and said ""well I know you have to say that. Maybe you could just bring me up in conversation? Our little secret."" I was caught a little off guard that this situation was repeating itself and gave her an unenthusiastic maybe.

I don't think these women mean any harm, but they need to realize I'm his employee, not his pimp. I don't like seeing him treated like a piece of meat. I've already put my foot down about setting these women up, but I can't stop them from hovering over our office trying to catch a glimpse or make small talk with him. I know the solution is probably to get real with them and tell them they can flirt with him if they want but I'm not going to facilitate it, but I work in politics and forming strong relationships with other staff members is essential to my work. I don't want to burn any bridges, but I'm not going to treat my boss like a prize to be won. 

Do you have any advice on how to put a stop to these requests without seeming hostile or alienating my co-workers? The tricky part about this is these women will act like they're just joking sometimes, but I know they're not. I feel like if I tell them to stop, they'll say ""chill out I wasn't serious!""

TL;DR my boss is a babe and my co workers want me to help them date him. I want advice on how to tactfully tell them I'm not going to facilitate that.

I'm scared of this.

I've lived my life so far on autopilot and I don't want to do that anymore. I guess you could call it a quarterlife crisis, but we get just one life, I don't want mine to be all regret later."

The impression I am getting so far from the companies I have applied to over the past 3 weeks is that I am not experienced or good enough.

How should I go about applying and getting an internship?"
39ltv9,15,2015-06-12,LPT: Use VC firms' websites as job boards,friendlyspork,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/39ltv9/lpt_use_vc_firms_websites_as_job_boards/,"If you're looking to get a job or internship at a startup, a really easy way to do this is look on the main VC firms' websites. They want to help their portfolio companies grow so their websites show you all the open positions at each of these companies. 

It's easier than looking up individual companies one by one, and it also helps you know they're backed by solid investors (not that that's always a guarantee they'll be successful.) It's a good jumping-off point to do additional research on the companies once you find one you like.

I am an Australian engineering student who is interested in applying for an internship in France, I am probably B1 in French and since I am planning to do it in the summer, it's like Europe's winter (December-February).

Does anyone have any tips, success stories or good places to search? Ideally, I would like to have a stipend and would not consider paying for an internship."

On one hand I listen to classic rock radio stations in the Toronto area, and on the other listen to talk-shows like 102.1 the Edge, Howard Stern, .etc.

Anyways, I'm working for the summer but upon my return in September I was looking for a radio job. I have no direct experience in broadcasting but I do have some qualities:

- Great communication/presentation skills
- The classic deep, slightly raspy radio voice
- Vast knowledge of classic rock/modern rock
- Relatively computer handy, used to edit sound clips in the past and could definitely learn a soundboard, interface or program fast
- Young, charismatic, sense of humor, ""fresh""

I'm thinking of recording myself in a ""mock radio situation"" i.e find a format for a show I listen to, basically copy it with my own voice and prepare it as a ""demo"".

Any suggestions or advice?

I know most radio guys don't get ON-AIR as they say, for years and usually start behind the scenes as interns or whatever. I'm willing to do that to

Any suggestions/info appreciated!"

39lxg2,1,2015-06-12,Advice for second-year CS student with low GPA ?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/39lxg2/advice_for_secondyear_cs_student_with_low_gpa/,"I study in the top CS university in Brazil but for the first 3 semesters I did very poorly on some classes (Calculus 1 and 2, Linear Algebra and Physics 1) and had to retake both Calculus courses, even though I did well in the more programming/CS courses (Programming in C 1 and 2, Low-level programming, Logic, Algorithms and Data Structures).

The problem is, my overall GPA isn't really good (we use a different system in Brazil, I have a 5.5/10 average grade with all courses included, which is about 2.2/4.0).

I decided that next semester I'll focus a lot more, I'm reading on productivity and study habits, and am planning every day/week beforehand.

The problem is, I still have about 3 years in college but I don't think my GPA will get a lot better since I started so bad, and I want to start looking for internships in a few months.

What are some good tips for my resume to get internships, since almost all of them require my GPA ? And is there any hope in the field for people with low GPAs ?

Also, any recommendations on books or websites to improve my studying habits/college lifestyle are welcome!

ps. Sorry for my poor english."

I am currently a Software Developer Intern for a Cloud Enterprise Company and upon returning to school, I have been given a few options.

Option 1: I have been offered an intern position at a different company starting in the fall (which means I will take a semester off of school), the pay is about 20 cents less an hour than what I currently make ($20).

Although the company looks amazing on a resume (wont say which for NDA reasons idk.....just being safe)

Option 2: Stay at my current company and get a raise (maybe), take a semester off of school and go back after the fall.

Option 3: Go to other company and do weekend developer work for my current company, they have listed this option for me because they value my effort here a lot. 

I'm not sure which path would be the best, and Im having a tough time deciding. My current company knows about this job offer, they aren't mad since I am just a student.

All help is appreciated. "
39m63h,10,2015-06-12,What NOT to do as an intern,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39m63h/what_not_to_do_as_an_intern/,"After all the frantic ""am I screwed!?"" posts we get from students and interns, thought I'd share this experience since I believe it's a trap some personalities can fall into.

I'm an intern at a F500.  This summer's group is about 15 of us, and the program really tries to connect the interns and get us to do stuff, and we've mostly all become friends 4 weeks into this.  

But we have one intern, lets say ""Bob"", who really, really, **really** wants to fit in.  Bob does a lot of things right.  Bob does a lot of things wrong.

We interns go out for drinks, sometimes we run into full time staff, it's a small town.  Bob is younger than us so he can't legally buy alcohol, so Bob invested in a fake ID, which he decides to use at these bars in a small town while mentioning to everyone at other times that he's not 21.

Bob also likes to hang with some of the non-accounting interns.  To seek acceptance and prove he's one of them and not one of us, he proceeds to talk blatant shit about the accounting/finance interns and how ""annoying"" we all are and about how he's better.  

Small town, word gets around fast.  It's a week later and with the internship not even half over, he's already made enemies with the entire intern group by running his mouth in a poor effort to ""network"".  In turn, full time staff members who talk to us and know his age now know two things:

-Bob uses a fake ID to buy alcohol at one of the less than 3 bars in the town

-Bob is talking shit about interns and the finance department as a whole

Bob doesn't really have any friends anymore.  He tried really hard to be the cool kid, and failed miserably because we're not 13 anymore.  If any of you are in an internship like I am, don't overdo it.  The hard part is done, you have the internship.  Be nice to people and you'll get a good response.  "
39m8dl,8,2015-06-12,If only I could shower.,kittizenkane,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39m8dl/if_only_i_could_shower/,"All I wanted to do was go take a shower, but noooo, it is slowly filling with the neighbor's waste water. Yeah, when the neighbor showers it backs up into *my* tub. Fucking disgusting, right? I've already called maintenance about it and they've already been in twice to ""fix"" it this past week. Every few months this happens because I live in a shitty fucking apartment that I hate. I hate it. I hate everything about it. Every summer the AC breaks. Every winter the heater breaks. There is no insulation. The windows are...well, barely windows. I can be sitting on the couch and still enjoying a nice breeze, through my closed windows. Oh great. There are mice. There are ants. I hate this place.

Why do I live here? Oh, right, because my boyfriend and I were going to get an apartment together. He had strict requirements about the rent. You get what you pay for I guess. We had actually found a nice place in ""our"" (his) price range, but he waffled too long on the decision and we lost it. I didn't understand at the time. We had already agreed to move in together but he wasn't ready to pull the trigger on signing the lease. ""I just want to talk to my dad about it"" he said. Yeah, right. Why couldn't you have this life talk before you agreed to moving in with me? We found a different place. I was feeling a time crunch. It was in the price range, we needed somewhere to live. I regret it all the time, I regret saying yes to living here.

The real reason we live here? Because my boyfriend thought we were going to break up before we moved in. The real reason he was waffling on the first place? The was feeling guilty about the lies that were piling up. His lies. Before we moved he dropped the bombshell on me. This 4.0 GPA pre-med student I was dating? He had almost failed out of school and had no hope of getting into med school I guess. He was majoring in biology but had no idea what he was going to do, except maybe join the military. He's not academically stupid, he had just been depressed and unmotivated, surrounded by shitty influences, and he fucked up. He never told me for fear of judgment. Which is ridiculous. I'm an understanding person. The lies are worse, way worse, than the truth. But I forgive him. He gets accepted into the engineering school. We move in together, because we've already signed the fucking lease. He thought that he would have to drop this fucking bomb on me and that we would break up and that I would be living here alone. That's why he wanted to get a place with such cheap rent, so that after the truth came out I could afford it on my own. Why didn't you fucking come out with this before we signed a lease? Fuck, then we could have had a reasonable budget. Jeeeezus, the logic just boggles the mind.

It's not even logic. It makes no sense because I was living alone before paying significantly more in rent and doing just fine. He knew this. He had a roommate and their apartment was significantly more than this place. We could have afforded it. He just wasn't thinking. So we live in a shit apartment, because we had a fucking shit budget.

Engineering starts. He stops coming home. I feel neglected. ""I'll be home at 9."" 9 o'clock rolls around, 10, 11, 12. I fall asleep. 4am and he's slinking in the door. It's not that he's cheating. He's not, and I know this. He's pulling all-nighters at the library and any of his classmates would confirm this. But he tells me he's gonna be home at fucking 9, and I don't hear from him until he shows up hours after that. I just want a fucking text, you know? ""Hey babe, this is taking way longer than I anticipated, I don't know when I'll be home"" How fucking hard is that. I ask him to give me a heads up next time. He agrees and apologizes and ""feels bad"", but never does. It becomes a point of contention. 

Every semester he swears up and down that the next semester will be better. Next semester, next semester. I mean, it's not that he's lying per se, but it's not true. He believes it for whatever misguided reason. I get my hopes up. My hopes get crushed. Every semester is worse than the last. We spend less and less time together. At least he is excelling at engineering. This time around he truly does have a 4.0 GPA but it only does so much to improve upon his previous fuckups. He pushes himself this hard as a form of repentance. He lands an internship.

Oh, the internship. ""It'll start June 1st"" he says. I hang on to this. Yeah, sure it'll suck being apart but we'll have a few weeks of just him and I, not interruptions, no school. Hah! No...no, it starts the Monday after finals. We don't even get a fucking summer break together. We get a weekend. After his worst semester yet, we get a fucking weekend. Why? Because the other two interns wanted to start early. ""Well I can't be the only one who doesn't start now."" I mean, *you could*, let's be clear. But you won't. Another hope, crushed. The light at the end of the tunnel of a shitty semester just winked out. He'll immediately leave. I graduate from college and we don't even get to spend one fucking week together. 

The night before he leaves his friend is celebrating graduating from law school. He feels obligated to go, but I don't feel like going out. ""I'll be half an hour, I'll just have like 1 drink."" Two hours later he shows up completely drunk. I had been staying up waiting for him, but at this point I'm a) completely sober and b) upset that he's let me down again. I just go to bed. Again, the same old story...just be fucking honest with me. If you tell me you're going to be half an hour and not get drunk, I fucking believe you. But I shouldn't. I shouldn't believe anything you say.

So here I am alone in this shitty apartment. My boyfriend is off in BFE for his internship. ""I'll come visit you on the weekends!"" Guess who hasn't visited me? It's not that he doesn't love me. He is completely head over heels for me. But he's a say-er not a do-er. He tells me what I want to hear and does the opposite. I guess it's easier that way. For him at least. Meanwhile I'm sitting here in an apartment I despise because my boyfriend couldn't be honest with me and he's not even here. Well, maybe the neighbor's waste water has drained out of the shower by now."

39mdyh,163,2015-06-12,[Update] A cult [18-21 M/F] started at my church. One of them was my friend and she's starting a social media war.,goawaycult123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39mdyh/update_a_cult_1821_mf_started_at_my_church_one_of/,"Well it's been a while since I last posted and I honestly wasn't intending to post an update but it's a little therapeutic for me to get it out and maybe someone else who is dealing with a similar situation can read this and learn from it I suppose.

Previous post http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36ukv7/a_cult_1821_mf_started_at_my_church_one_of_them/

I guess a fair bit has happened since the whole social media war. The first thing that happened was that all the cult members deactivated their Facebooks within a day of the whole thing except for Joanne and Bob, whom both decided it was a terrific idea to lambaste their parents. I guess the whole ""Honor Thy Father and Mother"" part of the bible went over their heads...

Anyways, I think everyone decided to just leave them be and nobody really responded to all their crazy Facebook posts to begin with except to ask them why they had to drag a whole bunch of people into it. They were pretty much repeating ""LEAVE US ALONE, IT'S OUR DECISION TO LEAVE"" and nobody was replying so they would... post it more? It made a lot of sense. 

They all just ran off to somewhere in California living off the money Sean stole from his dad and after a while I stopped caring because they are adults and if I heard about 6 college students being stoned in some Muslim country it was whatever, until yesterday.

Hopefully none of the them Reddit because it turns out on Wednesday Flora ran away. She got in a fight with JD and when then all went out in the morning, she drove her car away and came back to us and showed up at the college ministry and apologized to everyone. 

It's all very hush hush right now because she doesn't want JD to find out she's been conversing with all of us, but apparently the 6 of them + JD's family of 5 (he was approved to leave the state?) moved to California and were living in a condo. At some point Flora came to her senses and started to feel unsafe so she left. JD and the rest of them are now trying to get her back and locked her belongings and ID in storage. They did it cause she has some sort of internship and now she doesn't have anything so she can't go to it...?

It must be really hard on her and I'm supposed to meet up with her today after work just to catch up with her. I'm thinking about giving her some of my clothes and a purse, hopefully they fit her and I probably won't bring anything up about the cult so that we can just meet up and she can feel normal again for a little bit.

A little part of me is afraid she'll just blow me off and not show up... So I'm nervously typing this on my lunch break. I really don't know what to say or do. If anyone has any advice on how to best handle this, it would be much appreciated. 

   
**tl;dr**: Flora ran away from the cult. The others are trying to get her back and have her stuff held ransom in another state. I'm going to meet up with her today after work, hopefully it turns out well. 

**Edit:** I was supposed to meet her 2 hours ago. :( I tried, friends... I really did. 

**Edit 2:** We met up! She was 4 hours late but she brought Harrison with her! I was honestly surprised and I'm not gonna lie, for a second I thought they were going to kidnap me or something. I was wondering why it was taking her so long to reply to my messages... it turns out she convinced him to leave, picked him up and drove him all the way back. We went to Denny's and had a nice chat along with my husband and another mutual church friend. It was really good to see them and they're trying to convince the others to leave. The two of them have a lot of guilt and shame about the things they've done but we'll try to support them along the way. :)"
39meq4,9,2015-06-12,Best housing solution for a 6-month internship in Tokyo,RdNetwork,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/39meq4/best_housing_solution_for_a_6month_internship_in/,"Hello /r/japanlife !

I was accepted at the N.I.I. (National Institute of Informatics) in Chiyoda, Tokyo, for a research internship from late February to late August 2016. 

Therefore, even if I already searched for information about that by myself, I'd like to hear your opinion about the best way for me to get an apartment that would be close enough to the lab and not too expensive.

I looked at the pinned post on the right, but excluding guest houses, most of those websites are fully in Japanese, which is definitely not very useful to me (even if I'm learning Japanese; I'm unfortunately not yet at that level, I guess). It seems that most expats going to Japan for such a period of  time choose those guest houses (mostly Sakura Houses or OakHouses), which seem to be good solutions, but I'm struggling to find something that would suit perfectly. Namely:

- I'd rather live in an apartment: I don't like dormitories, and I'm not a fan of shared houses (maybe you can convince me that it's the best way ; share your opinion on this too !). I know that's it is more expensive, but I thought I could find apartments that would be okay without being greatly expensive (I didn't. Minimum is about 100kY/month). I don't really mind a small surface (I mean, as long as I can live in it. That's probably like at least 9m²).
- I'd obviously like it to be not too far from the lab, but I don't mind walking. I guess a good criteria would be that if I can go to work in less than 40-45 minutes (total), I'd be fine. Not sure though if that is a surmountable amount of time in the Japanese transportation system. 


I think I look like a pain in the ass for most of you, who probably don't want to help such a demanding person, so I'll just say that I'll welcome anything that looks like a tip or a good idea, even if that means criticizing my demands (after all, I assume you are the one who know about Japan life).


Tl;dr: What is the best way to find an apartment for a 6-month internship in the center of Tokyo.

Thanks in advance ! :)"

39mq36,4,2015-06-12,Inverted VM CPU response - two processes run 27% quicker than a single one. (x-post /r/virtualization/),bunabhucan,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/39mq36/inverted_vm_cpu_response_two_processes_run_27/,"tl;dr On vmware virtual machine servers, one process takes three and a half minutes, two identical ones takes two and a half minutes.

I have a horde of virtual servers and was configuring some software to multiple processes to parallelize a huge data load. Part of that process is to try to find out where the sweet spot is in terms of how many processes you can add before the CPU chokes. If one runs in 3m, two together take 4m, 3 take 7m and four take 20m then three processes per server is probably the throughput limit if you have limited hardware.

The behavior I see is:

1 process takes 3m21s - 201s

2 processes take 2m26s - 146s

Two processes running together finish in 27% less time than a single process running alone.

This makes no fucking sense unless the ""cpu"" we are seeing is constrained or set up wrong. 

The process I tested with is pure integer comparison and lookups. It generates, stores and then sorts (the same seeded list of) random numbers using lookups.  No floats, no disk access, nothing like that. The exe runs this code in a virtual machine (so a virtual host runs a virtual machine which runs an exe which runs a virtual(ception?) machine which runs my code) and gets executed at runtime. It is not at all challenging for modern processors. It repeats a hundred times for ~12m comparison for the result we see. If I run that test ten times I see slight variance on virtual hardware and almost zero variance on real hardware. I've eliminated many of the simple mistakes that might mess up the results - the test waits for the minute to tick over so they start at the same moment, that kind of thing.

I tested running one session on a 3.4 GHz desktop PC and saw the same process finish in 1m39s or 99s. The cpu never hit 24% utilization.

By that metric, the virtual servers are ""seeing"" a 2.3Ghz cpu with two sessions and a 1.7Ghz cpu with one session.

I know very little about virtualization hardware and configuration parameters. I spoke to the folks who run these servers and there was some mumbling about software versus hardware CPU virtualization. They ""pinned"" two CPU cores to one server but the test results didn't change.

In case my test was not representative of the actual data extraction I am attempting I tried two identical data extracts. I saw roughly the same thing. 4 sessions on 4 servers (one per VM) and 4 sessions on 2 servers (2 per VM.)

1+1+1+1 - 68m 61m 78m 85m - average of 73m

2+2 - 76m 71m 55m 56m - average of 64m

This is about what I would expect. The code being run reads data from disk, processes it horribly inefficiently and writes it out to disk in an xml type format. Slowly. My test only simulates the horribly inefficient processing part. I have no control over virtualception or the horribly inefficient procession portions.

My hunch is that the single session running on the ""dual core Xeon"" server is not taxing the CPU enough to trigger the ""yo, server no longer idle, get busy!"" flag and so it is being run by the intern CPU who is overworked serving too many ""idle"" virtual machines. Two sessions are enough for the intern CPU to let her tell Mr. Hypervisor who rouses some employee CPUs and get them out of the break room.

Questions:

Has anyone seen this type of problem before?

Are there standardized tools to ""exercise"" a CPU at some level of activity - X integer operations per second - rather than just try to peg the CPU? (I could come up with a level of activity that gets my desktop to 23% and repeat on the server.) 

What is the language of your people for this CPU virtualization and is there a faq or overview or introduction somewhere?

My product manager has lots of low level programming experience and understands how the computer works fundamentally. I feel like the stuff I have learned in school has somehow vanished. Like, there should be a so called ""fundamentals jar"" in my head of really important software concepts but I just don't think I have it.

I have taken most of the intense computer science courses such as operating systems, computer graphics, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, object-oriented programming, and have learned how to use java in eclipse. I understand the basics of a cpu, memory management, system resources. I also understand basics of html and css. I feel very very weak though in the sense that I would have to relook aat a wikipedia page of these concepts if I were to have a discussion in them.

Anyways, is there a book that you think would help cure my self-doubt? I want to be very strong with the fundamentals so that I look like an attractive candidate for future job applications. Thanks!"

39n0l7,2,2015-06-12,Internship in U.S.A. for European students?,karosas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39n0l7/internship_in_usa_for_european_students/,"Hi folks,
Some background: Me and my friend are first year Lithuanian international students in Denmark. In our college it is mandatory to take an internship after 2nd year and we got our sights set on U.S.A. (Columbus, OH most likely). And with that some questions popped up -&gt; 

* How hard it's to get an internship as non US citizen for Java/C# devs (Well 'devs' is a little exaggeration at the moment, but that's what we are focusing on right now)?
* On average how much money we should have before that for accommodation and so? We will be getting 2000 DKK (~300$)/month from our college, but I doubt that's enough?
* How frequent are paid internships in US? (Since that would make our lives easier with accommodation, etc.)

That's all, thanks for any information and sorry for probably sounding like a child with a dream, but we just decided to be really serious about this."
39naf2,1,2015-06-12,The company I was recently hired in has a policy against comments. What?,Ser_Rodrick_Cassel,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/39naf2/the_company_i_was_recently_hired_in_has_a_policy/,"I'm a new guy (and just an intern) so I'd rather not contest their coding conventions, but this one in particular goes against everything I learned in school, and I was wondering if it is common in the workplace.

two weeks after being hired at this company, when I submitted my first code for review they told me to delete all my comments. their reasoning was that my code should be readable sans comments and if it isn't redable enough that it needs to be commented it needs to be refactored in smaller methods. I am certain they used the word ""unprofessional"" to describe the practice of using comments.

I went through all the files in the project, and sure enough there is not a single line of comments (apart some auto-generated lines).

-

I was always told that commenting the code is good. I believe those would are the principal reasons

 * anyone else reading it can follow along what the code is doing.
 * encourage the programmer to write code that makes sense. being unable to write clean comments would be an indicator that the code is too messy to begin with.

I will oblige to their conventions, but I thought it was a good subject of discussion to post here. to comment or not to comment? are comments an indicator of an organized, thoughtful programmer or a messy, spaghetti lover programmer?"
39nbpi,13,2015-06-12,My thoughts on the new Lil Durk album,rapintel,hiphopheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/39nbpi/my_thoughts_on_the_new_lil_durk_album/,"This new Durk has been in the works for years, seeing as he has been on the label for years, but jail time and other backups caused delays.  The album, “Remember My Name”, was generally expected to be the biggest commercial album for a young drill artist out of Chicago since Chief Keef “Finally Rich”, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.  While Durk predicted his album to sell around 100,000 copies the first week, it only moved 27,000.  

There are some standout tracks on the album including the opening track “500 Homicides” in which the listener can hear the raw emotion and anger in Durk’s voice.  Perhaps some of the reason the song is so good is due to the lack of autotune, a decision I wish the artist made more often, and many people agree with this point.  A large part of the reason for this artist’s success stems from blending street-hardened experiences in his lyrics alongside melodic hooks into verses that are not quite raps but not singing either.  Think Future, but if he didn’t try so hard.  On this first track, Durk skips the chorus altogether, which actually works well and adds to the urgency in his lyrics and voice.  Track 3 is the single on the album and features follow Chicago artist and fellow Def Jam singer, Jeremih.  Musically, this cut stands out on the album due to its higher level of commercial appeal and catchy chorus.  The level of autotune on the song seems pretty on point.  The first verse moves along well and my only complaint is that Malcolm In The Middle reference that I’ve heard in multiple rap songs.  Jeremih adds a nice bridge before the second chorus.  The second verse starts well (“you ain’t never been to my town n****, a good place to go but the murder rate is so ridiculous”).  As the verse moves along, it seems a little lazy, especially near the end.  Further, some of the lyrics are rather simple (“I’m a boss, Hugo…  I got them pissed, I’m the shit”).  Overall, I think the song is good: the feature helps quite a bit. Durk does a nice job of blending Chicago, romance, cockiness, and money.  Violence is noticeably absent in the song, which perhaps adds to its marketability, but you can hear about violence on almost every other track.  That being said, I do not know if this is the best idea for a single, because while it was clearly manufactured by the label, the course itself contains the N word, the F word, and the word “drugs”.

Most people’s favorite song on this album is “Tryna’ Tryna’”.  It is basically a party song about trying to turn up.  Logic, another relatively new rapper on Def Jam delivers a rapid flow that is easily one of the best verses on this album (from chi city to the f****** bank, Sinatra money, I been frank).  That being said, I don’t love this song, and it isn’t as catchy to me as I feel like it wanted to be.  I think the best song on the album is “What Your Life Like”.  The content includes violence, people criticizing him, and how crazy his life is.  In addition to the brutal honesty in the lyrics, perhaps the song is so good because of Young Chop’s production.  The first line of the first verse: “you can’t turn up on them social sites thinking it’s gonna be alright”.  How he closes the track: “name my n*****’ names in a song, police match the faces, I do it for the Vine not knowing it’s building cases”.  An interesting theme throughout the songs is social media and the role it plays in the violence in the Chicago gang scene.  Essentially, Twitter and Instagram are very important ways to promote artists, and fans are curious about the lifestyles through pictures in addition to the musical content.  However, posts can be easily misinterpreted as insulting or personal when they are not meant to be.  Additionally, conflicts that used to happen behind closed doors are now out for the public to see.  I saw on an interview that Durk manages his own social media about half the time, and allows other people to do it about half the time as well.  I would really need to trust anyone writing under my name because if you post the wrong thing one time, it could cause quite a bit of conflict.  Social media is a double edged sword: it can add to popularity and help connect you with your fans or even your friends, but it can also lead to conflict.

Later in the same song, “What Your Life Like”, he references his frustration that 20 of his shows were canceled due to the violence at his shows and his lyrical content.  He describes it as “money down the drain” because he has children to feed.  At 22 years old, he has three children from two different women.  Durk’s clearly a fan of young ladies seeing as it is probably one of his top 2 subjects to rap about behind the violence.  A lot of girls think he is cute according to the various interviews I’ve listened to.  In fact, when he was at The Breakfast Club they read a rather crazy e-mail a female fan sent him discussing as she was celibate for quite awhile and saving herself for him, and also seemed a bit suicidal.  Keke Palmer, a talented and beautiful young actress discussed her rather close friendship with Durk in an interview just days before Durk’s interview at the same radio station. An intern at a radio station of a different interview (at Hot 97) got her hair done and was extremely excited and nervous for Durk’s interview.  In these interviews, he frequently cites his children as the reason he is staying away from violence.  He moved to a better part of Chicago and his mom got out of Chicago.  He says he doesn’t go back to the hood very often.  I’ve heard both schools of thought: once you get out you stay out completely so you don’t get hurt and you can help from a distance if you want, or you frequently go back to demonstrate how real you are and to give back.  However, I really respect that he is trying to better his life and focusing on music and his children to a significant degree.  In the interviews, he frequently references a tragedy involving a four-year-old getting shot in the head and surviving, and how he doesn’t want this to happen to his children or any children.  Yet, he does have a song on his album called Amber Alert, which is the child abduction emergency signal, so it seems like a hypocritical song.  While the content is about adults and the song itself is OK, I think the title of the song leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The other tracks on the album are not terrible but they’re not particularly memorable or good.  There is no breakout song like “Dis Ain’t What You Want” or “L’s Anthem”, perhaps the two most Durk-like and defining songs in his career so far.  There is not a song as catchy as “Bang Bros”.  I really feel like the album could have used some giant features from people like Rick Ross, Meek Mill, or French Montana.  Some artists he wants to work with include Eminem, Drake, and Future.  If he had put songs like “Don’t I” as well as “Purge” on the album, which are recent but not on his latest mixtape, the album would have been much stronger.  Further, if he had put one of those features I just named on either of those two songs, I think the songs would have done really well.  The album could have used more Young Chop.  Overall, it was too short of an album, with only 10 songs on the regular version and 12 on the deluxe. Overall, I would give this album a “B”, and it is worth a listen, but perhaps even better would be watching the music videos of all the songs I mentioned.

While Chief Keef’s debut album and music in general is more demonic and he doesn’t seem to care about much, Durk seems like a war general making calculated statements to his enemies and fans alike.  In interviews, Keef’s aloof presence makes him seem young and rather unmarketable whereas Durk’s rather well-spoken and seems very likable, as likable as the criminal that frequently raps about hurting other people could be.  Therefore, even though he sold less albums, I doubt he gets dropped and I could see a second studio album doing very well, packed full of features, with better writing and production based on what he learned from this first album.  With his three children only being a few years old, his father getting home from prison in a few years (apparently a well-known drug dealer), Durk has a lot of personal things to look forward to.  But with his manager recently being murdered, and having lost between 20 and 30 friends due to violence over the years, danger lurks around every corner.  Perhaps that is another reason why he is called Durk.  Other than lean, he does not really drink or smoke because he prefers to be aware of what’s going on around him.  He seems very cognizant in interviews and rather sober on his songs.  As long as he continues to tour, creates gritty music videos, releases mixtapes, and stays relevant through social media and the guest features, while also avoiding violence and criminal charges, but staying loyal to his fans and friends, I could see him having continued success and growing as an artist.  It’s a lot of responsibility, but if anyone has proved they could do it, it is Lil Durk.

I have a crippling case of analysis paralysis. Like an idiot, I am trying to figure out what to specialize in before even starting college, because I want to work hard towards becoming a distinguished “good” engineer and I am afraid of spending time learning skills that will potentially not be applicable in my actual career . I’m interested in distributed systems, and I want to start studying up on the subject and coding cool projects like a chat application, but I paralyzed by my fear of the repercussions of dedicating my career to one  specific area. I am afraid that I will not be able to find internships in distributed systems, and therefore fail to find work as a distributed systems engineer after college. At this point I would be left with strong CS fundamentals and a potentially employable knowledge of systems programming in a market that primarily is moving towards web and mobile dev.  In this unfortunate scenario, would I be unable to find work at somewhat decent companies as a software engineer? By this I mean interesting work as a software engineer, not making crud apps all day. Excuse any pretentious vibes that may be coming from this post, I am not trying to offend anyone, I’m just worried. If you must downvote this post, go ahead, but at least have the decency to give me a reason, so I can resolve it and eventually get help.

edit: I am not completely new to programming. I do have a bit of experience in web dev."

This is all very new to me, could you help?",justd0oingit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39nmu7/22yo_lower_income_kid_now_making_65k_has_25k_in/,"Hello reddit! Long time lurker here! As the title states, I'm a 22yo kid from humble beginnings who busted their behind in college and landed a pretty nice job, which I'm grateful for. Coming from a family of blue collar workers and paycheck to paycheck living, a lot in the world personal finance was foreign to me and I wasn't told much besides ""go to school and get a good job"". Thus, here I am! I've really read some amazing, life changing stuff on here in regards to budgeting and saving from some of you so I'd love to get some opinions on my own personal financial situation (whether it be me not saving enough here or spending too much there) and how to go forward with my current situation.

**So here it goes, my financial breakdown:**

* Salary - $65,000

I also will be receiving two bonuses, have an old 401k, and I also have some cash:

* Signing Bonus - $5,000
* EOY Bonus - 9 to 10% of salary
* Cash on hand - $6,667.08
* Old internship 401k - $2,006.57 (I no longer work there and I have **no** idea what to do with it)

My current debt is as follows:

* Student Loans (Stafford) - $25,032.56 
* CC1 - $2089.77 @ 11.99%
* CC2 - $571.20 @ 22.99%

As far as budgeting goes:

* I'll be paid $2,708.34 twice monthly ($1,929.53 after taxes according to ADP) for an estimated $3859.05 in monthly take home pay
* I plan to contribute 2% of my income to get the 8% match offered by my employer, bringing my total monthly take home pay to $3781.87
* Cellphone, Netflix, Xbox Live, &amp; Gym expenses are $65.00, $17.30, $32.46, $10.65 respectively. These are the only monthly payment services I have
* Currently I plan on paying $1,020/month for rent. Unfortunately the complex I'm looking at also requires a monthly fee of $130 for valet trash, high-speed internet, and DirectTV cable
* I also want to put $450 monthly into an emergency fund

In the end that leaves me with $2,056.46 monthly in left over income. Now, I'm more of a macro-budgeting type of guy so I don't plan on budgeting all of that out for food, movies, dates, etc. *but*, I do know I want to save more than I already plan and leave the remainder to live off of. I'm just not sure how much.

The last factor in regards to my financials is a car. My job assignment will require me to move far from where I currently am and my current vehicle (bought used 5-6 years ago for $5,000 cash) is in no shape to make the drive. For that reason I plan on leaving the vehicle at home to be used by younger siblings once a mechanic gets it up to shape, they'll need it. 

As far as a replacement goes, this is the one area where I *really* want to treat myself (and have something nice to drive for once!). The exact car I'm looking at is about 29k and estimated to be 31k total after taxes and fees. Assuming I put $5,000 down I would need to get a 26-27k loan from a credit union I'm a member of and with a credit score of 741 I'm thinking I can get a pretty sweet rate.



Let's say I can get it financed at 2.89% (a friend got that recently) for 72 months. That would leave me with a $400.16 payment per month. I've also been quoted for $140-ish for full coverage insurance. Considering those two extra expenses monthly, I'd be left with $1,516.30 a month to live off of and hopefully save some more with. One thing I should say is that, since I'm leaving so far for home, I'd also like to have money for a holiday plane ticket to visit to family once or twice a year.

So, what do you guys think? I think that's everything.. Before considering a car, does my budget look sound? Where do I go from here or how can I improve/adjust it? Am I pushing my limits with attempting to get this car? I'm really not trying to buy another $5,000 used car but if I am doing something I may regret or pushing the limits of my finances, I'm okay with something cheaper. What *can* I afford? 

I know r/personalfinance can lean a bit on the r/frugal side of things (which I myself don't necessarily subscribe 100% to) but I am truly open to any and all opinions, viewpoints, and perspectives! 

One of my *biggest* fears, coming from where I come, is to make it this far and *still* become a slave to my own finances, bills, and debts. I want to be able to enjoy myself while also remaining secure. That is the stuff they don't teach in schools so I am grateful for anyyyy help!

This may be an odd request, but there is a chance I will soon be hired for a resnet position without much prior training or experience in the field, and I'm looking for some tips and advice from professionals in the field. I'm not sure where this would best go so if you have a suggestion for a subreddit, please comment it!  

The background is I've been working with this school's IT department as an intern for a couple years, and it so happens that residential networking staff member who takes care of the student laptops/tech issues (as opposed to faculty and staff needs) will be leaving soon for other life plans. Someone is needed to fill the void temporarily--ideally, if I fill this position, I'd like to do a good job so they keep me around instead of hiring someone with more experience.  

My own experience working as an intern in the IT department has mostly been working with standardly-imaged machines, basic troubleshooting (Google), computer set-ups, imaging/multicasting and basic network closet troubleshooting. I don't know too much about hardware, networking or tech specs. In hopes of providing the department with someone who can fill the void temporarily, I've been given minimal training by the current resnet staff member for dealing with student laptops, mostly amounting to checking for unwanted browser extensions, cleaning out Flash Player, running MalwareBytes and one or two recommended antiviruses. He also recommended some resources to keep updated on new operating systems and tech news (related to making sure the school installs/software is compatible with new operating systems).  

I plan on referencing some malware removal guides for the common layperson to build upon the basic knowledge I've been provided. Do you have resources/knowledge you can share that would be useful for a person new to this kind of job with little training? For instance, should I make a system restore point every time I work on a student's laptop (for Windows, not sure what the equivalent would be for Macs)? What is a typical day at work like and what kind of knowledge is required for the kind of issues which come up that you  have to take care of?  

**tldr; might be hired soon for a job working with student laptops I have limited experience for. Asking for guides, advice, typical workdays to help me gain a better sense of what I can learn to help me when I start.**

Thanks so much in advance for your advice!"
39o1xt,215,2015-06-12,LEc² was a disappointing event...,yallahall,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/39o1xt/lec²_was_a_disappointing_event/,"Hey guys I just attended the LEc² event in Fredericksburg VA and it wasn't great. It was so bad that I left 4 hours after the event began on day one and headed home. This will be a long post so I will provide a TL;DR in the beginning but if you want the full details please read, it won't take you that long tbh. This is also a vent post and is open to debate but I don't think many will disagree with me.


**TL;DR :** East Coast convention in VA. League tournament to be held there called L.A.S.T. There were also to be famous streamers and youtubers. The event was poorly planned, behind schedule and really had nothing to do. There were little to no booths, very poor audio quality and a overall failure of an event. My team entered to play in the L.A.S.T tourney since there was a $10k USD prize pool for the top 4 teams, we were cheated out of our spot while other teams were treated differently and when we asked why we were told pretty much tough shit.


**The Actual Full Detailed Story :**


This event all came about one day at my school, Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, PA by the president of our League of Legends club. The event was called LEc² and it was going to be a large convention in Fredericksburg VA. We got a few people who were willing to drive the 6+ hours and pay $50 for tickets plus around $200 for hotel fees and food/gas to go. But this event was also hosting a League tournament and the president and I found a team to play on.


There were 20 teams in total, and the organizer of the whole event, Matt told us we would break into 4 groups of 5 and play each team in our group twice plus one random team from another group for a total of 9 games and the winning team in each group or the team with the best record would play at the event. Each group happened to have a challenger level team in it, and then a mix of other elo teams. Frank Fang Gaming was in this, Inertia Gaming, VWS, some of the players on the rosters consisted of players actively playing in the challenger scene or retired LCS pros.


My team was called Legendary Threats and we were placed in group A along with a challenger/master level team called Dreamek, two gold level teams and a bronze/silver team, my team was diamond/plat. So we looked at this as a way to gain some experience. We wound up being 3-0 and tied for first in our group with Dreamek who when we played them beat us in a 5v5 in about 32minutes. So we move to 2nd at 3-1. There was a new game each week and we stuck to our schedule of practice and playing and we knew we could have a chance at going to this event if we could just beat Dreamek one time and play them again in a tie breaker. So before our 2nd meet up with Dreamek we prepared non stop.


Fast forward to the day of the 2nd match vs Dreamek, it is scheduled for 1pm EST we showed up as a team by 1245pm EST. All of the games were streamed on Hitbox btw since Twitch wouldn't give LEc² a subscribe button. Now before I get into how we were cheated here let me go over the rules for this tournament, oh that's right there aren't any. $25 per player to enter, so $125 per team and a cash prize of $10k and there are no official rules for this whole thing.


The only source of rules we had was from a Teamspeak meeting in the LEc²'s official event teamspeak about a week or so prior to game one of the group phase. In this meeting which required but wasn't limited to one representative from each team we discussed how the tournament was going to work and have a Q&amp;A at the end. Matt summed up the meeting and emailed it to the contact emails of the teams, I was one of my team's contact emails so if I need to provide proof later on of the email I will but in this email Matt had the only rule for attendance to games and that rule was ""The team captain MUST show up 15 minutes prior to game start time and alert the admins that his/her entire team will be here and ready to play for the match start along with being in the official teamspeak for any complications that need to be discussed."".


Okay, so now you know the extent of the rules, back to where we were, my team is in the custom game lobby with the admins at 1245pm waiting for Dreamek to show up. By 1255pm they still don't have anyone in the lobby and that's when one of the admins tells us that Dreamek was playing in another League tournament and that they dropped out of that one and that they haven't heard from them all day. So we begin to wonder if they're even going to show up, we start to get excited because if they don't show and drop out then we finish 1st in our group and get to play at the event.


At 1258pm one of their players joins and apologizes for being late but also states that he thought he would be the last one in the lobby and has no idea where his team is at. We ask the admins since there really aren't any rules what happens if they don't show past the game start time of 1pm? The admins respond with every 5minutes past the start time they lose a ban and if it reaches 15 minutes they forfeit the match. By 1pm a 2nd player for Dreamek joined the lobby, and said they are going to use their sub, by 106pm the sub joins and they lose 1 ban. 110pm comes and goes, they lose a 2nd ban and now have 5 minutes before the forfeit. A 4th player joins the lobby and it's FSN Trance, I was excited because I love Nintendude and Nien so I asked Trance about them and he told me that Nien is cool and that Nintendude is the dankest memer alive.


So after the happy chatting for a few minutes its now 115pm and we apologize to them for having to forfeit but then the admins start panicking because they need something for the stream(they only cared about the stream ever and rarely ever cared about the players). So we offered to play Dreamek in a 4v5 fun game since they have to forfeit for being past 15minutes late and not having a complete roster. The admins tell us to hang on as they go and talk to Matt, they come back a couple of minutes later and tell us this. ""For the L.A.S.T event in a 4v5 you have to play and it counts towards your record, if it was a 3v5 then you could choose to not play and just take the win.""


So we say what that this isn't fair, we shouldn't be risking a free win and plus they showed up past the allotted time of 15minutes, they should have to forfeit but since you need something on stream we will play a fun game and let them grab a 5th just so its even. The admins tell us no and force us into a 4v5. Some mistakes happen, Trance played Corki, their mid played Ziggs, they wave cleared and eventually got the best of us and we lost. Pretty pissed off we stopped practicing because now we were just going to finish 2nd place since we lost to them twice.


Two weeks go by and Dreamek loses to their random team out of our group making them 8-1 in 1st place and us 7-2 in 2nd place. I contacted Matt and said that this isn't right we should have gotten that win making us 8-1 and them 7-2, we should be the ones playing at this event and not them. Matt got back to me a couple of days later after I asked him to review their decision on our 2nd game vs Dreamek and he told me that there was a ruling and it stands.


Pretty pissed off I sent Matt a strongly worded email with some advice for him if he plans on running an event like this again. Fast forward a few weeks, school ends and I move from PA to MD to start an internship. After my first week of work on my way home on Friday ready to begin my weekend I check my phone when I get settled in around 445pm. I had an email from Matt at 427pm and it was asking if we wanted to play at the event because 2 teams that finished 1st in their groups can't go and since we had a good record we were offered a spot. I was ecstatic I responded to this email right away and told Matt we would play. It felt so right like we finally got what had been taken from us. Before I had the chance to contact my team, around 515pm Matt emailed me back and said change of plans, the team we were supposed to replace is under new management and got the team together and is now going, sorry but you are not playing at the event, but thank you for being willing to.


So now we lost our spot again. Fast forward to the actual event. I meet my 2 friends from PA there and we get a hotel for a few nights. Today starting at 10am was the event, we were pumped, my friend Kyle was cosplaying as Syndra and we couldn't wait to have some fun here and forget all about how poorly we were treated. Well going into the event check-in was from 10am to 1030am and that wasn't done until about 11am, then Sky was supposed to give a keynote at 11am which got pushed back and then so did the 1st best of 5(BO5) match between two of the 1st place teams from other groups.


We met up with the rest of our team who actually lived in VA and started discussing the event and sat down to watch game 1 of the 1st BO5. It was between Team Cave Gaming, the winners of Group D and Warriors Anonymous, the winners of Group B. WA won game one and while watching the game we saw another group of guys in jerseys called Super Nova, another team who lost in a tie breaker to Team Cave Gaming of Group D. The other group of guys we saw in jerseys were Maelstrom Gaming. Having no idea who Maelstrom is I opened up the eSportsHQ website on my phone, the official name of the company running this event and hosting LEc².


I find out that Maelstrom Gaming is from Group A, and that they replaced Dreamek with a whole new roster that had ManCloud as their mid, xPecake as their ADC and BloodWater as their support. Well knowing what these guys look like and seeing the guys in the Maelstrom jerseys and not seeing ManCloud, xPecake or BloodWater I was confused. After game 2 of the the 1st BO5 we went and asked the casters who was playing in this tournament and they told us Maelstrom and Super Nova. So Group C's winners Frank Fang Gaming couldn't come and their spot went to Super Nova some how.


We found Matt at the event or well one of my teammates from VA found him and asked him some questions. Why was Super Nova chosen over us? Matt said it's because they responded to the email before us so they got FFG's spot. Okay some bullshit right there but w/e. 2nd question, why was Dreamek allowed to completely change their roster multiple times and have 5 players come to this event and play under new management with a new team name? Matt said that only 3 of their players were changed, ManCloud, xPecake, and BloodWater. And since the other 2 were on the team from the start and they beat you guys in your group they still had rights to play at the event.


Idk how this makes you guys feel but it made my teammates and I pretty upset, we were salty and a little pissed off, we worked hard for this and got cheated so badly for no reason at all. We tried to follow what little rules their were and the admins just didn't care. So after finding this information out I didn't want to be at this event anymore, there wasn't much to do since Panels weren't open, and Smash Bros didn't start till later on. There was a few merchandise booths and some cosplay but overall there wasn't really anything to do.


So I left and went out to lunch with my 2 friends from PA, we had Chipotle and then walked around the Mall for a little while. We went back to the hotel room and watched some TV and had these biodegradable balls of water meant for plants that take 6hrs to form, we pretty much played dodge ball in our room with them it was the highlight of the event and that saddest part of all is it wasn't even at the event that this highlight happened. I waited for traffic to pass and left the hotel around 715pm and got back home to unpack, and write this post. I feel bad for my friends who traveled 6+ hours for literally nothing.


This whole event was a massive disappointment. I'm actually glad that no one from my club at school wanted to go because if they did and this turned into an event with school vans and professors coming, holy shit this would've been embarrassing on so many levels. But I do want to say thank you to Sky, and the other steamers/youtubes who were there, you guys really care about the community and tried to make this event worth it but in the end it really wasn't and I am disappointed along with many others.


If you went to this event please post here about your experience and whether or not you went back on day 2. Where did you travel from? Was it worth it? Are you also disappointed?


I was told some of the cosplay's will be posted along with my friend's Syndra cosplay to the Dignitas website in the near future so if you want to see them they should be posted within a week or so.


Thank you for listening to my venting and hopefully you're on my side about this whole thing."

Im a recent engineer graduate from Brazil (electrical engineering) who in the next fall semester is going to start a master degree in Korea, and after that I plan to go for a phd in an american university, and hopefully staying for good in 'murica working as an engineer. The reasons why I didn't just went strait to a master degree also in the US is mainly because of funding and capability to land in a good institution. To explain better, I studied in a federal university here in Brazil, but since brazilians institutions do not have a very good presence in those international rankings, I feared that my qualifications would be overlooked when in comparisons with other international students. In Korea I got offered a full scholarship plus living expenses at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), which is supposed to be a pretty good school with significant international presence, so I figured that getting a masters with good grades and of course nice publications from there would give me a better chance of landing in at least a public ivy for my phd. I have no plans at all to work in Korea, I actually studied abroad there during my undergrad and did an internship at a big korean company, and over there I was able to see the horrible life of the asian engineer, which honestly I hope I do not get to experience.

So anyway, now that I already told a little bit of my backstory, I wanted to know the opinion of /r/engineeringstudents regarding my plans and my chances of actually succeeding in it :) Any of you guys have heard of KAIST? With a high gpa and good research experience, do you think that I would have a good chance getting into a top PhD program in America? And after finishing school, do companies hire foreign PhD graduates? What is the average salary that is offered to foreign engineers in this conditions?

Another thing that I wanted to ask is regarding acreditation. Brazil is not a signatory of the washington accord, but Korea is, so both my master and phds would be from accredited institutions. Would it be possible in the future for me to become a licensed engineer ? Or ABET just care about your undergrad??

Anyway, sorry for doing a riddle cosplay asking all these questions haha Any feedback, personal experience stories, tips and comments will be highly appreciated. Thanks!

Background is somewhat important so please read.

**Background**: ""Rachel"" [38F] hired me at my current job. I absolutely adore her and consider her the best boss I've ever had. She taught me  a lot, which I consider integral in making me the person I am today. After working together for about a year, Rachel left my company to start her own, which is an in-market competitor for my current company, though they pursue clients generally not in my company's wheelhouse. I consider Rachel a mentor and borderline friend.

""Jenn"" [24F] has been my coworker for about 2 years. My company hired her after she was an intern largely because one of our employees she worked closely with quit for another job. I consider Jenn a personal friend outside of the office. We don't hang out regularly, but she and I occasionally go to movies and eat brunch together. We used to get dinner every Friday as a sort of ritual, but lately we've not been doing that quite as much. The point is that Jenn and I are close. Also, everyone at our small office (7 employees) knows we're close.

**Current situation**: Normally at our company, every employee signs a non-compete contract as part of the onboarding process. This non-compete prevents employees from leaving for a competitor and/or stealing clients in the market our HQ is in for 1 year. Apparently, according to Jenn, she is not bound by a non-compete because when she was hastily hired, she was never asked to sign one. Rachel signed a noncompete, but our owner decided not to take legal action when she started her company since while she  was a competitor she wasn't seen as a direct competitor as much as another company in our space. She was going after clients we were unlikely to pursue.

**The problem**: This morning, Jenn asked me for a reference because she was applying for a job at Rachel's company. I agreed at first, but after thinking about it, I was uncomfortable providing a good-faith reference considering that Rachel is both a competitor and former employee of my company. However, before I was able to process my feelings, I was already entrenched, as Rachel sent me a text message asking if I could talk with her office manager about an hour after Jenn asked if I would provide a reference. 

I felt bad about going back on my word since I agreed to give Jenn a reference, but as the day wore on, I was increasingly uncomfortable providing a reference for Jenn. I eventually provided what was a good, yet fair, reference--it was definitely good, but I was mostly honest about what I perceive as Jenn's deficiencies. Don't be fooled, though, it was a 90% positive reference. I believe my reference was very influential because even before we spoke, the office manager gave a couple of iterations of ""Rachel has spoken very highly of you, and it's nice to put a voice to the name.""

Well compounding matters is that last week I sent an email to Rachel expressing my displeasure at my current company. I feel like I've kind of stagnated and am not growing at my current company. I'm also worried about my advancement opportunities (or the lack thereof). I told Rachel before I sent her the email that I wanted to ask her for career advice, and she encouraged me to send the email. However, in the ensuing week I haven't gotten a response, though she was quick to send me a text asking if I would be willing to talk to her office manager in order to give a reference for Jenn. I will say that while I didn't exactly ""trash"" my current employer, I did express displeasure in the fact that I felt like I was just treading water at my current company, and asked her what she thought my value would be on the current market. For what it's worth, Rachel has said many times that she wishes she could hire me. One of the reasons I've stayed with my current company is because I got a promotion as well as two substantial raises (&gt;10% each time) in the nearly 3 years I've been here.

I'm currently upset with both Jenn and Rachel for putting me in a precarious  situation. Everyone  at my company (again it's a small shop) knows I'm close with both Jenn and Rachel. I fully expect them to hold the belief that if Jenn leaves that I will have had advance knowledge of her move. I'm worried that holding this information will reflect poorly on me within my company, considering they would expect me to have known Jenn's moves in advance of her telling anyone else. I'm also upset that Jenn gave me all of 1 hour's notice that she was using me as a reference prior to me being contacted by Rachel's office manager. To make matters worse, I recently went to a conference and one of my bosses wanted me to have a workshop next week where I'm expected to fill the rest of our company on what I learned at the conference. I feel very uncomfortable essentially training the competition since I assume Jenn is going to get the job at Rachel's company. I'm hurt that Jenn would put me in such a precarious position with my company in order to get a new job, and I'm upset that Rachel didn't have time to answer my email imploring her for advice, but she had time to promptly text me that she wanted to make sure I was going to give a prompt reference for Jenn. 

So the TL;DR of my emotions is that I feel used/betrayed by Jenn and Rachel in order for Jenn to jump ship to Rachel's company (which again is a competitor started by a former employee). I'm mad at Jenn for using me as a reference pawn, where she has everything to gain, and I have only downside. I'm mad at Rachel for not informing me of the conflict of interest presented when I sent her the email asking for career advice and also for not responding to my email in general. I've consulted a few friends and have gotten a mixed bag between ""You've just got sour grapes,"" and ""You're a good dude and they exploited you while leaving you with the shit."" So I want to ask Reddit: am I being too sensitive or am I justified in my emotions? I may calm down over the ensuing days/weeks, but as of right now, both Jenn and Rachel are dead to me.

**tl;dr**: Co-worker/friend leaving for new job to work under former boss who left to create competitor. I feel like I'm carrying all the risk with them bearing all the reward, but might be overreacting. What does Reddit thinK?"
39ozzh,18,2015-06-13,Is it viable to find work as a student in London?,takenx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39ozzh/is_it_viable_to_find_work_as_a_student_in_london/,"Hi, here is some background first. 

* I am a university student from a European country where I have attended all my courses and I only have some projects left to finish in order to get my degree (I will probably finish uni by January 2016)
* I have been in a placement since February in a company in London as a software developer (kind of through my uni but not really).

Now my contract with the company ends end of August and the company really wants to keep me but that will depend upon how successful the company is going to be in the next 2 months.

I personally want to remain in London and finish my uni degree (the last couple of projects) from here but my main issue is financial stability. I am trying to prepare for the worst (in case the company goes to shit) and I want to not remain without a job after end of August. 

**Here is my question**: Is it possible as a student to find a developer job in London? Keep in mind that I have no courses to attend or anything, also I don't care about the job title all I care is that it pays good enough to financially sustain myself so if it even was an internship, if it paid good enough I would be ok with it. My plan B would be to find a shitty student job, I just want to fully explore the possibility of having a developer job before going for a shitty student job.

**TL;DR:** I am a student that has no courses to attend but doesn't have a degree (yet) and I also have software development experience. Is it possible to find a developer position in London that pays well enough to financially sustain myself or will I have to find a shitty student job?"

39pnr8,3,2015-06-13,I [M21] just lost the love [F24] of my life after 6 months and it came out of nowhere.,Kolten_Wong,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39pnr8/i_m21_just_lost_the_love_f24_of_my_life_after_6/,"My girlfriend and I and had amazingly healthy relationship. Out of nowhere shit hit the fan. We had been together for about 6 months but had known each other for about 8. We talked every day and before I moved away for an internship, we saw each other every day. Always smiling, laughing, and having a good time. I went back to visit her for a couple of my off days from work and it was smiles as usual. Had a blast the entire time I was back and we both admitted it was painful for me to leave. Before I left though we made sure to plan out as many dates as we could that we would be able to see one another. 

About a week after this, she started getting distant, short tempered, as well as short in her responses. She just overall seemed uninterested. We talked about it and she said she didn't know what she wanted anymore. Said that since we weren't together every day now that she had some time to sit back a look at our relationship. A few days later she came back with some things that she felt were the cause of the issues. She said she needed me to be more assertive, she wanted to have more stimulating conversations, and some other very nitpicky things. I was totally caught off guard because it was just a week earlier she was almost in tears about how healthy our relationship was and how she had never been in love and loved like this before (past two boyfriends we're abusive). So I worked and worked on it and eventually went back to visit for another couple days. 

Things were kinda off but we still had a really good time. I went to a therapy session and my therapist basically said I needed to tell her how I felt and what I needed from her. So I did, and then we both ended up getting angry. She hung up and got in the shower and I out of frustration sent some texts basically breaking up with her. It turns out her biggest gripe was that we were at two different points in our lives and that we weren't that compatible even though we shared similar viewpoints on damn near everything. She also mentioned she didn't want to be the cause of making me grow up faster than I should. She said she didn't have time to wait for me to grow up. It really hit me hard that she was in love with me but wasn't willing to be there for me as a grew into a better and more mature person. It just came off as being really selfish. We had so many plans about our future and where we were headed. She's already admitted to me that she has commitment issues and warned me at the beginning of the relationship that she had a habit of doing some self sabotage on her relationships. I just want her back but at the same time I want to protect my heart.

TL;DR; I was completely blindsided by my girlfriend and I can't help but think she's running away from the commitment and sabotaging her happiness."
39pocr,40,2015-06-13,My co-worker hook-up gave me the best orgasms ever!,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/39pocr/my_coworker_hookup_gave_me_the_best_orgasms_ever/,"During my fourth year in college,studying architecture, i had a compulsory internship semester of four months. When i joined my internship, there was this guy who just joined as well, and we both reported to the same person.
For a couple of months, neither of us talked much and were actually very competitive as to who would impress our boss the most.
When we were both assigned to do the 3d model for the same project together, we finally started exchanging pleasant conversation, mostly about architecture and design. One day, he randomly asked me to go get some coffee together, and apart from some more pleasant conversation exchange, there was nothing more to report.
It wasn't until a whole month later, that he asked me to get some drinks with him.We went to a bar that is usually clouded in smoke and sat next to each other in a booth. I'm pretty sure both of us were thinking of hooking up with each other that night, as was clearly evident with him putting his arm around me, and pulling me closer and stuff. All of a sudden, we were making out, It started out pretty soft and we even laughed a little after and continued talking. 
It wasn't until an hour later, when we were making out pretty hard and i wanted to start ripping his clothes off!
We decided to leave the bar, and he invited me over to his house. 
We made out some more in the elevator, the car and finally reached his house half an hour later.
It might help to add, that i was pretty horny considering i hadn't had any sex for atleast 14 months. As soon as we go in, the making out continues and escalates quickly into him taking his clothes off. I immediately thought we'd just have fast, hard sex on his bed, and i was wet enough already to do so. He had different ideas though. 
He took off all my clothes and threw them aside. He proceeded to move me towards the bed and continued to kiss me. He slowly started kissing my neck and then moved to my breasts. He licked and kissed my nipples ever so lightly, and i couldn't help but writhe and moan in his hands. He slowly started moving towards my pussy and softly kissed my thighs.
After much teasing, he started lightly licking my pussy and would occasionally let his tongue enter. He then moved towards my clit, and started to lick and suck passionately. Having not had any clit stimulation for a while, i started to get very aroused, very fast. After only a few minutes, i came, and i moaned and grasped his hair as i did. He didn't stop licking my clit. He then started to rub my clit with his fingers and simultaneously, rubbed one of my nipples. It was a pretty cold night, so my nipples were already very hard. He constantly fingered my clit and my nipples, both almost close to being sore, while i continued to moan and writhe. I was so close to cumming, i gripped his hand and yelled out loudly ""i'm going to cum!"". I could feel so much tension on my clit and my nipples, both very sore already. I finally screamed out ""fucckkkk"" and he started to lightly lick my throbbing clit while i came furiously. I felt like i had a simultaneous clit and nipple orgasm, my whole body just lying still and feeling the depth of the most intense orgasm i've had. He then took his fully erect penis and started to stroke my pussy a few times, until he entered it. He started to thrust slowly, all while kissing my nipples lightly.
Slowly his thrusts started to become harder and faster, and i started to rub my clit again. Every thrust of his was pounding into me, and i was so wet, and so loving the fullness i felt. It looked like he was very close to cumming, and i started to rub my clit furiously. He let out a very low groan and asked if he could come on my tits. After he came, he took over rubbing my clit, and a minute later, i had a body shaking orgasm! While my clit was throbbing, he started to lightly suck it, which made it feel so much more intense! We were both so exhausted, that we kinda napped for a short while, and he drove me home later. Our last two weeks of interning, we continued to have sex in his house, and even fooled around a little at the office, twice! He left the city at the end of his internship, but we continued to sext and have phone sex/video sex for a little while. I still fantasize a lot about the night! Those three orgasms were definitely the most intense i've had so far!   "
39pofr,1,2015-06-13,I'm [17 F] confused about my ex [15 M] after the breakup.,ichigopanda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39pofr/im_17_f_confused_about_my_ex_15_m_after_the/,"So I've always been skeptical of dating guys younger than me in high school, especially since I was a senior and he was a sophomore. He (let's call him Peter) was a the friend of my original crush from junior year, and he knew I liked his friend (let's call him Jake). To be honest, Peter was not my type at all and I knew him as one of the funny sophomores because of twitter and facebook. I also heard about him a lot through my underclassmen friends, and he sounded like the class clown of the grade, but I never really paid attention until I actually meet the person.

During the summer, I started to skype with Peter everyday because of our mutual friend (let's call him Danny) and it was pretty obvious Peter liked me. Since I liked Jake, I just ignored his advances. He still kept trying, and at one point, I had to ask him if he likes me because I don't feel the same way (my friends felt so bad for him because they said he must have been really hurt), and he lied that he didn't, but I knew that he did. I asked Danny about Peter's feelings and he told me that Peter really likes me, but he's a bit skeptical to date me because I'm spending my senior year on a college campus, so I won't be at our high school so often. I wasn't mad or anything, because it was true that it would be hard to date Peter or Jake because I wouldn't see them as much in my senior year, but I always thought it's about the effort we would have to put in.

After the whole confrontation, Peter and I still remained friends and we still skyped everyday, and he still liked me. He said he would support Jake and I when the new year starts, but he would still like me. I respected his feelings and I didn't really shut him down if he made advances, because he already knows that I didn't return the feelings. When the new school year started, I felt that whatever I had with Jake disappeared because Jake didn't put in effort with me anymore unlike last year, and it seemed like I was the only one trying. Jake constantly lied to me that he was busy or that he had a lot of homework, and then Peter would tell me that Jake would be online playing League or that they didn't have a lot of homework. I guess over the summer, Jake lost feelings for me because we didn't keep in touch since he was in another country all of summer. Peter told me that Jake kept in touch with their classmates over summer, so there shouldn't be any reason why he didn't contact me.

So obviously, I started to stop visiting Jake at the bus stop and I stayed home and waited for Peter to come home so we could skype. I thought I liked Peter for sticking around, but I didn't want him to be a rebound, so I told him to please wait until all my feelings for Jake are gone and I feel absolutely nothing for him. Peter respected my feelings and he gave me time until I moved on. At one point, Peter went to visit relatives in another state and I missed him like crazy and I realized my feelings for Jake were gone. When he came back, I was so shy and I couldn't even look at Peter on skype because I was too embarrassed that I missed him like hell, but Peter saw right through me and we talked about our feelings.

We waited until we saw each other in person for him to ask me out, and during that week while we were waiting for the Friday for me to come to the high school, we were basically in puppy love. After we were officially together, we had a pretty nice relationship, but we had many many ups and downs. We fought a lot and had many disagreements, but it's not like we didn't try to fix them. We come from two different backgrounds and two different families, so our way of seeing and dealing with things really affected us. We were each other's first love, first kiss, first **real** relationship. Pretty corny, but it's true. Our relationship was like a dream come true, like something from the movies. We were young (well, we're still young) but we admitted that we felt love and not infatuation or a mere crush. 

Over time, our relationship started to crumble from our problems. At one point, his friends thought I was abusing him because my jokes were harsh or that I forced him to do my work when I told him he could do it if he wanted to, but I never asked. I only asked him one time to do my essay because I was really stressed and we fought that night, so he did it to make it up to me. I didn't like him doing my homework, but he really wanted to make me happy, so I let him. I returned the favor by making him food or comforting him (because his house is really shitty) or even physical affection (we never had sex due to our abstinence, so if anything, it was oral). And because of the house he lived in, he always brought himself down and called himself stupid and worthless, but I always tried to help him out. Of course my parents made me feel down once in a while, but I didn't need constant reassurance like him. I kind of felt tired of constantly reminding him that he's worth my time and that he's not a mistake or he's not stupid, because it would feel like I'm just a record machine. He also never wanted to do the things he wanted to do, because ""it was for me"" which would upset me because it made me feel selfish. Long story short: there was always an imbalance in our relationship because he would try to always do what I wanted or expected, while I wanted to do what he wanted or expected once in a while and he wouldn't let me. There's many more reasons to why we fight, but this was a main one.

So after 5 and a half months, he broke up with me. Oddly enough, we ended on good terms where we said that as long as we're happy, everything's good. In the end, we just wanted the other to be happy. I really wanted to be with him and he did too, but he didn't want a relationship.

After a week or two, I found out that he's talking to his ex and that he may possibly have feelings for her again and that he's calling our relationship abusive, and I knew it was his rebound because one time in the summer, he ranted to Danny and I how he never liked his ex. Also, I was in the middle of this internship for the sophomore English class (which was weird after the breakup), so Peter and his friends had to see me as a teacher and call me by my last name and I had to grade their papers and such. During that internship, his friends thought I was stalking him, when I had a legit reason to be there. Peter also started to smoke pot four weeks after our breakup, even though this boy has asthma, and he told me about it when he knows I'm not into doing stuff like that. He also ran away from home at one point and sometimes he accused me of talking shit about him when I'm just trying to figure out his feelings because it would always be mixed. If I saw him in the halls, we would look at each other, and if I tried to greet him, he would look away. Even now he's still doing that and it's been two months after the breakup.

I just question if he thought I was abusing him, or that I'm judging him, or if he agreed we're just friends, why does he keep looking at me in class and in the halls? When I try to greet him when we meet eyes, he instantly looks away and ignores me too! I'm not overthinking it either, because my friends have seen him stare at me recently. I don't think either one of us has moved on, and regardless if he's smoking or he's doing things I wouldn't like, I still like him. Yeah, people change and he's not the Peter who I initially met in the summer, and yeah he's 15, so he's going through a lot right now, but I guess I'm just wondering if there's ever a possibility we'd get back together? Even if it's not now (because I already graduated), but in the future?

Sorry if this was super long and confusing! Also, sorry if my grammar sucks.


**TL;DR**: After a nice relationship that started to fall apart after a while, my boyfriend broke up with me. The breakup was civil and nice, but the post breakup had a lot of drama. I still like him and he shows actions of liking me still, but he is really bipolar about it. He still shows he cares, and I still care too, so is there anyway for us to get back together or are we done for good?"

39q22z,1,2015-06-13,College Level Computer Programmer,[deleted],computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/39q22z/college_level_computer_programmer/,"Hey, I am currently a computer science major in a small college and I need help in navigating through internships for next summer since this one did not go as planned.

39q2gs,1,2015-06-13,Am I depressed? What do I do about this?,Athylus,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/39q2gs/am_i_depressed_what_do_i_do_about_this/,"A little anecdote will make my situation clear.

I've been studying for the past two years in something I chose without realizing the job I'd be doing later. I ended up really liking most of the classes, since it's mostly math and physics related subjects. At the start of the first year I went to every lesson and got 80%'s on my tests and all. From second period onward I stopped coming but still managed to make it through the first year. 

Now I'm in my second year, and I need 45 of 60 study points to be able to go on internship. However during the year I began smoking more and more weed, and living totally out of my circadian rhythm. It's gotten so bad that I barely go to classes anymore and even if I  manage to pass all my upcoming tests I'll have 44 points. Meaning I can't go internship and I'll have to wait probably another year.

Myself personally? I'm a bit of a loner, I like people but hanging out for too long drains my energy and it's hard for me to small talk because I don't see the point. I like sports, but haven't been kickboxing for 2 weeks since I was 'busy', mostly sitting on my ass and not studying. I wanted this internship though, and progress towards my graduation so I can start working. Right now I am 21 years old and I want to get out of the house and start working which could have been in 2 years but now it will probably be 3. 

So I want this. Yet I sabotaged myself by skipping nearly all classes and being a lazy, undisciplined person. I'm exactly doing everything I DON'T want to do. Smoking weed, procrastinating, fucking my study up, not working, etc. The list goes on. It makes me feel bad, and I like being alone. I'm at rock bottom now and I have very little hope and motivation left to do anything now... I need a little guidance. If you've read this far, I thank you."

I am currently finishing my second year of CS studies with a dream of securing an internship at Google/MS/AZ/FB (preferably in the US but that's probably impossible since I am from eastern europe) and work as a java developer 24hrs/week (will do full time during summer but I'll still have a lot of time on my hands.

My plan for compiler would to first learn F# (online tutorials + book Programming Language Concepts), (or meanwhile) go through Coursera Compilers course (https://class.coursera.org/compilers/lecture) and then start programming my actual compiler.

I am afraid that I'd not be able to finish it on time before summer ends, and this is crucial to me as I know that deadline for summer internships is around dec/jan, and I won't have any time when uni starts again (work + other hobbies + this will be a tough semester). 

If anyone else here has wrote something similar before please post how long did it take you to learn enough to write an actual working compiler, that would be really helpful :)"

39q48p,1,2015-06-13,Prestige or Practicality: Help with college admissions,CreativeLemon,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39q48p/prestige_or_practicality_help_with_college/,"I am a rising high school senior, and need some outside help making the largest financial decision of my young life: college.

I am very fortunate in two regards: firstly, my parents are very well-off and have offered to pay for my college, and secondly, I am a very good student and have plenty of options college wise.

However, as I researched and visited many different schools, I noticed that every school I'm considering fits generally into two different archetypes. Let's call them School A and School B.

**School A:**

School A is the old-money, country club, private school with an endowment in the billions, tons of prestige with employers, a huge alumni network, and worldwide renown. It has an unparalleled quality of education. I believe School A would give the best chances in the job market based on its track record.

However, School A costs $60,000-$64,000. I cannot get any kind of scholarship. My family does well enough to not get any financial aid. My parents have graciously said that they would pay for my college, but later admitted that they would not be able to handle the entirety School A's price. I would have to get a small amount of student loans to pay for School A. I know that student debt is probably the worst kind of debt to pay off, so this option is not that intriguing to me.

That takes us to **School B:**

School B is still a decent school. You may have heard of it, maybe not. It has solid programs, well-respected alumni, and is located near a good job market. Because it less competitive than School A, I would have an easier job getting spots in programs and internships. 

And here's the catch, I could probably get a significant scholarship to School B, and go there either for free or for enough that my parents could easily pay it. That means I would have zero student debt, which would be a relief. But, to make it even better, my parents have said that if I get a full ride to School B, they will gift me all of the money that they have saved over the years for my college tuition. About $80K.

So here's the picture. I could graduate from School A in the hole with a decent amount of debt, but also with the limitless potential and connections that a degree of School A affords, or I could graduate from School B with not only zero debt, but with nearly six figures in the bank from the start.

My question for you guys is: what should I pick? Do the opportunities, connections, and potential for later earnings at School A outweigh the *huge* financial head start I would have coming out of School B? Am I crazy for even considering School A? What should I do!?!?

And I lastly, I know I may come across as the typical clueless, affluent kid, and I know I am ***extremely*** lucky to have the opportunities that I have. But I've never faced a decision like this before and I fear that my naivety will lead to the wrong choice. I could really use some guidance.

Thanks for your help! "
39q5gh,10,2015-06-13,"Me [20 F] with my bf [21 M] of 3.5 years just blindsided broke up because he ""fell out of love with me"".",wavingasiancat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39q5gh/me_20_f_with_my_bf_21_m_of_35_years_just/,"We were known as the couple that could.  We were that couple where everyone wanted to have a relationship as good as ours.  We never fought because we also talked things out and were rational; but we had a passionate relationship overall.  We started dating in high school and even though we went to colleges that were 2 hrs apart, we made it work for the last three years.  We were both super busy - we both had a ton of extracurriculars and just visiting the other meant the weekend, aka 2 of 7 days, was gone productivity wise.  But we loved each other so much that we always said it was worth it and we'd never consider not doing this.

The last three weeks or so I felt like he was avoiding me.  He didn't text back as much, maybe only 10 times a day.  Even when we texted/talked, we never really ""talked"" like we had just a month earlier.  I thought he was just tired from his new internship; two weeks ago, he complained to me that I was avoiding him but I was just tired and way more busy during the day because I was at work.  I didn't bring it up because I thought it was the same as that.  We saw each other 3 times during this period- once a week.  One of those times I helped him move out so it wasn't even really a date.

Last night he picked me up from work.  We had planned that I would stay over the weekend.  But that morning he said he wanted to stop by my house first, and sat me down on my bed and said ""I still really like you- but I don't love you anymore.  I've tried, but I can't"".  I asked if he thought we should take a break and come back in a week- no; if we should work on it together - no; how long he'd been feeling this way- the last couple of weeks; did he think he could fall back in love with me?-no.  I told him I felt it but thought it was exhaustion. He confessed he tried hiding it but I knew him too well- even got the time when he started  doubting right. He wanted a clean break, and just like that, we were done.  

I'm mad about a couple things, namely that he didn't communicate it to me so I could be warned/worked on it with him, and also that I don't see that effort.  He never tried to see me more often-no difficult right now to just see each other after work since I've moved home for the summer.  He didn't try to change up our two dates (not counting moving out).  He was more distant.  It seemed more like he tried doing the same things as usual/ignoring it, and then just gave up.  Part of me feels like he let his tiring job get to him and he didn't really try at all. He said it himself, I was the perfect girlfriend for him. But in three weeks, three weeks compared to 3.5 years, and he decided it was over.  


He let me keep making plans for our summer too. We had just a month ago- literally one week before he started his job- talked about doing the long bike trail on the Cape together. We were gonna party hard for my 21st bday (which is in a week. He broke up with me one week before my 21st bday.). And he let me keep thinking that everything we had talked about- the summer, moving in together, getting married- was still going to happen in the future. Even our last date, this past Sunday, he said, ""Well regardless of what you plan for your birthday, know that I have that weekend reserved for you"".  Later I found out that he texted my friend the next day and asked her to make sure I had a really good birthday party. So that Sunday he already decided to break up with me. It breaks my heart to think that he waited another 5 days to actually do the deed.  It just breaks my heart in general.


But I'm so sad.  So so sad. He was a great boyfriend. My first serious one, the one I gave my first everything to-kisses to sex.  He was so thoughtful to me and he made me feel beautiful and he was always there when I needed him.  He accepted my very weird and clumsy self and loved it. And I just can't believe it only took three weeks for him to lose that love.


I don't know where to go from here. I don't even really know who I am; I know me myself as a person, but I've spent every day thinking about him for the past three and a half years, sacrificed so much time to go visit him, let him and me become the same person, thought of him as my other half (""the one"" if you will.  He was my best friend, the closest I've ever been to anyone and the only person who knows EVERYTHING about me.  Not to be cliche, but I lost my boyfriend and my best friend, and so suddenly too.  I'm shocked and I'm numb and I'm heartbroken.  I simultaneously can and can't make sense of what happened.  I can and can't accept that this is over.


**tl;dr**: Despite our perfect relationship, 21M bf broke up with 20F me because he fell out of love with me. I don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated."
39q5uk,1,2015-06-13,Best use of internship money in college?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39q5uk/best_use_of_internship_money_in_college/,"Just finished my first year of college, and this summer I have high paying tech internship in SF. I’ve already budgeted out this upcoming school year of my expected income and expenses (costs are extremely low due to scholarships and a little help from my parents). I’m expecting to have $1500-$3000 left over after everything is paid for (rent, tuition, books, food, everything. Also don’t have a car).

I’ve been able to accelerate my degree plan so that in three years I’ll graduate with a bachelors and master’s degree. I’ll be graduating with no debt, and in my field of study likely with a high starting salary at my first job. I realize I’m in an extremely fortunate situation, and I want to take as much advantage of it as I can and not squander it.

So what’s the best use of this money? Invest it in stocks and bonds, put it in a savings account? Upgrade my laptop and such to be more productive? I’ve taken accounting, finance, and economics classes so I mostly understand the gist of the options available to me but I’m not sure which course of action I should take.

On a side note, what's the best way to deal with California taxes, and is there any way to recoup any of it? I'm still a dependent of my parents.

Thanks in advance!!

A little background on me and what I've down so far: I am 5'3"" and at the beginning of march I weighed around 150. During this time I started dealing with a tight IT band/knee issues so exercise was hard. I mostly just kept myself to around ~1000 calories per day and by the end of march I was around 142, which I've maintained since I had to move across the country for an internship. I'm settled in and ready to get started on some real work. I just bought a fancy new scale and learned that I am currently 142 lbs, 24.8 BMI, 26.0% BF, and 35% muscle mass. Now I know that my BMI is on the high side of normal, but from what I can tell my BF is average and my muscle is above average. (I also have big boobs for a small person. 36DD. Not sure if this would affect my stats. That might be a dumb question).

My goal in all of this is to lose a little more of the excess fat, maybe get down to 22% BF or so, while not losing any muscle, before I start to try to build muscle. I plan to eat at a deficit based on what IIFYM tells me, watch my macros, and work out (I do lots of yoga to help with my knee) 4-5 times a week. So I guess my question is does that seem reasonable? 

I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing so any advice or critique is welcome. Please feel free to ask questions if I forgot to add something in here. Thanks for the help!"

No one in my family or family friends circle has ever gone to college. I knew nothing about it going in, and just learned as I went along (costing me a few extra semesters). 

I am now in the same boat with graduate school. I have talked to a few professors about getting a masters/phd, but I feel their advice is bias (they all want me to stay and work for them) and may be outdated. I would really like to get advice from students that are currently in graduate school, know people in grad school, or have graduated with a graduate degree.

Here is a little bit about me:

I have an offer from a professor at my current school for an assistantship (Masters or PhD track). It would pay for my tuition and I would receive a modest allowance every month. 
Major: Mechanical Engineering 
School: A relatively small engineering focused, state, tech school (i.e. Podunk Tech). Although we are well known for our engineering program within the state.
GPA: 3.92
GRE: Just recently found out what this was. Planning on taking it before the end of the summer.
Graduation: Dec. 2015
Experience: Summer internship in local manufacturing plant. Accomplishments included doubling the output of the area I was working in. Although I was still not well received there (I was not invited back), I was more of a book worm at that point and did not know how to navigate the industries social landscape well. I am now currently doing research at a national lab on a fellowship for the summer.
Extracurricular Activities: I am a member of two engineering honor societies for which I tutor other engineering students and sometimes do some community service like pick up trash around campus.


I'd like advice on any of these questions:

Given my ""about me"" information, what level of schools would likely accept me and give me funding?

How much does the schools name/prestige matter for an engineering graduate degree?

Is a graduate degree a good idea for me with so little work experience, should I get an engineering job and then come back to school in ~5 years?

Is a graduate degree in mechanical engineering, likely in vibrations, a good idea at all? 

I am interested in all concentrations of mechanical engineering. Is there a concentration with a better job security and/or earning potential than vibrations that I should be looking for?


I feel really lost when trying to lay out my life after graduation right now. The only people I have been able to get advice from are some of my current schools professors. Any advice you have on life after obtaining a bachelors in engineering is appreciated.

39qsk6,5,2015-06-13,"2 years out of of college with a BA in International Affairs, and no jobs. Considering returning for a different, more marketable degree. Don't have a clue what I'm doing.",Atylonisus,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/39qsk6/2_years_out_of_of_college_with_a_ba_in/,"Hello all. I don't even frequent this subreddit enough to know how active it is.

When I was in high school I didn't know whether I could get into a good college. When I was in college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Once I settled on a degree that seemed interesting enough to pursue a career in, I had no idea how to go about DOING that career after I graduated.

I squandered my time and resources. I was so confused by everything I was hearing, and convinced that I couldn't juggle paying for my utilities with a student job AND doing coursework AND searching for internships that I never made connections.

Take a note from my book and make the most of your time. I spent tens of thousands of dollars on a degree which has so far landed me in three separate kitchens around town, each barely above minimum wage. I feel like the biggest failure, not only because of where I am, but because of what I did or ended up NOT doing to get here.

No jobs want anything to do with me - International Affairs sounds like a cool thing to study (and it is) - but outside of government people don't know anything about what I've studied and are hesitant to trust my skill set. In conjunction with my lack of internships or any real academic references my ""career"" if we can call it that was dead ended before it began. On the flip side I could probably work in a kitchen the rest of my life doing terrible prep work and cutting my fingers off.

I'd do it over again if I knew how. But the more I read, the less I know. I'd go back to study computers. Can you get another degree? How do you even go about starting?"
39qsxp,3,2015-06-13,How should I pay my credit card this month if I won't receive my paycheck until a week after my CC bill is due?,peter178,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39qsxp/how_should_i_pay_my_credit_card_this_month_if_i/,"So I just started working my internship for the summer. I'm a college student, so I didn't start off with much money before starting work. After paying off all of my rent (my landlord made me pay all of it up front for the summer) and other expenses needed to start off the summer (which isn't cheap since I'm in D.C.), I now have a credit card bill of $2,384.46 due July 9th. I have calculated all of my projected expenses and income, and by July 9, I will only have about $1,100 in my bank account. The thing is, on July 15, I will receive a paycheck around $1500 which would allow me to pay off my credit card bill. Still, I won't have it by the time my CC bill is due. So, I've considered two options and was hoping to get advice on which would be the best for me:

1. Pay as much as I possibly can on July 9 (about $1,100) and then pay the rest once my paycheck comes in less than a week. Unfortunately, this would be the first time in my life that I wouldn't pay my CC bill in full and thus would have to deal with my APR rate. My Purchase APR is 15.99%. How exactly does this APR compound? If I pay my remaining balance off within the week, is the APR interest charge less than if I were to wait until the end of the month? Or is the APR interest simply charged on a month to month basis? 

2. The other option would be to get a payday loan. I really, really don't want to do this since they are such a risky business to get involved with. Also, I can't seem to find any payday service that will give me an amount up front of how much interest I would pay for this week loan.

Are there any other options out there? Thanks again for the help, I've never been in this situation before."

I attempted the mirror jump, but couldn't last more than 10 minutes or so without backing out. I didn't see or feel anything. I tried just focusing mentally and ""releasing attention"", but I couldn't stay concentrated for too long.
I never noticed any changes is, so I figured both attemps were failed ones.

But a few days after attempting, some weird things started happening.

Things just started going right for me.

I was waiting to hear back from a job that hadn't contacted me in two weeks to offer a position, who suddenly did the next day. Not to mention, I was so desperate to move to New York with no opportunity to do so, only to randomly come across this amazing, ideal internship set in NY that lasts a year long and would be perfect in my situation. I haven't finished my final interview yet, but I've always been fantastic with phone interviews and I expect to do well and move there for the internship at the end of the summer.

Everything just randomly fell into place out of nowhere and I'm wondering if I may have jumped accidentally. I had all these ideas in mind (getting more money, moving to the city etc.) but I didn't think they would happen simply because I wasn't concentrating enough.

On the other hand, my close friend who was kind of being distant in the past, has now become like 10X as distant. However, I feel like this might be the universe preparing me for leaving in a few months by distancing myself from her so that it's not too painful.

I haven't noticed any other changes."
39re1b,346,2015-06-13,"I saw myself in the condo across the street, and I killed myself.",WayneTheDeuceman,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/39re1b/i_saw_myself_in_the_condo_across_the_street_and_i/,"So, I bought a condo a little over two weeks ago. I won't go into detail on the price. Apparently that's not very couth. But I'll tell you this much, it was a really good price. Downtown location, with some of the best restaurants and theaters just a stone's throw away. Or rather, a stone's drop from 32 floors up. It's a lavish one bedroom with a big patio and floor to ceiling windows that look out directly to the condos across the street. Even at the amazing price I nabbed it at, it's still a little expensive for me. But I'd wanted to live in a place like this since I was a little kid. And now I could finally afford it (kinda'). 

I was ecstatic to move in, and the first few weeks were like living in a Christopher Nolan movie. Waking up everyday to a huge, beautiful cityscape just behind my blinds. I would get dressed (everything seems cooler when you're in a nice 3-piece suit), get a cup of gourmet coffee (I just got a Keurig as a flat-warming gift) and just watch the city begin to wake up from my windows. You see people in movies do it, and it seems like such a bold yet boring thing to do. But, when you feel like you're on top of the world, sometimes you just like to appreciate the view. Worth every penny of debt. At least, that's how I felt at first. But, it wasn't long before something very odd spoiled everything I love about this place. 

Just last night, I fell asleep on the couch playing video games and being generally unproductive. I woke up around 3 or so in the morning, hunched over and the controller dropped at my feet. I was snapped awake by a cold chill that drifted over me like a phantom. I shivered and sat up, wiping the gunk out of the corners of my mouth. The cold felt like fingers creeping under my skin, and it shocked me into full awareness. 

I got up, in my underwear and t-shirt. No suit at 3 in the morning. I tried to shake the feeling off. The feeling like I was being watched or someone was stepping over my grave. I went to the kitchen and nuked a cup of milk and reached for my chocolate mix. I noticed the lights in the condo straight across the street flicker on. I glanced over, and saw a man closing his front door. I went back to what I was doing and just focused on my hot chocolate. 

I stirred my glass and started to take a slow and cautious sip as I approached my giant windows. I stared across the street and watched my neighbor come home late, oblivious to my attentions. I felt like Jimmy Stewart in a Hitchcock movie. Y'know, like a classy voyeur. I was just starting to convince myself I was ok when I started to get a good look at my neighbor across the way. 

I nearly choked on my drink when the man came to his window and looked out. It was me. It wasn't some guy who was the same sort of handsome, or really styled his hair and beard like mine. It was actually me. Like looking in a mirror, but 40 yards away and I wasn't wearing the same clothes. I also had a pretty disheveled head of hair and looked pretty grim.

I nearly shit a brick. I thought I was still asleep, at first. With all the creeping cold and anxiety, it made perfect sense I was having a lame nightmare. Just as I contemplated that theory, a splash of burning hot milk met the top of my foot. I jumped and spilled even more. I suppose the singing pain was clue enough that this was all real.

I didn't even care about the pain in my foot. I stood there in the small puddle of hot chocolate, pouring more from the tilted cup in my loose grip. My identical neighbor was imitating my window-watching habit, with his own depressing twist. It looked like I was crying, and I had been out in the rain, but there wasn't a drop all day. Hell, there hadn't been any rain for at least a week. He wore a wet, black leather coat. It looked nice. For just a moment, I wondered why I didn't have that same coat. The wonderment faded quickly as my doppelganger pulled a shiny black pistol from his nice leather coat. 

The other me started to heave with his intense sobs. He seemed to shout something directly at me, or maybe just at his reflection on the glass. He beat his fist against his chest as the sobbing got worse and his eyes bulged red. A word seemed to catch in his throat just as he pulled the gun up to his temple and squeezed the trigger. I watched my own brains get blown out all over the window across the street and 32 stories up. I couldn't speak and could barely breathe. I grabbed my phone to call the police, but I had no idea what I was going to tell them. Just as I pulled the phone up to dial, I glanced back across the street. The window was dark and there was no light from within. I couldn't tell if the blood was on the glass anymore, but it didn't look like it. 

I decided not to call the cops. At the very least, I'd sound mentally unwell. I'm not sure what to do, guys. I couldn't fall asleep after seeing what I saw. So, I came here, because hell if I know what to do. The sun's about to go down, and I've been glancing out of my windows every minute or two. Afraid I'll see myself again, a big gaping hole in my head and shouting like a depraved loon. What should I do, Reddit?

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Update**
Thanks for the advice, everyone. I'm still not sure what's going on across the street, but it's gotten much worse. 

I stayed up watching whatever I thought might keep me enthralled. Part of the awesome-bachelor-pad-package had to include a 55"" 4K TV, so I lined up a blu-ray watchlist and got a little drunk. After Fifth Element and a little over halfway through Inception, I had run low on my 6th Shiner and was running high on stored urine. I got up and made my way to the bathroom.

After taking a piss, I headed back into the kitchen and grabbed another Prickly Pear. I had just popped the cap off when I made the mistake of passing my gaze by the window. There was a single red light on in the window across the street. I caught a quick glimpse of two people this time. I ignored it and went right back to Inception. It was the hallway scene, and I fucking love that scene. But I sat there, and I couldn't focus on a single second of the movie. Instead, I found myself trying to use my peripherals to spy those big, dangerous windows that had been such a selling point when I was shown the place. 

Finally, I couldn't deny myself any longer, and I shot up and approached the window. I put my free hand up on the glass and leaned in to diminish the reflection and glare. There were the two dark figures, moving from one room to another in the dim light. I couldn't make out any of their exact features, but it was obvious they were a man and woman. They headed into a red-lit bedroom with a big king-sized bed and billowing white sheets. I couldn't see a ton of the room, but it didn't look anything like my apartment. Everything except for a Spider-man poster that I have. And in just about the same spot in my room. In the red light, I could see more of the couple. She had dark skin, raven hair, and a red two piece that definitely complimented her slender but supple figure. He had shoulder length hair and a stylish blue pinstripe suit. The angle she was in covered his face, and I couldn't see hers very well either. She sat him down on the bed, her back to the window. She started to slowly undress down to lingerie that could hardly be said to be clothing at all. She swayed in a slow and sexy rhythm, shaking her ass back and forth as she tossed her clothes aside. 

I had completely forgotten about the night before. Not a thought to what I had seen in that exact same condo just 24 hours ago. An ass like the one she had will kinda' do that to you. I suppose the Shiner wasn't helping any either. She started to bend over and push the lucky bastard in the suit down onto the bed gently. I took a hefty swig of the beer and leaned into the window even more, pressing my forehead against the cold glass. It looked like she either handcuffed or tied his hands to the bed frame. Some classic kinky stuff. I was not disappointed in the direction this was headed. Then, she sat back up again, and said something before getting up and walking away from the bed. The man in bed leaned his head up to watch her go, and I would've done the same if I hadn't then seen his face. It was me again. Even in the somewhat dim red light, I could immediately recognize my features. The thin eyebrows, slim jaw and cheekbones, and dark eyes. The hair was much longer, and he was clean shaved. But it was definitely me. I chugged the rest of the Shiner frantically, hoping the alcohol would just make me pass out and I could forget this moment. No such luck. 

My heart started to thump in my chest like war drums. The me across the street just laid his happy head back, rocking his feet back and forth. The sexy dark girl returned from the bathroom with something behind her back. She playfully approached and said something with a big smile. My counterpart laughed and bit at the air towards her, like a hungry wolf. The dark girl grit her teeth and without hearing it, I could tell she growled. She rounded the bed, her hands still behind her back. When her back was fully to the window, I could finally see what was in her hands. A knife. A big fucking knife. 

""Woah, what the fuck? Hey! Hey!"", I yelled in my own condo while I banged my palms on the glass. As if there was any chance the me over there could hear it. 

The dark girl swayed a little more, then started to crawl up the bed. Crawl over the other me. She still held the knife behind her back with one hand as she ran her body over mine. Sorry, over the other me. She stroked his hair with her free hand. My doppelganger smiled and leaned in to kiss her neck. She whispered something in his ear, then brought the big shiny blade out from behind her back. She yanked his head back by the hair and slid the knife across his throat. The blood poured down in a wave from one side of the neck to the other. She quickly straddled him and began to stab. And stab and stab. I couldn't see most of them, because her body was blocking a direct view. Thank fucking christ for that. But the blood. God, the blood just sprayed in every direction with each double handed thrust she made. It streaked across the walls, the furniture, the billowing white sheets. It painted thin, flickering red lines on the window. 

The sight of so much of what was pretty much my own blood, coupled with all the Shiner in my gut caused me to rush to the kitchen sink and puke. I didn't waste time to even rinse before rushing to my bedroom and grabbing my gun. Yes, I own a gun. A 1911. Another one of those things I always wanted and shouldn't have spent that much money on. I had no idea what I was going to do. I should've just called the police, like any rational person would. Instead, I bolted out of my room in my underwear and holding a loaded pistol. I looked across the street again, and there was nothing. No red light or streaks of blood. No murder scene out of a fucking HBO series involving yours truly. Just a dark and apparently empty condo. 

I sat in my own dark home, my recliner turned to the window. I had my gun in hand, thumb on the hammer. I sat like that for at least an hour after I saw that evil bitch stab me like it was getting her off. No lights coming on. No sexy dark girl cleaning blood off or tying up a bunch of trash bags. Not even a door opening and a momentary light from a hallway as she dashed out. Just motionless shadows and no sign of life. Finally, I got the nerve to turn away and put my 1911 down. I sat down at my computer and updated this thread. I'm losing sleep, guys. And I don't know if what I'm seeing is real. I really hope I'm not going crazy. I can't afford to see a shrink and pay for this place. You folks have to help me. I'm losing my shit. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I called off work today. It was raining like crazy (still is), and you could tell I wasn't the first person to call in when I spoke with the front desk girl. I knew I wasn't going to be able to focus on work today, and I had more important things to do. Like test the foundations of my sanity, for instance. I checked my 1911, put it in the holster, and put the holster on. I put my suit jacket on over the holster, buttoned it up, then pulled my raincoat on over that. I had an Irish coffee to bolster my courage and keep me on my toes. I set out from my apartment, and crossed the street in the heavy downpour. 

I approached the entrance to the tall grey building. I tilted my head back and squinted into the rain. I stared up at the 32nd floor. I didn't count them up, but I could dart my eyes right to the window straight across from mine. It was identical to every window above, beside, or below it, but I could recognize that one instantly somehow. I looked back down as I got close to the doorman. He smiled politely and opened the door.

""Hello, sir. Welcome."", he said as he held the door open. 

He didn't call me by name. And why would he? I'd never been in this building before, after all. I was relieved he didn't somehow recognize me. I half expected him to call me by my middle name and welcome me home. I just smiled back and nodded as I walked inside. I found the directory in the lobby. I looked up floor 32. I didn't know which condo it was. I couldn't just assume it would be the same number as mine, even though that unit was either vacant or unlisted. It didn't seem like I had a lot of options, and I'm not exactly a detective. I caught the elevator by myself and hit the button for 32.

The elevator up was a slow and anxious ride. The elevator car was old and vintage looking. It had brass railing and mirrors that were aged and dirty in the corners. The car shuddered to a stop on the 28th floor, and the heavy double doors creaked open. Standing there was a little old lady with a big silly hat that cast shadows on most of her face and upper body. She gave me a grin that was full of crooked or missing teeth. She waddled up beside me, pressed the number for 31, and stared towards the doors as they stammered back closed. We rode up the next 4 floors in awkward silence. Maybe just awkward for me. After all, I had a loaded gun nestled neatly under my arm. Somehow, being near an old woman made me more nervous about having a gun. As though it was way easier for me to accidentally shoot an old lady than a young person. She smelled something awful, too. Not just regular old-person-smell, or even trumped up dirty-old-person-smell. It was something new, distinct, and awful. Like a cloud of chalk in the air, mixed with burning hair. It was hard to breath in. One of many reasons I didn't strike up a conversation.

The elevator dinged at floor 31, and the odd old lady waddled back out of the elevator. She stopped once she was fully out and standing with her back to me. She turned her body to face me just as the doors started to close. I watched her smile at me with that horrible row of upper teeth protruding from her overbite.

""It's nice seeing you again, Mr.... You look much better."", she said to me as the doors shut closed right after. I didn't type it here, but she said my last name. I'd never seen the old bat in my life, but somehow she knew my name. That horrible fucking smile was the last thing I saw before the mirrored doors shut, and I was left staring at my own dumbfounded expression. I stood, frozen in confusion and at least a little fear and paranoia. The elevator rumbled to a stop again, and dinged at the 32nd floor. I hesitated a minute before slowly exiting the floor. 

I made my way down the hall, and began to get a creeping sense of familiarity. The old, boring beige wall paper. The antique, bronze light fixtures made to look like candles. The random red leather chairs down the halls, with wear and tear down their arms. It all felt like a hazy dream I'd had many times before, but always forgot soon after waking up. I walked in auto-pilot mode down the halls and to apartment 3213. The same number as my condo just across the street. I wasn't sure how I'd lead myself right there. The layout was definitely similar, but not the exact same as my floor. But here I was, like I'd been following GPS directions. 

I stared at the door for at least a full minute without moving. I was so worried about who would answer. If I'd see myself answer the door. What would I even say.

""Hey, I'm you... and I watched you die twice in horrible ways. Would you kindly cut that shit out?"" 

Yeah, I don't think that was gonna' cut it. But I pondered no longer and just manned up. I knocked on the door with just two quick knocks. 30 seconds and nothing happened. I didn't even hear anyone moving around inside. But I still waited another 30 seconds before knocking again, this time a little louder and longer. A few seconds later, the door across the hall behind me clicked open. I turned and almost gasped aloud. 

It was the sexy dark girl from the night before. Her hair was much longer, and she wore glasses now. But that was her. She smile sweetly at me, and spoke in a cute little voice.

""Can I help you?"", she asked from behind her thick glasses. 

I couldn't answer right away, but finally, I was able to speak, ""Uh, yeah... do you know who lives here?"". I motioned my head back to the door for 3213. 

""That apartment's been empty for months."", she shook her head, her raven bangs swaying back and forth. 

""Are you sure? There's not a guy living there that looks like me... like, exactly like me? Uh, my twin brother."", I asked, trying not to flip out right in front of her. 

""Nope, definitely not. I'd remember if a cute guy moved in across the hall."", she said as she giggled a little. I could see why the other me fell for the psycho bitch. Psycho gorgeous. She pulled one of her hands from out behind the door frame, and in it was a shiny little knife. My hand immediately twitched, trying to shoot to the 1911 under my jacket. I just nervously smiled instead as she continued. ""I'm actually baking some chicken right now, if you're hungry. You could call your brother. Maybe he lives on another floor?"".

""No, that's ok."", I said, trying to smile genuinely. I could feel the sweat start to gather just under my skin. I couldn't stop staring at the knife. ""I've gotta' go, actually. It was nice meeting you.""

""The pleasure was all mine!"", she called out in that adorable little voice as I turned my back to her and quickly headed back down the hall. She didn't seem to recognize me. Or she's so crazy that she'd forgotten she killed a dude that looked just like me the night before. I suspected the latter wasn't the case. 

I headed back out into the rain with more questions than answers. Went to a local coffee shop and whipped out my tablet. Just thought I should update you guys. I don't want to go back to that condo tonight, but I don't have anywhere else to go. Maybe I should get some really dark curtains or something before I head back home. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I don't feel safe in my condo anymore. Things are starting to escalate in a very strange and frightening way. Shit, let me explain.

I was feeling pretty haggard coming in from the rain earlier, and not to mention the mental roller coaster that going up there gave me. Seeing the dark girl with the knife. Inviting me into her apartment like a black widow spider luring her doomed mate. But she did look different. Her hair couldn't have grown that much in a night. And she didn't seem too thrown by seeing a guy she killed rise from the dead and knock on his own door. And what about the old lady and her horrid stench cloud. She knew my name. She said I'd looked better, or something to that effect. What the fuck did that mean? My head ached with questions and dread concerns. 

I stayed up late, mostly scouring the internet for information on the condo across the street and seeing if this sort of thing has happened to other people. Both searches came up with a whole lot of nothing. Nothing useful, anyway. I also spent about a half hour researching forms of dementia and schizophrenia. Just to be sure. I've always heard crazy people don't think they're crazy. I kept telling myself that, as though suspecting I was crazy was in some weird way affirming that I wasn't. 

It was just before 3AM when a light shimmered on from the window across the street. It was so instant that I couldn't help but glance over, and then it was too late to not stare. There I was again, slamming the front door to my other condo across the way. I had a long grey scarf and a goatee. I ran my gloved fingers through my hair in a state of frustration. I was cursing to myself over there. I knew that I shouldn't be watching myself again, but how could I not? How could you turn away from watching another you? Whether it was real or delusions of an ever fracturing mind, it didn't matter. I couldn't look away. 

The other me marched through his apartment, turning on every light as he continued to shout at himself. It looked like he was running his own name through the mud. Pounding his chest and slapping the side of this head. He started to go through his bedroom and pack things into a suitcase. That's when I started to look around his well lit condo and realize it was a lot like mine. I hadn't gotten a great look the night before, but this was definitely a different apartment tonight. Different furniture and decorations. To be specific, a lot of my furniture and decorations. It wasn't exact, but god damn it, there were a lot of striking similarities. I even recognized my Keurig in the exact same spot on the counter where I keep mine. I glanced back at mine, half expecting it not to be there. Like this son of a bitch across the street was stealing more than just my likeness. 

I turned back and the other me started to load stacks of cash from a metal briefcase to his luggage. Just as he was trying to zip the suitcase closed, my phone rang. Not just the other me's phone, but my fucking phone rang. I nearly jumped out of my own skin. I spun around and snatched it off the kitchen counter. It was an unknown number. I looked back across the street, and the other me was answering his phone. As he did, mine just connected on its own. I didn't even touch the screen. 

""Fuck."", I murmured, muffling myself as I did. 

I put a hand over the receiver end and pulled the phone slowly up to my ear. I could hear my own voice on the line, but I wasn't speaking. 

""Hello, who's this?"", the other me asked as I watched him from my window. Stopping what he was doing to take the call. 

""You know who this is."", answered a deep and raspy voice with a slavic accent. 

""Yeah... look, Demitri, I'm going to get you your money, I just need a little more..."", I pleaded before I was cut off. 

""Always with the excuses, (He said my fucking name. My actual first name). You bring me the money now."", Demitri said with a very angry tone. 

""Ok, ok. Look, I can meet you in two hours at that place on Broadway. I'll have your money then."", I offered him.

""Why not now?"", Demitri asked in a friendly manner. 

Just then, my identical neighbor's door burst open and three large men with tattoos and weapons rushed into the condo. The other me bolted like a god damn cheetah from his bedroom, across the living room, and towards the kitchen. Maybe that's where he kept his gun. Seemed like a bad place to me, especially now. Before he could make it there, one of the tattooed men took three quick shots at him with a pistol. His couch (which was exactly like my couch) erupted downy feathers into the air as the first two shots missed. The third ripped through my doppelganger's leg and he went tumbling to the floor. 

Two of the large men quickly grabbed me from off the floor and yanked my injured body up onto my knees. The third man approached slowly, talking and pulling a very large machete out from his belt. He seemed to be making some point as I panted and sweat, a muscle-bound ex-con pulling on each arm. The third man stopped talking and leaned in close to me. He stared for what seemed like a long, tense moment. Then he quickly raised the machete high and brought it down to the floor, cutting off my right arm in one swing. I could see me scream and thrash across the street as my blood sprayed all over my nice white carpet. 

The men holding me didn't flinch. Like they were at work. Before I could even register the level of atrocity playing out in front of me, the machete fucker hacked down on my other arm. This one took two strong bashes before lobbing off my other limb. I could feel my stomach wrench like Bruce Lee had been sidekicking me in the intestines for the last hour. I thought about getting my 1911 and just firing right through the window, but I couldn't move a muscle. Maybe I was just in shock, I don't know. 

I screamed and bled for a moment longer before the machete wielding fucker chopped into my neck with two sturdy whacks and my head hit the floor. It rolled a couple feet across the pretty white carpet, leaving a red trail behind it. The machete man grabbed my severed head by the hair and lifted it up to stare straight into my scared and dead eyes. He smiled with a row of regular teeth mixed with gold ones. He slowly turned his own head and the severed one to look out the window and directly across the street. At me. Right as he turned to catch my eyeline, the lights in the other condo went out. 

And just at that moment, a loud banging rapped against my door. I almost yelled, it startled me so bad. I immediately grabbed my 1911 off the coffee table and made sure it was loaded. I inched towards the door as the banging continued and started to shake my walls. My muscles began to tense the closer I got. My hands were shaking, but I was more than ready to unload a clip into a fuckhead with a machete. The banging kept getting louder and it seemed angrier. I cautiously placed the muzzle against the door and leaned in to look through the peep hole. Right as I reached my eye to the door, the banging stopped completely. I looked out and just saw a hallway. My heart rate slowed down just a little, and I opened the door to peak both ways. Not a single person.

I went back inside, locked the deadbolt, and busted out the black label bottle. I'm a few drinks in now as I finish typing this. I've got my Johnny Walker and my 1911, so at least there's that. But whatever's happening, it's starting to bleed into my condo over here. I don't know what might happen tomorrow night, but I'm not looking forward to it. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I stayed out pretty late tonight. At work, I did everything I could to keep my mind off of going home. I surfed a lot of Reddit, I tried to strike up as many bullshit conversations as I could, and I powered through the work I had. Anything to postpone the realization, that eventually I was going to have to come back to the condo. As the work day neared to a close, I started to rally a group to go drinking. On a monday night, I was just hoping for the resident alcoholics, but I managed to get a few lively souls to tag along as well.

We stayed mostly downtown, only hitting one bar on the northeast side for the first hour. Then we headed to my home turf. We went from posh little bars to loud crowded clubs. One of the interns brought a big ass bag of pot with him, and I didn't mind indulging everytime he rolled and lit a joint. 

He'd pass it to me pre-lit, with a big stupid grin and say, ""Here ya' go bro, you can have greens."". Don't mind if I do. 

We got drunk and stoned and I'm pretty sure Rick and Steve did coke in the bathroom at Bohanan's. I don't remember how it got started, but I even ended up making out with Cindy, the HR girl. Not my proudest moment, but she's kind of cute. For a solid two hours, I managed to push the whole matter of the condo out of my head. I just had a bunch of dumb, loud fun. 

But before I knew it, the bars were closing, and everyone was going their separate ways. I tried to convince Cindy to come over (not even for the sex, but just to have another person with me in the condo). She gave me a big kiss then said it was a bad idea. She got in a cab and smiled at me one more time before driving away. I wasn't too far from home, so I walked. Home. I don't even think of it like that now, but the word is familiar. 

I stepped into my building, nodding vacantly at the doorman as he greeted me. I dragged my feet through the main entrance and reception area, my head held low. I felt like a child on his way to being punished. So badly not wanting to go, but knowing I had no other choice. Dreading the inevitable is a really stressful feeling. As I entered the lobby, someone caught my eye. I looked up to see the smelly, little old lady from the day before. She was walking away at the other end of the lobby towards the elevators. 

""Hey! Hey, wait!"", I called out to her. She didn't turn around or even stop. She just kept waddling forward, her big stupid hat shaking with her awkward little steps. 

I raced after her, almost within reach just as she rounded the corner to the elevators. She was out of my sight for just a second. I turned the corner after her, but she wasn't there. Instead of running into her, I ran into a puddle of something and slipped onto my ass. Hurt like hell. I pulled my wet palms up to see what it was, and even before seeing the red, I could smell it. I was sitting in a pool of blood. It was all over my hands and clothes. I looked up and saw myself in the middle of the elevator hall. It was the me from last night, knelt down and both of my severed arms lying on the tile floor. The blood was mine, flowing out from the bloody nubs at my sides. My face was very pale and my eyes were wide. My head was tilted slightly back and my mouth was screaming, but I couldn't hear anything. I was so insanely afraid, but I still managed to start crawling backwards, away from the other me. As I did, the other me's head began to lean back even further. I saw a thin line of red appear on my neck and quickly grow into a canyon of red. Then my head simply fell backwards off my shoulders. 

I began to hasten my crawling. Just as my back hit an elevator door, I heard a *bing* sound, and the door opened behind me. I fell back inside the elevator, and immediately jumped up and pressed the Close Doors button. They closed and nothing reached in to yank me out before they did. I pressed 32 and that's when I realized my hands were clean. The blood was gone. I checked myself over and there were no big red stains on my clothes or shiny blood starting to dry on my skin. I was clean. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. 

As the elevator passed the 12th floor, it started to shake a little. It was an old building, and it wasn't the first time the elevator had the shakes. But then the lights started to flicker on and off, and that was both new and terrifying. I unbuttoned my coat a little for easier access to my pistol. That's right, I had my 1911 on me all day. After all the shit I'd seen the last few days, it seemed like a good idea. The flickering got worse, like I was back at one of the clubs from earlier that night with strobe lights assaulting me. Then the lights went out completely for a moment. It felt like a hell of a long time, but it was probably about 3 seconds. When they flickered back on, the old woman was standing right in front of me. As soon as I saw her, I could smell her. Like she appeared out of thin fucking air. I yelled in shock and immediately gagged from the stench. She just started laughing at me as the light continued to flicker us in and out of darkness. Her hiss like laugh made my skin crawl. I reached for my gun instinctively. The old lady flickered, laughing in the light for a moment before returning to the dark. When the light flickered back, the dark sexy girl was there, knife high in the air and already coming down. She was laughing too. I yelled more and opened fire. I shot three times rapidly. The muzzle flash lit the whole elevator with each shot. On the third shot, the lights stopped flickering and I was alone. There were three bullet holes in the door, but they didn't seem to go all the way through.

The door opened and I didn't even think. I just ran. I ran all the way to my apartment and quickly unlocked the door then locked it behind me. I backed away from my door, pistol still in my hand. I was sweating and could barely breath. Just as I backed into the living room, I heard a loud thud on the window behind me. I spun around, aiming my 1911 at my patio windows. There was nothing there. Not on my patio, at least. But across the street, there I was. And not just one of me, this time. There were three of me. One in every window of every room in the condo across the way. And the condo no longer looked kind of like mine, it was now an exact copy. The only thing missing was a confused and scared me, holding a pistol and staring out at myself.

The me in the bedroom was precariously standing on a chair, his neck attached to a rope, the rope attached to the ceiling fan. He stepped off the chair and his neck immediately snapped. His hands and feet started to shake and his body began to convulse. The me in the living room was being beaten to death by a man in all black with a ski-mask and a metal baseball bat. Each blow sent little clouds of red into the air, and I could see a big fucking grin through the ski-mask mouth hole. The me in the kitchen was getting ripped to damn shreds by three big dogs. Attacked by god damn dogs. *Why the fuck is this happening to me?* That's all I could think as I watched myself die three times at once. 

Then the lights in the condo across the street all went out at once. It was pitch black over there again. After a few seconds, my cell phone began to ring loudly. I never have that thing off vibrate. Before I could even pull it out of my pocket, my home phone started to ring loudly as well. Then my microwave timer began to sound. My TV and radio both turned on to very noisy programs at full volume. My alarm clock beeped piercingly from my room. The stampede of sounds began to work my eardrums over, and I felt like my head was going to split in half.

""Stop it, you mother fuckers! Leave me alone!"", I shouted, waving my gun around as though there were anyone to shoot or scare.

And right then, everything stopped. The TV and radio turned off, the phones stopped ringing, and everything else in the condo fell silent. Even I held my breath a little, making no noise, waiting for the next wave. Then, I heard the first one. A light scratching sound on the glass behind me. Then another scratch joined the first. Then another, and another. I slowly turned around, so afraid at the thought of what was on my patio and how it'd gotten there. Then I saw them. At least a dozen dead versions of me, scratching at the glass.  There was a me covered in burned flesh, and another with a metal pipe right through his chest. One of them bled from bullet holes over most of his body. Another had a huge chunk of flesh ripped from his stomach and neck, as though he'd been half eaten by something. And all of them were scratching at the windows of my patio with rolled back eyes and gaping but silent mouths. Just standing there, telling me I was soon to join them with their blank, lifeless eyes. 

I was so fucking scared out of my mind, I nearly emptied my clip at them. The only thing that stopped me, was the thought that breaking the glass would let them in. Instead, I pointed my gun and shouted at them to just go away and leave me alone. I could feel my throat start to burn, I yelled so loud and hard. And then, just like that, they were gone. It's not as though they even disappeared, they were just one. I blinked and my patio was empty. And thank god the scratching sound was gone. 

I'm at the end of my rope, Reddit. I don't know if I can keep taking this. And now I don't even know if I can leave my apartment. It's out there... whatever ""it"" is. Someone please help me, before I go completely insane... or worse.

39reh9,3,2015-06-13,Advice: I've been asked to make a career switch by a company,dtoxtwelve,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39reh9/advice_ive_been_asked_to_make_a_career_switch_by/,"Background: I was an intern with Company A for almost a year. During that time, I handled significant turmoil. Company A lost an important employee unexpectedly and a significant amount of the workload was placed on me. I did well and impressed them. I finished out my internship with the company on good terms and went on to other things. I worked at another company for one year and did well there. I left a few months ago and have been job hunting since then.

Over a year after leaving Company A, the CFO at Company A contacted me and asked if I would be willing to do some contract work for them. I agreed, since the chance to make extra money never hurts. This was over a month ago. They used this as an opportunity to re-evaluate me and they were impressed with my work.

Last Friday, the CFO asked to me meet with me. She told me that I am a valuable asset that the company would be foolish to let go twice. The CFO told me that there are no current positions that utilize my experience, but that the company is creating a new Director of Communications position in the next month. The CFO told me that she would push for me to get this job. The CFO told me that the position  would offer me a 20% increase in salary of what I was paid at my last job. 

The change is drastic enough to call it a career change. That said, my job search is not going well and an increase in pay, responsibility, and having my own office seem too good to pass up.

Should I take them up on the offer? "

I've been so busy with finals that I haven't had the chance to do any research. But in about a week I'm flying to Gevena, Switzerland to intern at CERN. I have always wanted to explore Europe, so I see this as a doubly great opportunity. I still haven't decided which cities I want to visit, and with my trip only a week away, advice from more experienced travelers is more than welcome.

I definitely would like to go to Germany, Italy, France, and maybe the UK(a little harder since its farther, and I likely need to limit my travels to weekends). 

Also, I am trying to learn German and French since they are similar to languages I already know, I was kind of wondering how vital this or if I shouldn't worry about cramming before I leave.

Thanks!"

i just took my first test and i don't feel i did that well on it (i'd say i failed, but maybe it's a passing grade i don't know) 

i really want to do well on this class because i would hate to get a C or F grade for a class i took over the summer ( i feel like i gave away my vacation just to lower my gpa)

but i don't want to drop it because i'd feel pretty bad knowing my parents paid for it (the only class i took over the summer)

i'd also like how a dropped class can affect my chances for co-ops/ internships and eventually job oppurtunites/ graduate school

39rva2,1,2015-06-13,"[Rant] Pressure for near perfect grades from my Dad, I'm losing my mind.",b0x0fawes0me,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39rva2/rant_pressure_for_near_perfect_grades_from_my_dad/,"I'm a computer science major through an engineering college and it's close to impossible to get straight As. It's not that I don't study enough, it's just when the test rolls around I get horrible panic attacks because I'm so scared I might fail.. so I do sub-par because I'm freaking out the whole time.

The worst part is, I'm financially dependent on my parents still. They make too much money for me to get any aid and I'm going through hell with my financial office trying to get any loans. If I don't get good grades, I get cut off and I'm essentially homeless and I can't pay for school.

The fucked up thing is I don't even care about the money. I'm so desperate for my Dad's approval that I feel like if I get bad grades I'm not worthy of love. It's so fucked up because he screwed around in college and graduated with a 2.4 with an accounting degree. 

I know what I need to do to get a good job when I graduate. I need to keep my GPA above a 3.0 and be involved in clubs and get an internship or two. The problem is, I have to be so focused on grades because if I dip down below a certain point, shit is going to hit the fan. 

The worst part is he has no faith in me. Every time I come home and tell him that the pressure is killing me, he says ""what, are you failing something now? it sounds like you're warming me up to say that you're failing something"" and he looks at me disgusted. He knows about my panic disorder but he either doesn't believe me or he doesn't care. His solution is ""just take a pill"" or something. I've heard it all. As if I haven't been trying to cure it for years.

I hate it. He acts like he's this great parent because he will say things like ""I don't know why you make me out to be the bad guy, I don't care about grades THAT much!"" but then he'll look at me like a piece of human garbage when I come home with anything not up to his standards. 

Here's the kicker - I think my anxiety is sabotaging me on purpose. I think I'm so scared of failing that I *need* to fail. It isn't that I don't love what I'm doing, I do. I love coding. I love working with computers. I know this is the major I'm supposed to be doing. But there's a voice screaming at me that if I succeed, he's still not going to be proud of me, he's going to take all the credit, and he still will give me a hard time with everything. But if I fail, maybe, just maybe, he'll feel guilty for pushing me to my absolute breaking point, and he'll change.

I know that's irrational, and I wish my rational side could win out so I could live a goddam happy life and support myself and not have to deal with this asshole anymore, but he's never *really* been proud of me because he has a lot of self-hatred and sees a lot of me in him, which kills me. I've done some pretty amazing things in my short life, more than he could ever handle at my age, and I guess I'm just sick of him not trusting that I know what's best for me."

However I don't have any intern/work experience in this field. 

     The past year has been really hectic for me, I didn't do an internship in the summer due to me deciding to go to China instead to be with my grandmother who was expected to die soon (she died Christmas week 2014), the family situation related to her declining health gave me quite a lot of stress which tanked my grades during the fall semester of my senior year and I even had to go back to China during the spring semester to attend the funeral and had to deal with a lot of stuff (arguments over inheritance and such) that shouldn't have involved me but somehow did. 

     I've applied to a lot of places after I graduated and haven't heard back yet from anyone (how long does it usually take?). Normally I wouldn't be too worried yet since I graduated college with no debt and have ~1 years worth of savings. My family however is putting on a lot of pressure to find a job which is stressing me out. All the jobs I'm looking at requires 2-4 years of experience and it seems most of the good internships want me to still be in college. I'm starting to worry since its been almost a month after graduation and I still have no real destination. I would really appreciate any advice that can help me figure out what to do correctly with my current education and lack of work experience. 

 TL:DR Family stuff happened so I couldn't focus on my college and after college matters. Now I'm graduated without experience and facing a lot of pressure to get a job from my family and need advice/help. 

EDIT: Resume: http://imgur.com/2XFY4sE
This is my resume for R&amp;D and lab related jobs. I use another when applying for medical device. Differences is subtract lab technique/equipment section and add medical device design knowledge + high school work where I worked at a Chinese restaurant during high school as a cashier/waiter and then became an assistant manager (technically in name only) for a little while before going to college due to me always helping the managers and workers there with English translations.

39s2tg,29,2015-06-14,"Something, or someone, won't let my sister wake up",not_bran_stark,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/39s2tg/something_or_someone_wont_let_my_sister_wake_up/,"If you have younger siblings, you’ll understand me when I say that they’re always “little” to you.  Little brother.  Little sister.  They can grow up, become adults, even surpass you in some ways.  But there’s always an element of protection we older siblings feel towards our younger counterparts. Despite the multitude of ways in which they can drive us crazy, we still love them.  We still protect them.


Keira is my only sister. The baby. We're close enough that sometimes we're mistaken for twins. We went to the same university. Live in the same city. Have keys to each others places. We tell each other everything. We’re not just siblings; we’re friends. It’s always been that way with Keira and me. I’m the big brother, the defender. She’s always been there for me in a more emotional capacity. When I'm down, when I get dumped on, or whenever life in general is going shitty for me, my baby sister is there to lean on, always with her gentle encouragement and kind words. She has such a talent for knowing the right thing to say.  It’s why she pursued psychology. She just *gets* people. There have been times I’m not sure what would have happened to me if Keira hadn’t been there to guide me through the darkness.


You may be thinking this is a creepy relationship, but I’m telling you it’s nothing like that. We’re just close. She’s my little sis. I love her. And I’m sharing her story because I don’t know what else to do now.


Let me tell you some more about Keira. She’s pretty. Dark hair, dark eyes, a smile that lights up the room. She inherited our mother’s features and our dad’s kind nature.  Naturally, she’s had guys crawling all over her since she was about 15. But Keira was always cautious. She was always very careful about the guys she dated, and I can count on one hand the serious relationships she’s had in all her 25 years. She always wanted something real. 


In January, Keira embarked on her last semester of grad school. She was well on her way to becoming a therapist. She had a good job and an even better internship lined up. Her grades were stellar. She had a close knit circle of friends, and a sweetie of a dog named Denver. Seemed like she was doing pretty well in this life. Intelligent, ambitious, kind. I was never prouder of her.


And then he came along.


Now, of course my job as a big is to look at all of my little sister’s suitors with a suspicious eye. My philosophy was to assume every one of them was an asshole until he proved otherwise. Luckily, all of her boyfriends had been acceptable. Her relationships ended on good terms. She was always so logical about the end of her relationships, and was back to her old self within a few weeks, taking the whole thing as a learning experience. Always the optimist.


But dammit, he *had* to come along.


I’m ashamed to say it. But the new guy, I liked him from the start. It was hard not to. He treated her like a queen. He reminded me a lot of her. Intelligent, ambitious, kind. That’s probably what drew them to each other. They met at a New Year’s Eve party and three weeks later they were inseparable. His name was Robin. Robin and Keira. They were the model of what an ideal relationship ought to be. They never fought. It was like they complemented each other perfectly.


I was happy for her, I really was. Even though it meant spending less time with her. I’d never seen her so alive and full of happiness.


But nothing’s perfect.


In March, Keira revealed to me a few things about Robin that bugged me. Not even consciously, but beneath the surface, what she told me had set off a feeling of unease I could neither put a finger on nor shake.


Robin was ex-army, which wasn't a big deal. But what I didn’t know was that he was suffering from PTSD, and didn’t seem to think he needed to get help for it. Keira wasn’t concerned by it. She promised me the biggest symptom he had was nightmares. And she told me that he had confessed his symptoms had lessened since becoming involved with her. It bothered me. I began to worry he might be using her to lean on; or that Keira with her background in psychology saw him as some sort of rescue project. But I trusted her judgement. And she was so incredibly happy with him. So I kept my mouth shut. Now I wish I hadn’t.


I won’t waste time with the details of their breakup; that will come later. What I can tell you is that one night in April, my baby sister showed up at my door absolutely beside herself. She went back and forth between jabbering at a million miles an hour and sobbing her pretty brown eyes out. And she kept repeating the same thing; “He was a different person...it was like he was a different person.”


I’ve never seen Keira so utterly morose in my life. She was downright depressed. Her sleeping schedule completely reversed so she was staying up all night and going to sleep at daybreak, only when she became too exhausted to stay awake. She quit her job because of this. She moved in with me because she could barely take care of herself. Her grades plummeted to the point she almost didn’t pass some of her classes. My sister was heartbroken, and it tore my own heart out to see her that way.



Fast forward to about a month ago. Keira’s depression had reached a point to where I was worried about her. Like genuinely worried I might come home to her body in the bathtub or something awful like that. I convinced her to see a therapist. She was ashamed for being so beaten down. Ashamed that someone else had weakened her so badly. But she went.


When she came back from her first session, it was not with the slightly more chipper attitude I had hoped for, but with a prescription bottle. At this point I was alarmed. The following conversation went something like this:


“Drugs? Seriously?”

She shrugged almost guiltily and I felt bad for sounding judgmental. Truth was, I was pretty amazed that this jerk had messed her up so bad that she needed to be medicated to resemble something of her normal self.  

“Yeah. It’s to help me sleep” she told me.

I thought about her strange sleeping habits of late and nodded.

“I guess I didn’t realize it was so serious” I said apologetically.

She shrugged again and sat at the table, staring downwards.  

“It’s just the dreams” she said quietly.

“Dreams?” I asked.

She sighed heavily and nodded.

“I dream about him every night. *Every* goddam night, B! And it’s always such nice dreams. We’re together and everything is alright. It’s like nothing bad ever happened. When I wake up and realize it was a dream...I just can’t handle it anymore. It hurts too much.”

Her voice had begun to quaver and I watched tears splash onto the table top. I walked over and squeezed her shoulder. No wonder she was struggling to move on.  

“It’ll be ok. You’ll get some decent sleep and you’ll be feeling better before you know it” I told her.

She nodded. “I hope so, B.  I just can’t go on seeing his face in my dreams and waking up to an empty bed. It’s cruel.”

“The mind can be a cruel place” I told her.



She took the pills that night, and every night for a week. And like a miraculous transformation, I saw my sister coming back to me. She took all the crap she associated with Robin and finally boxed it away. She got back to running with Denver.  She stopped moping. It seemed like all she needed was a gentle push in the right direction and she was able to take back the helm of her life.

After two weeks on the pills, her therapist said she could start to wean herself off of them. So she did. All was well until yesterday.

I came home from work to a dim apartment. Something was off when I entered. Terribly off. There were no lights on. No dishes in the sink. The place had a foreboding air to it, an uneasily quiet, empty feeling. I was about to decide that Keira had gone out for a long day of errands when Denver caught my attention. He was sitting on the kitchen floor next to a puddle of his own pee. He looked distressed, and paced to Keira’s bedroom door.

I followed him with fear in my heart. Was she dead? Had she cracked and taken her own life?  Was her evident recovery all a ruse to pacify me? My heart hammered harder with every step.  The door was ajar. I called out to Keira - no answer. Now I felt sick to my stomach. I made myself open the door to the bedroom, thinking awful things like how I would explain it all to our mother…
She was there in the bed. She at least looked very much alive. The first thing I did was look at the blanket pulled over her chest for signs of breathing. I could see movement! She was alive! Relief washed over me.
“Keira!” I said loudly, hoping to startle her awake and give her a good scare in return for the one she’d given me.
She sighed and rolled onto her side, facing away from me. She was normally such a light sleeper.  This was odd.
“Keiraaaaa” I called.
Nothing. Was she faking?  She had to be.
“KEIRA!” I bellowed, certain I’d catch her laughing, giving away her attempt at a prank.  And a bad attempt at that. Then I remembered she’d neglected to take Denver out to the point he’d pissed on the floor. With a jolt, I realized she would never intentionally do that to her beloved dog . This wasn’t a prank.
She breathed deeply. I walked to her  Concern began to rise in my stomach again. She was asleep. Fast asleep. I shook her gently. Nothing. I shook her more vigorously. I took hold of her shoulder and pulled her onto her back so I could see her face.
“KEIRA” I said sharply.
I was met with nothing but her pretty face, sleeping peacefully, with an almost serene, smiling expression about her.

Now I was good and worried again. Had she taken something?  Or been drinking?  But there were no empty pill or booze bottles in sight. She was simply asleep.
The next few hours were something of a blur. I called both her therapist and our parents, but I can’t remember who first. I got the voicemail for the therapist and hung up so I could call our mom. She came right over and after several failed attempts to rouse my sister, the decision was made to take her to the hospital.

And there, it got even weirder. After running every test imaginable on her, not a single doctor could tell us why Keira won’t wake up. She’s not comatose. She has brain activity - lots of it. She’s just asleep. And what’s more, is that they couldn’t, still can’t tell us why she won’t wake. We’ve tried everything - shaking her, pouring ice cold water onto her, making loud sounds. But she’s still asleep. She’s a mystery. The doctors are saying they’ve never seen this before. There’s some specialist flying in from Montreal as we speak. He’s our next best hope. 

I’m at the end of my tether here. I’m back at my apartment, back in Keira’s bedroom. I came back to search for clues; anything to indicate why my sister is in some sort of enchanted sleep from which she cannot wake. I’m scared for her. There’s something really fucked up going on here. I can’t explain it. But I can feel it. I haven’t solved the mystery of my sister’s inexplicable slumber, but I have uncovered some pretty alarming things.
First of all, there’s a note under Keira’s bed that I missed when I was in her room earlier. The handwriting is disjointed and sloppy but still distinctly hers. I interpreted it as best I could:
*He is mine and I am his. The illusion is mine. He exists. The other one is dead. I have to go back to the illusion. The illusion is real. I have to stay. I have to st*

And there it trails off into nonsensical lines, as though Keira fell asleep writing the note.
There’s something else. The pill bottle on her nightstand, the stuff she had been taking to help her sleep.  It’s not some sleep aid like I thought it would be. The label says *Cypripedium reginae*.
It sounds like some kind of plant. What the hell did my sister get prescribed? And how does it tie into her condition? Because it *has* to. People don’t just go to sleep and stay that way.
I’m taking this bottle back to the hospital and getting some answers. Maybe if they can figure out why she’s asleep, they can wake my sister up. And this pill she was taking is the key, I know it.  
I’m on my way out now. And I’m going to call Robin. I have a nasty feeling he might somehow have something to do with this.

39t273,5,2015-06-14,PhD vs work?,nctr,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/39t273/phd_vs_work/,"I'm soon going to finish my masters degree in statistics. I also have more than 2 years experience as a software engineer from doing freelenacing work during my studies part time during the semester and full time during semester break. I also have a internship as a data scientist as well as a published paper from a student research job.

So things are looking pretty good, I am currently applying to both PhD and work positions.

There are mainly three possibilties:

PhD at university 

- if computer science then good money, less than in indutry but not that much
- may be too theoretical
- takes up to five years

industry PhD 
 
- less money
- really interesting job description, at least on of them, for the other I still have the interview 
- not assured that I can actually finnish my PhD in the three years, then the contract runs out, still high probability to then work for the company (BMW or siemens) in a PhD position

Industry:

- most money
- two jobs I appplied to also seemed very interesting and exactly what I want to do (data science)
- maybe harder for career later when I have no PhD?

So my question is, how important is the PhD in your experience for a career in data science? What would you chose if you could between those three kind of job offers?"

I'm building a survey application for my internship. The survey contains slides, each with different input fields and such, and the end product will probably have over 30 slides. I've written a substantial amount of code already and the issue I'm running into is that I've been hand coding the slides in HTML, but that's going to get really, really messy when I start going over 10 slides. Not to mention if I make any change to the structure of my slides, I have to change all 30 of them by hand and that's not productive.

My solution: Somehow model all the slide data in the backend and dynamically add slide elements to the webpage. 

My question is on implementation. I've looked at angularjs and emberjs and I'm not sure if I want to put in all the work to revamp my web app to use these frameworks when I really only need to inject the modeled data into the DOM. I could easily do this with jQuery. Maybe these frameworks will help me more than I realize?

So I started this and added to it as I remembered reasons why I think I should be evaluated.  Is it appropriate to give something like this to whoever I end up seeing?




Growing up I always did really well in school; straight As for the most part, never anything below a B, and those Bs brought me great personal shame. But I also never really had to try to reach those grades.  When I reached high school, I started getting more Bs.  Algebra was where it started.  I understood the concepts and formulas but not my test scores. I always made stupid mistakes.  Forgot to carry the 2, forgot to drop the X.  On the End of Grade tests, I always did much better because they were multiple choice and if I didn’t get one of those answers I could just redo the problem.  These tests always saved my C averages and brought them up to high Bs because of how they were weighted.  The same went for my social science/history classes.  I just couldn’t make myself even try to remember specific dates. These classes didn’t have EOGs but the final projects were usually papers or presentations which I’ve always exceled at, even if I always put it off until the last minute…

When I was a sophomore, I found theatre and it changed my life.  I loved everything about it and quickly developed a taste for the design and construction side of things.  Set building, costuming, cleaning out the store rooms, sound, fly systems, and lighting.  It was all beautiful.  I even loved acting, just not as much.  I would get restless in class and ask if I could go work on my projects for theatre.  Most teachers didn’t even care because I wasn’t a trouble kid nor were my grades terrible.

Eventually, I took Honors Chemistry, which I admit was a huge mistake, but the only time the regular chemistry class was offered was during the only time that I could take a teaching internship for Theatre. My teacher hated me.  Not directly as a person, but definitely as a student.  She made a show of me in class, flaunting my bad grades, calling on me knowing I wouldn’t know how to do the formulas and then smirk when I couldn’t answer and ask the guy who did understand it all.  One day, in front of everyone, she told me that I needed to spend less time focused on my Theatre studies and focus more on chemistry.  I had a 68 in that class the day before the final.  To my teacher’s disbelief, I scored a 94 on the exam, pulling my final grade up to a 72, so I passed.  Barely

Looking back on my journals from this time, I realize that I was very depressed.  I was dealing with a substance-abusing mother and aunt that was resentful that I chose not to live with her after years of demoralizing treatment. I started skipping class and would only show up to school for my Play Production and then walk home so I got there about the time school would be out.  I’d hang out at home until I couldn’t stand it then walk down town where my favorite coffee shop and the community theatre were. This would total about 10 miles of walking a day, assuming I got a ride home later that night if I ran into somebody I knew.

Outside of school, I stayed out of trouble.  I had no interest in drugs or alcohol.  I barely had a boyfriend who was present so no sex either.  Both my mom and aunt regularly accused me of doing all of these things…my mom because it’s what she was doing at my age.  My aunt because she was told by my foster care appointed therapist that it was inevitable that that’s how I would turn out if left to my own devices.  They forced me to go on birth control (depo-provera specifically) to protect me from the sex I wasn’t having.  That also messed me up emotionally for a while and I had wild mood swings.  After that I developed really bad cystic acne and gained significant weight.  I stopped getting the shot once I turned 18 and moved out.  The issues that arose as a result of it lasted years.

The point of going into all of that, is I just always assumed my depression issues in high school were related to my environment.  I thought the skipping classes and only doing the things I loved were a result of my sadness and inability to take on more discomfort.  I was excited to graduate (and that I hadn’t ruined my chances of doing so) so I could leave my hometown forever and go to college.  

But college was hard.  I was repeating the same patterns, but this time I wasn’t sad.  On the contrary, I was amazed by the level of freedom I felt and the liberation that came with being away from my mom, who I realized in retrospect was emotionally abusive.  That being said, my grades weren’t great. I could no longer put off major projects until the night, sometimes hours before they were due and get a decent grade. Theatre classes-straight As.  I started skipping my lecture classes in math and philosophy.  I dropped my lecture class in Biology after two weeks.  I would get ready, leave my dorm, and as I was walking to those classes, a sense of panic and dread overcame me and I would just…go somewhere else.  Usually to get coffee or I’d walk downtown to see some art.

I barely scraped by in all of my classes (except for the one I dropped) with a C average my first semester.  I’m not sure how, probably because they were designed as intro-level classes to ease the transition from high school learning to college level learning.  My second semester rolled around. I ambitiously signed up for five classes, promising myself that I’d get it together and do well.  I only signed up for one theatre class.  By week two, I had dropped Astronomy, another big room lecture class, because I experienced that same panic every time I tried to go. I switched all of my other classes to theatre-related things: set design, movement, costuming. 

I dropped out completely halfway through my sophomore fall semester.  I convinced myself that college just isn’t for some people and that I was one of them, despite being labeled as “gifted” my entire life.  I got a job at a local restaurant and planned on saving money to go to school for massage therapy.  Being done in eight months was an appealing idea to me, not to mention I agree with the idea of “positive touch” being essential in peoples’ lives.  But I could never save enough money and there were no loan plans for the schools in this area.

Eventually, when I was 21, I decided to try school again and applied to a community college to work on core credits to figure out what I wanted to do.  I had become disenchanted with professional theatre, as I hated the politics, but I knew I couldn’t make a living doing community theatre forever.  Still, I somehow ended up being a theatre major there.  I only took theatre classes, despite that not being my plan. For a whole year I made straight As there, so I was confident I could go back to a university when they cancelled the associate’s program.  

I started off strong and organized.  I desperately needed general ed. requirements, so that’s all I was taking at the time.  It was definitely hard, but I was determined to succeed this time.  I’d only skipped a couple of classes because of that anxiety, but I was managing.  Then my mom struck again.  I’d held her at arm’s length for a while, and rarely went to visit, but one day my aunt called me and was desperate to arrange an intervention.  I agreed to be a part of it.  It failed.  I told her not to talk to me until she was sober for a minimum of three months and that had to include a month of rehab.  She responded by “trying” to kill herself by eating too many Tylenol.  Based on the evidence I was given, I came to the conclusion that it was a fake attempt to get my attention.  My aunt, a nurse, now agrees with me.  I shut her off completely after that.

Immediately after, my boyfriend of four years cheated on me with my best friend.  Shortly after that, my dad, whom I had very little contact with growing up because he spent most of my life in prison, accused me of just wanting his money because I had asked him if he would be interested in helping me go to massage school instead of showering me in expensive gifts that he kept giving me to “make up for lost time.”  He stopped talking to me.  I couldn’t handle life anymore.  I dropped all but two of my classes, and then eventually stopped going to those.  I was too anxious to see a campus counselor, despite them having an awesome reputation.  I would sit in the parking lot at work trying not to throw up at the idea of mindlessly bussing tables all night.

Fast-forward four years.  I have a much more satisfying job, despite still being in the service industry.  I don’t want it forever, but it’s great for the time being. I’m in a lower level management position involving cash handling.  I still make a lot of stupid mistakes, but given how structured the process is, it’s easy to figure out what I’ve done wrong. I sometimes overshare my life stories with my customers, but luckily they don’t seem to mind, since they always ask for updates when they come in again.  Some of my coworkers complain about my “baby-brain” because I developed a terrible memory while I was pregnant that never really seemed to return to normal.  That being said, I’m not sure it ever was, because before I got pregnant I was making mistakes and they were put off to me being new to the supervisor position.  
I have an amazing husband, who listened when I said I’d sworn off dating for a year after my ex in order to learn how to love myself and sort out my head.  The only time we argue is when he gets upset at the weird messes I seem to leave everywhere or when I forget to do something I promised I would do. I totally understand his frustration, and I unintentionally escalate these arguments because I get frustrated that I can’t answer why I do these things.  He jokingly picks on me constantly for losing things that I was just holding, like my keys, phone, and wallet.  That, and how frequently I “about face” when I walk into a room because I suddenly remember why I left it in the first place.

We have a beautiful daughter who has defied all odds by surviving extreme prematurity and losing a portion of her small intestine. She came home after 108 days in the NICU.  She has inspired me so much and now my life purpose is to do the same for her.  I want her to have a healthy, strong female role model, unlike what I grew up with. I’ve adopted a mindset now that my life is in my hands and only I can improve it. Since she came home, I’ve stopped giving into excuses and lost a significant amount of weight, although I have more to go (PCOS and hypothyroidism and having been pregnant are NOT an excuse!). I found a good college that would take me despite my track record.

One of the conditions for the school to take me in with awful grades (which they will remove from my record if I do well) was that I had to take a class called Learning Strategies.  This class was taught by the head of the tutoring department and writing center on campus.  She specializes in figuring out how a particular individual learns and gives them tools to make it work for them.  We did several introspective journals that we submitted to her as well as many in-class activities.  I honestly thought this class was going to be just an easy-A class to b.s. through but it really taught me a lot about myself.  For example, that I’m a kinesthetic learner and need to be able to fidget or play with “toys” in order to focus on lecture-style classes. It finally made sense that all the classes I excelled in were busy, constantly changing environments.  I honestly feel that the reason I haven’t panicked yet is because this class gave me some tools to help me stay organized. Granted, I regularly get overwhelmed by the idea that I can’t do it this time and that I’m just going to drop out again, wasting my time, disappointing my husband and daughter.

Towards the end, my professor sent me an email, in response to a question I had about our work, saying that she thought I should get tested for ADHD.  All of the things I wrote up to this point, I had mentioned in some way in our journals.  She told me that anxiety and depression can actually be symptoms of ADHD and, while she doesn’t like to just throw the term around, she felt I could benefit from looking into it because there are resources on campus that can my education journey more pleasant if it’s determined that I have it. She made sure to clarify that she is not an ADHD professional, but, as a tutor she works with a lot of people with the condition and from them she has heard lots of stories like mine.  
So, that’s why I’m here.  I decided to write all of this out to try to organize my thoughts.  I tried seeing the campus counselor but just couldn’t articulate my needs in person and she told me she didn’t understand why I was there.  I was going to write it all out like this, but shortly after we met, the school got rid of the adult counseling services on campus, so now I’m trying to figure out where to go.  I would absolutely love if you could help me figure out what’s going on in my brain.  My biggest fear is failing college a third time so I’m trying to get the tools I need before my head threatens to consume me again.

39tqxp,3,2015-06-14,Benefits of Weekend Detox?,SweetAliss,Stims,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/39tqxp/benefits_of_weekend_detox/,"In advance, sorry this is so long.  There are questions at the end, I promise.  I just wanted to give as much info about the situation as possible.

My husband has long-term issues with chronic fatigue and ADD symptoms (definitely no 'H' in there).  He started taking Adderall a bit over a year ago, and found it very helpful for both.  He occasionally uses it recreationally for stuff like sex, but usually uses it just to treat the symptoms of the ADD and to stay awake and productive during normal waking hours (not staying up all night).  He also started on Zenzedi a few months ago because he sometimes wanted the productivity/focus without the energy, such as in the evenings.  Since starting it, he goes between the two - we've found that he sometimes gets angry in the morning if he takes Adderall to wake up, but 10mg Zenzedi gets him going with no problems.  Usually he'll take 10mg Zenzedi in the morning, anywhere between 10 and 20mg Adderall in the afternoon and early evening, and (depending on how late we're staying up), another 5-10mg of one of them in the evening.  He takes Klonopin for sleep (since starting the uppers), usually 1-2mg, and if he needs to go to bed early, he'll usually take 10mg Ambien as well.

Sometimes, after periods of increased use, he starts having issues with anger and irritability, so he'll stop for a week or so, and then he's back to normal.  During that time, he has a hard time doing anything productive, and sleeps for a long time (at least 10 hours a day, but as much as 16).  He doesn't usually develop a tolerance unless he is using it recreationally (which again, is rare).

Over the last month and a half, our lives have gone through a big change.  We had been taking a year off from work to spend time with family and becoming more active with our religious practice.  But in early May, we started getting ready to move from Florida to Utah, where we were to start Grad school.  This was a big task, and he did the brunt of the work.  Starting probably about a month ago, he was having to work all day and frequently all night packing up our things and getting ready to leave.  It was really stressful, and needless to say, he was taking more of the amphetamines and sometimes taking them round the clock.  Then he had to drive a moving truck cross-country for almost a week.  Then came the unpacking and getting moved in.  He was able to take a couple days off the meds but then had to start again for some preliminary meetings for the place we'll be doing full-time internship starting in August.  And last weekend started our grueling summer class schedule (we're leaving our house at 7am, driving an hour to and from classes, and getting home between 6 and 7pm, at which point we've got hours of homework).  Last week (1st week of classes), neither of us got more than 4 hrs of sleep a night between sunday and thursday.  This meant an increase in the meds, as well as a BIG increase in the amount of caffeine we drink (he had been drinking 2 energy shots per day most days, which comes out to 370mg).  

At this point, we're hoping our homework will be less demanding, but there are still other responsibilities which take hours out of our nights, so it's not like he can come home and crash, and take 12 hours off the meds/caffeine.  

He is taking this weekend to catch up on sleep, but I'm assuming he is detoxing from the amphetamines and caffeine as well, because he's been awake less than 4 hours in the last 36.  Usually when he takes a break from the drugs, he takes a week or so (he calls it his ""detox just to retox"" phase), but at this point that's not an option.  He HAS to be up at 6am tomorrow to start another really busy week, which means he HAS to go back on his meds.  And there's no foreseeable break in the future.

My question is ultimately, is this shorter detox/rejuvenate period actually helpful, since it's so short?  And since he has to go back on the uppers so soon, at what point should I be concerned (aside from when he starts getting really angry)?  He always accuses me of thinking I know what's best for him, which I don't - I just see what's NOT good for him sometimes.  But again, let me emphasize that this isn't for fun, it's out of necessity.  He's not abusing anything. He's still taking less than his prescribed dose of both meds.  Also, what amount of caffeine is physically dangerous?  The bottles say not to take more than 2 per day, but I don't know how accurate that is, as so many people chug energy drinks (which are also full of sugar) like water, and seem healthy."
39tt10,6,2015-06-14,Best housing solution for a 6-month internship in Tokyo,RdNetwork,Tokyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/39tt10/best_housing_solution_for_a_6month_internship_in/,"Hello /r/tokyo !

This was first posted in /r/japanlife, and as their bot wisely told me, it sounds like a good idea to ask here too. Hope you don't mind the double post if you read both of these subreddits.


I was accepted at the N.I.I. (National Institute of Informatics) in Chiyoda, Tokyo, for a research internship from late February to late August 2016.

Therefore, even if I already searched for information about that by myself, I'd like to hear your opinion about the best way for me to get an apartment that would be close enough to the lab and not too expensive.

Excluding guest houses, most of the websites I found are fully in Japanese, which is definitely not very useful to me (even if I'm learning Japanese; I'm unfortunately not yet at that level, I guess). It seems that most expats going to Japan for such a period of time choose those guest houses (mostly Sakura Houses or OakHouses), which seem to be good solutions, but I'm struggling to find something that would suit perfectly. Namely:

- I'd rather live in an apartment: I don't like dormitories, and I'm not a fan of shared houses (maybe you can convince me that it's the best way ; share your opinion on this too !). I know that's it is more expensive, but I thought I could find apartments that would be okay without being greatly expensive (I didn't. Minimum is about 100kY/month). I don't really mind a small surface (I mean, as long as I can live in it. That's probably like at least 9m²).
- I'd obviously like it to be not too far from the lab, but I don't mind walking. I guess a good criteria would be that if I can go to work in less than 40-45 minutes (total), I'd be fine. Not sure though if that is a surmountable amount of time in the Japanese transportation system.

I think I look like a pain in the ass for most of you, who probably don't want to help such a demanding person, so I'll just say that I'll welcome anything that looks like a tip or a good idea, even if that means criticizing my demands (after all, I assume you are the one who know about Japan life).

Tl;dr: What is the best way to find an apartment for a 6-month internship in the center of Tokyo.

Thanks in advance ! :)

I have an important decision to make. I was accepted to the Online Master in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and I also was accepted to the Online Master in Software Engineering at Penn State.  Money is not an issue, ...I was wondering what program would be better in the term of ROI, recognition and would have a better impact in my career. 

Pros Ga Tech
Cheap 7k. Money is not an issue but things might change.  University has better reputation in technology field and is more concentrated in theory.

Cons
3 years to finish the master. No project option, just courses.  Its a new program so they might have a lot of things to figure out. They quit the subspecialization in Software Engineering and Databases.

Pros Penn State
I love the courses because are more centralized in software development process, project management etc etc.  It only takes 2 years to finish the program.  The master has the requirement to complete a project. 

Cons
I love theory but since this programs is more specialized in SE I think would be better to perform my job. What I'm really worried is that expensive 36K for the whole program and so far money is not an issue but I always liked to err in the side of less debt.  In the other hand, someone from GaTech might have a better starting salary than me just because of the name of the university.

Future plans:
I want to earn an MBA after my masters, I want to become a Chief Information Officer.

My background:
Bachelor degree in Bioinformatics and Computer Science. GPA 4.00, 5 internships. (Summer Research Internship University of Virginia, Integratek, Coca-Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers, Pharma-Bio Serv, US. Dept of Treasury.

Some background information on myself:

- Attend a well-respected top-20 accounting program state school, headed back for an MSA in the fall. 
- Very solid and attractive extracurriculars, but nothing overly related to MC
- 3.5 GPA
- Previously interned in b4 risk group, currently interning in another b4 audit

After doing some soul-searching and research, I believe that MC is really where I would like to be. I feel as though the B4 MC groups may be a good fit for me based on my background, but I'm wondering if it's too late in the game for me to try to move that direction since I missed the opportunity to intern there. Furthermore, if I receive an offer from my current B4 audit internship, will that help me at all in trying to obtain a full time position in one of these b4 mc groups? I know these groups are fairly separate entities from a legal standpoint, but I wasn't sure what degree of interconnectedness they have from a recruiting standpoint. 

Any advice on if making this transition is reasonably possible and if so, how I should go about it besides networking, would be very appreciated. Thanks!"
39tyjn,1,2015-06-14,Super high anxiety about an internship I don't want but should take...help!! Feel helpless.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39tyjn/super_high_anxiety_about_an_internship_i_dont/,"Hey everyone,    

So I just finished my 3rd year of college at a pretty top university as an econ major. For most econ/biz people it's really important to get an internship in the summer for experience. I recently got an offer after applying for a while, and I'm supposed to sign the contract to accept today. IT IS SUPPOSED TO START TOMORROW. Actually it was needed a few days ago but I've just been avoiding it. The thing is, I feel so anxious about it all. I'm not so sure about my future career path, but one thing I know is I'm afraid of the 9-5 cubicle job for life, which I think is where most econ majors end up. I know this is only a summer internship but the anxiety is killing me. I don't think I can see myself in a position like this in the future. It seems like I won't like it. It's been stuck in my mind all day and I've cried so many times because of it. 
    
    
The internship is a commerce/purchasing one in a medium size company, so most of the time I'll be analyzing numbers I'm guessing. I feel like I just randomly applied to internships because I feel obliged to. If I don't get one, I'm behind my peers in terms of experience. I feel like I don't even want this. I don't even know though. What will this lead to? Another crappy cubicle job that pays more in the future? I like helping people and I know I like rewarding acts. I also don't know what I'll do this summer if I reject this. Another option is to travel a bit but that costs money and i feel SO guilty not developing myself professionally. It's an endless cycle that repeats in my head. I'm afraid that I'll end up with a dead end job hating life forever. Also this internship is a 3 month contract so I can't leave if I hate it. I just don't see myself 9-5 full time...I'm not sure if I'm just complaining. I seriously think this is affecting my mental health. I feel like I'm more of a free spirit type? I know it sounds weird, and I don't think I'm lazy per se, but I just can't get myself to sign to accept. I talked to my parents and peers about it, but all of them just say 'you're lucky, just accept. Most people don't get this paid opportunity'. I don't think they understand the distress this is causing me. I've looked at other internships, but no other seems to interest me...they all seem to be desk ish jobs. I long to be creative and not 'stuck'? Does this make sense to anyone? I'm one to overthink and analyze everything, and I don't know if I can handle this 40 hrs a week of I hate it. I've been thinking about self harm quite a bit since this is so stressful and taking over me. I've had past mild anxious thoughts throughout college so far in regards to career prospects and social life in general. Right now it's even got to the point of me wanting to slightly hurt myself. Please help me. What do I do? What can I do? Am I just crazy? What can I do to help myself? Anyone going through the same thing?"

Is web dev oversaturated or going to be?,programminghelp9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39u1zc/question_about_what_career_path_to_take_after_cs/,"So, I currently already have a degree and work full time in finance as a licensed rep.  However, I have no interest in staying on the phones or working this job anymore.  I am working towards a undergrad degree in Computer Science outside work.  Basically, since I already have my ""fluff"" classes done with my other degrees, I really only have to take 15 classes to complete my degree.

By the end of the year, I should have 5 classes completed.  Starting in 2016, I plan on leaving my current job and doing 3 classes a quarter (except during the summer, because I hope to have an internship then).  Obviously, one of the quarters will have 4 classes though.

With all that said, what would be the best career for me to focus on that could lead to a good initial position to start out in the tech world?  

I realize that there are a lot of possibilities with this, but I really want to get started on the right foot and focus on something for the next year that could realistically lead to an internship and a career next year.  

Someone has recommended to me either focusing on mobile dev or web dev.  I feel like going web dev, but I am slightly concerned on that.  With all the bootcamps (and all the people going for that field), would that be a bad idea?

I just feel like I want to start focusing on side projects on my own for now so that I can land a good internship next summer.  To do that, though, I obviously need to focus on a field that I want to go into.  

Does anyone have any thoughts on a good field to focus on and why?  Also, what are your thoughts on focusing on web dev?

Thanks for any information with this.

Look, I know what your thinking. Probably something along the lines of ""omgjgjghfhgh, you posted ensnared on a Sunday, it only comes out on Wednesday. well, my ever faithful reader, I shall give you the reason for this: this ain't quite ensnared. Sure, it may contain the title of that ever untruthful publication, but this is a special edition. I recently saw a post containing a picture of a ferret with blue feet. Users confused this ferret with a ferret with different coloured blue feet. As such, I decided to make this: a guide to all the notable and/or easily confusable mustelids on /r/furry. You may expect further special editions if other issue arise. Well then I'm sure you know the disclaimer off by heart, or have tattooed it backwards on your forehead, but still we must sacrifice some space to placate the nameless gods that time forgot:

&gt; warning: nothing in this post is true. it is full of half remembered events and blatant lies. we apologise if anything in this turns out to be any way correct .


Well, then. We must continue onwards. Firstly for those of you who ain't in the know, mustelids are a family of a animals . they include: badgers, otters, wolverines, ferrets, unicorns ,weasels (which are weasaley recognised) and stoats (that are stoataly different). There are not as many of these as the canine dog/wolf things that stalk the streets at night, but there are a fair few. Annoying thing is, some are bloody hard to tell from others. So,we have got examples of all the mustelids your likely to see on reddit:

* cyanfootedferret: ~~a counter terrorism operative working for the Sealand Enforcement Agencey~~ an accountant, this cute little fella is armed and highly dangerous (or should I say footed and highly dangerous). He can be told apart from others by the cyan markings on his feet, eyes the colour of an impure emerald and blood spattered on his coat (which, i might add, is a very awesome coat)

* Argent marble scratcher: if you see an otter dog ferret thing walking though walls, its either this hologram, or you've eaten some crazy mushrooms you found in the forest. You think this is the real ~~quaid~~ Argent? It is! Blam blam blam!

* the badger: contrary to popular belief, there is only one badger, he just exists in multiple places. As such, any attempt to cull badgers only results in failure. These quantum entangled badgers who share a hive mind  have only one motive: kill all humans. They are accomplishing this by collecting lots of underpants. No one knows why, but since they don't want to die they don't mention it to them. Do not approach badgers, they will steal your soul.

* wolverines: don't approach wolverines. Through some freak quirk of evolution, their skeletons are made of adamantium. No one knows why, but they are better, faster and stronger than all other mustelids. Keep yer distance from them.

* Fisk Velox: if you see an otter with a nice looking scarf on, ~~steal it nd bring it to me~~ be careful. If you see him unseaming people from the nave to the chaps with his glorious purple insect legs, and with messed up eyes, then now is the time for running. he is ~~an armed and dangerous bounty hunter who will kill all who stand in his way~~ a perfectly normal intern here at the Ensnared office. ignore him.

* john miles: if you happen to see a ferret wearing a pinstriped suit, aviators, bunny slippers and sporting a green Hawk, that is just our science, health and economics editor, john miles. no, we don't know why he dresses like that. yes, we know it looks ridiculous.

* velvet fotter: half fox, half otter (we can only begin to imaging how promiscuous that makes him, but we are guessing alot…). While only half fox, be careful of this one as its likely he will try and eat your shoe, especially if you are a Sagittarius, or its the 5th of April. No, we are as puzzled as you are by this.

* Hipster otter: don't worry about him, he's fine until Burnham wood comes to /r/furry, and plants can't use the internet. ~~yet~~, as well as him giving birth to a woman or some stuff like that.

* ?: you may see a pine marten, wearing a dinner jacket, a monocle and a bowtie. We don't know who he is. We don't know what he is doing. All we know is that whenever you see him, bad things happen. The colour of his bowtie is persimmon, if that helps


If I've left ya off the list, then… I'm sorry! I am bad jackal! Cya on Wednesday for issue 4 of your government mandated weekly propaganda.

39udfu,6,2015-06-14,On site interview and possible same day start,f7a12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39udfu/on_site_interview_and_possible_same_day_start/,"  I have an on site interview with the CEO of a small R&amp;D cyber security lab for an internship.  The email I got from the company said that if I was accepted, I could start the same day.  Is this normal? I haven't had any sort of interviews with this company, only a short phone conversation with the VP.  No mention of what I will be doing or pay or anything.  I would think that this puts me in a bad position to negotiate, considering I could have other offers (I don't). 


  Some background, when I originally applied in March, they told me that it was an unpaid position, which I declined. A week ago, they emailed me again saying that the position is now paid (I'm not sure if this is a red flag).  This is in the Bay Area (CA) if that's important."

39uhfi,8,2015-06-14,I'll break up with my boyfriend because he never gave me the intimacy that I always craved,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39uhfi/ill_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_he_never/,"It's June and soon it will be six years ago that I met my current boyfriend. I was 20 and he was 24 when we met.

I always had this imagination of a perfect relationship in my head. I wanted to talk with him for hours, I wanted to get to know him like no one ever did before. I wanted to share secrets and ask stupid questions without being judged. I dreamt of never losing that spark.

Once I worked at a hospital for an internship. There was only one other middle-aged man in my office. He was very nice and patient, I really liked him. My father knew him and said he had never seen people in love like that man and his wife. It was beautiful to watch him when he called his wife. His face lit up, his eyes smiled, there was a warmth and softness in his voice when he spoke with her. His body language showed complete happiness. He never ate at work so he could go home early and eat with his wife and children. He talked sometimes about her like he just met her even though they were married for a long time. I'll never forgot this.

Every since that week I dreamt of having the same. I knew it was possible, I've seen it with my own eyes. I only met once a couple like that since, so I know it's rare. Most couples make me depressed, I mean it's always the same. It starts with complete infatuation, peaks sometime and then it goes downhill with cheating and embarassing passive-aggressive remarks in front of strangers.

I wanted to have that comfort of being accepted completely, to show my ""real"" self without fear of being judged. I wanted to have that trust to build a real, deep connection. I wanted someone with an open, flexible mind. I wanted to open myself completely. 

I tried it. He never really let me in in six years. Sometimes I ""confessed"" things to him to motivate him to open up too, but it never worked. There was always a distance I couldn't overcome. We never talked about difficult, dark topics. It was six years of cocktail party small talk, nothing with real substance. 

When we fought he secluded himself completely. He'd lie down on the bed or couch and then he wouldn't stand up for hours. I learned that this was his way of dealing with his mother, who can have severe mood swings and can be quite aggressive.

Yesterday I hugged him and there was nothing. That warm, tingly feeling was gone, there was no love, it was like hugging a stranger. 

When I was together with my first boyfriend I told him how my father sometimes hit me when I was a child without any reason at all and he said his father did the same. We were laying in bed. We looked at each other and suddenly we hugged each other tight and began crying like babies.

There was a perfect connection in that moment. I know I have some problems, there are happier and funnier people than me. But for me, that moment was perfect and it was one of the most loving and intimate moments I ever had with another human being in my whole life.

I never came close to that with my current boyfriend. I always missed intimacy in our relationship. He'll always be there, alone in his head and maybe he'll never let anyone in. I don’t know why he does that. Maybe he thinks he’s not worthy of love if he shows what he’s really like?

I know that I want to be completely open in a relationship. I talk about every problem, but I also like to listen and give advice. I don’t want a human garbage can where I can dump my problems. I want it to be a two way street. 


I love to read reddit threads where people talk about how they can’t wait to get home and tell their partner about their day or how they love to share books and discuss them. How they miss their partner in a healthy way, even though they have been married so long. I want to have the chance to experience this myself.

I hope one day I can find the same.

I know the breakup will be one of the hardest things I’ll ever do, but sadly it’s a natural part of life and it’s necessary.

[Close up of screen](http://i.imgur.com/ei39G3M.jpg)

[Close up of Aztec Monster SCSI](http://i.imgur.com/PSOQ1pl.jpg)

This was bought off of CL many years ago and used at my work as conversion piece and to prank the interns. I finally brought it home as I wanted to have a perfect one that would last another 20 years.

What has been done:

1. Motherboard recapped [MacCaps](http://www.maccaps.com/MacCaps/Repair_Service.html)

2. Analog Board recapped (also Maccaps)

3. PS rebuilt/capped (yes, Maccaps)

4. Nused tube from a donor SE (less burn in)

5. SCSI to CF Adapter [Artmix on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/usr/artmix?_trksid=p2053788.m1543.l2754)

6. 1Gb CF card from Amazon

7. Micromac DiiMo 50Mhz '030 Accelerator Card [MicroMac](http://www.micromac.com/products/diimo_030.html)

8. Asante SE/30 ethernet card (piggbacked on the Micromat) (this has the 10bT connector on the daughterboard)

9. Filled RAM slots

So after cleaning and assembling everything, getting the CF partitioned and chopped up into some manageable sizes, System 7.5.3R2 installed and apps moved over it's ready for some light use when I have the need for some tranquility. It's eerily silent now, with only the SE fan making a slight noise. Gone is the piercing whine of those Apple/IBM 100G SCSI disks.

It's in a room without any other computers (AppleTV doesn't count)."
39up7h,0,2015-06-14,Should I(25) attempt to got into a relationship with a girl(20) who is childish and i do not love?,Cydonianknigh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39up7h/should_i25_attempt_to_got_into_a_relationship/,"I am in a weird situation. 
We were friends when we were child. I am a medical intern now. Two years ago something interesting happened. Her (20) mom called me for medical advice/help bcz her daughter has epilepsy. We arranged a meeting and i re-met the most beautiful girl around me. We met 2-3 times with her mom for doctor appointments. I was shocked by her beauty, how she changed so much. 
After a while we started to talk via facebook and cellphone. Then we hang out 3-4 times. The more i know her the more i lost my respect. She didnt go to college (college is not a must for me but one must be educated somehow). She is reallllly stubburn. She is ignorant on some issues and the bad thing is she never accepts that she is wrong or it is normal to not to know everything. Plus she is a bit childish besides me(25). I met many people who are 20 and can act like an adult. She generally acts like a child.

Whatever, after those meetings i started to loosen the connection and i finally stopped texting her or calling her and replying her messages etc.
One day she called me and said to me ""we need to talk"". I knew something is coming but i never expected to be confessed. She told me she is in love with me for 7 years. She was seeing me in the neighborhood etc.(she gave some details ablut how can this happen, how can she love me even we were not seeing each other). This happened like a year ago. I told her i can not be with somebody that i can not respect. I need to find a reason to respect. I told her she is superbeautiful etc. But this doesnt seem like to work.
She accepted this surprisingly in a mature way. Then deleted me from everywhere, facebook etc. We never talked after that.
Now i can not stop thinking about her. Like did i missed a chance? Is it possible to make a girl more mature and educated in a relationship? Did you guys ever do it before? I still have the opportunity to talk to her and probably win her heart. 

tl;dr: i found the most beautiful girl but she is childish. is it possible to overcome this while in relationship?"

39uqvw,0,2015-06-14,"You're all probably sick of hearing this question, but..",[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/39uqvw/youre_all_probably_sick_of_hearing_this_question/,"Can I learn c++ In a few months? Now before you down vote this, let me explain. With a strong background in game design, (animation/rigging, modelling, texturing etc) is it possible to learn enough of c++ to ship a game? I know c++, or any programming language, is extremely deep and people spend their lives mastering, or trying to master the 'unmasterable.' I know it won't be easy, or simple, but I do have the drive to learn enough c++ to ship a simple a game. (My summer project). I'll have enough time, aside from working as an intern and writing a novel, to dedicate around 3-4 hours a day (for ~3 months). The alternative is that I use the UDK/cryengine and use the built in logic scripting (kismet/flow graph) to script simple logic, if my previous inquiry is dubbed impossible or unlikely by you guys. So what do you think? Is that enough time to become comfortable enough to write in c++ taking into consideration a game dev. Library?

Edit: I forgot to mention I have a fairly strong background in calculus/vectors, linear algebra etc, as well as a simple understanding of how programming works (Java 101) and then of course my background in design.

Edit2: I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding, my fault of course, but I should've mentioned I don't expect to write an engine from the ground up. Just enough cpp knowledge to tinker with/modify one of those free-to-make game engines like unity/udk/cryengine.

Thanks!

I only saw a brief amount of people but from what I gathered I saw jeans, skirts, dress pants and blazers without ties, and button ups but no full suits. [This](http://i.imgur.com/olrhwrb.jpg) is what I wore to the interview. I was thinking basically along the same lines as that but with [this](http://imgur.com/SS9X41k) shirt and tie combo and maybe grey dress pants and the shoes in that picture. Thoughts? Basically dress shoes + button up + tie, too hot for any sweaters or anything. As an intern I want to make a good impression

Also side note what pants, button ups, and ties would go with [those blue and brown shoes in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/Snsw4NW.jpg) I would like to pick those up seeing as I have one set of brown dress shoes and one set of black already.

39utxo,2,2015-06-14,"It is a catch 22 to be educated, but then lose your job, and trying to make new forms of income (legally), you apply for what society thinks is lower level jobs, and can't get them?",stephencrowe50,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/39utxo/it_is_a_catch_22_to_be_educated_but_then_lose/,"I think a new law of sorts needs to be established, that allows people who had higher level jobs of one sort or another, and then through let's just sum it up to bad luck due to a number of reasons, (either bad economy, the industry had a slow down, i.e. and was laid off) and thus lost that job, and now has to find new ways of making money to pay for living expenses be able to get what society deems as lower level jobs without having to fudge their resume.
This is the because I think I am facing this problem now. I use to be an archaeologist. I graduated in May 2002, and after finishing school from Suny New Paltz I went to Ireland to do a archaeological field school (aka dig) which is like an internship in most of other jobs, because most cultural resource management companies (the main companies in the U.S. that hire archaeologists to do pedestrian survey and field work); require all applicants now to have it under their belt before they can even try to be hired.
Anyway in 2006 after working for these companies for a few years. I got laid off from R.C. Goodwin and Associates, and about a month later I went to graduate school at Ball State University to get my masters.
Anyway long story short. Due to realities I was living with at the time, while I attended graduate school (though I considered this advance work in my field) I technically wasn't making any money. I could afford it for a little bit, because I had saved before, and though I was concerned about making no income, as I said I could afford it, and I justified it by telling myself, that I was finishing a advance degree and that when I finished I would get a better job in my old field to justify the time spent obtaining this extra piece of paper.
Anyway lo and behold, I don't graduate until 2012, due to unforeseen issues with finishing up the final graduation requirements. At this time I am already back home (meaning I had to move back in to old my old home in NYC), and I am in NYC. At this point I have applied to archaeological companies, even ones I worked for in the past, and I never got a response. I called some, but damn did they sound annoyed that I even called inquiring about the resume I sent to them, so I stopped this practice. Anyway I never heard back from any of them, except for one back in 2014, that was going to hire me, but due to the fact that I needed just a few days to get things in NYC settled, (due to the fact that I was working a part time gig job at this time) before I worked for them on another temp job (which was only going to be for about two months), this was too much time on their end to wait for me, so the job got rescinded.
Anyway, main point is so since officially graduating, I have just done part time gig work. It's ok as a job. I am not complaining about the job, but it is not a career, and it is one of these jobs that overtime, I feel they won't want to hire me anymore.
I can't really go back to school again, (since in this country) we charge students to learn a ton of money) before hiring any of them, and yet we live in a time where after paying that ton of money and time, your not guaranteed even a entry level job in the profession you chose to study.
Again I am now trying to move to a more steady job for the time being (as my gig job for a few months) has ended yet again in late April, (well though I worked two weeks ago on another). My main question is this, I have applied to what I deem more regular jobs in the last few weeks as well, but I haven't heard anything from any of them?
Is this because I listed my education, for a cashier job at petco and other similar jobs of this nature which society sees as low level? Even if I smudge it off, what do I say I was doing from 2006 to 2012, sitting on the computer eating bon bons lol. Yeah this was a joke, but I feel I am really in a bind that I can't legally get out of?
I have done other independent work since then too, and hopefully some of it will sell one day, but in the meantime I can't be guaranteed that it will ever make any money?
Furthermore, I have tried to learn new skills, such as java, python (two main programming jobs) since the hell I've been through since graduating from graduate school. Yet these endeavors are not overnight, and in this field things change fast enough, that I am wondering if I am just wasting my time, though I am about to learn HTML 5 too.
I say I wonder if I am wasting my time, because it seems that there was a unwritten law made in our society that the only people who are allowed to start out in a field are those that just turned 18?
Yet when I was 18, (wow that was such a different world) and it really wasn't a million years ago either), but I was as I stated here prepping for a different field so I was not focused on computers. Though sometimes I attack myself (being the gamer that I was) that I never considered that by switching majors to computer science that maybe I could get a job designing games.
I attribute that fault to what I call my generation or at least I had in our thinking which is called linear thinking. This basically just means that when I was starting out in college, it was during a time where so many people (were implied) that going to college for anything would lead to something better, and I think that whatever major you studied was going to lead to a specific job in that specific field for life, or then what was the point of going to college at all?
Anyway if anyone can suggest anything based off what I've said, I'm open and appreciative.
Thanks

39uvie,1,2015-06-14,(Abusive parents) How do I qualify as an independent student if I am below the age of 24?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39uvie/abusive_parents_how_do_i_qualify_as_an/,"Hello Reddit

I don't usually post things on here, but I need some help in my situation. I'm going to be a junior in college starting next fall. I'm turning 20 in a couple of months, and I want to achieve financial independence from my abusive family. My parents have been abusive all my life (both emotionally and physically- less physically abusive lately though), and I'm not kidding when I say they argue every day- usually about meaningless things. They blame my sister and I for all of their problems, and make me feel like crap on a daily basis. Whenever I try to make my own decisions, or do anything that anyone else would consider normal, they make a big deal about it and threaten to not pay for my school. They even threatened to not pay for it if I did not break up with my boyfriend at one point. I do not understand this because I get good grades, work, and I don't cause trouble. I know that they are not obligated to pay for my school, and I appreciate that they do. I just want to be able to pay for it on my own without having to live in an abusive situation.

I've been putting up with their abuse for years, but I just don't think I can take much more of it. I don't have a lot of money- I have a job at university and I'm doing an internship over the summer so I think I will be able to save around 4 or 5k by the end of summer. I've been taking steps to become independent of them, but I don't think I'll ever be able to afford university on my own if I am considered a dependent student. I'm opening up a savings account and I will remove them from my bank account (it is a jointly owned Chase College bank account). My boyfriend says that I will be able to move in with him and his mother if I decide that I want to leave home.

My main problem is that I can't afford to pay $3,500 per semester for school. I go to a state university and it is not as expensive as some schools, but I just don't have that kind of income. I make $8.25/hr at my student work job. I don't have any other family members living in the US because we moved here from a different country.

Do any of you know if it will be possible for me to become an independent student? Also, I do not want to file charges against my parents. I want there to be someone who is able to pay for my sister's college, and I do not want to mess that up for her. I want to be able to leave without causing too much drama.

I have been programming for a few years as a hobby, took several computer courses in school, but I don't exactly think I have good or perhaps even decent skills.

I'd like to get an internship or even do free lance work while I wait for school to start up.

I live in a small town about thirty minutes from Seattle and am attending the University of Washington in the fall, so I have access to a few major companies if the opportunity arises. However, after talking with my dad, he thinks that I should wait until I have about a year of actual CS education under my belt before pursuing internships etc.

If you have any comments, anecdotes, or advice, I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.

More specifically, what can I do to land myself an internship and/or even work during the summer?

Ive been lurking for quite a while, this community has been an endless source of entertainment and knowledge...

A little background info:

28/yo male living in the east sf bay area, CA. Been using h for the last 3-4 years, currently averaging 1-1.5g/day mostly insufflated.

 I got busted recently and was put on pc 1000 drug diversion. I really have no desire to quit but jail is a non option. My work place is a highly.competitive internship so being late or sick or absent for any amount of time means i lose out on my dream job. Ive tried doing a quick sub taper but subs dont do shit for the mental cravings and i relapsed. I think my best option at this point is trying to get into a methadone maintenance program but the ones ive found so far all keep essentially the same hours which would interfere with my work schedule. I generally work 6am-3pm. The ones ive found are open 5am-1pm and this would mean i would have to be late or leave work early every day to get my dose which would quickly leave me out of a job which would quickly leave me homeless...

Basically, I am wondering if anyone knows if there are methadone clinics that either open at like 4am or earlier or close at 4pm or later...  I have insurance (blue shield of ca) or can pay cash if they dont do insurance. If anyone can point me in the right direction i would appreciate it.

(Ps i hope this doesnt count as sourcing. Please forgive me for any spelling mistakes Im typing this on my mobile. Thank you for reading and safe nods!)

(added) *If anyone has been through pc1000 in the east bay please message me I have some questions I would like to ask. Thanks!!  "

Doing the whole long distance thing with my girlfriend and am excited that she is coming down on July 15th.  She will be here from Wednesday night until Tuesday morning, so I want to have a plan of what to do while she is here. I've already started sketching out things to do and would like your input.  I'm not running a strict schedule or anything, but do want a rough outline.  Here's what I got:  

Wednesday  

*  Pick here up from airport at night
* bring her to my home and relax  

Thursday  

* I think I'm going to have to work on Broadway from 10ish to 4, so drive her down and let her bounce around and explore while I work
* Afterwards I don't really know, thinking of going to Cafe Coco for their writer's night.

Friday  

* pack a picnic lunch and go to some nice park (not Centennial, probably going there Saturday)  
* Go out to a nice dinner.  I'm thinking City House and we could walk around Germantown.  
* Maybe grab ice cream somewhere afterwards, go to Love Circle?
* If time is good head over to a midnight movie at Belcourt (hopefully they have a good movie, their calendar isn't that far ahead)

Saturday  

* There's Jazz in the Park at Centennial from 7-10, so I really want to check that out and go dancing
* Maybe hang out at a nearby bar afterwards?

Sunday  

* I got nothing so far

Monday  

* Wake up early and drive to Cummins Falls to hike and swim. Grab lunch in Cookeville and head back.  

Thoughts? I appreciate any and all input.  I feel like there is more I need to do but am unsure.  Gotta fit some hot chicken in there somewhere.  Thanks in advance!"

So I'm going into my ""junior"" year at a University studying another field of Engineering. I've come to a realization that it is not the path I want to take and am going to make the switch to Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering. Due to the change I have pretty much completed all the classes outside of CSC. So I will be taking a load of csc classes a semester which probably isn't very recommended.

1) I know this is probably on here more than once daily, but what would be the best in-debth guides that will put me ahead? I'm open to trying to learn all the languages and would really like to start working on my own projects before school actually starts back up.

2)Also, as I will be graduating in 2-2.5 years. At some point I will need an Internship or other ways of earning experience. Outside of internships what would be the best way of earning experience that I can put down on a resume? Would personal projects count as experience? 

3) I have three concentrations to choose from? What will I be learning differently in each of these? What jobs would I be able to go into with each of these concentrations?

- Software Engineering
- Computer Science and Second Discipline
- Disturbed Systems and Networking


Sorry for asking, I've just been researching it for the past week and no guides that I have looked at have really caught my eye.

39vp4f,1,2015-06-15,Internship Anxiety,cinematicc_,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39vp4f/internship_anxiety/,"I started working as a graphic/web design intern about a month ago in a medium sized company.

In the semester prior to this, I had been working extremely hard,balancing school work and my retail job while also sending job applications everywhere downtown. I knew that I was ready for an internship and did not want to return to retail this summer. I hit a few unpleasant ""obstacles"" in the job application process - mainly interviews gone bad, which motivated me to land an internship even more! I really had my mind set on what i wanted to do and could say i was ""relentless"" in sending out job applications. Eventually by the 2nd last week of school where I could say I was just about to call it quits, my hard work payed off; I got hired, and started working one week after the semester finished. 

Fast forward a month later, i still don't feel like i've settled in properly. I'm having an extremely hard time connecting with my colleagues at work and fitting in in general.  There's constant pressure for me to do extremely well. One of them being that there are other Uni students here who honestly seem far more skilled than me. As much as I push myself, i cant keep up. I've already finished 1 project for my director and he didn't seem to happy about it.

Now i'm fearing i may lose this internship due to low performance and incompetence. I feel like they're expecting me to produce the same quality of work as the other students - even if they're in upper years. Couple that constant worry with a near 2hr commute everyday and an online elective... at this point i just feel extremely drained...

TLDR: Like i said, i'm extremely worried i'll lose this job after all my hard work (even if it's an internship) and will just be discouraged afterwards to try it again.My google history is riddled with subjects like ""Fired from my internship"" and stuff similar to that..I was really looking forward to this summer. I was just wondering if anyone here's gone through something similar and would really appreciate any advice on how to deal with this.

It has been 2 months, she has been back for a month and I miss her. Not sure if I should contact her. 

NOT TL;DR: 

I'm 22 and this has been my first ""serious"" relationship, one where I have loved my SO and I could see a long term future between us. I'm also a dunce with relationship advice, hence why I'm here. 

I graduated in the fall and took my placement exam for Gradschool after the new year. My relationship with my gf at the time was shaky... we fought a lot, but made up. On New Years eve we were arguing a lot and I started to feel some anxiety. I asked if we could step outside and she really objected and I felt like it was because she didn't care enough to. Her sisters friends all told her about all of the cute guys she would see overseas on her trip in the upcoming month and it was all right in front of me, which really bothered me. 

Finally, after someone started blasting music and everyone started dancing, we went outside and talked. I told her I wanted to be clear from now on and to settle all of our past arguments. We talked about all of our disagreements in the past year and we agreed we had to be positive, especially if she was going overseas for a few months. 

Suddenly our days went by smoother and we communicated so well, it was like a switch had turned and we were on good terms -- even when we argued it was peacefully resolved. 

She left for the trip and immediately it became more difficult. It was harder to reach her, as we were living on different hours and we both had work, but I tried hard to make it work. I would stay up a little later to chat with her and she would call me during my lunch breaks. 

Things began to turn ugly as our fighting began again, usually over miscommunication. One day, she accused me of going on a date with a girl (I'll call her Susie) she thought liked me. I told her honestly, not only did we both (Susie and I) snapchat the same restaurant a day apart, I had not seen Susie in weeks. She didn't believe me and argued for days, which quite frankly made me suspicious. The age old idea that when someone accuses you of a wrong doing might signal they are feeling guilty of it themselves, perhaps to justify their own -- in this case, alleged cheating? 

She finally calmed down after a few days and we were having a chat during my lunch break. I was awfully tired that day in particular because I had stayed up talking to her and I had a huge workload that I remember particularly well. Unfortunately, I didn't seem as interested in what she was talking about as she would have liked and she dropped this on me: 

**""Maybe I should just be going out instead of wasting my time. You clearly don't care anyways.""**

That echoed in my mind and I responded with ""fine."" 

She texted me a while after apologizing, but it had done its damage and I was furious. I ignored her for 3 days, something I never would have done because I just enjoyed talking to her --- up until then, that is. I got a text from her on the third day saying ""Did you delete me from Snapchat? I can't see any of your snaps...""

I had not. I told her. This only drove her to ask if we were even dating anymore. I thought for a second and it occurred to me I was no longer interested in our relationship. Yes, after 1.5 years, I was just tired of fighting, tired of the stress, tired of walking on eggshells when she was upset, taking blame for anything that went wrong, etc.

I told her we should break up. Now, she was continents away and this was all mid conversation.... so I had texted her saying this. She immediately calls me in tears telling me we shouldn't, if anything we just need time alone. I told her no, it was time that we had a clean break. I tried justifying it by saying it was because I was a distraction to her work and she instead took it to mean I broke up with her based off of her poor scores on the placement test (we had taken the same test). I explained I still loved her, I just knew I didn't want to be with her because it caused both of us a mutual stress and that it just would get worse. 

She didn't take kindly to this, but I answered her calls regardless. One was the crying, one more later was in tears in anger. Finally another a day later in tears, begging for forgiveness to which I almost just gave in to... but I stuck to my gut and I stayed on the line with her. I love this woman and I told her I wanted her to be happy, but I told her we just didn't click and it was heartbreaking for myself as well. 

She called again the next night, but I was asleep and I missed her call. I called back and she told me never mind. 

We hadn't talked for a month and she finally returned. I texted her saying we should talk, not as a gesture of getting back, but as closure and just to calm things down. I was sure that she was upset and I wouldn't blame her for not wanting to see me. She agreed to meet, but later went back on it angrily saying she had seen my true character and never wanted to see me again. That was on April 15th. 

 
It is now June 15th.

I miss her and I really want things to be good between us. I'm not 100% sure I want to get back together, but I do know that I miss our friendship and I really don't like that she now basically hates me. Of course, this is out of my control, but I really wish it could be better. 

I know it would be best to not talk to her unless I was sure I wanted her back, but something tells me even if I did go for it she would definitely not be okay with it. 

As an outsider reading this, should I reach out to her? Would I be disrespecting her healing process? Am I closing a window to make this work if I just don't say anything?"

Right now, in my daily life I work 30 hours a week, have 25 hours of classes a week (excluding any assignments/projects done outside of class) and I spend about 20 hours at my internship. I am so fucking burnt out. It's been 9 straight months and I've got 3 more to go. I am starting to lose my mind, to be perfectly honest. On top of having dislocated my knee cap a few months and and recently being told that I've got fairly severe anemia, as well as a parasite I picked up while travelling in what seems like another lifetime ago, it's no wonder I'm so fucking tired. Any amount of stress is almost debilitating at this point. My mind has no more will to deal with it. I feel like a fucking brat for feeling this way though.

I know that there are many people who have worked harder and done more, but I'm not one of them. I need my rest. My brain's so foggy. 

I have had a long history with depression throughout childhood and my teenage years, I can feel the disease creeping back into my life at this point. A part of me is scared that it will take over. My anxiety is full throttle and I depend on alcohol to put myself to sleep. The only reason I don't let myself hurt myself is because I'm worried my partner will notice. No. I know she will.

I created a 'ms paint' style application which uses graphic methods to draw shapes in different colors on a graphic object.
I would like to use this for my next program and I was able to embed it´s Content Pane in the GUI still maintaining full functionality.


Now here´s the part where I need some help.
I want to use the draw functionality to create low res graphic objects (200x200p), but I would like the drawing area (canvas?) to be bigger than 200x200p and to be scaled down afterwards to the small res graphic.

Now when I just draw on a 800x800p canvas and then scale it down with the graphic intern methods most information is getting lost because of the 1p wide lines getting scaled down to nothing.

So I was thinking of either magnifying the small drawing area to a satisfying size, so the user actually only draws a 200x200 picture in a bigger user interface (so the pixels get displayed bigger like magnifying your browser with ctrl+mousewheel).

The other option in my head was to somehow change the drawing thickness, so the program fills 4x4 pixels instead of ony one pixel for drawing commands. Then i hope i should be able to scale it down from 800x800 to 200x200 without losing informations.

Do you guys know if there´s a way to implement any of the two options or is there even a better option available?

Cheers, omaboy

Then our contract with our student accommodation ended and it took us a month of couch surfing, back-packing and calling in favours before we found a place to live.

Now our course requires us to do 6 months study then go on a 9 month internship before we start studying again. Since my girlfriend had so much catching up to do it she wasn't able to get one for 3 months which was unbelievably stressful and meant she pretty much spent nothing to do for 3 months.

This all lead to us fighting a lot more than we have ever before and its starting to strain the relationship. Shes been moody and grumpy and unaffectionate, whilst ive been constantly tired, dickish and pretty insensitive. She's said some means things, ive said some mean things and although we love each other it just doesnt feel like it did before.

Everybody is amazed were still together after everything we have been through but honestly we've had some pretty bad fights lately and I just don't know if we can survive.

I guess I just want some advice from people who have been through similar situations as to what do you do when you want to stay together but you're so tired of all the stress.

TL;DR Been through a few hellish months and want to know how to make it through together.

39x9ix,1,2015-06-15,College graduations are supposed to be a good moment in a person's life. Why do I feel the opposite?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39x9ix/college_graduations_are_supposed_to_be_a_good/,"In about 26 hours from now, I’m supposed to be starting what’s expected to be one of the best moments of my life – college graduation. It’s supposed to be a time where people celebrate and feel happy about moving on into the next chapters of their life, whether it’s more schooling, joining the workforce (while having $100,000 in debt in some cases) or following whatever dreams still exist.

If it’s supposed to be a good moment in a person’s life, then why do I feel the exact opposite?

All this graduation ceremony stuff has done is cause stress, mental exhaustion and sadness. I’m expected to act completely fine and happy when my a-hole of a Father comes from Florida in five hours to see me for the first time since 2012 for this graduation ceremony. I’m supposed to act like this past year hasn’t been absolute hell, from having my Grandmother die to moving into her house to having hundreds of mental breakdowns. I’m being forced to hide the fact I’m gay from my Father by my idiotic and annoying Mother who expects me during all of this to simply smile and let my Dad spend the night at my house, something she planned two weeks ago and expected me to agree to him staying here. All of this is supposed to be happening the day before the one year anniversary of my Grandmother’s (and my happiness’s) death when she was the one who cared about my schooling more than both of them combined.

I wasn’t even planning on going to graduation until two weeks ago. I had been told by people in the optional third-year that most people skipped graduation last year, but I found out the exact opposite from my program coordinator when I told her I wasn’t coming. She was disappointed and said she “wanted to see me walk across that stage” tomorrow.

I’m lucky I can even graduate this year in the first place. This year was the second year taking my two-year converged journalism program. I was expected to excel the whole year with straight As and produce the best broadcasts possible as the co-lead of our school’s news radio show on a weekly basis.

I had all this expectations coming into last September and ended up falling flat on my face.

I ended up missing multiple assignments for almost every class and went from being a sociable person (despite having Asperger’s Syndrome) and wanting to work every day to not trusting anyone in my classes and being unable to get out of bed most days. Soon, I had to drop my co-lead position and take a month off of my internship during first semester. By December, I had a mental breakdown while trying to write a cover article for HockeyNow Magazine and went to the hospital three times in three months to get help. By March, I had been there six times and the hospital refused to treat me anymore because I didn’t go to the small mental health clinic they sent me to (I had no time to do so unless I skipped class daily). Now, I’m unable to get help for at least six months because none of the psychologists or physiatrists in my area are accepting new patients. In Canada, it seems as though you’ll only get help for mental health if you either A) try to kill yourself, not just say you want to do so or B) are extremely crazy.

During all of this, my GPA started to suffer. I went from having a 3.9 GPA to about a 3.2. I also failed an online elective course, the first time I failed a class in my life. I was lucky I could get an online tutorial course to make up the credit, or else I wouldn’t had been able to graduate until January 2016.

Basically, in the past year, I’ve deteriorated from being confident, happy and able to pass off as normal to being an autistic social freak. I’ve gone from loving attending college to dreading going to classes. I can’t trust my family or any friends I have left anymore, let alone myself. I was supposed to never even make it past high school according to my doctors when I was five, so for some, my “drop from grace and mental stability” or whatever you can call it is probably not much of a surprise.

Right now, I feel like breaking down and crying. Heck, I’ve already done that four times in the past two days. I’ve already contemplated stabbing myself in the wrist or stomach with a dirty breakfast knife and smashing everything I own in my house this morning. The stress of tomorrow and my future is getting to me.

This year has been so full of bullcrap that I don’t know how to see this graduation ceremony as a good moment in my life. Am I supposed to be happy about not having anything to do with myself until next September? Am I supposed to be smiling about having no real friends or people I can trust and being isolated in a house for a majority of the summer? Am I supposed to look on the bright side when I can’t see where I’ll be in two days, let alone two years or two decades? Heck, I can’t even see myself anyone other than working as a Walmart door greeter or going to college still in 10 years due to the stress of daily life and constant burnouts eating away at my brain.

College graduations are supposed to be a good moment in a person’s life, but for me, I’m dreading every second of it, because as soon as the music stops and I walk out of that banquet hall tomorrow, I’ll still be a hopeless idiot who means nothing to the world."

I've been out of undergrad for two years, sitting on a worthless liberal arts degree and getting dicked over by my no-benefits job in all kinds of ways. I've been looking seriously into going back to school for CS (playing around with the MIT OCW class for a couple weeks, and I love it so far). I really want the external motivation of a structured program as I get started, and I believe I've found a way to pay for it and actually make money in the process. My only hangup is that undergrad is a big time investment. I'd probably be doing at max 9 hours a semester as I work a full-time job, per the school-payment program I'd be using. A 60 hour courseload will have me (assuming I intern for summers) graduating at around age 27 or 28 with the skills and degree of the average 21 year old CS grad. Granted, 28 is way better than 29, and it's still a great investment so I can be succeeding in a great career when I'm 40. Even so, can I be doing this smarter?"

I've held a job my entire life but they were all part-time/college jobs. I feel like I do a good job in all of my interviews but so far I am looking at 3 No's, 1 Job offer, 1 I haven't heard back from, and 2 interviews in the upcoming week. I couldn't accept the job offer because the position paid less than I expected it to but I talked to the company about it and they really liked me and just told me to give them a call if/when I change my mind and they will have an opening for me.

Is there something I should be doing differently? Everyone I ask keeps telling me that I'm doing really great and I should be thankful I have so many opportunities popping up but is that really what's happening?

As a side note, how do you find jobs that just require a general Bachelor's? I'm much more interested in the rehabilitation side of CJ rather than the law enforcement side so that's what I've been applying to (Non-profits etc.) but I would like to branch out and see what else there might be for me. The only way I've been getting all of these interviews is indeed.com, that's really the only place I've been using. Am I missing certain resources or is that a good collection of job opportunities?

I'm particularly interested in BCG since I heard they take the most PhDs (true?).  Since their deadline for 2015 applications was Apr 12, is it too late to still be considered for a 2015 start?  I'm thinking of calling up one of the recruiters for my school to ask him/her directly.

If it is too late, would it still be possible to apply for 2016 and what type of work should I do in the meantime (perhaps specialized consulting)?  Would my chances be lower for 2016 not being a fresh graduate?

I should mention 3 things:

1)  I'm a bit older than the average graduating PhD (29 vs. 27-28) because 

2)  Took some time to build a startup that did not work out, hence total PhD time was 7 years.

3)  Did two industrial internships while in grad school which I think a significant plus.

Lastly, should I as an Engineering PhD be considering any other consulting firms in particular?

39ygj7,1,2015-06-15,"I'm not in debt, but I'm sick of having no money in savings and not being able to buy anything big. How do I become better at saving?",Radcliffes_Asshole,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39ygj7/im_not_in_debt_but_im_sick_of_having_no_money_in/,"TL;DR since this got long: I don't have any debt, but I'm terrible at saving money and way more dependent on my parents than I'd like to be. How do I save more of my money? What are ways to stop myself from spending it?

20 yo college student. Like I said I don't have any debt besides plenty of student loans, but that's mostly because I don't own a credit card and don't have a way of getting into debt even if I wanted to.

However, I'm sick of constantly being poor. My parents don't *mind*, but I'm tired of having to ask them for money, or ask my girlfriend to pay for my dinner when we go out. I have literally zero dollars in my savings account. I quit my food service job in November, and couldn't find another one until February so that completely ate through any money I had saved up from that. The job I found only gave me 5-8 hours a week, at minimum wage, so I was getting like 75 dollar paychecks every two weeks - so I left the school year with no money in savings either.

What brought this up was an ER visit that I got a bill for - my parents are kind enough to still cover my medical expenses, but it made me realize that if I had an actual emergency I needed to pay for, I just couldn't do it without there help. All the big things I need or want to buy - a new computer (need), a new set of skis (want) - it feels like I'll never be able to buy because I'm just so bad at saving.

I make ~500 a week over the summer at my internship, but a good chunk of that gets taken in taxes so realistically I probably have 800 every two weeks. I want to learn how to save it so I can buy my computer and pay my parents back some money I owe them, but every time I set aside money for it, I end up needing it instead.

I keep meaning to download YNAB or something like that, just haven't gotten around to it... but I need more than that. Even if I put $100 of my paycheck into savings and say ""this is not going to be spent"", in a week and a half I've run out of money and I need to buy gas and food that that $100 gets pulled out anyways.

So - people who weren't necessarily in debt, but were terrible at saving your money. What changed? How did you learn to keep your money instead of buying things? I love spending money way too much, and ideally I'd like to learn how to save it before I have to become truly independent and get fucked over by real life."

I owe my parents a copious amount of money and I have spending problems. I have a poor diet. My weight is becoming more and more of a problem. I have no real friends.

At this point I was feeling pretty down, but I attributed that mostly to the bad job I had. I thought I could fix it by getting another job, so I did.

I've been at this new job for about 6 months now, and I have the same feeling. But worse. I don't enjoy this career, I don't love my partner, and I don't particularly feel like being alive either.

I keep having these invasive thoughts while waiting for my train and out in public. I'll stand right on the safety line as a train approaches, and I think ""Jump. Do it. Nobody cares about you anyway"". I have to physically turn myself away from the track and the train to stop myself. A similar thing when crossing roads. Of late, I'll see a car approaching, I'll slow down and think ""Go on. Hit me. Please"". I feel like I'm just following the same routine day-in day-out, waiting until I finally die.

I'm scared and I don't know how to get out of this. I need to talk things out with someone."

Was this wise to accept? I see a lot of people on here saying that $65k-$75k is normal for entry level CS jobs. I understand that I don't have experience or internships under my belt so it's reasonable that it's lower, but should I have held out or negotiated a higher salary? Houston is relatively cheap to live in, and there is no state income tax, however I'm still under the impression that this is low.

Fast forward a few months and there is an election here in Alberta, and I end up volunteering for the party I like , who end up winning in a landslide. Suddenly my career options look better than they have in years. But, its been over a month since the election and all I've gotten for a response has been a text from a former staffer giving me an email of a guy to apply to. I've applied to work there a lot and its the same guy I've gotten zero response from in the past. 

Needless to say, I'm not too optimistic about finding a job there, but it still early I think. i keep reading in the news about how the new gov. has brought in people from outside the country and things aren't really in full swing yet. But I would really love to work for these guys and it seems like they're just not willing to give me a shot.  So I guess my question is do I wait it out? Or is it worth it to look elsewhere?

After a few dates she said that before anything more serious she had to tell me some stuff about her beliefs and her family.  Turns out they're a really religious family and she and I had some conflicting views about a few things. I figured every couple has their bumps, and proceeded.

As summer progresses I fall more and more in love with this girl.  She tells me that she's moving and transferring to a different school in August.  I was upset, but it's only 2 hours away so we'll still get to see each other.  

After she moved, I'd go see her and spend the night once or twice a week and things were great.  I loved her and she loved me. She loved the way I'd treat her, and I loved the way she'd treat me.  We'd always get each other little gifts and leave little notes sitting around.  A damn near perfect couple in my eyes.

She showed me around and I really started to like the town and the school so I decided to transfer there as well to finish my last two years of my degree (it's a better school anyway) and to be closer to her.  Bad idea.  As soon as I moved it immediately became apparent that I'd made a huge mistake.  My second day of my first semester there she tells me she's going to be in New York all summer for an internship then got all pissy when, even though I was really happy for her, I wasn't just jumping up and down on the table at the fact that she'd be gone all summer, for our anniversary, for her birthday, and for my birthday.  

From that point I started to spiral back into that wonderful abyss we call depression.  I have dealt with it probably since middle school, trying all kinds of different medications.  I had finally found something I thought was working and made me feel great which is how I ended up meeting her in the first place.

The combination of being in a new place knowing no one, then finding out that the one person you do know, who's supposedly 'always there for you' is going to very far from there for you hit me really hard.  After that we started to argue more and more and spent maybe one night overnight together my whole first month there. She either always somehow ""had to study"" for 12 hours a day or had some reason to not see me, which made me feel totally neglected. I still went to class, but apart from that at this point I'd pretty much just sit in my apartment by myself most of the time.  Nothing was fun to me anymore.  I lost all interest in music, the sports I play, any social activities. I don't have any friends here except for her, and we just keep fighting now. All I wanted was to curl up in my bed.  She knew I was struggling with it and would sometimes try to help then just get really frustrated when she couldn't magically make me feel better in 10 minutes.

One night I asked her to spend the night and she said no, she had a friend over.  I asked if I could just see her for a minute, again no.  

It really upset me so I just said ""okay."" and left it at that.  She kept texting me that night and I didn't respond for a little while... which turned into ""Why are you always ignoring me?"" ""I'm sorry it's all my fault you hate it here."" 

The next day I asked her to come over and she did.  While we were sitting there I pretty much broke down in tears and told her exactly how terrible I was feeling, how upset I was about her not wanting to see me, why I'm always so quiet or it always seems like something's wrong.

To which she replied ""maybe we should just be friends"" 

I just hugged her and said okay and sat there and cried my eyes out for the next few days.

Once I was over that initial sadness I really thought I was perfectly fine for a few weeks.  I tried to talk to some new girls and tried to make a few new friends.  After about 3 weeks it hit me how hurt I really was.  I was just pretending to be interested in these girls and people I had nothing in common with to make myself feel like I'm not alone.  

Then I discovered that even though I was alone, thanks to the liquor store down the block, I could at least be numb to it which is when I started drinking.  It made life bearable again.  The days were still tough and seemed to drag on forever but at least I could look forward to getting home and making a drink, then another one, the another one, then straight vodka until I can fall asleep basically every night.  

One night I was embarrassingly drunk and got upset over something she said online (stupid...I know) and did something I'll always regret and never stop kicking myself for. I sent her a message that, to this day, I hope I never have the opportunity to read.  I woke up the next morning and realized what I'd done so I sent her another message sincecely apologizing for what I had did the night before and asking if there was any way I could fix it.  She told me to never try to contact her again.  

I probably deserved it for being such an asshole.

So it's been about three months since we broke up now, I still live alone in apartment that always reminds me of her, somewhere I don't really like, where everything reminds me of her, and I can't really take it anymore.

Since then I got a job I do enjoy to occupy some of my time and keep me busy, but since it's summer I don't have class so I still have a lot of time to sit around, over think what I'll never be able to go back and fix, and feel like shit about it.

I know there's no point in beating myself up over it anymore because it doesn't help at all, but it hasn't left my mind since it happened.

I've tried to get over her.  I've tried talking to numerous girls and it always ends up with me realizing that no one will replace what I had and make me feel exactly like that again.  

The old (well, not really) adage ""The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else."" is not by any means true all the time.  I got with a girl and it just felt wrong.  Almost disgusting in a way.  After I got home from her place I felt like a horrible person and like I was just trying to use her to forget about my ex.  She was well aware of that because the whole reason that happened is she had asked about my ex and I told her the situation and that was her solution to forget about her.

I go to work whenever I have to, but other that that Reddit, reruns of tv shows, drinking, and staring at the wall are about the full extent of my daily schedule.

I don't find joy in the little things in life that used to make me happy.  I don't even find joy in the hobbies I've invested thousands of dollars into and have always loved.  I feel like I've lost most of my old friends, one good friend has been there for me so I go visit him and his girlfriend at their place whenever I can, even though he's two hours away.  Even that makes me kind of sad though, seeing them together and happy, probably on the verge of getting engaged.  I'm happy for them, but it's tough to see right now.

I try to go out and do stuff but always end up spending 5 minutes wherever it is then going home because I'm not having any fun and don't know anyone there.

After battling with depression for so long then finally getting over it, followed by meeting her and our whole relationship, it feels hopeless to be stuck back here again. I'm sick of dealing with it. I'd honestly never kill myself because I know it's selfish and will just lead to me hurting more people, but I'd almost gladly welcome being blindsided by a bus that I never saw coming.

The only time I really feel happy anymore is when I'm doing something potentially dangerous and adrenaline pumping, like riding my motorcycle.  There I'm kind of in my own little world.  No one can see into my tinted helmet visor, so I can kind of block out the world, go fast, and feel some sort of thrill again.




**TL;DR** Fell in love with a girl, she moved, 6 months later I moved to the same town/school, soon after we started arguing a lot more and broke up, now I'm extremely depressed again and can't get myself to leave my apartment except to go to work."
39yuja,0,2015-06-15,Should I move back home and enjoy college or stay where I am for career experience? [21][M],advicethrowaway4321,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/39yuja/should_i_move_back_home_and_enjoy_college_or_stay/,"Hi guys,

I apologize if this is kind of lengthy but I need some objective advice.

I am currently going to college about 3 hours away from where my parents live, and I'm going into my third year (junior year). I have in my time here made some great friends, and intern at a very selective organization that after 4 - 5 years of college, would be phenomenal on my resume. I have great grades (mostly As, 1- 2 b+) and am about to be promoted within my internship.

The problem is that I work every waking minute of my college life. I work 30ish hours a week, volunteer a further 10 - 12 (mandatory for the internship), and even then I'm not really able to cover all of my expenses. I can't afford a car, and can barely support myself. I haven't had any time or money to even think about a college girlfriend, and it's likely to stay that way until I graduate if my schedule doesn't get any lighter. Currently I've noticed my sleep schedule has been ruined, bad eating habits and usually tired which makes keeping up with my gym routines somewhat difficult.

My parents have been pressuring me to come home and finish school there. There is a university within the same school system that I can transfer to (it will delay me graduating about 6 months), but I could live at home and would be able to afford a car, could start to have proper relationships and enjoy my college life. My only concern is that I would be missing out on valuable experience from my internship/job that would greatly help me get a job post college.

So if you guys were in situation, what would you do? Have you been in a position like this before? If so, what helped you decide?

**tl;dr: overwhelmed in current position but set up for great career in several years; or move home and enjoy college/life.**

Thank you for any advice you guys have!"

After not to much trouble, I came upon the program called BrowserHistoryView which saves history from Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari.

  When testing it on my terminal and one of the users computers it worked, even exporting it to a CSV file and differentiating what history was viewed by the different users that used the computer.  However after trying it on about 10 other computers, all others gave me a blank history with the exception of one computer.  My first thought was that those users were using some form of a browsers incognito mode or actually deleting the browser history.  But after watching users leave the computer and confirming that they did not delete the history or use an incognito mode and still getting an empty browser history, I’m a bit perplexed.

39z16g,7,2015-06-15,Do I have enough leverage to re-negotiate my salary after 3 months?,ropapsciss,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39z16g/do_i_have_enough_leverage_to_renegotiate_my/,"So basically I got offered a job about 2 months ago, and accepted a low offer because I had no basis to negotiate at the time. It was 38k, which is a bit low for my position which is essentially a project manager/account manager for a marketing firm. I want to re-negotiate my salary after probation, and specifically want to call it that instead of a raise because that's really what it is. What I want is 45k, which seems a bit high considering my current pay but here are my reasons for why I think I can pull it off:

**Circumstances in my favor (I will not bring these up during negotiations):**

- Me and my manager are the only people who work with our current client, who happens to be our company's biggest client. The company needs me at this point and I would not be easy to replace very quickly.

- Some of the other new hires already get around 40k from what I know
- Someone who was newer than me and relatively bad at their job quit the other day, and the company made their best efforts to still not lose them.

- I know for a fact I handle more projects/earn the company more money than most people in the company, let alone just the new people

**Things I can actively say for myself during negotiations:**

- Always go above and beyond, i.e. staying late, coming early, working from home, etc. This is due to the nature of our client where I have to work extended hours, and the company has had trouble in the past with people who are willing to do this.

- My client relations are well established and heading in a very solid direction. I know the way our company works, the client's company works, and how to make them compatible. 
- Excellent employee relations. I have to work with different departments for our projects, and everything has gone smoothly.

- I can see a future with this company, and the company thrives on long-term project managers who are familiar with the clients, rather than just people using it as a stepping stone
- I got an exceptional review for the first half of my 3 months

**General Facts I will bring up:**

- Industry average for this position is 45k+

- I made more in my previous internship

- I moved to the city for this job (shows commitment) 


I know this much of a jump, especially in 3 months, sounds pretty unreasonable. But I feel like it's not only justified, but flat out unfair if I don't at least get countered with 43 or something. 

Let me know how I should approach this, certain things to be aware of/I should do/ I should avoid. I just want to make it clear that the ball is in my court... It really just comes down to how I play it.

39z5m2,3,2015-06-15,My student job is boring. Should I keep it or not?,Ate_a_muffin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39z5m2/my_student_job_is_boring_should_i_keep_it_or_not/,"Hey CS Career Questions,

I'm a nontraditional student. I'm American, moved to Europe to join a spouse, and started a computational master's degree because I initally couldn't find work. I'm a competent programmer - I know I can keep up with my good classmates, and I place top third in my computational classes. 

I started a student job with a start up in my current town (minor European capitol, and I'm not here by choice). This was two months ago. I've been doing a fairly dull task for them, one that no one else wanted to do and needed to get done. I did good documentation, got praise for my work, got along with a micromanaging supervisor and my other colleagues. 

I'm going away for the summer, but asked them what I could expect in the fall. They told me I could expect work in my competencies - they consider this to be biology, however, and not programming. I can't seem to convince them otherwise. I'm interested in being a better programmer, and I took this job (which pays considerable less than my other gig) so that I could learn. Instead, I wound up on a project that required all of 9 linux command lines.

I'm not against shit work; everyone has to pay their dues. But I'm afraid they're never going to give me anything more challenging. I tried asking my boss a bit about it today, but since I'm gone for the summer, it was hard to get a definite answer. 

I'm trying to figure out the best thing to do in this situation - should I push harder for more challenging tasks? Move on and leave this off my resume? Keep working at a lousy job for a reasonable amount of time so I can put it on my resume?

My concerns are that

* Small community: There are only so many people in my field, particularly in this part of the world. I don't want to burn any bridges

* Reputation in the US: At the same time, I don't plan on staying here forever, and I'd like to keep my resume in good shape for the US. Coming here has been a terrible, terrible career move, but I'd like to make the best of it. 

* Scattered background: Aside from a few years in research science, my resume is a bunch of scattered (if pretty interesting) internships. I'm worried that it looks like I'm job hopping (I'm country-hopping, and the job-hopping is incidental). 

* Cultural norms: Here, it's pretty typical to see people work at one company for a ten-year stretch. My longest job has been four, but I'm late-twenties, so maybe that's not completely unreasonable. 

* Maternity leave: Okay, maybe this one isn't typical for this subreddit, but I'd like to have a kid in the next year or so, and Europe is much better for this than the US. Is it worth putting up with a dull job so that I can have more time with my future offspring (who, honestly, I'm not even sure I'll like all that much)?

A few other things - my soft skills are good, and I'm a decent networker, but I've had an extraordinarily hard time adjusting to Europe. Scratch that, my soft skills used to be good, but just don't seem to work in Europe. I lived in the US and Asia before, and always had a great time, but for some reason, I really don't like it here. I've also done a lot of other things in the past, which don't point straight to developer, but suit a small company nicely.

Thanks in advance for your feedback. "
39z62r,1,2015-06-15,I'm [22M] dating my Girlfriend [21F] of 2 years; trying to fix the potholes we've created.,Cobra1951,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39z62r/im_22m_dating_my_girlfriend_21f_of_2_years_trying/,"I'll get to the points of the relationship because there is way too much detail. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now. We met in 2012 when she was ending a relationship with a guy I knew who was really messed up. I liked her a lot and we started having feelings for each other; only problem was, I went to school out of town. As the fall semester progressed, she started getting distant from me even though I'd come to visit her (we weren't even dating yet). When January came around and it was time for me to start the spring semester and leave again, she basically told me to take a hike.

I got on the road heart broken and moved on with my life. Didn't talk to her after that. Then once April rolled around I got a short text from her telling me to check the mail. She had sent me a letter telling me how much she missed me, how much I motivated her to go out for her professional sport team dancing dreams, etc. At first I was really apprehensive because I didn't want to hear from her again. Then I opened up when she said she would be in town for a graduation. We met up, long story short, love was rekindled and we got into a relationship when I was back home for July and August.

Things went absolutely great. As winter rolled around about 5 months after, we started having our first little arguments. They were about jealousy. Me having a few girl friends, her having a few guys friends (I went to her work Christmas party and found out one of her coworkers was a guy she was involved with when we didn't talk...and she called me his name by accident!). 

She didnt want me talking to a couple of the girlfriends I had, I told her how the few guys she talked to were REALLY friendly and what not. We argued over social media, really immature stuff. This went on for all of 2014 on and off. Fights getting progressively worse. I would travel and spend lots of money on visiting her and even going thousands of miles away to watch her dance (even though I was pretty broke). I decided to expedite my college graduation and finish up in Dec of 2014 so I wouldn't have to be separated from her again and I could move back home. Did that this year, then in Feb of this year she went behind my back and applied to move to LA for the Disney Internship after I made the decision to come back home which in of itself was partially messed up (even though it'll be a great opportunity for her). 

Now going back to the jealousy problem, no one should tell their S.O who to talk to or be friends with. I never did BUT there was this one guy my girlfriend was ALWAYS talking about, she was best friends with him on SnapChat, she hung out with him EVERYDAY at school, she texted him, FB messaged him, came home and talked about him to me, every day all day and I never really thought any thing of it. One day I talked to my best friend about him and he was like oh yeah that guy screwed up my cousin and his ex girlfriends relationship. It hit me like a train and I confronted my girlfriend telling her I backed off from all my female friends yet now I realize you're always talking about/talking to this guy and it REALLY bothers me. That's all I told her. I barely found out that she went and blocked him and also told him to stop talking to her when I thought she was just going to ignore him or tone it down and leave it at that.

So now this friend who I knew years ago (never interested in) started messaging me and making small talk. I always told my girlfriend when she did message me and all of a sudden she got upset; asking why this girl came into my life all of a sudden, blah blah. Every time we've fought since April she throws this girl in my face saying go date her, I can be with her, I can talk to her, etc. etc. I don't even like this girl, I'm not attracted to her (shes 2 years older than me, almost 25 yrs old). My girlfriend even messaged that girl when we fought and said she can have me now...WTF....

We had a horrible argument this past Tuesday and today is the first time my gf talked to me about it. It all boils down to that girl. My girlfriend said I need to block that girl, why can't I even do that for her. She told her guy friend off for me and I cant do the same. My girlfriend pretty much wanted to break up over it and I talked some sense into her. I don't talk to this girl, I don't like her, shes no where near as attractive as my girlfriend, but it doesn't get through to her. We fixed things and my girlfriend is opening up to me (this is as of 4 hours ago) but I don't know if I should block this girl to satisfy her and ""close the door to communication"" or just tell my girlfriend deal with it. I never told her to do what she did to that guy and to be fair, I don't talk to this girl, I haven't hung out with her at all, I don't even have her number! It's just the facebook messages that bother my girlfriend. I don't know what to do...


   
**tl;dr**
-Girlfriend is jealous of a girl that I know who occasionally facebook messages me
-We've been fighting non stop and my girlfriend basically said things wont be normal till I block this girl
-Girlfriend blocked one of her guy friends that  she always talked to him, hung out with him, texted him, messaged him, talked to me about him, etc. and I said it bothered me
-Now she expects me to do the same for this girl that I don't talk to, hang with, have her number, or anything. Shes literally just a friend on FB...
-Now not sure what to do; I don't want to look like a jerk but I just want my relationship back...

PLEASE HELP.

39z6hy,10,2015-06-15,Concerned About My Probationary Period,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39z6hy/concerned_about_my_probationary_period/,"I'm almost done with the first month of my 90-day probationary period of my first full-time job as a graphic designer out of college, but certain things regarding it are really starting to worry me.

The first thing that concerned me is that the probationary period is called an ""internship"" technically and we are called ""interns"" during that time period. I found out later this is normal for employees kept on board, but other things don't sit right with me either.

The biggest red flag I noticed is that I'm replacing another design intern who was also just out of college who was not extended. It's possible management felt she wasn't the right fit, but from talking to some coworkers, she completed her tasks on time and was under the impression up until she was told to leave that she would be extended. I've heard of companies rotating probationary people like this to avoid giving full salary and benefits, so that's what I'm afraid of is going on.

The person I report directly to though, has talked with me in long-term scenarios. Saying things about the future of the company and possible scenarios that involve me that are much further down the road than 90 days. This was comforting, but I haven't talked much to the head of the department, however as he and the president of the company are both on vacation for a while.

All I know to do is play it extra safe and get a lot of feedback about my work. I've scheduled a review with my direct supervisor to find out how I can be the ideal employee. But would it be a good idea to ask about this as well? Or even about the former intern I'm replacing? Perhaps I could contact the former intern myself and ask what happened? It was just a huge process to uproot for this job, and I'd hate to be going home in two months."

This has happened within the past 5/6 interviews, it's becoming really discouraging and I am losing motivation to do anything.

I have good internship experience, 

1. 1 small firm public accounting

2. 1 industry fortunate 500

3. 1 not for profit 

Also have good extracurricular and volunteer experience 

the latest rejection was from an SLP at a regional firm, I connected very well with the partners and most of the staff but the recruiter told me the above statement, and literally said she could see me at a big 4 firm rather. this was my #1 choice as well... which is why i am starting to panic, i thought i honestly had a good chance.. 

I've spoken with some of the career services, they say my interview skills are strong and I am overall a pretty sociable person.

39ze7q,2,2015-06-15,So I had a moment of clarity after experiencing pretty bad (but temporary) panic.,staticrank,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39ze7q/so_i_had_a_moment_of_clarity_after_experiencing/,"I just started an internship this summer, which has been pretty huge for me. A year and a half ago I was pretty much bedridden. I would panic walking down the street. 

Anyway, I got on an SSRI, got back into school, and somehow found my way into a really great internship program. I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt. 

Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous. 

So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided. 

I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do. 

I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie. 

I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start. 

So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys! "
39zgc7,209,2015-06-15,"[AWALT] My single mother made swallowing the pill very, very easy.",Redsqa,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/39zgc7/awalt_my_single_mother_made_swallowing_the_pill/,"Let me tell you why I had absolutely no trouble swallowing the pill. It’s all because growing up I had a very good example right in front of me : my single mother. Her life is a certified platinum TRP case study. Seriously, almost all the clichés are in here.

**tl;dr** my mother tried to trick a married alpha, had me, continued to ride the cock carousel, hit the wall then found herself some nice betabux

She met my father where she used to work. She was only an intern at the time, while he had a job high in the hierarchy, and as a matter of fact was already married. **Women are attracted like flies to social status and higher SMV.**

It did not bother her that he had already a wife or two daughters, even though she met them and hanged out with them quite a lot of times. **Hypergamy does not care.** She told me she ditched her boyfriend because she ""fell in love"" with my father, and they had an affair for a little while. **Women do not love, at least not like men love. They use ‘love’ and other justifications to hamster away their amoral behavior.**

Of course, after some time she wanted him to commit. She wanted him to divorce his wife but he would not. How surprising that she became pregnant around the time their relationship ended. 
This reeks of the good old ""omg the pill did not work i don’t know why"". What she told me is that she refused to see him anymore because he did not want to leave his wife, and then discovered she was pregnant with me. What are the chances ? What my instinct tells me, screams to me, is that she tried to force him to commit with a baby, and he did not want to have anything to do with her anymore. **Women will test and trick you.**

After I was born, she raised me to be a beta bitch, of course. She was overprotective, controlling, and I was so feminized I had more female than male friends as a boy. She fed me feminist bullshit all the time, and I grew up thinking that males were inherently evil. **Women will not help you; some will try to break you and make you comply to the feminine imperative.**

Now, even though she had a child (me), she did not stop riding the cock carousel. She would hang out with guys that would be assholes to her and her toddler. I remember one of them burning me with his cigarette on purpose when drunk, and she just told me to go to my room. Another one, verbally abusing me all the time, but she would disregard his fucked up behavior because he gave her the tingles - I could see it, even though I did not know what it was at the time. **Women have no fucking self respect as long as you give them the tingles.**

Anyway those guys would usually come late at night and leave in the morning. She was just pump and dump to them, and in retrospective, it was hilarious seeing her trying to make them commit. I think she was trying to pull the same trick she did on my father with them, because I also remember her telling me one time that I might have a little brother or sister soon... What the fuck.

She reached the wall, and after a few years all of this stopped. She would say that she was tired of being treated like shit, that she deserved a good man yadda yadda yadda. My ass. **Women will argue that they changed when in fact, it’s only their options that have changed. Women will hamster.**

So you've guessed what happens next right ? DING DING DING You are correct, it's beta hunt season !

She found herself a nice, way older beta dude online. They had a long distance relationship for a while. After the first time they saw each other in person, she told me that he was not attractive and awkward. ‘Oh, too bad for you mom, I'm sure you'll find the ri-’ wait no, turns out Mr. Ugly is loaded ! Of course, she changed her mind. **Women will disregard your looks if your social status is higher than theirs.** They dated for a while, and eventually she moved in with him.

I try to visit them as little as possible, because she treats him like dirt and her behaviour disgusts me. Her sense of entitlement is through the roof. He pays for everything and even though, without him, she would honestly be nothing but a washed up old slut without a dime, she is a nagging and controlling bitch. He paid all her debts (if you did not know, single mothers suck at managing money) and he gives her pocket money to spend on buying useless shit. 
What did she do in return ? She stopped trying to be feminine. Short hair, no make up, no more contacts, no more skirts, no more heels. I think she even stopped shaving her legs. Poor guy. But what can you do, betas don't give the tingles. **If you’re beta, it does not matter how good you are to women, women will never respect you.**

Last I heard she was sleeping in another room because he ""snores too much"". Yeah right. I guess he is not getting any. **Alpha fucks, beta bucks.** But he does not care apparently, he still told her that if anything happened to him, she could have the house. They will probably marry at some point. Some guys are beyond saving… And this reminds me everyday of the hell that awaits blue pillers."

I'm currently studying in Network Security and have been told that Ethical Hacking/Pen Testing is a hard field to make a break in.

So far, I've completed classes in Pen Testing, Microsoft Securities and passed my CEH. My second semester will consist of Web Apps, Cisco Security and Advanced Linux + Python. I've used various tools and exploit modules and have a sound understanding on how a secure network works. 

Any tips would be much appreciated.

39zo4a,3,2015-06-15,Deloitte Advisory,acctpls,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39zo4a/deloitte_advisory/,"Hello everyone,

I recently was notified from Deloitte shortly after attending their leadership conference that I would be given an offer for next summer. I know I will be working as an Advisory intern, but I was wondering what I would actually be doing, since Advisory practice covers a lot in general.

While I was interviewing, they used the term AERS Advisory to explain where I would be in the future if I were to work there. But at the conference, I was told that AERS Advisory group merged with another group to create Deloitte Advisory (Please correct me if I am wrong).

I am a finance/accounting major and an Information systems minor, but I would not be graduating with 150 credits, and I don't plan on becoming a CPA. I sent them my transcript and indicated that I would be graduating without getting my masters. They did not seem to care.

So here are my questions:

1) Is getting a CPA necessary (or required) for the Advisory practice? Would my options within the practice be limited without a CPA?
2) I know there are a lot of services under Advisory (i.e. Cyber risk, valuation, strategic risk, etc.). Given that I prefer to do finance related work, would I be able to ask them to put me under valuation or other finance-related services?
3) If I end up in a group I do not want to be (i.e. IT side of Advisory), will I be able to switch during/after my internship, assuming I am given a full-time offer?

I know the questions I am asking are very premature, but it's been stuck in my head since I got the good news and would love to know the answers. Thank you in advance."

39zwx3,9,2015-06-15,Back at same company for Internship,RotaryRotation,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/39zwx3/back_at_same_company_for_internship/,"Hi All! 

I frequently lurk around here and love the advice a lot of people have to offer here. I don't post on Reddit, but I have something pressing and decided to create an account and get some feedback from the community: 

I currently am a rising Junior pre-engineer at the University of Washington (I will apply as a Mechanical Engineer next academic year). I also want to mention in the past worked at Tech companies (Amazon, Concur) while in High School. Now, I want to bring up my situation at school, my university (UW) follows a quarter system, and my very first year, I only completed literally a whooping 5 credits. I dropped my last two quarters and completed Hardship Withdrawals in some of my classes my very first quarter primarily because of family situations going back home. My family lives just 20 miles east of the University, so I found myself distracted to the problems. Though, I was fortunate enough to land an internship as a Software Engineer at what was a startup with ~200 people. The pay was $20/hour, which was seriously the most I have ever made in my life (hell, my parents even admit that they never made that much in their lives). 

I enjoyed my time at the company, and when the school year came around, I was offered an actual full-time position as a developer. I instead opted to work ~20 - 30 hours at the company and committed to school (I am a first generation college student, and I want to be the first in my family to grab that degree!), but my situation back home still existed. I ended up dropping classes again my first two quarters. My situation back home is entirely financial related, I was helping my parents pay off our bills, monthly rent and so on, so it was tough for me to digest all that few months ago.

When Spring Quarter cam rolling around, I seriously formed a fist with my hands and kind of punched myself (it hurt so bad that I actually had a nice bruise on my cheek for two weeks). It was out of sudden anger that I wasn't succeeding in school, and I am still in square one while I should be moving onto bigger and greater things already. I signed up for full-time amount of credits again, and I am proud to say, I managed to 4.0 every single class. I had an insane amount of motivation this time around, and I figured out a way to keep my tensions with my family back home, and instead focus on my classes, and just being at a great university. (not trying to show off, this is probably my first time I have been this excited in two years!) 

Well, rolling onto this summer, that same company I was already working at wanted me around, so I decided to commit for a full-time position this summer. I will be an Intern, working with the same team, though, the role is still Software Engineer oriented, just as before. The company itself raised a super nice seed funding just two months ago and has jumped to 370+ employees, so it is definitely an exciting time to be at the company, but my problem is, I am a Mechanical Engineering major. I chose the major because of all the career shadowing I did, and the insane amounts of research I did my off time that made me intrigued with the powers of an Mechanical Engineeringl Major. 

I am obviously happy about working at this company, but I have a bigger passion and interest. It is already way too late in the internship application game for this summer, but should I just stick it out this summer at this company, and grow more of my programming skills here? This internship is extremely out of my pursuing major, so I'd love to hear thoughts on this, whether I should just drop it, but in the case you recommend that I should drop it, what should I do with my summer? I'd have over 3 months of free time. 

Another thing that kind of got me was the pay, now I know an internship is all about the experience, but I don't come from a family that lives in a nice home and we have the luxury to buy things at our heart desire, I have slept in a 1 bedroom apartment for my entire life along with my parents and brother. I have some friends going off to big tech companies who are easily making $6,000 - $8,000 monthly at their internships, and it kind of makes me rethink my situation. While I acknowledge this company is growing, would it be smart to possibly ask for a higher raise, as I have been around for over a full year? Or should I accept what I am being paid? If I currently am being paid $25 an hour, would asking for $30 an hour hurt? I apologize if this just sounds purely arrogant to some people, I just want to define my worth and stand by it! 

I am already looking ahead for internships next year, and want to definitely do something in the Mechanical Engineering realm. I know a lot of people mention that Computer Science related internships make most of the internship money, but how much would an Mechanical Engineering internship make? Another question is, especially for big companies, do they cover housing if it required to leave the current city I am in for the summer?

If I were to stick around with this company, what else can I do to make myself extremely appealing to companies looking for Mechanical Engineering interns? In the Software Engineering world, we can always just develop side projects, push them to GitHub and showcase them, but what is an appropriate way to do this as an Mechanical Engineer? I want to make myself as appealing as possible to companies when it comes time to applying for internships again.

And lastly, with my situation mentioned, I am planing to graduate a couple of quarters late (technically be shy of a full 5 years at college), I am sort of leaning on possibly doing a Co-Op Spring Quarter of next year, just to build my my resume. Any thoughts on pursuing this? 

Once again, I appreciate all feedback, and apologize if my questions or tone seems out of norm, just wanted to get right down to the meat of my question :) "

39zzjo,33,2015-06-15,What jobs are available to Computer Science majors?,programminghelp9,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/39zzjo/what_jobs_are_available_to_computer_science_majors/,"So, I am currently getting a post bachelors degree (basically a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, without having to retake the ""fluff"" classes again for a undergrad degree).  I'm doing very well in my courses so far and really enjoy what I'm learning.  

However, I am to finish this program by the end of 2016.  My aim is to get an internship during the summer of 2016.

There are two things I'm trying to decide.  One, what I should be focusing on now to get a good internship/career next year.  Second, what options do I have really and what fields would be good to focus on for someone just starting out in things.

**FIRST QUESTION:**
Is there a website or something out there that gives a list of career options that a recent grad can get into realistically AND have good job prospects for the future?  This is a big thing for me right now.  I want to start focusing on side projects I enjoy AND set me up for success in getting into a field I want to get into.  All I ever hear is stuff like, ""go work out google"".  Well, google is a big company and does A LOT of stuff.  What fields can one get into with a bachelors degree for an internship or 1-2 years after graduating?  

**Second Question:**
What fields are showing the most promise for the future?  I know someone has told me to choose between web dev, mobile dev, and software dev.  Are those the big options for now?  I was considering doing web dev, but honestly get the feeling its going to be oversaturated soon with all the bootcamps and other things.  mobile dev seems interesting, but not sure that is a right decision either.  I know people say do what you enjoy, but financial factors matter too.

**Third Question:**
After answering the above, what do you feel someone should be focusing on for the next year to set themselves up for success at getting a good internship?  If you say side projects, WHAT KIND?  If you say, just study, please say what?  I would just really like to know specifics.  

**Summary:**
Basically, I really enjoy what I have learned so far.  But, I feel its time for me to focus on things outside my class and start setting myself up for a successful internship and career.  I have a year to do this.  What fields can I get into, what side projects should I be doing, and what fields would be best for the future?  

I really would appreciate some help here.  I'm someone who enjoys this stuff but feel I need a little more guidance.

**EDIT:**  Before anyone says, I have asked in the past in /r/cscareeradvice on this and didn't get much responses at all (I deleted it a while back).  I'm just trying here instead too see if I can get a bit more responses.  While I think cscareeradvice is a great sub, I feel like it could be a bit more active at times.

3a01mx,3,2015-06-16,"I made a mistake, and I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to act on it.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a01mx/i_made_a_mistake_and_im_not_sure_whether_its_a/,"Hello! 

I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's in computer science. I walked in May and am just finishing up a hands on course this summer. 

Last year, I had an internship with a company. I liked it, they liked me, I took a full time position. 

In the fall, I had a classmate who was looking for internships. I knew him fairly well and had worked with him on several projects. As such, I told a representative at an event on campus from my company that he might be a reasonable candidate. 

They interviewed and hired him for a part time internship starting later this summer. 

Fast forward to now; I'm working with this individual for a hands on course required by the University to finish my degree. It's done this week, so I'm finished with school for real now. 

Working with him for this course, I'm realizing that perhaps recommending him was a poor choice. Lately he has shown terrible attention to detail, a desire to finish everything very quickly without any foresight for maintainable code in the future, as well as awful communication skills. In addition he has become very poor at handling frustration, refusing to work an entire afternoon because of a conflict in the office. 

I now think that he would be a bad choice for our company. The question is... Do I attempt to tell my company this? I think that it has the potential to tarnish my reputation. However, I'm afraid that might sound immature and as if I'm going back on my word, but on the other hand, the person I told to look at his resume is not a recruiter, and I'm not sure if he ever mentioned it to my boss. Perhaps he simply put his resume in the good pile. 

Additionally, the fact that they interviewed him and made the final call makes me feel comfortable with staying quiet. 

Any thoughts? Should I do nothing? Should I tell HR or my boss? Perhaps be honest with my boss, and just be careful to evaluate him in his internship, as an internship is fairly low risk for the company?

I’ve started this 12 times so here goes nothing;This is my overall successful experiences with r/raobj, if one person gives me shit this is coming down. Warning: This is written horribly and I’ll probably edit it a hundred times. Hopefully I didn't fuck up and this won't get removed

A little background: In the beginning of March I got out of a really shitty relationship after three years together, once I stopped being sad about it and I started to get really horny, I decided to post on this sub trying to get some more experience, having only been with one person I felt like I wanted to be with more people, and improve my skills. I was completely overwhelmed with response, I probably got close to 200 messages, I spent some time going through them and found a few cool people to talk to and try to set stuff up.

Ultimately I ended up meeting up with somone after a lot of back and forth chatting, because basically we could never find a time and a place to meet up, so I blew him in the library…. Twice. Both times were so much fun, it was really hot to sneak around. He’s a really cool guy, and I hope to see him again in the fall to do a little more.


So the semester ended and I had some time to kill between my last final and the start of my internship and I decided to see if raobj had any love for Jersey, so I posted again. I probably got around 75 responses on this post, one message stood out to me from a guy who explained to me that he was in a very open relationship, he had quite a kinky side, and was very cute too. We talked for a day or two, and after getting horrible cold feet out of fear of death one night, I smoke myself up and I went over the next night. The three of us hung out and smoked for around an hour and just had some casual conversation, it was really nice, put me at easy and made me feel like I wasn’t going to be killed.

One thing I have to say was really awesome was when I got upstairs he asked me “Are you sure? You can leave, no one will be upset, no one will be mad, if you’re not sure you want to do this we don’t have to.” Honestly this was so respectful, I knew I had made the right choice then. We had so much fun. We have met a four times total, each time better than the one before, he constantly blows my mind with his mouth and his toys, leaving me dripping wet for days afterwards thinking about when I’ll be able to see him again. Seriously such an awesome guy, very easy to get along with, and he gave me the best orgasm of my life yesterday so I think very highly of him :)


About 25 days ago I got a message from a girl asking me if I’d be interested in having some fun with her boyfriend, and after having such a great experience with an open couple already I decided to see if this would be just as fun. After talking for a week or so I went over to their house where they were nice enough to not kill me, but did smoke me up. After we spent some time talking, me and him started having some fun and pretty soon we all ended up in bed together… yeah it escalated a little quickly lol Although that was probably the most nervous I had ever been it was honestly a really really fun time, they were both awesome people, I loved having so much attention on me from both of them, I got to practice my oral skills and got more than plenty in return. He left me sore for quite some time, wanting to meet with them more. Which I’m actually hoping to do this week!

Lastly I messaged someone after seeing that he was going to be coming through Philly on a business trip. 
We started talking and hit it off almost immediately. He captured the story pretty well in his version of it which can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfBlowJob/comments/3a05ja/m4f_success_philadelphia_great_first_time_in/
I got a little BDSM play as a sub, and it was awesome. I spent most of time with him blindfolded with a dick in my mouth and I loved every second of it. I got to experience some ass play for the first time as well. It was so nice I went there twice, the next day he fucked my brains out yet again, only regret here is that I wont see him again :(

My experience with raobj has been overwhelming positive, even the people I don’t meet and just chat with are so nice and keep my days very interesting. and everyone i've met has been overwhelmingly attractive I feel #blessed If nobody's getting hurt and everyone is being safe, why not have some fun? I would wholeheartedly recommend hitting up any of these people, you’ll have a great time.

3a07q2,2,2015-06-16,"Starting web career, two offers quite different from each other",kwhali,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3a07q2/starting_web_career_two_offers_quite_different/,"**TLDR;** Solo dev role with basic graphic design, mostly small marketing sites, full choice on stack, occasional maintenance on previous projects(PHP/MySQL + HTML/CSS/JS, cowboy coded, no VCS/practices/tooling/documentation).....**or** C# graduate role with 6 months training/support + benefits for global enterprise company developing law firm software(SaaS), agile practices. Pay is about the same, roughly 50k NZD. My web experience is mostly backend with node.js, broad knowledge of frontend/backend technologies, best practices, previously solo AS3 AIR dev/designer for corporate internal e-learning software on PC/Android.


**Role 1 - Fullstack solo developer, Details:**
The first is for a small company which seems to mostly do small marketing websites(enter the draw with your code, guess a number/sequence, static info) and recently a mobile app via Cordova with Parse. The position offers 50k NZD and was one of the few roles that listed no experience necessary(it's difficult to find intern roles here unless you're a student or have good connections, junior roles usually want quite a bit and keep rejecting me for lack of experience). I'd be replacing a guy who's been there 2 years and is going on an OE, he doesn't know if he'll return to the company after. He did light graphic design work, mostly basic image manipulation/creation from the looks of it(they have a graphic designer), basic print work and he manages all the code for websites along with some tech support. The position is presently an 60-90 minutes commute(2-3 buses, a train and a bit of walking), I'd likely need to relocate, due to a condition I have driving is risky. 

**Interview:**
During the interview, I was sat down with the guy and just left to talk with him about the role and what I've done along with some questions. I asked quite a few, he used Ruby on Rails in the past, and has since moved to PHP for the backend work, he doesn't use any frameworks, no source control, or any tooling really. MySQL is the database along with phpMyAdmin for management. I glanced over the js,html,css code he's done and it's mostly pure bar jquery and some plugins, no frameworks or preprocessors used. He justifies it as preferring to keep things simple and that the lack of a VCS/tooling as not having much point as a solo dev working on small projects like he does. He wasn't aware of the term QA, though had practiced TDD with ruby once and found it tedious.

**After Interview:**
I felt the interview went well, I was told my previous experience/cv along with being completely self taught boded well compared to fresh graduates from small courses/university. I've been given a test to replicate the functionality of one of the recent marketing sites(3 sections of form inputs) that use php/mysql in the backend which I have no experience with and that concerned him. It doesn't sound difficult, I could setup a LAMP/WAMP stack, follow a tutorial or two online for the php/mysql and be done easily, I don't feel it was an appropriate test.

**Thoughts:**
My concerns with the role is, while the projects might be small/repetitive with low to no maintenance required, it's a solo role which requires much more responsibility and risk. Due to the varied nature of the role and perhaps short deadlines, I'm not sure how much growth I'll get, while I'd have plenty of choice on how to approach a project it might be too much. I'm very much into tooling(Vagrant, Gulp, Sass, etc) / VCS(git) / DevOps(ansible/security/automation) / workflow(gitflow, stash/jira, CI/CD) some of which I'm still picking up or expanding on. Short deadlines might impact on how much of that I can utilize, along with a negative to the company for onboarding someone new to replace me(far more expensive than a dev with skills for the current role). While the company experience/reference is useful, along with portfolio I'm not sure if it's a good investment of my time in regards to furthering my career with future job applications.

**Role 2 - Enterprise C# SaaS Graduate intake, Details:**
The 2nd role is for a global company which has an office in my area, they specialize in developing lawyer software with C#. I'm not a huge fan of C# atm, it's a solid looking language and probably useful to know, though the type of work/community is less appealing to me. The software doesn't sound like it'd be all that exciting and I'd likely be doing maintenance on legacy code as it's enterprise grade. The position is intended for graduates, despite not having a CompSci degree(requirement), HR is considering my application, I've completed some tests with an interview scheduled later(it's not an offer yet, though I'm confident I stand a good chance as I've proved as capable if not more with CompSci grads in past work experiences). 

**Thoughts:**
The position offers a proven 6 month development plan that includes lots of training, guidance and support, with benefits mentioned such as ""Life Insurance, Income Protection, certification and tuition reimbursement, Financial Advisor, and a Bonus Pool(whatever that is?)"" Supposedly the pay would go up after that 6 months, though I'm not too concerned about pay, more in a mutual investment. This role would provide me with a community of developers to work with, co-workers to discuss/learn with along with mentors, I find this quite valuable. C# is in heavy demand where I am, though I am more passionate about node.js and web technologies/dev. I'll obviously have less input/choice on projects and have a more focused role with less risk/stress. Work aside, I see this role providing more growth opportunity along with gaining Agile/workflow/collaboration experiences that are less likely in the first role. The references would be more valuable, career prospects better, at a later date I could likely transition towards a good web focused role with greater success.

**Personal Concern:**
Having previous experience with roles like the first one prior to the web industry, I've noticed I develop an unhealthy work ethic where I carry project work with me even in my spare time rather than working on my own personal projects. It becomes too representative of me I guess, despite doing the work unpaid I'd strive to ensure quality to the best of my ability and still conform to deadlines. With an enterprise/corporate environment along with plenty of coworkers, I think the likelihood of me doing 60-80 hours a week on a project are far less likely. So I'm kind of biased towards this role provided I get the offer, interested to hear other perspectives/experiences however."

I love calculus, I love reading the works of John Keats, and I love reading about the history of the country I live in. I want to read and write and go outside to pretend everything is alright. But when I open the door to the tiny apartment I am forced to call home through gritted teeth, I am reminded of my life. My mother- as wonderful, caring as she is- struggles financially. I have no father and have no reason to believe I have one. My older sister is in college and toils away for hours at work. My younger sister does small jobs, like babysitting. My younger brother can't work. I am an egghead, but I've done manual labor. My sweat has dropped down onto the soft dirt of places I hope to never go to again; I've seen the sun slowly climb over hills, and I've pleaded many times for it to not grant me heat exhaustion. I've been swindled by families wearing smiles, and my family has been robbed on multiple occasions. I've only ever worked during the summer because my mother insists that I focus on my studies (from 5 am to 5 pm). I have fought my way through some of my school's most talented students to gain acceptance into an internship offered by a prestigious university; however, this has put such a strain on my family's already delicate situation by forcing a long commute and essentially making it impossible to work during the summer. Applications and gas are not cheap, yet other students do not seem to be affected by this at all. Even though I go to parties and hangouts, I feel so alone. I'm pretending to an empty audience that I have a wallet ripe for the picking! Sometimes my family snaps at me, and other days I can see it in their eyes. How can I proudly wear my accomplishments when it has been built on the sweat of my family? They're breaking, and I feel like I should quit. I can still drop my pencil and book and pick up that job or two. I would fit right in with my cousins and uncles and grandparents. They all expect me to quit. As I stare at the ceiling from the pile of covers I've come to call ""a bed"" I think about what I've done and all the money I've wasted. I want to quit, and it would be so easy. I'd drop out of this school and attend a regular high school, take the easiest classes, allowing me to pick up as many jobs as needed to support my family. I'll stare up for a little while longer, and if I'm lucky, I'll cry. I just don't want to feel this hopelessness anymore. I want to so desperately believe that it'll get better."

I'm currently not in school at the moment and work in two retail jobs that I hate with a burning passion. I'd like to get out of retail and maybe get into an internship/intro. job like a pharm tech. (based on advice from a career counselor basically telling me that I have procrastinated for these past two years since my graduation) to get a feel for the actual career. I am currently applying to pharmacy technician jobs around my area but what if I get the job and discover that pharmacy isn't right for me?  Well, I have many choices for careers due to uncertainty on my end. I'm in a bit of a dilemma though since my mother (who is widowed and had a stroke about a week after my graduation..) has been persuading me to get into a program that won't take long  so I can get a stable job and help pay the bills, student loans, and an unfortunate amount of credit card debt that I have accrued (she has helped me pay off one of them herself). I feel that I owe her by finishing up a program as soon as possible and getting my life on a stable track but I do not want to jump into a program that I will not enjoy as a lifelong career. If I find a program I must be able to work part-time (20 hours at most) at the same time since I am paying for credit card debt and loans at the moment. My fields that I have narrowed down to that I think are suitable for an ISTJ (introvert) personality for me who likes to be kept alone for the most part, analyzing, classifying, looking at data and working in a not too stressful environment would be: Accounting, Pharmacy, Clinical Lab (Medical Technologist), Research Analyst (for maybe Finance and/or Health/Pharmacy), and Computer Programming. I would like to know which careers out of these are suitable for my conditions (must be able to work part time while going to school - preferably having an intro level job or internship for the career that I choose, must have availability of internships and intro level jobs in my area (Warren, MI), 4-5 year program at max, and fit my introverted personality needs). I would like to find internship/intro. jobs for each field and eventually try all of them out but if anyone can help me narrow down this list based on my personality, needs listed above (with working part time), and timeframe that would be greatly appreciated and would help me waste less time on this dilemma."

Why? 

The growing of crowdfunding platforms in 2015 the industry is expect to raise at $34.4 billion valuation general and Social causes $3.06 billion. If we just look at the success of Kickstarter (&lt;1Billion valuation) and the projects that came out from it we can tend to trust that a nice future is coming.

Crowdfunding is easier and faster, find an interesting project and 5 min later your will be part of it. Rewards are also an interesting new way of engaging people, folks become contributors not only donators --&gt; Reciprocal factor

When you give money to social crowdfunding you are supporting a cause not a company or non profit organization.

The relation between social medias and crowdfunding matters,  almost 50% of people report their charity support thru social media and influence their friend/followers.

I'm actually 21 years old, and i'm completing my internship in a Japanese startup which created a platform for social projects to be crowdfunded. I did choose this work because I really trust a better future can be created thru social crowdfunding and being able to contribute to it is for me a pleasure.

3a15sg,14,2015-06-16,"Doing a double degree in Business Admin. and CS. I have a couple choices of specialization, which do I choose?",allmybeard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a15sg/doing_a_double_degree_in_business_admin_and_cs_i/,"Directly copied from the school website, these are the two CS specializations:

&gt;**Spec. in Computer Science** - This is the program that will give you the most concentrated background and deep knowledge of almost all areas of computer science

&gt;**Spec. in Information Systems** - This program provides a solid foundation in computing and information systems with a focus towards applications of computing in modern enterprises and organizations. This program was developed in consultation with the Business School, and is a perfect fit for the combined HBA program.

So, ultimately my goal is to work my way into a Project Management job as quickly as possible. 

While IS would be easier, it is less focused on coding, which could potentially hold me back at the start compared to the CS specialization. Also, with a more abstract knowledge of coding methods (from the CS spec.), I might be better able to manage a project by having that deeper theoretical knowledge of the project. Also, I'm quite good at math, so I'm not worried about the CS spec. in that regard.

On the other hand, IS is a more business-focused discipline, which might lend itself better to a PM kind of role. Perhaps it would accelerate my path to that job position. Since it is the easier option, it might open up free time for me to get involved in extracurricular activities for my résumé.

In the end, I'd like to fulfill these criteria:

* a) more marketable when searching for an internship while in school, which leads to,
* b) more marketable for a first job
* c) a better candidate for an early Project Management job

I know I probably can't go wrong with either, but based on these criteria, and knowing that the end goal is some sort of management role, which specialization would you pick?"

I was reading some of the posts in here and found that this community has a lot to offer so I decided to ask for some help.

To begin, a quick description of me. I'm 23 years old and will graduate college next year, I have an internship which I really like and it challenges me. I love the idea of being able to know a lot about everything and learning new languages. At the moment the only language I'm fluent at, other than my mother language (portuguese), is English (working towards learning Chinese aswell).

That being said, I really struggle with anxiety and lack of motivation to do things. I always procrastinate when I have something important to do, like a paper for college and a big assignment at my internship. I really don't know how to fix it, I've been struggling with it ever since I was a teenager. I WANT to study more, to work more, to engage in healthy hobbies that will bring me some self-improvement, but everytime that I start something, I quit it. I'm tired of being labeled (by myself) as a quitter. I can't focus on whatever it is I have to do for more than 10 minutes, I get distracted and will go on to check facebook, imgur, reddit, sometimes twitch.tv, you get the point. 

I'd appreciate immensely some feedback, some tips on how to get more disciplined, more motivated, more focused and most of all, stop quitting. "
3a191r,0,2015-06-16,"Reddit, I need to start working on my monograph and conclude it to my Economics degree next year. I want to do something related to League of Legends and data collect. Any suggestions to help me with that?",[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a191r/reddit_i_need_to_start_working_on_my_monograph/,"Hi Reddit! I need your help and creativity to achieve something I've been thinking lately. 

First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm from Brazil and study Economics at UFABC, considered the best university of the country in terms of research impact (according to Scimago Rankings). I'll finish my degree in 2016, and I really want to create my monograph related to League of Legends, but I still don't know how to exactly ""close"" this idea. 

I have also been doing internships for almost 2 years. I worked at Total company (a supernational oilcompany) in the controllership, comercial trade and accounting department, and currently working at Itaú BBA (biggest investment bank of Latin America). All of these jobs I heavily use Excel and analyse data. I also have a passion for League of Legends (almost addicted level). I was challenger last season and currently sitting at D1 50 pts as a Quinn main.

And finally, I'm a big fan of of an exciting field that is fairly new to Economics, which is behaviour economics and specially neuroeconomics.

What is my idea? Put together my experience in Excel/Data analysis, game and League of Legends knowledge and somehow try to apply to Economics behaviour, but I don't know how to use EH into LoL. Any suggestions?

For example: collect a bunch of high elo games (specially from Korea), get all the data (farm per minute, wards in the river, number of times an Ezreal used his Q, or number of times a succeed gank worked purely because of wards versus lack of watching the minimap) etc. And then with all these datas, try to create something that can be applied by suggesting some players a few ideas that the commom sense or general tips does not include. These suggestions can often be in the category of economics behaviour, and in the League of Legends scenario, item otimization would be a huge deal, and farm/kills aswell because they all deal with the money you get from the game and then try to manage the gold and proceed to a win/loss ratio of how people actually used their gold, either by farming, getting kills or assists or the items (example: you HAVE to go back to base as an adc Caitlyn with only 1425 gold instead of the 1500 for BF. What would you do considering if your team is losing, and the decision of this pure moment can actually change the outcome of the game because of suceed events that will occur once you make your decision to what item you should buy. Because of massive data, once we can figure out why she had to go back at 1425 gold, and this same scenario happened to other games aswell, another idea would be to undestand this 'pre-moment of going back to base with less than what you can buy as BF' and suggest a change of how you farm or how this happened when you should have stayed to get the BF).

I know this can very silly, and it's an idea that just started to grow on me, SO YEA, I have a lot to think about and that's why I would love to have your input. Doing something in college related to a game I have been playing since I started actually going to college would be awesome for my life. "
3a1hxd,10,2015-06-16,"I am a NYU Stern Graduate (’08), Ask Me Anything!",jimmythehand1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3a1hxd/i_am_a_nyu_stern_graduate_08_ask_me_anything/,"Hi /r/ApplyingToCollege!  I’m a personal friend of /u/steve_nyc and a graduate of NYU’s Leonard N. Stern’s School of Business.  I double majored in accounting and finance, and he asked me to drop in and answer whatever questions y’all might have.  I’ll check back to this thread for the rest of the week or more.

The main area’s I’ll discuss are:

**(1)** Overall admissions statistics and how I compared

**(2)** My thoughts on the “Stern” experience. 

=-=-=

**(1)**     Stern is the business arm of New York University, located in the middle of the ‘village’ in nyc.  Stern is a top tier undergraduate and graduate school, and is a primary pipeline for accounting, finance, and marketing careers centered in NYC. If you google “NYU Stern admissions statistics,” you will find:

* 15% admissions rate, 
* Class size of ~600 per year,
* 98% six-month job placement (not so much in ’08!) 
* Mean HS GPA &amp; SAT 3.9/4.0 &amp; 1432/1600, 
* Median HS GPA &amp; SAT   3.76/4.0 &amp; 1460/1600

I applied Early Decision and was accepted November of my senior year in HS (NYU was my “reach school”). My numbers were somewhat below these averages, but I was a solid performer in high school and had a lot of extras (AP classes, cross country &amp; track, debate, a very solid essay and good references).  I also had applied to the summer program for prospective students and took classes in economics and expository writing.  Each of these factors must have added to my application and tipped the scales in my favor.  

If you ask me, “hey if I do X or Y will I get in?,”  my advice will invariably be to do extra-curricular activities because you like them, research &amp; consider several different ranked programs, and don’t get hung up on a dream school.  Your goal should be to develop passions and direction for your studies, not because it looks good on college applications.  Try new things you normally wouldn't.  (I tried theater, and was tricked into cross dressing in a Shakespeare play... so maybe not that far??)

=-=-=

**(2)**     Stern is tough.  The program is intense, the classes are curved, and you are subject to stress and decision making beyond your average college student.  Stern sucks because the real world sucks, and they make it a point to prepare you thoroughly.  The goal is to give you all the tools that you need to lead a successful career in whatever you want, even (especially?) outside of the business world.  Stern is very supportive of its students and the alumni network is strong.  You’ll find out more about group projects than you ever wanted to know, and you will build friends and contacts that will last you a lifetime.  

Your first 2 years are filled with arts and science classes like everyone else.  You make up essays about Plato by day and worry about getting ID'ed by night.  Starting somewhere in your sophomore year, your education begins.  You complete a business core common to all ""Sternies,"" then pick a specific major.  Most students major in finance or accounting, sometimes marketing.  In your third year, you go on a “business case study” for spring break: you have to behave, but hey, free trip!  Junior year you will stress out to secure a banking internship regardless of if you want to do banking or not, then stress out more senior year while you interview and figure out how a 21/22 year old is supposed to decide what a career means.  (Hint: you are not!).  Then you graduate and learn to love excel and late nights and being shit on by angry senior analysts and even angrier senior managers.  Alcoholism as a coping mechanism is encouraged.  (Scaring people off much?  Living in nyc is awesome, don't worry!  So is having a job!)  A couple working years later, you kind of wake up and start making choices that actually steer you in a direction you want to eventually go.  Full disclosure, this is my current uh… ‘stage,’ although I did accounting, not banking.  

NYU itself is awesome!  You live in or around the Village your first year, then elsewhere in Manhattan in one of the many dorms.  The city becomes your playground. You are going to find your college experience to be very different than your friends from home!  By the numbers Stern is the opposite of the broader University. 60:40 Male to Female, 60:40 Asian(s) to everyone else and a sizeable international presence (which is sort of a plus and sort of a minus).  One key factor here is to make friends outside your specific program.  I myself went Greek, which has a small but active presence on campus, and I’ll be forever grateful for the overall experience (but not the drinking).  

=-=-=

My little cousin is actually attending NYU Poly for engineering / programming right now, and my advice to him would be to make sure to take better advantage of the city, date as much as possible, and drink less!  Take advantage of the networks offered to you and don't forget to be a human being!  Words to live by, and I think I’ll be taking my own advice.  Fire away guys!

I know a lot of things but an expert in nothing.,witch-haus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a1l1p/any_space_in_boston_for_an_entrylevel_web/,"I graduated a year ago and started teaching myself programming about two and a half years ago. I'm not a child prodigy. I'm just a person who wants a job. I enjoy programming but it's not my entire life and I don't ""make websites"" just for my own fun. (I'd rather learn algorithms for fun, but I'm not good at math either.)

I've applied to about fifteen jobs so far, but all I have for experience is my internship last year doing PHP (I don't want to keep doing PHP). I like back-end but there aren't many back-end jobs, at least here in Boston, and there are even fewer *junior* back end jobs.

So tell me what you think of this plan. I'm going to learn Python/Django (less competition and pays more, yes?) and try to pick up a little Javascript so I could conceivably apply to this smorgasbord of front-end jobs in the meantime. I also want to get into data visualization and/or interactive programming, but that's in the distant future. The point is that I don't necessarily want to do web dev my entire life. So Python might help me get out of web if I ever want to do that. 

Thoughts? Any thoughts specific to the Boston scene?

Yes, that is me...  She knows I come on here often and she knows my mentalities towards woman and she made me believe in the AWALT.  Want the real story or want to hear my side well here you go.

Was head over heels for this girl, had good morals, did not make her commit to something she did not want to do, nor pressure her because she had a bf.  She just left for her internship all the way in Florida and I said I would keep in contact.  The agony of her having a boyfriend finally caught up too me and I finally had to just cut contact and better myself.

She ended up texting me 3 days after writing that post which was yesterday.  She told me ""Jst so you know we broke up""  as in her and her boyfriend.  I respond with ""Okay cool.""  She asked to give me a call and we talked.

She then proceeds to tell me she really hit it off with another guy in Florida.  I was like then why the hell would you contact me just to tell me that?  She had no answer in which I responded well have fun in Florida and good luck with everything.

I felt I took my knowledge from TRP, did not get mad at the situation and just dropped her like a fucking brick basically.  She was in shock I did this, but why would she contact me saying she is single again, then proceed to tell me she hit it off with some dude down in Florida?  Yes it bothers me, but I cant LET it bother me.  I am trying hard to not let it and I have been feeling better already.  

This just goes to show thaat swallowing TRP and accepting the fact that AWALT is real people.  Shit is real, it took me a while to realize it, but once something happened to me it finally hit me.  AWALT and fuck them for being that way.

Rant over

I'm currently running OS X Yosemite, version 10.10.2, and can provide more specs if needed(don't think you'll need processor etc for this though).

It's been having a lot of problems lately, from running really slowly to this funky glitch where my mouse moves erratically that started a few months ago, but that only happens occasionally. Its started to take longer and longer to open an application, or save a document, and I'm really frustrated.

So, I've decided my best solution is to start fresh and reinstall Yosemite. I'm hoping to be able to replace it once I'm completely done with school and find a job, but I need this one to last until then, and reasonably work.

I only really use itunes, which is backed up in icloud, adobe programs and light gaming like emulators and Minecraft that I can just reinstall online, and then, Microsoft Office. Sigh.

I got MS Office shortly after I got my computer. Not willing to shill out a ton of money after spending a significant portion of my savings on the computer, my tech-savvy then-boyfriend found a shady torrent download for it, and it worked. So currently, I have Microsoft Office 2011 installed.

And I have no way to reinstall it. No disc, no code. I'd like to avoid having to try my luck with torrents, because I'm not so tech-savvy and have rarely had them work in the past.

I'm a journalism major finishing my undergrad and soon moving on to my Master's, so I use Office, especially Word, all the time. Right now I'm taking summer classes, working a job with an environmental paper, and doing an internship with a paper in my city, so I can't exactly do this reinstall without being sure I have a way to reinstall word. I'd really like to reinstall, because I'm tired of troubleshooting 10 different glitches every week that a system wipe would fix, and I have a ton of crap on here I never use.

I almost exclusively work in Google Drive, and just paste stuff into word docs to turn in/email to people, so I don't need to save any documents, just the program itself.

Is there any way to, I don't know, put it on a flash drive, or find a recovery key somehow? Or can someone recommend a reliable place to download it?

I'm broke after paying tuition and a deposit on an apartment, so buying it isn't really an option right now. And the Apple versions, like Pages, aren't something I can submit on D2L or email to someone without pages(right?). 

So, /r/techsupport, is there any way I can do this? 

tl;dr: Want to wipe and reinstall Macbook, need to somehow save and reinstall torrent-downloaded Microsoft Office programs."

Colleen Zenk always intended on being a teacher. The Waldorf, Minn., native followed the plan and started her career as a home economics teacher. She soon made the move to Wausau, Wis., where she realized her learning had just begun.

Tied to the Wausau job was an occupational foodservice program for high school kids, but it required an instructor with more than 2,000 foodservice hours. After securing a job at a local restaurant to obtain her required foodservice hours and teaching the program for two years, the program was eliminated. Rather than returning to her roots as a home economics teacher, Zenk decided to take a different route.

""I had a few options because of my foodservice background,"" Zenk said. ""I moved back to Minneapolis, took a job at a restaurant and soon ended up in long-term care.""

Minnesota requires a licensed dietitian or certified foodservice professional in long-term care facilities, so it was back to school again for Zenk. After weighing the options and considering evening classes, Zenk was referred to the University of North Dakota Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professional (NFP) Training Program.

""At that point I was running two kitchens and couldn't manage to get away every Wednesday night to attend class,"" Zenk explained. ""I also considered becoming a dietitian, but because of a limited amount of internship options I decided the UND correspondence course was my best choice. I've never looked back – it was the perfect solution!""

From that point on, she was off and running. Zenk managed the kitchens for an independent living facility, and later worked for Sysco Minnesota and the Minnesota Beef Council. Zenk's approach throughout her career was to ""keep food fun."" She described the lutefisk dinners, Swedish smorgasbords and St. Patrick's Day meals her independent living facility would host.

""Residents really enjoyed these meals; it featured their cultures and provided them with a taste of home. It's important to go the extra mile, and we tried to make memorable experiences for all of the residents and their families,"" Zenk said.

Zenk retired from full-time work in January, but is staying with the Minnesota Beef Council on a contract basis. She hopes to spend more time with family and friends, golf, read and travel.

Along with her education and work experience, Zenk served as the national chair for the Dietary Managers Association from 2002-2003 and participated in several industry committees. It was on the DMA Certifying Board where she served with UND's Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professional Training Program Director, Becky Rude.

""Colleen is a respected professional and role model to both emerging and seasoned CDMs. She's been the go-to food safety person for the state of Minnesota and the nation; she's an expert speaker and advisor for the foodservice industry,"" Rude explained. ""Our team is proud of her accomplishments and of the fact she's a graduate of our program.""
Industry Outlook

Zenk expects the aging population and number of senior housing units to create challenges for the foodservice industry. She expects the marketing to be fierce, and dietary managers should realize the overall role they play in promoting their facilities. Zenk feels food is a huge factor in determining the overall quality of a facility.
Always Learning

Through her career, Zenk became a Certified Trainer for ServSafe®, the Sanitation &amp; Food Safety Training and Certification Program sponsored by the Educational Foundation of the National Restaurant Association. She's received several national awards, most notably the Distinguished Service Award from the Dietary Managers Association. Zenk has also authored numerous articles published in Dietary Manager Magazine and Today's Dietitian.

""Continuing my education has opened doors,"" Zenk explained. ""I think education is how people get ahead, and I encourage anyone considering a career in foodservice to continue their education and training."""

3a37kg,5,2015-06-16,Career switch to management consulting from brand management,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3a37kg/career_switch_to_management_consulting_from_brand/,"Hey guys, I want to know if my hopes for a career switch has any realistic chances, and if so, how I might make my case stronger for a switch into consulting.

About me:

I'm a fairly new grad, but I've been able to pretty quickly build up a strong background in marketing, specifically brand management. I graduated from a well-known business school in Canada with a BBA in 2013 and I started working for a major pharmaceutical company immediately. At this point I was a marketing intern, but in about a year's time, I moved up twice and became an Assistant Brand Manager, and put into partial responsibility for profit &amp; loss of the company's flagship brand.

After a few more months at this pharma company, I switched to a major consumer goods company, a top recognized name in households as well as among recruiters. Pay is great, and the work is rewarding, and now I am fully responsible for profit &amp; loss on my own for a very large product portfolio. My credentials in business/brand management speak for themselves and I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish.

However, marketing has never really been a passion, but more of an interest since it's a way of making the strategy come to life. I've always loved business strategy more than marketing. I formulate strategies every day at work, since business strategy is the bread &amp; butter of a brand manager's life, apart from commissioning TV ads and whatnot. I do enjoy the marketing aspect of my job, but I would like to focus entirely on business strategy by joining management consulting. My hope would be to join something along the lines of Deloitte Consulting, and to a lesser degree, ZS Associates.

I've recently started doing consulting work on my own, on top of my full time job, and I've been able to acquire a client. I would be advising the client on general business strategy as well as bringing the strategy to life via marketing.

I graduated with honours for placing in the top 15% of my class, but my GPA wasn't very spectacular (3.6~3.7). My pathway into brand management was through case competitions, and I am very good at those and have a few achievements in this regard that really add to my resume. I do have the option of doing an MBA open for me, but I don't want to pursue an MBA degree since I'd hate to take on student loan and forego a few years of salary.

Does my resume sound like a fit for consulting? What advice would you guys give me?"

3a3je5,1,2015-06-16,[Support Only] What was the point of everything?,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3a3je5/support_only_what_was_the_point_of_everything/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I worked hard to get to where I am now. Its a fact. Maybe I could have done more, you can *always* do more, but I know I worked hard. I did what was necessary and for a time it was sufficient. Life seemed to go on. Now it's taken a  turn for the worse- I've summarized everything in the wall of text below for anyone who happens to care. Sorrrry.

Satiety is never more than a fleeting moment... I don't know where it comes from. Maybe its because my Asian parents always pushed me or because my extended family is ridiculously successful, frankly I don't give a fuck. I'm neurotic and idealistic and driven, but I wouldn't change who I am, my life hasn't been all that bad and I love my family. Psychoanalysis should be left to those fucking quack psychiatrists. I took a long time for me realize that.

But things aren't going the way they usually do. I used scrape by in flying colors. Getting into college was an emotional roller coaster, I used to crawl under my sink and cry for hours, I was horribly depressed all the time but in the end it happened.

Once in College, initially I had no idea what I wanted to do and ended up minoring in something really difficult and obscure, which dragged down my cumulative GPA to a 3.4 (my major GPA is 3.6). I want to enter banking or consulting in the future and I *know* I can do well in either role and I will put in the hard work to do well in either. I'm also pretty sure my coursework so far has prepared career wise, if there's anything I don't know, I can learn it. I did internships in finance and consulting in my freshman and sophomore years but last year everything went to shit.

First this guy I was dating broke up with me. I was a pretty conservative girl, no drugs, no alcohol and lots of sappy romance movies- I was living in a fairy tale. All those shy smiles across the quad, that awkward conversation outside the residence halls and the way we'd run into each other *all* the time. We'd liked each other for a while and I sort of let slip that I was interested in him and he asked me out. I couldn't have been happier in that moment. I guess it was ironic that I was thinking about marrying him by the end of it. The honeymoon phase was rudely interrupted by something you'd least expect. Right, so his parents convinced him to get married to another girl- I had no idea until they were already engaged. I thought we were still dating. He didn't really think to mention it. A week before he broke the bad news to me, I was reading these super senti texts about how he loved spending time with me and how he couldn't wait to see me after summer and I felt all fuzzy inside. 

I guess I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' where real. It broke me. I've never had any real romantic meaningful connections with anyone in life and I might have just been infatuated. I used to dream all day about finding the right guy. Hell, I still do. I don't know what he felt when his parents told him he had to get married to this girl, but he eventually agreed and I felt like a piece of trash. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 20? Just my luck.

Things had *never* been easy. My family life was unstable and I pressured the fuck out of myself. But this just drained me. I missed a week of my internship, I pretended to be sick and when I got back I just wasn't the same. I wasn't enthusiastic anymore. Even after I got back to school things just weren't the same, I wasn't depressed all the time, but it still hurt. I couldn't think about anything but getting back at him, making him feel the way he made me feel, I wanted to destroy him and his new wife and all it did in the end was destroy me. The worst part is that there was a small part of me that hoped he'd miraculously change his mind. So I started smoking weed, drinking excessively. I have an obsessive and addictive personality- not to point of having any real mental illness, but I'm not quite right. I did okay in my classes. 

2015 has taken my breath away. I ended up getting really upset when an interview went south after which I smoked and drank myself into the mental ward, where I spent two nights. The weed basically gave me a really bad, prolonged panic attack. I had another meltdown about a month later because of constant panic attacks and had to go to the hospital for another two nights because of intrusive sducidal thoughts. The mental hospital didn't help, I wasn't half as fucked up as some of the other people and nothing but animal therapy and ativan made me feel better.

Things calmed down by the end of the Winter quarter, I got straight As because my midterms simply happened to take place during that stable month between my meltdowns. Spring quarter was also okay and I got straight A-s. Besides studying however, I spent ages masturbating everyday (like 5 hours at a time and it still isn't enough). At the time it was very therapeutic, but it was also becoming a big time waster. Now that I've completely stopped I feel really anxious and I can't concentrate, like there's a block in the frontal lobe of my head at times, so I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms from not masturbating, which is just great. The two times I did masturbate I felt great after, and the withdrawals sort of went. I also have constant urges to masturbate due to complete abstinence...

I'm better now though, for the most part at least. But I don't have a fucking junior internship. The past year has taken its toll and my career seems to be the final victim. I had quite a few interviews but for some reason it never worked out. Lots of second round interviews but most places only take one candidate and the bigger places need a diverse set of schools. The investment banks were my best hope, because each of them takes about 3 or 4 kids from my school, but I haven't taken any accounting coursework so I didn't make it past the first round at any of them. All I have is this stupid tech startup which accepts everyone because they don't pay you, not one penny. Today the CEO of the company emailed me, telling they were 'overcrowded' so I should only come into the office when he wants me to. WTF is that supposed to mean? I've been too ashamed to tell my parents that I'm not being paid. 

I feel so burnt out yet at the same time I *need* a job. I feel like society has rejected me. I'm educated and my credentials are fine yet I just haven't been able to get a proper job while *everyone* else has and I swear there's nothing severely wrong with me. It feels awful that I'm not supporting myself and I feel ashamed that my dad still has to pay for my every expense. On paper I'm qualified and I swear I'm not *that* bad at interviewing. Most interviewers in the first round told me I interviewed pretty well.  I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing, like I got this far but now I can't find a job and the next stage of life has been denied to me. All I've had this past year is misery.

I don't really know why I wrote this whole thing. I don't know. What do you guys think, or has anyone been in this sort of situation or have any general advice? I just need to talk to some people about this tbh. Also please don't be mean. The reason I had my second bout of panic attacks and eventual hospitalization was actually because someone was horrible to me on Reddit and I started thinking they might be right and I just spiraled out of control. I know I sound very high maintenance, but these standards or whatever, they're completely internal to me. They exist because I am the way I am, I have a preconceived notion of success and if I don't live up to it I get upset. They aren't unrealistic at all, they fit my resume and I'm upset I haven't gotten to where I want. Similarly romance wise, I'm not bad looking, I take good care of my self, I run everyday and recently started lifting weights and stuff. I guess I do idealize romance. But I like it, its one source of positivity in my life. I've gotten really religious too lately, prayer helps. While writing this out I got an email from a big venture capital firm for an interview and I just feel desperate... before I used to get excited and I would start researching and preparing notes, now I get a little freaked out when I get good news."

How should I approach this in interviews, whether I get fired or if I need to explain why I'm looking for a job so quickly after accepting this one? I'm nervous to lie because my profession is very small and everyone knows everyone, word travels quickly.

Why I'm possibly getting fired: 

* My boss thinks I'm unhappy. I am happy with my job, but he is convinced that since I'm not that as cheerful as I was as an intern that I'm not happy and wanting to leave. Truth is I'm exhausted from training (I'm trying to focus and remember everything so I don't mess up) and I'm not licensed in my field yet and trying to study for my certification (I'm taking it next month). I've explained this to him 2 weeks ago but I heard today at work that he is still concerned and wanting to let me go because he is convinced I'm not happy. Also- I'm recently divorced (still married when I had my internship) and it has taken a toll on me, although I had not discussed that with my boss.

* I was given several projects by a coworker and told them that I was not going to take on anymore projects until I was licensed and/or the current project is completed. Coworker told my boss that I am unwilling to do the job I was hired to do and that I was acting unprofessional. However, it was my understanding from speaking with my boss 2 weeks ago that training and studying were my main priorities, and that my current project could take a back seat, and that I wouldn't be taking on anymore projects until the current one was completed or until I was done training/licensed. 


I'm meeting with my boss sometime this week to hopefully convince him that I am happy with my job and if he wants me to take on additional projects before being licensed and before I'm done training then I will gladly do it, but it sounds like he has made up his mind based on his conversation with the coworker that gave me the heads up today. 

I'd like advice on how to handle my meeting with my current boss, and how to approach job interviews whether I'm fired or if I'm simply looking for a new job so quickly after getting hired. "

However, right now I'm leaning toward the path of just getting a degree in CS, and aside from dabbling in a few extra courses here and there to not bother with getting a second major or minoring in anything. I would then use the extra time I had to work on solo projects, contribute to open source projects, participate in clubs, contests, events, get an internship, and so on.

This is due to advice I have read here in the past on this subject, about how working hard, doing solo projects, networking, etc will make you far more employable after graduation than picking up a second degree.

That being said, I also have a strong passion for mathematics, creative writing/literature, and philosophy. I would love to study all of these in-depth at college, but I just don't think I have the time, the money, or the energy to do so right now. Honestly, my top priority at this point in my life is to land my ass in a secure, challenging, rewarding, and high-paying job so that I can live life without having to worry so much about money. 

I'm thinking about the possibility of going back to college later, maybe 10-20 years down the road to major in math, philosophy, whatever I want to just for the sake of learning, if I succeed in saving up enough money so that I can do something like that. To be clear, I do love CS. I'm not sure if it's my absolute favorite field yet, but it's definitely the most employable out of my interests.

Is that a reasonable idea, or would it be better for me to try to squeeze in learning everything I want to learn right now? My main fear with that idea is becoming a ""jack of all trades and a master of none,"" as well as burning myself out. However, I also don't want to make the mistake of making myself look lazy or unmotivated to future employers."

***Explanation on why I forgot everything and have shitty grades:***


&gt;While I would consider myself intelligent, due to some issues I have I was a fairly terrible student. One of the main reasons is that I am much better at working on one project(or class) at a time than multiple that are vastly different, as I usually end up wasting all of my time with the latter scenario  I also don't learn in class at all and in many of my courses I ended up learning everything the day before the midterm/final exams. Even though I have gotten A's on many of my final exams I still ended up with many C's for the overall course grade.

&gt;As a result of this style of learning most of what I learned in college was quickly forgotten."
3a46y5,12,2015-06-16,[FR] First approach in America,kam-,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3a46y5/fr_first_approach_in_america/,"**Background:**

As this is my first field report, I’ll describe quickly where I come from. I discovered this sub 6 months ago, while browsing Reddit in order to keep my mind off the first girl that took some interest in me in over one year, and losing her. 21 years old, never had a girlfriend, virgin, had 2 dates in my life and failed them. Reading the stuff here made me realize how I was wasting my time, going nowhere, having no passion in life or anything. Years of procrastinating had lead me to stopped going to classes, spend my days playing online games, drinking a healthy mix of coffee, energy drinks, alcohol, and smoking tons of cigarettes. 
Wondering where my teenage boner had disappeared, I decided to follow the Seddit path and letting go of the past. Games was replaced with studying and educate myself, alcohol with water, cigarettes with chewing gum, masturbation with a workout session. I started improving my social life, getting back in touch with some friends, going to social events during the week, and out in the weekend. I took every chance I got to face social pressure, peeing right next to the guy into the urinals (hard one), taking a speech in front of the class, and going out alone if my friends preferred to play call of duty.
I began hitting on girls, at bars, nightclubs, in shops, and asking them out. I’ve had some little successes, get rejected and flaked a lot, and practiced irregularly. I could be far better, but I’m more confident than I have ever been, look good, didn’t spend any Saturday night at home in 6 months and wake up every morning with shits to do. So thank you for that. 

**Context:**

In the goal of self-development, I decided it was time to travel the world and gain a little perspective. I found an internship in America, which I fascinated me since I was a little boy, and got through months of stupid paperwork to get there. So here I come, arriving from France, spending the summer on the other side of the Atlantic. 

**First approach:**

I’ve been here since two weeks, having a hard time getting acclimated to the country and making friends. On this sunny Saturday afternoon, I was walking around the city, looking for things to do or discover. I came across a little festival. There is children playing, little concerts making nice sounds in the background, people enjoying some ice cream. The atmosphere made me feel really good and it was time to do the first approach I haven’t had the balls to do since I came to the city. 
I noticed this gorgeous girl, eating something that looks like Indian food on the sidewalk. It was so sexy. She is alone, no headphones, no phone calls, I’m feeling good, I got no excuses. So I go up to her and drop something along the lines of 
&gt;“This may be weird but I was walking around and I saw you, you look charming and I wanted to say Hi”

to which I got the 
&gt;“Thanks but I got a boyfriend.”

Whatever, I learned than talking to people is always a good experience so I go on and introduce myself, we shake hands and I ask her how she got here, in this nice festival. I sit down close to her, continue the conversation, and she says quickly “Actually, I lied to you, I don’t have a boyfriend, sorry for this”. I tell her that I understand but tease her a little about that. We carry on, learning about each other. She comes from California, is in Boston for a summer job and get some inspiration for her art work. She’s here since two weeks as well, had been mostly exploring the city alone, and got into the habitude of saying “I have a boyfriend” to get rid of man talking to her. I mention my dream of going finally to New York, she would really like to go as well. She is smart, interesting, and truthful. We get along well so I suggest she comes with me to the museum on Wednesday night as I saw it was free. She insist that she really wants to go, and put her name and number in my phone. We walked around the streets for a little more than an hour as we hugged goodbye. 

Approaching goes well most of the time and feels so good, and yet I’m often such a fucking pussy about it. Just do it©.

**Date:**

We texted a little bit, not too much, agree on time and place to meet. I live in a shitty cheap room with another guy so I don’t feel like bringing her there. I was planning on trying to f-close on the second date anyway, since it is my biggest struggle. 
We meet at a subway station, little kiss on the cheek, European style, and walk to the museum. I speak freely about whatever I feel like talking about, she shares some stories about her as well, staying in light conversation. In the museum we visit the American and European art, comparing our two continents and cultures. Making conversation as a foreigner is pretty easy, so much topic to explore. I do some light kino, hands on her arms, lower back. She doesn’t react at all but I don’t lose my frame. 
I suggest to get some drinks, she agrees, and go to the subway station. We miss the train for some seconds, so we find a little spot on the grass, sit down and I initiate her to meditation (she told me she never experienced it). As she has her eyes closed and I talk with a deep and calm voice, I touch her on her hands and knees. She likes it, we take the train, find a bar, we sit next to each other, and order drinks. Here we get a little deeper, I open myself and she reciprocate. She sticks her legs onto mines and I got one hand on her thigh, the other on her shoulder. The timing and situation feels right, so I go in for the kiss. She backs off, saying that she doesn’t know me yet. I laugh it off and change the subject. We pay and head out. 
We walk in direction of the subway station that would get her back home.  We sit on a bench on a nice plaza. I talk about this Old Italian gay guy who approached me two days ago as I was reading on the bench right next to this one. I got the conversation more on a sexual topic. She confess she is only attracted to men, but still has kissed some girl. Me too, was okay, would recommend. At this point we are so close that I do a second attempt at kissing, success. She say that she’s really happy I approached her 5 days ago. We had a good night, it’s late, work in the morning, and far from home. We kissed goodbye, after agreeing to meet up again Sunday night. And I go back home, with a raging boner, my most honest compliment. 

**Aftermath:**

I texted her 2 days after, to set up the logistics of second date. She said that she is too busy Sunday and Tuesday would be better. I know that she doesn’t work on Wednesday so we planned for Tuesday. I texted her last evening saying to meet me there at this time. She respond today late morning something along the lines of
&gt; “I woke up sick, caught a cold yesterday, I’m not feeling better, I can’t do tonight, sorry”. 

Cold, no suggestion of another time. So I interpret this as a loss of interest. The iron seems cold.

I haven’t respond yet, and everything I can think of seems too tryhard and fake. I could spend hours reviewing the whole thing, seeing how I didn’t follow perfectly the rules #23, 37, and 1345 of the PUA’s manual. But I prefer not to be too hard on myself, and writing this was helpful to get it out of mind. The progress I made in all area of my life since 6 months makes me feel confident. It is also such a little time to recover from a decade of inaction. Next time I’ll do better. 

Tomorrow, I’ll be back on the streets. I hope you do as well gentlemen.

She's nearly finished. I'm really serious about being willing to change my behavior and make her feel special. How do I show her and how do I convince her it isn't over?**

I've been with my girlfriend for 2.5 years. Things started out great, and then they kinda declined to a steady point. My girlfriend suffered from anxiety and depression for a while in the relationship (until recently) because of issues with her parents (they would play mind games and shit with her and rejected her for loving me - kicked her out and all). 

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I took a long hard look at our relationship and I realized I'm not happy with it. She's away from me right now, about 2.5 hours, and in August, when I return to school, she is leaving for Florida, about 12 hours away, for a Disney internship. I saw that we just didn't have the bond to keep us close over this period. For years she'd tell me how to comfort her, how to make her feel important, etc, but I was too stubborn to get it. I didn't compromise much or compliment her much or care for her fully. I realize now that it had a lot to do with being scared of getting hurt when I was falling for her. It had a lot to do with not having a good parental relationship to base mine off of. It had a lot to do that I just wouldn't open up to her. 

I finally realize this and try to surprise her this weekend and let her know what I'm willing to change, but she wasn't surprised and the talk didn't go down how I wanted it to. Needless to say, I didn't feel very welcome during the weekend. We finally had a talk. She told me she's been through a lot of pain, and she's finally getting over it and hanging out with friends and feeling better. She says she doesn't know if she has any more energy to give and wishes I had realized this sooner. She's currently thinking things over. We're still together. I think she's afraid of me letting her down. I also think she's afraid of me becoming an anxious mess for some reason. I kinda am right now. 

So, how do I show her that I really understand now? How do I get her to trust I'm for real? How do I soothe her and convince her to give it a shot? How do I show her I can be the person she fell in love with in the beginning? 

We've had some talks, and I think she thinks I'm sincere, but she's still really conflicted, ready to experience the world, etc and she's trying to find a place for me. I just need some help on what I can do to save it, because I've loved her, she's loved me, and I love her more now than ever. And I'm genuinely honest about really working to make her feel special and appreciated, which I realize is all she really wanted.

Other relevant info: we've never really broken up, but there have been some rough spots. Things have gotten physical a few times, some me trying to keep her from hurting herself, once or twice me out of frustration, but I never hit her, just holding forcefully. We had it really great in the beginning. She isn't talking to or seeing someone else."

It just opened up in the fall so it's still a fairly new place. I've been there about 3 weeks now. 

Also this past week, I interviewed for and got an on campus job in my cs department. It will be about 15 hours a week and the pizza place is the same amount of hours. Then just the other day I got asked to interview for one of the internships I applied for months ago. That internship is full time so more like 30-40 hours a week. There's no way I could balance that with the job in my cs department, the pizza place, and classes. Would it be acceptable to leave the pizza place? The full time internship would obviously be better for my future jobs in the computer science field than the pizza place."
3a51nw,0,2015-06-17,My Best Rejection So Far [FRish],Seductshon,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3a51nw/my_best_rejection_so_far_frish/,"This is half a field report and half just a personal account of why you shouldn't put girls on a pedestal.

Rewind about eight months. There's a mutual friend of a girl I know that's extremely attractive to me, let's call her BH. Anyway, I'm an upcoming DJ at my university and I had my first ""official"" gig a week before Halloween, and knew she might be coming to the party I was playing at. 

She ended up coming to the party, I was in a pretty good state when she came by (I had not met her before this night, but had heard about her and looked her up on facebook), anyway I hugged her like it was nothing and introduced myself. I noticed that she was very attractive, but did not act like it phased me, because I was much more invested in the gig I was putting on. Nothing happened that night, the group she was with left for another party.

That night I texted my friend (the mutual friend who knows both me and BH), we'll call her G, telling her I thought BH was very attractive. The next day G told me that BH also thought I was attractive. This sparked my interest. She was supposed to be coming to the party we had planned that night, but due to BH being a dingus and getting too drunk, that did not happen.

Fast forward to December (around Christmas and New Year's), she's still on my mind, because tbh I'm still somewhat of an AFC and G keeps bringing her up when we hang out. So I decide to facebook message her. Things go well, I get her number and from that point on I text her every month or so. 

This may sound strange, but she actually responds very well to these conversations, I keep them light and fun, with no real objective other that just to have some funny convos that amuse me. I sometimes infer about meeting up, get rejected quick, but not in a way that seems to indicate that she's no longer interested. 

Side Note: BH goes to a different university about an hour away, meaning she only really comes up to my uni like once a semester, so that's the reason why I was not more forward, and why I made initial contact with her via Facebook. It’s also why her rejections to meet never really seemed to matter.

Fast forward to the end of April, I happen to have an internship lined up in the city she is living in over the summer. This was completely coincidental, but having her there was definitely seen as a bonus at that time. I tell her that I plan on living in her city for the summer, she offers to give me a tour, fuck yeah. 

We go on the tour, although it's clear this is not a date from the beginning. Nonetheless, we have a lot of fun, and I'm definitely interested in her. 

I wait two days after the tour to contact her, ask her what she's up to that night and she tells me she's going out to a bar, I ask her if I can join. She enthusiastically tells me yes. I'm excited. 

We go out, I meet her best friend that goes to her school and things are going well. A few hours into the night we begin to isolate each other, there's a ""bubble"" around us, she's giving me signals that she wants me, although at the time I’m completely oblivious to them (I only recently started looking at seddit, and other seduction information like Models by Mark Manson, etc.). 

We end up outside because she ""needs some air” (another IOI that flew over my head) and I decide to ask her out on a date. She agrees, although she's drunk. I confront her on this, but she assures me she wants to go out with me. From that point on she's definitely interested in me, i.e. holding hands, dancing together, etc. 

The problem is I never make a real move on her after that (no trying to kiss her, little to no kino, except for an occasional holding hands while leading her somewhere), I could've easily made out with her, or even took her home, but was too oblivious to her signals that I didn’t  do anything. We ended up walking to her place together and I ended up with a kiss (just a peck) on the lips, then left.

The funny part was I thought I was “in"" at that point. I was so high on the night, because it was one of the biggest “successes” I’ve had in a long time.

Side note: I’ve spent the past five or six years really focusing on myself after an identity crisis that occurred in high school, so I haven’t really been focusing on girls, and how to improve with them until very recently. 

Anyway, I text her the day after and tell her about the date that she agreed upon, the issue was that she didn’t remember that, she was much more drunk than I realized. Although, she agrees to go out later that week (she agreed, I wasn’t going to let her get away with that). 

This was the first red flag that I noticed, but I ignored because I was so infatuated with her (I put her on pedestal pretty hardcore at this point). Moving on, we went out, to an art museum, but I didn’t really escalate at all, and she had to leave for a soccer game she agreed to go to, but “forgot about” before scheduling our date (2nd red flag that I didn’t realize). 

The date went OKAY, and I mean that in that exact way. It was neither good nor bad, or at least that’s what I gathered from it. We had fun, but again I did not escalate hardly at all. She showed some investment in me, which I thought to be a good sign, but seems was not enough.

From that point on, it was a struggle. I’ve texted her about hanging out, but she only responds when she can’t make it. Needless to say I’m getting pretty skeptical about our situation at this point. 

Fast forward to this previous night, I see her, I’m in a good state, I take her hand and dance with her for a minute, she asks how I’ve been and who I’m with, I sort of avoid these questions, and as soon as I showed up to dance with her, I leave her. This was planned, I wanted to catch her off guard and confuse her (drunk logic), anyway, by the end of the night I plan on figuring out what’s going on, whether I get rejected or not.

I find her, take her hand, and tell her I need to talk to her, she says that she has to take a tequila shot, which she does, but she does not come to me right afterward, she stalls. After being tired of waiting for about a minute or two, I confront her, in front of her friends. I ask her whether we’re going to talk, she straight up tells me “no, it’s not happening”. I scan her friends, they’re all not pleased, telling me to leaver her alone, apparently they’re celebrating a birthday or something, I say “see ya” and bolt. 

Afterward, I’m ecstatic, I finally know where we stand, and that I don’t need to put any more energy into our relationship. The fact that I made her polarized (thanks for that perspective Mark Manson) made me finally realize that I was chasing something that wasn’t worth chasing. 

I’ve learned a lot from this experience. One of the big takeaways is to take the shot when it presents itself, I had an extremely prime opportunity to make something happen with her at one point, but because of my lack of knowledge at the time, and my lack of using my intuition, I didn’t take the opportunity. 

Another big lesson is to not to chase girls, I initially attracted this girl to me because when I first met her I showed that I had value and didn’t necessarily care whether she liked me or not. I’m not saying to not approach women (in fact I’m terrible at this and am trying to get better), but don’t give up your values and principles as a man for a women, or anyone else for that matter. That shizz is unattractive af. 

The last thing I learned is that polarizing women is a good thing no matter it she reacts positively or negatively, by polarizing, you either filter out the women who you don’t want/aren’t worth being in your life or you gain women that actually care and give a shit about you. 

If you aren’t familiar with polarizing, I’d suggest reading Models by Mark Manson, not only is it a must read, but he also explains polarizing in a much better way than I can in this post.

I realize this is long, but I really needed to write this story out for myself. And if anyone can relate and learn from it, then all the better!

Also, if anyone has any feedback about what I could've done better, or where I might've gone wrong, let me know!

TL;DR: I tried to slow game a girl, put her on a pedestal, and had one of the best rejections I’ve ever had because of it. Read Models by Mark Manson."

I am in need of some advice regarding my current summer internship. Right now, I am 1 week through a 10 week software engineering internship at a startup. Before the start of my internship, the company moved to a new office around 1.5 hours away from where they told me to live, so I have to commute every day. In addition, this is my first ever software engineering internship, and there are no other engineering employees in the office, only other engineering interns and business employees. I am doing mostly backend work in python, and am learning mainly from the internet and from working long hours.

Recently, I got offered a software engineering internship at another startup closer to where I live. At this startup there would be other more experienced engineers and a product manager onsite. Also, I would be building an iPhone application.

My questions are...

1) Does my experience at my current internship seem like a typical startup interning experience, or does it seem atypical?

2) What is the typical startup software engineering internship like as far as mentorship?

3) What do you think I should do (stay with the current internship or take a chance with the new one)?

Thanks for your help! :D"

3a5o4o,2,2015-06-17,I feel like everything I've done has been for nothing,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3a5o4o/i_feel_like_everything_ive_done_has_been_for/,"I worked hard to get to where I am now. Its a fact. Maybe I could have done more, you can always do more, but I know I worked hard. I did what was necessary and for a time it was sufficient. Life seemed to go on. Now it's taken a turn for the worse- I've summarized everything in the wall of text below for anyone who happens to care. Sorrrry.

Satiety is never more than a fleeting moment... Maybe its because my Asian parents always pushed me or because my extended family is ridiculously successful, frankly I don't give a fuck. I'm neurotic and idealistic and driven, but I wouldn't change who I am, my life hasn't been all that bad and I love my family. Psychoanalysis should be left to those fucking quack psychiatrists. I took a long time for me realize that.

But things aren't going the way they usually do. I used scrape by in flying colors. Getting into college was an emotional roller coaster. I used to crawl under my sink and cry for hours, I was horribly depressed all the time but in the end, it happened. I got the acceptance letter and the congratulations and things were fine.

Once in College, initially I had no idea what I wanted to do and ended up minoring in something really difficult and obscure, which dragged down my cumulative GPA to a 3.4 (my major GPA is 3.6). I want to enter banking or consulting in the future and I know I can do well in either role and I know that I will put in the hard work to do well. I'm also pretty sure my coursework so far has prepared career wise, if there's anything I don't know, I can learn it. I did internships in finance and consulting in my freshman and sophomore years but last year everything went to shit.

First this guy I was dating broke up with me. I was a pretty conservative girl, no drugs, no alcohol and lots of sappy romance movies- I was living in a fairy tale. All those shy smiles across the quad, that awkward conversation outside the residence halls and the way we'd run into each other all the time. We'd liked each other for a while and I sort of let slip that I was interested in him and he asked me out. I couldn't have been happier in that moment. I guess it was ironic that I was thinking about marrying him by the end of it. The honeymoon phase was rudely interrupted by something you'd least expect. His parents convinced him to get married to another girl- I had no idea until they were already engaged. I thought we were still dating. He didn't really think to mention it. A week before he broke the bad news to me, I was reading these cute texts about how he loved spending time with me and how he couldn't wait to see me after summer and I felt all fuzzy inside.

I guess I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' where real. It broke me. I've never had any real romantic meaningful connections with anyone in life and I might have just been infatuated. I used to dream all day about finding the right guy. Hell, I still do. I don't know what he felt when his parents told him he had to get married to this girl, but he eventually agreed and I felt like a piece of trash. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 20? Just my luck.

Things were never easy. My family life was unstable and I pressured the fuck out of myself. But this just drained me. I missed a week of my internship, I pretended to be sick and when I got back I just wasn't the same. I wasn't enthusiastic anymore. Even after I got back to school things just weren't the same, I wasn't depressed all the time, but it still hurt. I couldn't think about anything but getting back at him, making him feel the way he made me feel, I wanted to destroy him and his new wife and all it did in the end was destroy me. The worst part is that there was a small part of me that hoped he'd miraculously change his mind. So I started smoking weed, drinking excessively. I have an obsessive and addictive personality- not to point of having any real mental illness, but I'm not quite right. I did okay in my classes.

2015 has taken my breath away. I ended up getting really upset when an interview went south after which I smoked and drank myself into the mental ward for two nights. The weed basically gave me a really bad, prolonged panic attack. I had another meltdown about a month later because of constant panic attacks and had to go to the hospital for another two nights because of intrusive sducidal thoughts. The mental hospital didn't help, I wasn't half as fucked up as some of the other people and nothing but animal therapy and ativan made me feel better.

Things calmed down by the end of the Winter quarter, I got straight As because my midterms simply happened to take place during that stable month between my meltdowns. Spring quarter was also okay and I got straight A-s. Besides studying however, I spent ages masturbating everyday (like 5 hours at a time and it still isn't enough). At the time it was very therapeutic, but it was also becoming a big time waster. Now that I've completely stopped I feel really anxious and I can't concentrate, like there's a block in the frontal lobe of my head at times, so I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms from not masturbating, which is just great. The two times I did masturbate I felt great after, and the withdrawals sort of went. I also have constant urges to masturbate due to complete abstinence...

I'm better now though, for the most part at least. But I don't have a fucking junior internship. The past year has taken its toll and my career seems to be the final victim. I had quite a few interviews but for some reason it never worked out. Lots of second round interviews but most places only take one candidate and the bigger places need a diverse set of schools. The investment banks were my best hope, because each of them takes about 3 or 4 kids from my school, but I haven't taken any accounting coursework so I didn't make it past the first round at any of them. All I have is this stupid tech startup which accepts everyone because they don't pay you, not one penny. Today the CEO of the company emailed me, telling they were 'overcrowded' so I should only come into the office when he wants me to. WTF is that supposed to mean? I've been too ashamed to tell my parents that I'm not being paid.

I feel so burnt out yet at the same time I need a job. I feel like society has rejected me. I'm educated and my credentials are fine yet I just haven't been able to get a proper job while everyone else has and I swear there's nothing severely wrong with me. It feels awful that I'm not supporting myself and I feel ashamed that my dad still has to pay for my every expense. On paper I'm qualified and I swear I'm not that bad at interviewing. Most interviewers in the first round told me I interviewed pretty well. I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing, like I got this far but now I can't find a job and the next stage of life has been denied to me. All I've had this past year is misery.

I don't really know why I wrote this whole thing. I don't know. What do you guys think, or has anyone been in this sort of situation or have any general advice? I just need to talk to some people about this tbh. Also please don't be mean. The reason I had my second bout of panic attacks and eventual hospitalization was actually because someone was horrible to me on Reddit and I started thinking they might be right and I just spiraled out of control. I know I sound very high maintenance, but these standards or whatever, they're completely internal to me. They exist because I am the way I am, I have a preconceived notion of success and if I don't live up to it I get upset. They aren't unrealistic at all, they fit my resume and I'm upset I haven't gotten to where I want. Similarly romance wise, I'm not bad looking, I take good care of my self, I run everyday and recently started lifting weights and stuff. I guess I do idealize romance. But I like it, its one source of positivity in my life. I've gotten really religious too lately, prayer helps. While writing this out I got an email from a big venture capital firm for an interview and I just feel desperate... before I used to get excited and I would start researching and preparing notes, now I get a little freaked out when I get good news."
3a5p02,12,2015-06-17,My college sweetheart cheated on me. I'm so blindsided and so devastated.,inconspicuous_junior,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3a5p02/my_college_sweetheart_cheated_on_me_im_so/,"I just recently graduated from college, about a month ago, and so did my girlfriend. We met the first day of sophomore year and didn't start dating until early into junior year.

When we graduated, I moved back home and she stayed at school to do an internship. Our relationship was very happy, always with each other and did everything together, she told me over and over again how I'm her best friend in the whole world. We talked about being together after she got into an accelerated nursing program and moving into my home town.

Last weekend we saw each other at our friends 21st birthday party and it's like we were never apart. The sex was great, she never left my side, we talked and partied like normal and she even fell asleep on my chest watching TV the night she stayed at my friends house.

Then I get a few texts this morning at 4:30AM..
""Junior, I need to talk to you tomorrow""
""I let another boy kiss me""
""And I love you a lot but that shouldn't be able to happen""

I thought nothing of it. I'm not really cool with the thought of someone else kissing her, but it's just a kiss, right? I call her and we start talking, she spills the beans that about three weeks ago, she got blacked out and slept with someone else. 

Okay, I'm a little pissed off, she has a habit of getting a little too drunk. But everyone makes mistakes, this one just hurts more than usual. No, that wasn't all, we kept talking. Then she says it was a week and it was the week right before our friends birthday. More talking, it was two weeks long. 

I HAD BEEN GONE A WEEK AND SHE STARTED SOMETHING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

I just feel so betrayed. I don't know what to do. I'm writing this about an hour after I found out. I just feel like someone kicked me in the nuts and kneed me in the face.

I think the worst thing is, I asked her if it would still be going on if the kid didn't go home this week. She said yes.

I just feel like a whole shitstorm of things are working against me. I haven't found a full time job yet and now this. 


Edit: They had sex for two weeks. She showed up to our friends house and never batted an eye. I think she only told me cause the kid went back to his hometown for the summer and she couldn't live with the guilt. And as far as exclusivity, it was an exclusive relationship and was established as such since the very beginning."
3a5rog,69,2015-06-17,My [21F] boyfriend [22M] keeps breaking my trust. Should I even keep trying?,HairFullOfSecrets_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a5rog/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_keeps_breaking_my_trust/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 3 years. We have a dog together and are living together (just for the summer). I do all the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and even pick out his outfits for work. But I love the kid, so I usually don't mind doing it all.


We've had problems in the past with him texting ex-girlfriends and old hook-up from high school and being really flirty and inappropriate. It always ends the same way; I get upset, he makes a half-hearted apology, and things are good again for a couple months. I always feel super guilty for snooping and let it go because every other aspect of our relationship is great. 

A couple months ago, I found an old iPhone of his in my desk. He had been using it to play games on and browse reddit while at the house. I opened it up and immediately stumbled upon some old text messages (from October) where he is arranging a meet up with someone in which is person needs to ""freshen up"" before he gets there. When he got home, I asked him about it and he lied until he knew I had evidence. Then he admitted that he has had bisexual thoughts for a long time. Back in October, he had met his breaking point and needed to explore those feelings. So, he had sex with a guy he met on the internet. He said it didn't go well, but that he does think he his bisexual. This broke my heart. I was very upset that he went behind my back and cheated, but I felt horrible that he's had these feelings since as long as he could remember and had never told anyone about it. 

After this, we sat down and had a very serious conversion about our relationship and what we both need to change if we want to stay together and eventually get married. We both expressed that we are unsatisfied with our sex life. I expressed to him that he puts me down a lot with comments about my appearance, weight, and various other flaws that I have. I have been working out like crazy and trying to eat really healthy, but my self-esteem has definitely plummeted. The end result of the conversion was that we were both going to try harder for each other and try to find a way for him in explore his bisexuality in a way that I'm comfortable with. 

After this conversation, things have been going great. We went away for the weekend to spend time with his family and for him to visit with a guy friend from highschool who he hasn't seen in a while. When planning the trip, he told me that he would want some alone time to hang out with this friend. I was totally cool with that so I spent the day with his family and our dog. 

Last night, he had fallen asleep so I went to set our alarm (which we usually do with his phone). Open on his phone is TONS messages between a girl, who apparently he met up with on Saturday night when he was supposed to be with his friend. In the messages, he's acting like he has no girlfriend and has been crashing on a friend's couch for the summer.

I confronted him and he told me he did meet up with her to go get drinks. Oh and even better his facebook (that he refuses to add me on) that he uses for his internship is clearly being used to connect with girls. He says nothing happened and he feels horrible about it. He says he loves me and wants to be with me, but he's unsatisfied and wants to have an open relationship. I told him I wanted him to tell this girl that he had been lying and is in a serious relationship, add me on his facebook, and work to gain my trust back and then once that happened we could talk about maybe swinging or doing something of that nature. I told him I'm sick of fighting to make things work on his terms and to make him happy and I want to be the one to be fought for. He did not do the first two things, and was very quiet/ brushing me off this morning when we were getting ready for work. 

I have no clue if I will ever be able to trust him again. I am a wreck. I am hurt that he isn't making an effort to make things work. My friends have advised that I've given him way too many chances and that he will never change. I love him, but I almost feel like I've given everything I have to make this work and I don't have anything left. I hope I was able to convey the situation well, as I'm pretty upset right now and I've never posted on reddit before. 

tl;dr My boyfriend has broken my trust many times. Should I break things off with him or give him one more chance?

Edit: You are all right. I know I need to break things off. My friends said the same thing. I guess I have been mindfucked that things are great and I am happy, when I am not. While my past choices don't seen too rational, I did make sure that while we got the dog together I adopted her in my name and paid all the adoption fees (the vet bills are in my name as well) and the apartment is all in my name as well. So he will be leaving me and the dog, and the two of us can celebrate all the new closet space we're going to have. I have already texted him that we need to talk when he gets home from work. He knows it coming. Thanks for the advice, "

I am going to begin networking the second I step onto campus through my computer science department and seek out as many AI related companies as possible. My school has a program where I am already getting 40% of my tuition covered through a scholarship, but that still leaves a large amount of money on my end to make up (most likely pulling out a 20k+ loan). 

In my ideal world where everything goes to plan, I network and find an AI company willing to intern me for the summer after I graduate as an undergrad, then pay for the remaining portion of my Master's degree in AI, and then hire me after obtaining the Master's degree. To anyone who knows more than me on matters of this nature, 1)how likely could this scenario be? (I'm a very put together and dedicated individual, and I will not lot anything stop me from achieving what I want to do.) and 2) Will a company realistically pay for the remaining portion of my graduate studies or am I really only looking at a certain percentage covered?

Any advice/help would be great. In the end even if a company doesn't pay for the remaining portion of my Master's I'll pull out the loan and get it anyways because I know a career in AI is where I belong. "

3a6614,2,2015-06-17,I'm [23 M] taking a huge step to the right with my fiancee [23 F] by being forced into a long distance relationship and I have no idea what I'm doing.,theglenlovinet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a6614/im_23_m_taking_a_huge_step_to_the_right_with_my/,"So, there is a lot going on here so I'll try to keep it neat. 

I've been with my fiancee for about 3 years this July and we've been engaged since last Christmas. We live in Indianapolis but a turn of events has caused my fiancee to move to Cooperstown NY for graduate school (She's going into museum studies and that is THE BEST school for her field - no joke), unfortunately my job field is a little more complicated. I graduated with a degree in Media Studies and although I have looked and applied everywhere I possibly could and after a year of working odd jobs, the ONLY opportunity given to me in my field is at a local news station in Indianapolis; forcing me to stay for at least a year (I start this job in a week).

What I guess makes this more difficult for me is that my fiancee and I have lived together for 2 years now (not including practically living together while still living in dorms in college). We are inseparable, she is my best friend and my life (and I mean that in the best way). I have ZERO experience with long distance with the exception of a few months one summer when I took an internship in Denver while my fiancee was in Indy--and even that was difficult. 

I felt like I needed to take the job opportunity in Indy because it was the first real offer in my field and I graduated from college 13 months ago. I knew that if I didn't get a jumpstart on my career soon, I never will. Here's one of the catches though... the job is part time and wont fully pay for my rent, bills, loans, etc, so I need a second job (NBD, I know) and I'm fortunate enough to stay with my current job BUT it is forcing to have a 7-Day work week (I don't wanna get into too many details about the schedule and everything).

Though I'm looking for a different second job I hate to admit it but the one I do have pays pretty well. So getting back to the relationship part; I feel like I'm living one of my big fears because not only am I not being able to see my fiancee, I am unable to be able to visit her; let alone able sit down for five minutes. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to keep our relationship strong and make sure that I'm doing well enough to not smother her, annoy her, or get constantly upset about not being able to see her. She doesn't leave for another 2 months but I'm already feeling like she left or everything is the ""Last This or Last That"" and I'm constantly breaking down at least once a day (which, as a 23 yo male, beforehand that NEVER happened).

To be honest, there are a lot of other things going on which have made things worse, to which I'm sorry if I start talking like I should submit to /r/offmychest. Within a month I have a big wedding to attend in Chicago, move into a new apartment, my parents have been divorced for a year but through complications have to still live in the same house up in Chicago--which is messing up my younger siblings, my father has been diagnosed with several types of cancer (I'm not making this up), all while starting a new job and plan a wedding in Wisconsin.

All-in-all, I feel like my fiancee is the only good thing in my life and now she's moving away and I can't go with her. There isn't an issue about trust or anything (which is good), we've started doing this texting thing where we're making up our own story through the texts in a sort of RPG theme, and there will be some breaks; so why am I still a wreck?

I think it's safe to say that I'm terrified of such a drastic change, especially for not being able to wake up next to my fiancee. I'm afraid to be alone (though I have a cat), because I can't be myself to deal with my nearly explosive anxiety now. I have friends here but they like to party, live without problems and stay out late (which I just can't do much anymore). 

If there is anything I really want to ask: what can I do to cope with a long distance relationship? What should I do to keep the communication between my fiancee and I great? How do I deal with being alone while being in a committed relationship?

Sorry about the novel, but I really just need some help to deal with going about a long distance relationship and with everything else going to shit, this is the one thing I want to keep well.

EDIT: My fiancee has been through long distance before which helps, even though neither of them worked out.
   
**tl;dr**: Forced into a long-distance relationship before a wedding, I'm a nervous wreck / How do I go about it and stay happy?"
3a6805,16,2015-06-17,The “inner game” of becoming a data scientist,will-stanton,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3a6805/the_inner_game_of_becoming_a_data_scientist/,"I have seen a lot of posts lately where aspiring data scientists are asking questions like, ""OMG, data scientists know so *much*!"" or ""I don't know where to start!"" or ""What do I do!? I don't have a PhD!"" I know where you're coming from, but for many of you, just getting the factual answers to your questions will not help you become a data scientist. Why? Because your ""inner game"" is inhibiting you from reaching your goals.

What do I mean by ""inner game?"" As explained in the famous book *The Inner Game of Tennis*, the inner game is the game that goes on inside your head while you're playing a match. Most great players have a great inner game. When they lose a point, they don't dwell on it. When they are about to play a match against Roger Federer, they really *believe* that they can win. And even if they *do* win, they can still find things they could have improved in their play.

When I started my journey to become a data scientist, I was wracked with anxiety. I didn't really know anything about machine learning. Hell, I could barely program a computer. I tried to audit a Java programming class and left after a week. My inner game was weak, and I was stuck. I found some inspiration in the book [The Now Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524). The book helped me realize that my anxiety wouldn’t go away through browsing the internet. So I stopped sitting at my computer and took action!

I had a huge breakthrough when I started going to data science meetups and actually talking to people. Contrary to the picture of data scientists I had gotten from the internet, I found out that most data scientists are not experts in everything. I found out that with some persistence, I *could* learn how to code and train machine learning algorithms. My anxiety fell away like magic, and my inner game got so much better. I no longer gave up when I had some trouble with my code. I felt much more confident reaching out to employers.  Soon after, I found my first data science  internship (at a Meetup!), which turned into a full-time job.

So what’s my advice for the aspiring data scientists out there? Make sure your inner game is just as strong as your technical skills and your resume. You’ll need confidence and persistence and resilience if you want to become a data scientist. And you will need all of those traits when you finally *get* your first data scientist job, too. Best of luck, and please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

Edit: I got a lot more responses than I expected from this post! I plan to write more self-posts like this, as long as people are still interested. Meanwhile, I have a few more articles like this on my blog: http://will-stanton.com/"
3a6a9b,2,2015-06-17,Help with pulling data from a lot of (F)riggin sheets!,[deleted],excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/3a6a9b/help_with_pulling_data_from_a_lot_of_friggin/,"Alright r/excel, I just started my finance internship, and I have been working on a gross margin report that sage spit out at me. The only problem with this report is that instead of making into a nice table for me to then run some formulas on, it put each job onto a different sheet. What I want to know is how can you pull data from each tab of the workbook, and put it into a nice table. 

Specifics: 
1) On each of the sheets, the job number is in the same cell, so what kind of formula would allow me to pull all of the job numbers from each of the different sheets and place them in descending order.  I want to put all the C4 cell values from each sheet onto one page. Here is an example of what the data on each page looks like.
http://imgur.com/2JMEcH4,Wfh1eEK 

2) The other piece of data that I need can be found in one of two cells, as the area I was using changed depending on how many change orders there were for the job. Am I able to set up a varying ""puller"" that will pull data from either cell, since it is either a value, or blank for the two cells I need it to check. I need it to check for either cells J14 or J15.

Conclusion: I was looking for a final product that would look something similar to this.

3a6el6,2,2015-06-17,Macbook Air Needs a New Logic Board,[deleted],applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3a6el6/macbook_air_needs_a_new_logic_board/,"So I was replacing the battery in my Mid 2012 Air (model MD232xx/A) yesterday, and my day pretty much ended up with me clutching comfort food and feeling horrible. 

I opened up the back and was undoing the ribon chord that connected to the logic board. It was not hard for me to do, because I've done it before. I started to remove the ribbon cable that connects the battery, and all the pins snapped off from the logic board, and I nearly had a break down. 

I recently quit my job and decided to follow my gut and put all my faith in getting a Computer Science degree. I quit my job because I wanted to dedicate my whole summer to learning how to code and was hoping to build up a resume and get my first internship in the fall when the STEM hiring fair is. Worst of all, any money I put down will ultimately come from the money I was saving for a special family occasion.

I took it to a nearby Apple Store and they quoted me $755 for repairs. No flat rate or anything. Then I had a break down. There is literally no way I can pay that.

So here's where I'm at:

I'm trying to figure out if it would be more cost effective to simply get a Unibody Macbook and some SSD for it so I can have something. The whole shebang goes for ~$350.

I can order a new logic board from eBay for the befallen Air for about the same price, or I can cough up the extra ~$50 for the updated 2013 version with better battery life. However I don't know if I can simply take the updated logic board and transplant it into the older 2012 frame.

I don't need it for gaming. And I would prefer a longer lasting battery. However, I don't really have a whole lot of money, and I'm trying to figure out the best thing to do. I've scoured google for any answers, and I've got some options, but no definite answers. What should I do?

3a6f25,10,2015-06-17,Should I accept my first job offer?,Sunsweep,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3a6f25/should_i_accept_my_first_job_offer/,"I'm a fresh bachelors graduate looking for a job. I've recently received an offer from a company and they want to hear back by the end of the week.

The thing is, while I like the type of work the company does, I'm less sure of the company itself. Its glassdoor reviews seem kind of strange, with a bunch of recent reviews( as in starting from June) giving them 4 or 5 stars. If you remove those reviews, there are less enthusiastic reviews, many of which saying there is little opportunity to advance and that when deadlines come up work/life balance becomes bad.These reviews did mention it was a decent place to pick up experience as a fresh graduate though. Another strange thing is the interview process with the company went by very quickly, and they were the ones to seek me out.

Because of this and a slightly below expectations salary I'm on the fence about whether or not to accept. I don't have any other job offers right now, and none of the other interview processes I'm going through will be done by the time this company wants to hear my answer. Part of my hesitance may come from the fact that I once had a very unpleasant internship experience, and I'm afraid of going blind into this. I'm very unfamiliar with how difficult it is to switch jobs as a fresh graduate if things go badly.

EDIT: the industry is computer science. The pay is only a few thousand under what I'd expect, but I'm afraid of starting low and being unable to climb. Also, I was looking at apartments in the area and rent is somewhat expensive."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are the biggest problems facing journalists in the digital age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kcrn?context=5)|That's a really great question. There a multitude of them and I could fill the page with thoughts on that. But I also think there's a lot to be optimistic about since we are in an age of innovation and because the hyper competitiveness of the market now means we as journalists are being forced to really up our game to stand out.
 |But I do encourage younger journalists to try to have a long view. Build a life, not a career (that's more just life advice I guess). But in view of that, I want more young journalists to fight against the urge to do stuff that's quick, cute or clever and to dig deeper and do work that might take a little longer, but is thoughtful, or makes a serious point, or helps readers understand things about the world that actually help them or enlighten them or raise their spirits in a meaningful way.
 |We do need to have more investigative journalism, and I'm encouraged by what Ben Smith at Buzzfeed is doing in that space, as well as places like ProPublica. But we need many more folks to get into that space, and there's no question that the business side is still a puzzle.
 |I also think the headline on this New Yorker piece sums up the challenge facing journalists. [Link to www.newyorker.com](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-new-theory-of-distraction?mbid=social_twitte) We are in an age of distraction and a huge challenge for journalists is to reach an audience and get our material in front of people with anything other than ephemera. People are busy, they're stressed, and they're distracted. It's a business problem but also a creator problem. We're all still figuring it out. 
[*we are in an age of innovation and because the hyper competitiveness of the market now means we as journalists are being forced to really up our game to stand out.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9nhmq?context=5)|Upping our game means doing quality work in a way that is also easy to read, interesting and relevant. there is inherent tension between the sort of purist attitude of 'this is important/really good/etc so people should read it' and 'make it palatable to the largest possible audience.'
[Do you have a sense of the long term goals of the Koch network? Some of the RNC officials you quote seem to think the Kochs want to ""supplant"" the GOP. Do you think that's the case? And I guess, if so, why? What can't they get out of current GOP that they'd need to supplant it? (and is that supplanting just in terms of data capabilities or a more wholesale supplanting?\) Thanks for doing this, Jon!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kwa1?context=5)|Reporting on this topic has introduced me to a new level of smoke and mirrors. as one of the many people I spoke with said, 'you can't trust anyone' on this topic because everyone has an agenda. that's usually the case in political journalism, but here, there are other factors at play: a lot of money and a technical element to the story that gives those with expertise the ability to run circles around those who don't understand the mechanics, and which makes it hard to know who actually understands the process and who doesn't.
 |An example of the smoke and mirrors. more than one person on team RNC said they think the Koch's political arm actually wants to become, in some part, a shadow party. but you have to consider that some of this may be posturing, an attempt to alarm others so that they rally to the cause.
 |But the alarm did seem sincere, and I don't think the RNC would be going public with their confrontation with the Kochs unless they were concerned about losing control of data and relevance.
 |As to Koch world, I don't know how Charles and David Koch feel about this issue. it may be that the direction taken by Freedom Partners and i360 is not something they're aware of or in favor of, or it may be that they've blessed it. it's actually probably neither, ie not as black and white. I would guess that with the RNC's decision to take this fight public the brothers have started paying closer attention to the issue. 
[What are some things that annoy you most about the current journalism climate? Does it ever get frustrating to know that a large part of the American population don't seem to be actively interested in what you may deem important?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9mp2j?context=5)|I love this question. i'll admit, I love the movie ""Idiocracy."" I think it's absolute genius. I'm a huge Neil Postman fan, especially because of ""Amusing Ourselves to Death."" So if you've watched that movie or read that book or both, you know a lot about where my head's at on this question. I think TV has ruined us in many ways, not because of the people in it but because of the way the medium works. Add on top of that the schizophrenic distraction of the digital age and it's not the greatest recipe for an informed, thoughtful electorate.
 |But I try not to gripe about it. And I definitely don't want to think or act like what I'm doing every day is somehow more important than what people who don't follow politics are doing, because it's not. People running restaurants or doing maintenance on our infrastructure or teaching our kids or serving in our military or cleaning our hotels or whatever are all doing amazing things every day.
 |So yeah it's important that people be informed. But again, people are busy and they don't always have time to be up to date on stuff. My only real plea is that people read more than they watch TV. I'm not against TV - it's great for some things - but don't think it should be the primary way people educate themselves about the world. 
[What are your thoughts on Rand Paul? Have you ever met him in person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9n8ih?context=5)|I have a few times. I interviewed him in Iowa in February. [Link to news.yahoo.com](http://news.yahoo.com/in-iowa--a-tale-of-two-rand-pauls-182905616.html)
 |I think he is, as time put it, a very interesting political figure (they said he was most interesting man in politics), and I think he's had an amazing knack for drafting off hot button issues to raise his political profile. right now it's a little unclear whether he's had his best days as a presidential hopeful or whether he's got another surge in him. how he performs in iowa looks like it's gonna be pretty important, but then again, New Hampshire has a lot of libertarians, so maybe he can get a boost there. 
[If the Kochs and the RNC are at war, who do you expect to win? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kioa?context=5)|Hello jstrong! :) the Kochs, ie i360, are much better funded obviously, and among Republican campaign folks, they just want to win. they don't care about stupid philosophical questions. but by going public with the philosophical, more big picture question about who is the more responsible guardian of the Republican party's master voter file, the RNC may be able to rally some folks in the GOP to their side. a big moment will be what the eventual GOP presidential nominee does and how they lead the party on this question of data 
[*among Republican campaign folks, they just want to win. they don't care about stupid philosophical questions.*  I'm in the ""everyone needs to take a breath camp"" in your article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9n7hj?context=5)|Just to be clear, i don't think the philosophical question is stupid. i was channeling some operatives I've spoken too.
[Oh I don't think it is, I'd side with the RNC just on a ""the party is the party"" basis. But they aren't my boss, the candidate is, and he wants to win. All this can be distracting from the goal of winning in Novembers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9njt7?context=5)|Yup, that's where a lot of folks are. presidential nominee's decisions/actions will be big.
[How do you feel about the number of presidential candidates in the upcoming election? Job secutiry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9maw5?context=5)|Ha, good point. i think the debate format is ripe for some disruption. change it up, flip the script. try new things. i liked what Ben Domenech proposed ([Link to thefederalist.com](http://thefederalist.com/2015/05/18/fix-the-gop-presidential-debates-with-this-one-simple-trick/)) get rid of the moderator. maybe not for all debates, but why not do at least one that way?
 |I misread your question. thought  you asked about debates. as for the number of candidates, it's remarkable, historic and sometimes confounding. but it's going to be fun to cover.
[What made you want to become a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9ke94?context=5)|It wasn't all that thought out. i was a lit major at the university of Maryland (go terps!), I taught high school lit for two years after college, and then decided I want to write for a living, somehow, some way. I got a bunch of advice, and people I talked to said that the best way to build a writing career of any kind was to go into newspapers (this was the summer of 2001). so i started looking for work and got an unpaid internship at the Washington Times on the city desk.
[Are you still using Meerkat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kj8n?context=5)|That's funny, I was just in Miami on Monday at Jeb Bush's announcement speech, and I saw Mark Halperin, who was another early adapter on Meerkat. I asked him if he was still using it, and he said he wasn't. I'm not either. I think it was a fad that will probably have a moment or two more in the sun, but I think it's hard to exist as an app that you only use occasionally, bc those are the apps you delete when you're freeing up space on your phone!
[Over the last 30 years how would you describe the evolution of the GOP? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9nlt5?context=5)|Since Goldwater in 64 they've become pretty conservative, and have had a pretty consistent internal tension between the hard right and the establishment/elite more moderate wing. Reagan united them and so did Bush for a while but they've struggled without a national leader, as any party does. Democrats were in the same position in the 80's before Clinton came along, and could be there after Obama, depending on how HRC does 
[I heard the Koch Brothers were more libertarian than republican anyway. Will this schism cause them to back more libertarian candidates? Or even libertarian leaning republicans, like Rand Paul?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9mee2?context=5)|Their roots are in Libertarianism but they've become much more involved in the Republican Party over the last decade or so. ""Sons of Kansas"" by Daniel Schulman is a book about the brothers that's actually been recommended to me by people inside the Koch empire as pretty accurate.
 |They haven't shown any affinity for Rand Paul. their most positive mentions have been of Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. They're pragmatists at the end of the day i think.
[With politicians who might have split allegiances to the RNC vs. the Koch network, like Sens. Ernst or Cotton, if they're forced to pick a side (so to speak\) how do you see that breaking down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kju2?context=5)|I think most politicians are trying to straddle the middle and not take sides, even if they're using i360 more than the RNC's voter contact tools. their defense is, we have to do what's best to win. and the RNC has acknowledged that they haven't done a good enough job, so while there are behind the scenes conversations where the RNC is not happy with folks who are using i360, it's hard for the RNC to publicly castigate anyone.

3a6ifn,471,2015-06-17,THAT'S NOT A USB PORT!,FoldingUserFerrariic,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3a6ifn/thats_not_a_usb_port/,"Back when I was an intern, I met a woman we'll call 'Patricia'. Now Patricia wasn't the brightest star in the sky, and she clearly showed it when she failed to distinguish a USB port from an HDMI port. The request came in that one of the ladies in the office had apparently been having trouble with plugging in her keyboard. 


So I grabbed a coffee and walked down to the only cubicle this problem would occur in. As I rounded the corner, there she was. In one hand was her keyboard, and in the other hand looked to be some other sort of cable. Ignoring these details I took her keyboard and went over to one of the numerous usb ports of this very sad dell midtower. 


The moment my hand grabbed the end of this keyboard's connection, my heart sank. I took one good look at the usb male end of the keyboard and sighed deeply. It was split down the middle from being forced...but forced into what? I took another look at the ports and saw the only  thing that could cause this. An obviously scratched up HDMI port. 

I don't know how this happened, but Patricia ended up mistaking the two and attempted to force the cheap USB male cable end into the HDMI female end. Her reasoning?: 'It didn't fit the first time I tried putting it in'"

I've been alone for a while and recently realized that I would like a little intimacy in my life.  So I decided to post this ad!  So a little bit about me...I will be moving to Seattle for a programming internship on Saturday (June 20).  I am mixed race, 5'1, 108 lbs.  I am an electronic musician, I produce my own music, sing in it, and perform.  Some of my favorite artists include Grimes, FKA Twigs, Run the Jewels, Bjork, Odesza, Sigur Ros, and some artists that I really like include Flying Lotus, Nicki Minaj, SZA, Ben Howard, etc.  

I'm also super big on reading (I recently finished ""A Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England"" and love sci fi) and movies/TV (favorites = ""Fight Club"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Game of Thrones"", most animated cartoons, etc).  Let's see...what else...I'm very 420 friendly.  I love to dance - mainly hip hop.  I really enjoy biking, but am not a hardcore biker.  I'm studying music and computer science at school.  I'm trying to get my Chinese back on game by reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Chinese but its been harder than I anticipated.

Anyway, thanks for reading this whole thing!  Please PM me if you're interested.  

Edit: I just got ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene in the mail!  I'm so excited.  Yes."
3a6nwo,3,2015-06-17,Post-graduate Internships of any value?,erixx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a6nwo/postgraduate_internships_of_any_value/,"I just recently graduated with a CS degree and am now on the search for a job to give it some use.  During school, however - I never got an internship (I was, and still am, at a job that I somewhat enjoyed being at during college, but now looking for the next step now that I have my degree).

I've had a few interviews in the last few months which for various reasons I did not get (one I knew I probably wouldn't get but interview experience, the other I was likely just beat out but I thought it went great, and the last wasn't comfortable with a lack  of languages that I never said I knew, despite calling me in for the interview and me explaining that I knew I would transition well).

Anyway, hence the question: would it be worth it to look into and apply for internships?  I know -many- of the companies will have no interest in a post-graduate intern, but what's your guys' opinion of applying anyway?

I would still apply to jobs in the meantime of course, but every so often a job posting for an internship will pop up and I've been debating it."
3a6o7h,1,2015-06-17,Looking for advice on optimize efficiency on my current routine.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3a6o7h/looking_for_advice_on_optimize_efficiency_on_my/,"I've been casually working out on and off for the past ~four years. (Sometimes every two days, sometimes once or twice a month.) This summer, I've started pushing myself to get in better shape so I've been frequently going (six to seven times a week) and I'm looking for how best to optimize how I'm working out as currently I just do whatever I feel like. (I have no clue what I should be doing.)


Some information about me: Male. 20. 5'8'. 165lbs. 


Current Stats: Bench: 185. Inclined Bench: 135 Deadlift: 185. Bicep Curls: 37.5 (each hand.) Leg Press/Calf Raise: 360. Pull-Ups: 5. Dumbbell Rows: 45. Laterals: 100.  Tricep Pulldown: 100. Hip Adduction: 120. Hip Abduction: 80.


Goals: Maintain current form (minimize muscle loss). Increase stamina/endurance. Lose body-fat. To expand a little, I currently can only run about 2-3 miles at a 8 min/mile pace which in my mind equates to extremely low stamina. I also have large large pecs, ok triceps, small biceps, large thighs/glute and flab on my stomach. I would ideally like to within the next couple months cut the fat on my thigh/glut/stomach as well. 


Current Routine: Currently, whenever I go workout, I start with either bench or inclined bench. Move on to a combination of bicep curls, tricep pulldowns, dumbbell rows, deadlift, leg press/calf raise and laterals. Then if I don't feel lazy (every two or three days), I do some 15-20min of running. And again if I don't feel lazy, I do core exercises. (Sit-ups, Bicycle Kicks+Crunches, Leg Raises, Side Planks.)


Current Diet: I set my goal to about 1500 Calories a day but I've been maintaining an average of 2000 Calories so that needs to change. (I average 1800 on most days then once a week slip to 2200-2500.) I have no idea what goals to set macros at so I normally average about 50-60% Carbs, 20-30% Protein, 15-25% Fat. In terms of food, I work at an internship so I have nothing for breakfast (barring a coffee/red bull). Sushi for lunch (almost every day). Dinner is a bit varied but commonly Ramen with 4-5 eggs and spinach. Throughout the day I have Beef Jerky (protein?) and sometimes an ice-cream drumstick or Mixed Congee.


Increasing stamina is a huge goal for me, but I believe that doing a lot of cardio at the rate which I do it (usually 160-170 heart rate) cuts muscle as well as fat. Ultimately, my two main goals are increasing stamina and cutting body fat while maintaining current lifts. (Though I have no idea where my lifts are really low.)

Edit: I cannot squat. (I have gotten friend to try help but I have nowhere on my neck/shoulder/back to rest the bar without weights without the pain being unbearable.) Also my title is grammatically incorrect. RIP"

I apologize ahead of time for sounding pretentious or that I'm boasting about myself. I would just like to give some thoughts about myself and ask for help in discussing if medicine is right for me. 

Right, so.. I'm currently in between my freshman and sophomore year at a private, liberal arts college in the US.

Currently, I have a 3.9 cGPA and a 4.0sGPA. At the end of this year, I became the vice president of a physics club, community outreach..person.. of a biochem club, I started a coffee club (there's some cool physics in making coffee!), and I won a business competition that provided funding for a nonprofit I'm currently working to develop. I worked about 4 hours a week in a prion research lab last year, and I'm working upwards of 30 hours/week this summer in the lab, and I'll be doing 2-credit research next year and an honors project (maybe a publication? who knows..) after that, during my junior year. I teach a GED math class at a prison to inmates, I volunteer at two after-school programs in nearby towns, and I visit a long-term geriatric care facility to volunteer and work with staff there. 

In total, this past year, I amassed around 400 volunteer hours from all sorts of backgrounds. I'm part of an organization called the Bonner Foundation that has a chapter at my school--we're required to do 300 hours of community service, and we have weekly night classes to reflect on what we've accomplished and what we'd like to do to influence the community. Aspects like civic engagement, spiritual exploration, personal leadership growth, community service, and compassion are very heavily emphasized and since there are only 35 or so members of the organization at my school, we're a close-knit family and I've really grown as a person this year. 

What else... I'm a fellow of a community-engagement focused science organization (I don't really know how to describe it, and I'd prefer against naming it for the sake of anonymity) funded by the HHMI. I work in my school's civic engagement department as a service fellow, where I'm a communications officer who updates web pages, among other responsibilities. I'm a tour guide, and next year I'll work at tech support at my school, and I'll be an intro bio lab assistant. Here's my schedule for next semester:

2-Credit prion research 

1-Credit leadership class

It'll be a lot to take in, but I've developed good study habits and overall stress-managing skills during my first year here. I came from a really underachieving public high school, so having that first year of community college really helped in managing college work. 

I'm a 19-year-old white guy, and I like photography, hiking, running really far, um.. I'm a huge Photoshop nerd, I like tinkering with electronics &amp; building computers, and volunteering whenever I get the chance. 

..That's a little about me. I sincerely apologize, again, if I sound boastful or conceited. It's neither my intention nor my desire to simply brag about my accomplishments here, and I like to consider myself pretty modest. Anyway: I came into school as a pre-med after doing an internship at a hospital, volunteering extensively at a hospital, and really loving A&amp;P two years ago. I even got to spend some time in the OR, and I was convinced of my future as a CT surgeon. 

That was when I started getting into biology research. I've loved every second I spend in the lab, and even though it's stressful, gruesomely arduous, and tedious at times, it's been the most fun I've ever had in school. I've since dropped out of the pre-med club here, and set my sights on grad school in some form of applied biochemistry/biophysics-based science, with the eventual intent upon teaching in some degree in the future. I haven't shadowed anyone, and though I planned on obtaining an EMT-B cert and working for my school's EMS company, I dropped that idea after dropping the idea of medicine altogether. 

Then.. I got into population/organismal ecology. I've always been a reptile nerd, and I love snakes. I have two snakes right now, and I actually have a job this summer working with snakes at a local zoo. I looked into doing that with my future, but.. needless to say, herpetology isn't exactly lucrative. I'm taking a biology of the neotropics course in Costa Rica next winter, and I'm super excited for it. My biology major is pretty much contained within my biochem/molecular bio major, which is why I can do all 3 majors, but I'm focusing on conservation biology (and I'm lining up an internship in Tanzania next summer for conservation biology) with my biology major, and I really don't quite know where to go with that. The physics major is pretty much just for fun, since I've always loved physics and math, and I've gotten a little into programming (just basic stuff.. I know Java/HTML/CSS/Javascipt now, but currently learning Python) with a comp sci minor. 

I've recently become interested once more in medicine, but moreso for the community involvement and positive influence they can have, instead of the financial stability and career opportunity I'd originally set out for. I recently experienced my grandmother passing away in a hospital, and to see the care her doctors provided for her in her latest hour.. well, I was super inspired by them, and I really started looking into it as a possible career choice once more. 

I have no idea where I'm going with this, and I think I just needed to word vomit to try to collect my thoughts, and I couldn't think of anywhere else to do it. If anyone is still reading down this far into the novella, thank you. Just to know someone's listening is reassuring when fretting over my future. "

I think Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) died at the end.

Gyllenhaal's character was simply amazing. From the little quirks that went unexplained (i.e. asking Rick to keep his window down) to the clear symbolism of his violently-obtained watch, this movie seemed to be equal parts character development and plot. Excellently scripted and excellently portrayed.

However, I left the movie confused. Such an artful hour of plot and character seemed to fizzle out in a massive deus ex machina. Lou managed to get perfectly clear footage of the police shooting a criminal, he smoothly arranged the death of his employee, he somehow caused a complete character change in Nina, the police took one unsuccessful run at his alibi and failed, and he began anew with vans and interns galore. Too perfect.

I first stumbled upon this possibility when I rewatched the scene of Lou and Nina talking dirty face-to-face while Lou's footage plays on the screen in the background. The footage that is playing is of Rick's death. However, the footage isn't Lou's footage; it is the film footage. It is the death of Rick as the audience saw it, not as Lou filmed it. All of this leads me to believe that Lou was shot on sight by the criminal in the flipped car. Beginning with Lou's shout to Rick that the criminal is dead and the coast is clear, the movie is Lou's consciousness in a transition state imagining events as he would like them to unfold. 

Let me know if you agree/disagree with this! I haven't found this interpretation anywhere else."

Cold emails are actually VERY helpful. Sent out a handful of cold emails (50 or so). Got a bunch of replies, I'd say at least 20 to 25. Of those responses one was a phone interview and another turned into a direct onsite interview (no phone interview). Both turned into offers, accepted one and I've now been an act sci analyst for about a month at a large P&amp;C company.

For some perspective:

* Location: Canada
* School: Large School - Major Stats - Not waterloo
* Exams: P, FM, MLC 
* GPA: 2.2 (no one asked for it)
* Act Sci Internships: 0
* Other experience: 18 months as a Financial analyst at a small company. A lot of reporting/analytics work
* Computer Skills: Excel, VBA, SQL, R (all used daily in the FA role)

Get out there, get a job in any field. Demonstrate you can use VBA, Excel, SQL and other technical skills and start emailing. Hopefully this gives some people hope and doesn't make too many people bitter.

3a6xnv,7,2015-06-17,Dealing with ADHD,meowsif_stalin,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3a6xnv/dealing_with_adhd/,"For a long time i would blame my failures on my ADHD. I'm not taking away from the fact that it is a disability but i also see it as a severe lack of motivation. For years i would be lazy and hyper focus on the wrong things. For a lot of us we may be going down routes were not supposed to, hence a severe lack of motivation to get anything done in the field were in. Recently I've managed to light the fire in me and started getting things done. What I did along with taking my medication for it was change my mindset. I dropped a class because it was too difficult and instead of wasting the rest of my summer away playing video games which are my total weakness is i have taken up programming. I've got it drilled into my head that computer science is what i want to do and now being on the verge of failing out of school it's what i have to do. I've never wanted anything more than to succeed in this and with that said I've started busting my ass and it's helped significantly with my motivation. Some days lets face it, i really don't think there's much you can do to get motivated but other days when you are I encourage you to try your hardest at it. As for finding the right field for yourself. A little about me last year i had an municipal engineering internship. I was motivated to do well at first but it was the most boring thing in the world and it was easy to get distracted from. On top of that it wasn't paid so my motivation was next to nothing. After three months i was let go and i hardly regret anything from that experience. What i learned from it is i will never accomplish anything with out the proper motivation. Now I'm doing something completely different, I'm in commision based sales at a retail store. On average i'm probably making minimum wage but there's just something about having very relaxed managers who basically say, ""We don't care what you do. Just make us money and make yourself money."" For whatever reason I'm highly motivated and i work my ass off for minimum wage sales, loving every second of it. I'm not behind a desk, i get to be on my feet and talk to people, make friends and make money in the process. For me it's an extroverted adrenaline rush of get fired or make bank. Now what I've done is i'm taking that motivation and setting my goals on the far future. If i graduate with a computer science degree i could be making 60k a year!! And let me tell you thinking about that and actually wanting it has turned my lazy work ethic around. It's all about figuring out ways to lighting that fire underneath you. I really hope this helps some of you. I'll try to answer any questions in a timely manner. Sorry if this was super scatter brained :("

I just quite frankly don't have any real experience aside from customer service/hospitality jobs which is what I did before grad school.

I am considering buying a preconstruction condo ready for 2018 summer, which by that time I would finish my masters. As a student right now, I only make 19/h for my summer internship, but I expect to make atleast 55k /year by 2018. Looking for approximately 300-350k 1bedroom, and if my 2018 I make 41k after deductions (55k/y)(3200/month), then I should be able to make monthly payments (tax, maint, hydro, mortgage) of 1500/month, while still saving and living comfortably .

That said, my father, who resides in a different country and does not have a Canadian citizenship is offering to help with the 20% downpayment. 

How would I go about getting pre-approved for a mortgage with a low interest rate? Can I have an international co-signer or guarantor, or is that based on if the lender bank has an international branch in the same country that my father lives in?

If that isn't an option, what would the best route or option be to go about this?

Thanks !

Edit: based on comments and feedback and advice, another possible route would be to buy an existing condo in the area, rent it out until 2018, then take over the mortgage. That way expenses can be calculated before hand  and positive cash flow can be more obtainable . Mortgage would still be guarantored  by my mom who is in a citizen too. Thoughts to this route instead? "

We were close friends from about 2010-2013, then there was a huge issue between him, his ex-girlfriend, and me, and we didn't start talking again until early this year. After we talked about how we really felt about each other, things were great, but for the past couple months, certain things have been popping up that I'm not entirely sure how to approach.

He's become a little paranoid. He wanted me to put some tracking app on my phone ""just in case"" and gets indignant when I have plans with friends and won't ditch them to be with him. I can name at least three other women who have cheated on him, and I understand why he'd be a little anxious about this-except he *knows* me and he knows that I don't talk to ANY of my exes. I put the app on my phone because I honestly don't have anything to hide and I like to pick my battles, but I feel kind of bad that he lies about the just in case thing, because I *know* what he's looking for.

Also, he's pushing me to get a joint bank account with him, join his phone plan, and live with him already. Constantly. I've explained straight out that this is all stuff I wouldn't even consider unless I was engaged or even married. I don't know whether this is another paranoia thing or him just trying to be nice, but he just doesn't seem to understand why I don't want to go there yet. I'm definitely not one of those women who expects or even wants the guy to pay for everything, and I'm perfectly capable of supporting myself. Another issue is that I make quite a bit more money than he does-I'm a law student who has a really awesome and surprisingly well-paid internship, and he's a manager at a pizza store-and I know this sounds awful, but I don't really want him anywhere near my money with that level of access. He gripes about not having money for this and that despite the fact that he still lives with his mother rent-free, and I don't really want to be the one fixing that issue by agreeing to a joint bank account.

I guess I'm looking for advice and opinions on this situation. I do care about him a lot, but there just seems to be so much tension about our styles in relationships."

 Jxmmy is definitely my favorite character, he's so fucking cool, and mad funny. I think he and fiona belongs together. The fact that he's not a main cast in the show anymore makes me like him more.

#2. Lip 
Ok Lip's a fucking boss, liked him throughout the show but fuck! Common, that shit with Amanda was so disrespectful. She fucking loved him and he treated her like that?

#3. Carl
Carl's my fucking nigga! Nothing more needed to be said here

#4. Karen
I loved her in season 3 and hoped she and lip would be together.....but fucking mandy! Hate that bitch! How can Lip still have sex with Mandy after what she did to Karen? (Bad Writing)

#5. Amanda
Ok, Amanda is sexy as fuck! Smart, rich and unlike Mandy, she is good for Lip. How can Lip not see that though? She fucking loves him. He took her virginity fa god sakes! I loved when Lip had sex with his professor because it was kinda awesome, but I hated it when he started to ignore Amanda. He didnt even want to have sex with her. And by the way, wasn't Lip suppose to get that Internship from Amanda's dad? I really hope she comes back in season 6

#6 Bianca
I know she was only in the show for a few episodes, but that plot was one of the best I've ever seen. I fucking loved her

#7 Mickey
Didn't like Mickey at first but I've grown into liking this guy. His attitude is a fucking masterpiece

#8 Frank
Who else but Frank Gallagher!?

#9 Chucky
LOL. Did y'all see the last scene in the season finale of season 5? 
#10 Kev
He's been the nicest guy in the show hasn't he?

I got over it though, since going off to college and what not. 

About a year ago my family moved to another state and I ran into her family over my college summer break. I took her out to lunch and spoke with her for sometime over the following semester and found myself attracted to her yet again. That Thanksgiving break I got her her favorite flower and, after me thinking she was being receptive, tried to kiss her. She pretty much flipped the fuck out. (Not about the flower, but the kiss part)

Following that we had a Skype conversation as to what I was intending with that and I spoke that I was interested in a relationship and we just kind of agreed to 'see how things go'.

During winter break, I asked her on a date and she flipped out again, because she thought she had clearly communicated that 'see how things go' meant to be just friends. This essentially led to an argument where I said that we clearly shouldn't be talking if we're both weirded out from some miscommunications, and told her that we probably shouldn't speak until time does its thing. I figured that this was for the best and was alright with never speaking with her again.

At the beginning of this summer break, I got a very unexpected text - she told me she wanted to get back in contact. We were both invited to a friend's wedding and I began our first conversation, after several months of not speaking, by talking about the plans I had setup for the groom and wedding party. Unfortunately, she was unable to attend so I offered to bring a letter to the couple for her. This, obviously, required me to see her.

I fully went into that expecting to be met with some super uber passive/aggressive behavior but I was delightfully surprised. We talked for a bit then I left.

Sometime around my return from the wedding, we got coffee and went bowling. I asked her if she wanted to hangout sometime again before she went off to her internship and she agreed. Before I dropped her off she also invited me to an open mic at her workplace. Me, being incredibly stupid, agreed to show up. (I'm not very proud of my singing, but I've been told its not painful to listen to). I decided to perform a cover of my favorite song, simply because it was my favorite song.

EDIT: Apparently we can't link URLs, the song was Telegraph Ave. by Childish Gambino

In retrospect, I may find that this was a particularly bad idea due to the subject of the song. I didn't really care though, because it's still my favorite song. After the open mic, as I was leaving, I got up to leave and waited for her to be free for a second so I could ask her when she'd be free. She said she wouldn't be the next week and I was all like 'Alright, cool stuff. Cya around'. That night, I sent her a message thanking her for the invite to the open mic, and that I had a lot of fun and wouldn't mind some info about other events at that place. 

Here's where the 'problem' comes in. I feel like I'm being given the cold shoulder right now. I can be pretty neurotic/paranoid about things sometimes but I can usually deal with it. My message hasn't been 'seen' even though she's pretty active on Facebook and hasn't responded to something I tagged her in. It's been a while as well. I'm trying really hard not to be 'that guy' right now though, and haven't said anything else. 

I'm still attracted to her but I've decided that I value our friendship very much so that makes things a little difficult for me. 

So, am I being super paranoid? Should I say anything?

**tl;dr: Meetup with old HS crush, fall for her again, we fall out, we make up, might be getting cold shoulder now?**

He's pretty intimidating to me, though, since he's very experienced and knows his shit, to say the least. That's where the problem comes in:

So I first arrived at his office and we got right to it. He told me I'd be working with PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Laravel. I have never actually used any of those things ever. Anyway, he had me install all the components of LAMP, and connect to his MySQL db with PHP. Pretty straightforward here, but still foreign to me. 

So from there I was sort of on my own, ish. He gave me an idea of what he wanted me to do: Build a website where I could query an inventory (from the db) and get details on each item (industrial items like screws, steel, etc). With Flask/Python, I would be comfortable, but hopping into a new language (php) and new framework (laravel), it was kind of daunting. He kinda just set me on it. I asked few questions because it seemed like he expected me to know this, like ""Hey just set up your config file and have a formatted MVC layout (never heard of it...), it should be no prob right?"" He wants the base of the project done by the end of the week, which should be enough time to buckle down and learn the basics, but I think he expects me to be on a higher level than I might be. 

This may not be as big of a problem as I see it, but I am worried to go back after the base project is done and have him hit me with another stressful load of stuff that he expects me to know already. Getdotbit was written pretty.... umm.. hacky. I doubt things were even close to professionally formatted/set up.

I know this is sort of a 'desperate rant', but is there any advice someone can give me to handle a situation where I might be in a bit over my head?"

We were both in our teens when we met and started dating, never thought it would go past high school. Went past high school, into college. After we both graduated from community college we applied at univerisities, we both got into the same one, my first choice, her 4th choice. i pushed for her to come with me, because i knew her, she wouldnt last. she had never lived away from her family, let again away from anyone she knew. She finally agreed. She accepted to go to my first choice and we moved in together, about 3 hours away from our families.  But thats when things went south. Her parents being from traditions families opposed the fact that we move in together with out being married. So i proposed and got married, not exactly my ideal situtaion but i figured, i been with this girl for 7 years, might as well get married. 
We were both in school, full time students and i was working a full time job. Everything was ok the first year. Then it got to our senior year and we both put our marriage in the back of our minds, We still lived together and acted like a married couple, but affectionate wise we stopped showing each other we loved each other. 
She told me that she wasnt happy but i told her it was only temporary, that i was sorry for not paying attention for her, but between 18 units at school, 40+ hours a week of work, plus an internship, i was really busy and exhausted. 

WE got more distant when she got mono, she wouldnt kiss me or get close to me. Around that same time, one of my coworkers started talking to me. Just texting and kind of flirtatious at work, but i saw it as her being friendly, but i secretly had a crush on her. 
One night when my wife was out of town back with her family, coworker and i went out to a friends birthday party together. we both got drunk and kissed. and kissed. for what reason, that kiss felt more than just a kiss. 
My coworker, then started to say that she couldn't be with me because i was married. So we cooled it. But the following Friday, i went off with my friends and started to drunk text her. I told her i wanted to give it a shot. 
i got home that night, fell asleep. My wife then proceeded to go through my phone and saw my text messages (i should of erased it  but i forgot. ) 
She left that night. 
I woke up and found she was gone, i called her and no answer. I was finally able to track her down via find my iphone. she left to her parents. 

after work i took off to talk to her. we kinda fixed things and she told me, that she doesn't trust me anymore. that she doesn't want me working there. and i texted my coworker that i couldn't do that to my wife, and that we should stop anything before it goes further. 

work was awkward for a while, as i felt that my coworker was hurt. 
fast foward 1 month. work was a little better, co worker was actially talking to me in a work related sense. 
my wife was still hurt but we were trying to push past it. 
but everyday was a constant battle. Constant questions of was she at work, did you talk to her, when am i looking for a new job etc. 
All of a sudden those questions turned into, why am i still talking to her, (mind you, i hadnt talked to this girl other than work related items.) everyday she kept saying i was talking to her. and things got worse. 

i finally got pushed over the edge and texted the girl. and we started talking again. about how we miss hanging out and talking. but its not an everyday thing. we talk more  and shes kinda of flirty at work. but never really anything past that.

i dont know what to think, i love my wife but everyday shes saying that i cheated on her, that i do nothing to show her that i love her. 
she doesnt know we kissed. all she knows is that i started to get feelings for this girl.

she texted me this morning saying that she wants a divorce because everything remnds her of what happened, that i never show her any love ( i am not a affectionate person at all) and to make matters worse, she goes through my mac looking for any evidence, and it just so happens coworker send me a text this morning, saying thanks for taking care of a work related item she left me a message for. 

I am at a standstill, i want her to be happy, i dont know what to do anymore. i dont know how to show her that  i want to be with her. 
im lost and i dont want to lose her. when she told me she wants a divorce this morning it hit me like a ton of bricks, lost appetite and didnt want to do anything else. it was the only thing on my mind at work...

TL;DR married, got distant to wife, coworker showed interest, nothing sexual happened, wife found out that i was starting to get feelings towards coworker. wife was crushed now she doesnt trust me. everything reminds of her what happened wants divorce, says im just forcing myself to love her. 
want to show her i still love her but i am not affectionate at all.

sorry for the wall of text... "

3a8e4z,0,2015-06-17,[Series] I regret ever coming back to that place,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3a8e4z/series_i_regret_ever_coming_back_to_that_place/,"First off, I wanna apologize for the length. I don't know where to start with this series of strange events, events that changed me forever. I don't wanna jump right into it, and besides, a little back story is necessary.

Last summer, my grandfather died. He was my last surviving grandparent, but I was never really close to him. You see, my mother, his daughter, emigrated to the US with her new husband, my dad, leaving him and my late grandmother on their land in Montenegro. We'd visit regularly when I was a kid, and he was always a jovial man who would bounce me on his lap and take me out to see the sheep and tell me to count them. However, visits back to the wilderness of Montenegro (my parents never saw it fit to take me to one of Montenegro's many beach towns or national parks, just my grandparents' land in a village near Berane), soon bored me, and I preferred to spend my summers in America, smoking weed with my American boyfriend, going on roadtrips to music festivals on the East and West Coasts, etc. My last trip was the winter of my 13th year, when my grandma died and we went to her funeral.

I learned of his death when I came back from my freshman year of college. My mom was crying in the living room, holding one of those striped air-mail envelopes and a typewritten letter. Apparently, one of my aunts had sent it to her, and not bothered to tell her in time of the funeral. However, she did write that grandpa had left my mother a rather large swath of his property, and someone from our family needed to come and confirm the transfer of land to my mother.

I felt pretty bad about the whole thing, even though I barely remembered Grandpa Ivan. Besides, I hadn't seen my ancestral land in 5 and a half years, and my mother was in no position to travel. She worked as a nurse in an urban hospital, and was unable to take time off for the summer. Dad was pre-diabetic and in no shape to fly 8 hours across the Atlantic. Since my internship application fell through, I had time to visit and pay my respects to my grandfather.

Two days later, I was packed and ready to go. I was flying out from O'Hare, stopping over in Frankfurt, and arriving to Montenegro's capital Podgorica's tiny airport, where I would be greeted by my two cousins, Luka and Teodora.

After twelve hours of travel, I arrived to my final destination. Lugging my heavy duffel bag, I stepped out into the packed waiting area. I didn't see anyone I recognized, but apparently my cousins did.

“Lena!” a tall, athletically built girl called from the other end of the room. I turned and half-jogged towards her, relieved that I found someone. I could barely remember the features I had seen those summers ago, now set in a thin, tanned face with a few hints of makeup. She used to be shorter than me, but was now a couple inches taller. She started talking in Serbian, but I had to cut her off and try to explain to speak a little slower. She grinned and switched effortlessly to English. “Lucky for you, I had the highest grade in my English class last year!”

Needless to say, I was relieved.

“Luka's waiting in the car. We're stopping by my mother's in Berane to spend the night, then we're off to the village,” she explained.

The hot sun bouncing off the asphalt made me catch my breath as we stepped outside. I could feel myself starting to sweat. “This Podgorica heat is pretty bad, isn't it?” Teodora remarked conversationally, leading me to a dilapidated red Yugo. A young man was sitting in the front seat, blasting the remarkably intact A/C. Seeing me approach, he leapt out and greeted me in Serbian and made a couple remarks that I didn't quite catch. I simply nodded and smiled, and tried to tell him that it was nice to see him again. Teodora rattled some stuff to him in Serbian, and he smiled and in broken English told me, “O.K, O.K, nice to see you again, sister.” Apparently his English was not on the same level as his sister's.

We caught up a lot during the 3 hour car ride. Teodora had moved to Podgorica to study law. She had a boyfriend in the electrical engineering college, Aleksandar from Kotor, a seaside resort town. Aunt Mara was not very pleased, because he was half Croat. “But love conquers all,” Teodora sang, a silly smile on her face. Luka was also studying electrical engineering, and was rooming with Teodora. He had no girlfriend; he was serious about his studies. They pestered me with questions about life in America (“Is it true Americans eat at McDonald's for every meal?”) and kept telling me about how they had the perfect boyfriend for me and if we had time they'd introduce us.

As we all chatted, I couldn't help but notice the sheer beauty of the land. As we passed Podgorica, which was filled with gray Brutalist architecture and open air markets and old men on bicycles, handlebars loaded with grocery bags, I began to notice the high, rocky foothills of the Dinaric Alps, covered in thick pines towards the bottom and dark karst exposed at the top, meeting the dark purplish-blue of the twilight sky. I wasn't aware of how much I'd missed it.

At about 9:30 pm, we pulled up to my aunt and uncle's apartment building in the center of town. They led me up the stairwell, which smelled strongly of cabbage, to the fifth and top floor. It was clear that the cabbage smell was emanating from this particular apartment.

Teodora unlocked the door and announced my arrival. Aunt Mara bustled out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her stained apron. She took my face between her hands and kissed me on the cheek 3 times. Uncle Igor got up and switched the TV off, neglecting the water polo game to hug me and take my luggage. The table was set with sarma (ground pork and rice wrapped in cabbage leaves, which I abhorred), braised chicken (not so bad), and a goat cheese, tomato, and onion salad. She had probably spent all day making it, and I was hungry (the last thing I had to eat was an overpriced burger in Flughafen Frankfurt), so after awkward greetings, we all sat down to eat.

Teodora served as the translator. Aunt Mara wanted to know how her sister Olivera was doing, and her brother in law Goran (obviously, my parents), wanted to know how nursing school was going for me, if I had any plans to return to Europe. The rest of the evening went pretty uneventfully, and I was directed to a futon in the living room where I would sleep until the morning, when my cousins would take me up to Crni Vrh, the village.

I woke up in the morning, feeling jet lagged as fuck. Teodora was already awake and dressed, drinking soured milk (which sounds gross, but is basically like a cross between regular milk and plain yogurt in terms of taste and consistency) at the kitchen table. I could hear the water running in the bathroom, and the door was open a crack, leading me to assume Luka was shaving. Aunt Mara appeared out of the kitchen, brandishing two sandwiches wrapped in napkins, which she shoved into the front pocket of my duffel bag. After Luka exited the bathroom, I took a change of underwear, some capris (judge me, all right, I might look like a soccer mom wearing them but they're hella comfy), and some band t-shirt my ex had bought me when we went to Lollapalooza. Teodora explained to me that before I left the country, I'd have to stop by Podgorica once again to talk to the family lawyer (apparently, a second cousin of ours or something) to confirm the land transfer and hand over some documents my mother sent by me, but everyone assumed I'd like to see it first for myself and take pictures and stuff to email back to Mom.

After I said my goodbyes to my aunt and uncle, we all hopped back into Luka's Yugo and were off. Berane itself was a pretty depressing town; teenagers skipped school and smoked cheap, smelly cigarettes at the splintery cafe tables and there was no building over 6 stories. However, as with Podgorica, once we left the city proper, the landscape transformed into something beautiful. Small houses with white facades and red tiled roofs lay among flowering gardens, and once in a while you would pass a beautiful old church that had been there for centuries.

After a twenty minute drive on a shitty, partially unpaved, curvy road, a yellow road sign proclaimed that we had reached Crni Vrh. The village seemed pretty empty. The houses were few and far between, and all I saw were a couple old people walking up the dirt path and a couple mutts barking after our car. Occasionally, a person would walk by, herding a small group of goats or sheep. They would stare curiously at the unfamiliar car, but would look away as soon as you'd look at them. The sky threatened rain; dark storm clouds gathered overhead.

“The people who live here are mostly old-timers; I doubt there's even 150 people in this village. They're dying by the day,” Teodora remarked.

“No new people either,” Luka chimed in. “All go to cities, or to Serbia, or to Deutschland.” He pulled up in front of a house at the very end of the village, the familiar old stone house where Grandpa Ivan would be waiting in the doorway.

“Where's his grave?” I asked.

“Down by the monastery at the foot of the hill. There's really not much to see down there, there wasn't enough money for him and Grandma Raka to be buried together, unfortunately. There's just a plain wooden cross down there with his name and birth and death date,” Teodora replied.

“Ah, okay. Should we go in, then?” I asked, noting that a few drops of rain had fallen.

“Sure.”

Luka unlocked the door and held it open for us. The first thing that hit us was the smell of mold. It had apparently rained a lot during the last month, and the roof was leaky. Rivulets of water had pooled onto Grandma Raka's prized kilims, part of her dowry, and ruined them. Teodora warned me not to go into the attic – there were bats, and told me to be on the lookout for snakes. They were numerous here, and venomous.

“Why didn't anyone clear out his stuff?” I asked, examining the gilted icon of Jesus Christ ascending from the grave, the only ornament on the wall.

“A lot of it was cleared out by my mother, but a lot of stuff was left over. Only so much can be put into the car.”

I took the icon off the wall; with it came a few flecks of yellow-white paint. The lone lightbulb glowed a dull off white color. It popped as it turned black just as a clap of thunder hit our ears.

“Damn it,” Teodora whispered in Serbian, than turned to snap something to Luka. He came bounding back with one of those industrial flashlights. She turned to me and said, “There's still more in the sitting room and the bedrooms, if you want to look. We also have some raincoats and umbrellas in the car if you want to go around the property.”

I set the icon back on the wall and took the flashlight from Luka. I shined it on the dusty couch, covered by the same awful mint-green vinyl sheet with bright pink hibiscus flowers printed on it. “Remember when you tried to burn that thing?” I said to Luka, giggling a bit at the memory of 12-year-old him dragging it out to the bonfire one night and demanding to burn the atrocity.

He laughed and replied in the affirmative.

I walked down the hallway to my grandparents' room. It was small, filled almost completely by the sagging bed, covered by a light brown blanket. There was a floor length mirror and a pair of worn blue slippers on the side of the bed. On the nightstand lay a bible and a book of Montenegrin poetry. The wall was adorned by one of my grandmother's embroideries, this one of a field of poppies. Otherwise, it was bare.

We moved onto the bedroom that was my mother's and Aunt Mara's growing up. The ceiling had a noticeable water stain, and the two twin beds had splintery oak headboards and bare pink, faux satin mattresses. A bookshelf held their assigned reading from elementary and high school, as well as old textbooks. Waves of nostalgia came across me.

“I really missed this place,” I said, trying to justify the tears that had sprung to my eyes. Teodora gave me a little side hug in response. 

“You want to go see the creek that we used to go to when we were little?”

“Isn't it a bit of a long walk, though?”

Luka shrugged. Teodora replied, “It's nice to walk through the rain a little bit. It gives this whole place a, how do you say it? An air of mystery, I think.”

“All right,” I said, unconvinced. But she was right.

The field behind grandfather's house stretched out into the forest, and behind that were more fields and orchards. The edge of the property was marked by a small, clear creek filled to the brim with trout. It looked otherworldly in the rain, the silver mist coating the deep green. In the forest I could see the katun, the grouping of houses that shepherds would sleep in during the summer months to guard the animals if a wolf or bear came along.

“What happened to all the livestock?” I asked Teodora as we walked down the muddy path.

I noticed how she and Luka exchanged a look. “There was, uh, a disease. A lot of them died, but Grandfather sold the rest.”

I thought it was kinda odd, but didn't say anything. I took out my phone and started snapping pictures to send back to Mom, and the rest of the trip to the stream passed in silence, excepting the clicking noises from my iPhone camera.


The creek was swollen from the recent rains, and it flowed pretty fast. “Remember when we'd used to make little pools for the fish by stacking rocks?” I asked.

“I do,” Teodora replied, sticking her hands in her raincoat pockets. “It's pretty down here, isn't it? I miss it all the time when I'm down in Podgorica for school. So does Luka.” He nodded at the mention of his name. “You want to go back? It's raining harder than I expected it to. We need to get back to the car so we can get back to town before it gets really bad.”

However, the rain continued worsening as we made the forty minute trek back to the house. Luka went to start the car, and we all piled in. He started it no problem, but the car was mired in deep mud. He tried to get it to move, but the tires spun out. The nearest house was shuttered up, and it looked like the rest of the villagers had taken shelter from the storm.

“Fuck,” Luka whispered. (I had a good knowledge of Serbian curses from my parents, who used them very liberally in conversation.)

He turned and said something to Teodora, which she didn't seem to like. But he continued insisting, and she finally turned to me. “Lena, we're going to have to wait it out in the house,” she said with a tight smile on her face.

“Okay,” I shrugged. It would be kinda gross for me to stay in that musty, cold house, but whatever.

It was only 11am, but the darkness outside made it look like it was twilight. Bright lightning bolts illuminated the house as we all sat around. Luka produced a pack of cards from his raincoat pocket, and we played Skat for a couple hours, munching on the salami and cucumber sandwiches Aunt Mara sent along with us. The rain didn't seem to be letting down.

We all got bored of cards after a while and we kind of sat there for a while, having nothing really to say to each other. “When will we get to leave?” I ventured.

“When we can dig the car out of the mud, which may be tomorrow morning,” Teodora replied dully.

“Um, all right then. What should we do while we wait?” I asked. 

“Maybe another game of Skat?” she suggested.

I shrugged. “Okay. Can't you call Aunt or Uncle and have them get us?”

“Luka won't leave his car, and, besides, I don't have signal.”

The rain continued for the entire day. We played cards, mostly. I got tired at around 7:00pm due to jet lag, and chose to turn in on one of the smaller beds. I fell asleep almost instantly.

As I slept, I dreamt of earlier days, running through the fields, the grass up to my hips. Teodora was in front of me, Luka to the back. It was a sunny, warm day. I was wearing my favorite white dress, which was, in the dream, free of the grass and dirt stains I had inflicted upon it. But then it started raining. Luka passed me and caught up to Teodora, and they ran in front of me into the grass, so far that I couldn't see them anymore. I cried out; I was alone around the katun. The small huts had dark doorways, and I could hear whispering coming from them. I was drawn to it. As I came closer and closer, the whispering became more agitated. I called for my cousins, but I was being drawn into the opening. As I was about to cross the threshold, I was whimpering in fear. As I finally crossed it, the whispers turned into one long, ear-splitting scream, and a pair of red eyes swam into view.

I woke up.

But not in the bedroom.

I was lying in the katun on wet grass, a drizzle stinging my face."

OK so I've just binge watch 5 seasons of Shameless(U.S) and this is now the best tv show I've ever watched. I fucking love it, It's like a drug, It can make you feel sad, happy, angry all in one episode. The character development is the best I've EVER seen, so I've decided to make a list of my favorite characters from seasons 1-5

#1. Jimmy/Steve 
 Jxmmy is definitely my favorite character, he's so fucking cool, and mad funny. I think he and fiona belongs together. The fact that he's not a main cast in the show anymore makes me like him more.

#2. Lip 
Ok Lip's a fucking boss, liked him throughout the show but fuck! Common, that shit with Amanda was so disrespectful. She fucking loved him and he treated her like that?

#3. Carl
Carl's my fucking nigga! Nothing more needed to be said here

#4. Karen
Ok season 2 Karen was wack but I loved her in season 3 and hoped she and lip would be together.....but fucking mandy! Hate that bitch! How can Lip still have sex with Mandy after what she did to Karen? (Bad Writing)

#5. Amanda
Ok, Amanda is sexy as fuck! Smart, rich and unlike Mandy, she is good for Lip. How can Lip not see that though? She fucking loves him. He took her virginity fa god sakes! I loved when Lip had sex with his professor because it was kinda awesome, but I hated it when he started to ignore Amanda. He didnt even want to have sex with her. And by the way, wasn't Lip suppose to get that Internship from Amanda's dad? I really hope she comes back in season 6

#6 Bianca
I know she was only in the show for a few episodes, but that plot was one of the best I've ever seen. I fucking loved her

#7 Mickey
Didn't like Mickey at first but I've grown into liking this guy. His attitude is a fucking masterpiece

#8 Frank
Who else but Frank Gallagher!? He's been kinda like the comedy part of the show to me, he constantly makes me laugh

I'm worried that I'm getting obsessed.,renco,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/3a8gn3/when_to_quittake_a_break_im_worried_that_im/,"I am 22 and 5'6"" and a year ago I was 158. I've always been pretty muscular so it didn't look bad but I was unhappy with my body. In addition, I always had really bad stomach issues, so I switched to a Paleo/Primal diet last August and absolutely love it.

I am an avid rock climber and since January I have also been adding weightlifting and more cardio to my routine. I also had been against counting calories since I became too obsessed with it in the past, but I started to pick it back up and was doing fine. By May I was down to 140, with my goal weight being 135. I had done a BodPod which told me I had 15% body fat, but I honestly don't believe that and wanted to keep losing weight. I definitely look better but have some room for improvement.

Then graduation came, then vacation, and a finger injury which is keeping me from climbing as much. I've only gained 3 or 4 pounds, but it's driving me insane. 

I'm at a new internship and am really struggling to keep to my calorie limit, between 1500 and 1650. I keep going over and it stresses me out, and I gained 2 pounds this week and it stressed me out, and I feel hungry all the time but I end up stressing that I can't eat more. 

I'm thinking about taking a break from counting calories but I've come so far (kinda) and don't want to gain it all back- I really want to get to my goal weight. I just don't know how to handle this. And I've gone to therapy in the past and discussed this issue, I feel like I can figure it out if I just have some outside input. "

Growing up I was top of my class, got great grades, worked my butt off in extracurriculars, got my eagle award through Boy Scouts. I then went to the university of Georgia, a pretty good school, and got a degree in advertising and a high GPA. On top of this I did internships and was actively involved in extracurriculars. I essentially did everything that I was told would lead to a successful life.

I'm now a year out of school. My girlfriend left me, I still don't have a job, I had to move in with my parents 300 miles away from friends, and I was just fired from a retail job which I was overqualified for. I feel entirely worthless. I went to 2 different therapists, got on Zoloft, tried harder and different tactics in my job hunt, tried different hobbies, and nothing is seeming to change things.

I don't have a good relationship with my family. My dad is perhaps the most idiotic person I've ever known and is completely callous. When I first tried to kill myself, years ago, he said it was for attention. In his own words ""I don't believe in depression."" He was also physically abusive to me and has slapped the shit out of me to the point that I fell down a flight of stairs about 6 years ago. He also never stops criticizing everyone in the family. The yelling is too much. If I was to commit suicide his main concern would be how it reflected upon himself. My brothers don't really connect with me very much. My sister rarely speaks to me. My mom seems to be the only person who would legitimately care if I did die.

I had friends in college, but most have drifted away and don't speak to me anymore. I have maybe 4 friends I talk to regularly. They've essentially told me that being suicidal is stupid and lazy and that I just need to man up. I don't think it would affect them very much.

90% of my thoughts nowadays are how I can kill myself. I've tried thinking out the different options I have besides suicide and I am unable to see myself as happy in any of them. Maybe if I was able to start entirely over and drop everyone. I just don't know what to do besides hanging myself.

3a8ihg,3,2015-06-17,TIFU by Wearing Mismatched Shoes to Work,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3a8ihg/tifu_by_wearing_mismatched_shoes_to_work/,"First of all, photographic evidence so you know what these shoes look like: http://i.imgur.com/xmbvdDn.png

Ok so, I'm a 23 year old guy who just started my first ""real"" job out of college last week.  I've interned at the place for about a year though, so I'm friends with everyone.  It's an engineering place, and I engineer things.

Now I still live at home.  I share a room with my brother, and my 2nd brother and sister sleep in the living room (it's a small-ish place.)  I have to tiptoe around in the morning with the lights off so as not to disturb anyone.  My dad and I leave to carpool to work while most of our family is still sleeping.  Well what it boils down to is that I put my shoes on in the dark, and usually while sitting at my desk checking my email/comics/whatever.  To make matters worse, I usually wear my tennis shoes everywhere, but I wear my brown shoes when I go to work.  99% of the time this turns out fine, but yesterday well... refer to the link.

That's not the important part.  So I sometimes fuck up with my shoes, so what reddit asks.  My reactions at work were what killed it for me though.  As soon as I get in, I walk through the break room to put my lunch in the fridge and the first person I see says ""What the hell Drillgorg?"" and laughs his ass off.  It's all downhill from there.

Now anyone I worked with who was a 20-something was totally chill.  A bunch didn't notice.  Those who did, the reactions ranged from ""lol"" to ""you do you!""  But I swear, anyone over 40 seemed to think it was the funniest thing they'd seen this year (that first guy included.)  

A few times I tried to explain that I put my shoes on in the dark, and that most of my shoes are comfortable so I didn't feel the difference.  One coworker replied ""So if there'd been a turd lying there next to your shoe, would you be wearing it now?"" and cracked himself up.

Two guys, who must both be over 50 I believe, when they saw my shoes they started ribbing me and like everyone else I try to laugh it off and maybe explain myself a bit.  I walk away, when one of them says hang on come back.  I figured they had some work thing they needed to talk about but both immediately pulled out smart phones and tried to take pics of my shoes.  I noped on out of there.

Near the end of my workday, after a harrowing time of everyone asking about my shoes and not believing that I could do this by accident, my boss needs to see me in his office.  I'm friendly enough with my boss, he's pretty nice and likable.  He asks me to close the door, and I'm thinking oh dang, he only does that to talk about salary or HR problems.  And I just started so its definitely not salary.  Basically he asks me whats up and I plead my case about it being an honest mistake.  No idea if he believes me, but he says I need to be more careful with my shoes in case I need to talk to a client.  Great.  My boss just told me to make sure my shoes match.  My self esteem is through the roof.  I tell him I'll do him one better and keep a spare pair in my desk.  Feel pretty shitty for the rest of the day.

Hold on, this is where things get complicated.  Fast forward to today, I'm wearing matching shoes AND I have a spare pair in my desk now (get a few sympathetic laughs about that.)  One of the 50-somethings with the phones takes out his phone, and I'm expecting it to be a blurry shot of me walking away yesterday.  Instead it turns out to be a photo of the OTHER 50-something, wearing mismatched shoes.  When was this taken?  Several weeks ago, when I was out doing field testing with these guys.  He said so-and-so put on mismatched shoes specifically to see if I'd notice, and I didn't.  Guardedly, I ask ""how did he know to do that... several weeks ago?""  He replies ""we remembered form the last time you wore mismatched shoes.""

DAMN IT.  I had almost blocked that out.  Yes I remembered that I made this same dumbass mistake with the shoes LAST summer at this company.   But I totally forgot that anyone noticed!  I was a pretty low profile intern then.  So last summer I fucked up with my shoes, and these guys remembered for maybe 8 months and then decided to ""prank"" me by wearing mismatched shoes to see if I'd notice.  Not only did I not notice, I fucked up my shoes again yesterday just several weeks after their ""prank""!  Damn it damn it damn it.

TLDR: I'm an adult with a real job who needs to be told by his boss to wear matching shoes; half the office laughed their asses off."
3a8lyb,3,2015-06-17,Information Technology job security,[deleted],utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/3a8lyb/information_technology_job_security/,"I am going to be a sophomore at UTD, majoring in Information Technology and Systems, and I have been looking at job postings on Indeed.com for business analyst, systems analyst, data analyst, and IT consulting. Mostly all of the entry level jobs require at least 2 to 4 years of relevant work experience with certifications/programming skills.

The reason I am worried about getting a job is because I don't understand how students are able to get enough experience by just doing an internship and the capstone course. 

Did the companies that offer internships give full-time job offers? 

Also I heard employers give more respect and value for someone who has a computer science degree than an IT degree since CS is more technical. Please give me some advice.

I can't join the UTD IPP program offered at the engineering school, because I am majoring in MIS in JSOM."
3a8pcg,1,2015-06-17,"Salary related question, should I negotiate? (Returning Intern)",RotaryRotation,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a8pcg/salary_related_question_should_i_negotiate/,"Last summer, I was interning at a ~200 person ""startup"" as a Software Engineering intern and was getting paid 20/hour. The company is located in Seattle, and going to school in Seattle, I managed to commit ~20 hours of work per week with the company for rest of the year after the summer. My salary at this point became $25/hour. 

I just wrapped up finals and will be interning this summer at the company once again, but this time, they raised a massive seed round, and have jumped to over ~350 employees. As of this past Tuesday, I have been at this company for a full year, I was wondering if it would make sense to ask about some sort of raise or something along those lines? I have friends off to Google, Amazon, Microsoft who are making $6k a month, so I am not asking for that much, but I was thinking of $30/hour? 

Performance wise, I am confident I have done a great job (as to the reason why they asked me to join on for the summer). My main concern is, I don't want them to think I am hungry or anything, I am the first person in my family to even make over $15/hour so I don't really have anyone strong to ask for guidance. 

My reason for this question is simple, a lot of my friends are going back to their same companies they interned, and they got a higher pay because they returned, I am modeling the same idea based off of this.

I just turned 20 years old and am a rising Junior. 

Appreciate any response to this! "

###**Lost Players of Significance**:

* **Jermaine Gresham** 
     
      -I don't know many players in the league who started their career off like Gresham.  When he was drafted out of the University of Oklahoma he was an immediate contributer to the Bengals offense and developed good run blocking skills.  However, he soon proved to draw the ire of Bengals fans after his consistent fumbling problems and lackluster pass catching ability.
* **Terrance Newman**

   -Possibly the most significant player the Bengals lost in Free Agency.  Although his age is catching up to him you would swear he was 10 years younger in the first half of the season.  He's a starting corner through week 8 with great ball skills.  When the season grows on his body gets beat up and he slows down. 

* **Taylor Mays**

 -Although Taylor didn't find a large role in the Bengals defense he certainly played his part.  A great run support safety with lackluster pass coverage made him a Safety/Linebacker hybrid in his later years.  He doesn't have quick hips or a great football IQ but he should play a role somewhere in 2015

###Players Gained/Re-signed:

Cedric Peerman  |  RB  |  UFA  |  [](/CIN) | [](/CIN)

**Players of Significance:**

* **Michael Johnson**
 
 -This is unquestionably the biggest Free Agency move the bengals made.  The Cincinnati coaches, staff, and fans LOVE MJ.  He's so loved we pulled out of the Nick Fairly race when he was cut, and for good reason.  He's a system fit, molded by Mike Zimmer and Defensive Line coach Jay Hayes to wreak havoc on opposing teams.

* **AJ Hawk**

 -With Vontaze Burfict having microfracture surgery on his knee in the offseason, our enforcer on defense is questionable for the season's start.  Although he's getting up there in age AJ Hawk is a hometown guy that fans would love to see join the linebacker rotation.  

* **Clint Boling**

 -One of the bright young guards in the league, Boling was in high demand when Free Agency kicked off.  With teams like the Falcons and Vikings among his potential suitors it didn't look like he'd be coming back.  That's why it's not only surprising he's here at all, but for the bargain deal he signed as well.  Boling probably could have cashed out somewhere else but decided to stay in the Queen City on a 5 year / 26 million dollar deal.

##BENGALS 2015 [](/NFL) Draft



Round | Pick | Player | Postion | School
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1 | 21 | Cedric Ogbuehi | OT | Texas A&amp;M
2 | 21(53) | Jake Fisher | OT | Oregon
3 | 21(85) | Tyler Kroft | TE | Rutgers
3 | 35(99) | Paul Dawson | LB | TCU

6 | 21(197) | Derron Smith | S | Fresno State
7 | 21(238) | Mario Alford | WR | West Virginia

###Player Overviews

* **Ced Ogbuehi**

 -When healthy Big Ced could develop into one of the best LT in the league.  He has two great mentors in Whitworth and Andre Smith.  He won't be in the card this year but he has a bright future. 

* **Jake Fisher**

 -Jake will probably see the field as the primary reserve ""swing"" tackle towards the end of the year as he catches on to the system.  He's similar in style to Ced but with less footwork and more power.  A good choice for RT.  Bookends for the next 10 years.

* **Tyler Kroft**

 -Kroft will be asked to do the same thing Tyler Eifert was asked his rookie year.  Learn and contribute.  He's raw but has the chance to develop into a complete athlete at the position.

* **Paul Dawson**

 -The first of many value picks for the Bengals.  Dawson is a straight up game day warrior.  He might not like to prepare during the week but he'll show up on Sundays.  Burfict's main task while out will be to reach out to Dawson and teach him how to be a pro.

* **Josh Shaw**

 -Josh Shaw has a heck of a strange story (Google it) but you can't deny his talent.  To find him in the fourth round is an absolute steal.  He can play corner and safety and will fit in nicely to an already talented group.

* **Marcus Hardison**

 -A big strong guy who will need to develop.  He's going to be buried underneath Geno Atkins, Domata Peko, Brandon Thompson, and Pat Sims right away.  He'll learn this year and hopefully come into a more dominant role in 2016.

* **CJ Uzomah**

 -Alex Smith wasn't brought back as the 3rd tight end so this is where Uzomah comes in.  He's going to be limited to a run blocking skill set but could contribute right away on special teams.  The least likely of the 2015 class to make the roster.

* **Derron Smith**

 -The biggest value pick of our draft (with exception to maybe Dawson).  Smith is an extremely talented (albeit undersized) safety who was a standout player on a bad Fresno State defense.  The main question for him is going to be can he adapt to the NFL level on a good team where he won't be able to blame his mistakes on inferior talent around him.

* **Mario Alford**

 -A pure bred speedster who will try to fill in the role Andrew Hawkins had just a few years ago.  Could very well take the KR job away from incumbent Brandon Tate.

 | | | 14-2 (1st AFC North and Bye) | 8-8 (3rd AFC North) 

###Week 1 (@ OAK)
* Derek Carr has the potential to be great and could scare our defense.  But Amari Cooper won't be fully integrated in the offense yet and there's still plenty of holes.  Bengals should win this.

###Week 2 (VS SD)
* The Chargers are a team I can never figure out.  I never know if they're good or they're bad but they always have a chance since they have Philip Rivers.  Should Andy take care of the ball in this game I see the Bengals winning, but if mistakes are made Rivers will be sure to not return the favor.

###Week 3 (@ BAL)
* Our games with Baltimore have been pretty tooth and nail as of late, but somehow the team find a way to win.  I think that continues to open our first meeting of the year.  However, if the Ravens can get running on all cylinders they could pose some serious threat through the air.

###Week 4 (VS KC)
* The Chiefs are a darn good football team, so don't let my prediction tell you I don't respect them.  This is a team that just scares me much more if we played them away than if we were home.  We're home, we play well in the Jungle, our running game should click all day.  I wouldn't bet my money on this prediction though.

###Week 5 (VS SEA)
* See above.  The Seahawks are downright brutal to play at their house.  Away, they're still a really good football team.  They just have a style that plays to our advantage.  Seattle's secondary is amazing but we want to run.  I couldn't name a Seahawks receiver with confidence and they like to give it to Lynch.  The AFC North is all about stuffing the run.  I like our chances but this game will be tight either way.

###Week 6 (@ BUF)
* The Bills are downright talented all of a sudden a Rex Ryan for all his antics is no slouch as a coach.  But Buffalo, your QB situation is worse than ours.  I would probably take AJ McCarron before I went with any of your QBs.  I think you feel our pain from Dalton and your QB holds an otherwise talented team back.

###Week 8 (@ PIT)
* The Steelers always give us a hell of a game but in Heinz Field they're on another level.  Plain and simple until we beat them in their house again I'm not going to pick against them in the 'burgh.

###Week 9 (VS CLE)
* The Browns have had their fortunes somewhat change as of late, but they still made Brown-like decisions.  Hoyer led them to an outstanding record early in the year and as soon as he slowed down they pulled the plug on him.  It looked like they finally found an answer but they gambled it all away and lost.  It's hard to have faith in the Browns as a team when the Browns management doesn't believe in their own players.

###Week 10 (VS HOU)
* I really don't know what to make of the Texans.  They could be really good or they could be really bad.  My guess is the defense is going to be pretty great but the offense will be abysmal.  Things could work out for Hoyer here but I just have a bad feeling about how he fits in Coach O'Brien's scheme.

###Week 11 (@ ARI)
* Running out of room so I'll keep the rest short.  Arizona is a dangerous team when healthy.  I think this year they're finally able to stay healthy and make a run at the NFC.  They get the best of us on this day.

###Week 12 (VS STL)
* The Rams can beat anyone, as long as they're in the NFC West.  They pull off tons of great divisional upsets but outside of that they're pretty unspectacular.  Their defensive line might be the best in the league but those guys can't win you games on their own.

###Week 13 (@ CLE)
* I don't foresee this having a different result than the first game.  Although the dawg pound crowd will make things a little tougher in the beginning.

###Week 14(VS PIT)
* We have a much better chance against the Steelers when they come to our house.  Here it's a toss up.  Plain and simple. 

###Week 15 (@ SF)
* With all the big names retiring and the Harbaugh circus coming to an end I see it taking till 2016 for the Niners to get back on their feet in the NFC West.  Fans might get a bit worried after a somewhat rocky 2015 (I predict 7-9)  but 2016 should right the ship once again.  The Bengals take this game however.

###Week 16 (@ DEN)
* This all depends on what kind of form Manning is in come late 2015.  In my optimistic prediction he's the same one of late last year.  Turnover prone with less zip in his arm.  On the other end he's regular ol' Peyton.

###Week 17 (VS BAL)
* In a good season for us we finish the year strong against a formidable Ravens team.  On a bad year the Ravens take a week off before their playoff game and we beat a stripped down version of a playoff team.

Overall I think the Bengals have a super talented roster and we put it all together finally.  My realistic prediction is **13-3** as the second seed in the AFC behind an impressive 14-2 Colts team.

##Training Camp Battles

**Cornerback** -  Of the mix of Dre Kirkpatrick, Darqueze Dennard, Leon Hall, and Adam Jones two will find starting roles on the outside and potentially another at nickel.  Who comes out on top?

**Linebacker** - With Burfict injured only Rey Maualuga seemingly has a starting spot locked up.  Who else makes a mark?  Veterans AJ Hawk and Vinny Rey?  Or maybe rookie Paul Dawson?

***
***

##Offensive and Defensive Schemes

Hue Jackson's offense is very run heavy.  It relies on the power run blocking scheme to make holes for Jeremy Hill to run through while utilizing screens and outside runs for Gio Bernard.  Andy's passing game is kept mostly in the 0-10 yard range with the exception of play action where Jackson likes to stretch the field.

Paul Guenther's defense is very similar to Mike Zimmer's 4-3.  It relies on the majority of the pressure on the quarterback coming from the 4 down lineman without any blitzes.  Rarely you'll see Guenther blitz one or two but more often than not he's either bringing everyone or no one at all.

3a8xyr,8,2015-06-18,Three credits required to graduate in the fall and no internship for the summer. What should I do?,crazeecpe,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3a8xyr/three_credits_required_to_graduate_in_the_fall/,"Hi, Computer Engineer here.

As the title states I'm currently in a situation that is driving me absolutely mad. Last semester I was balancing the final semester of my senior design project, my uni's upper level micro-controller class, upper level FPGA/ASIC class, upper level network security class(I'm most interested in defense and security and this was the closest elective course available), and attempted to take my programs required class on operating systems. Unfortunately, I realized I was extremely overbooked about halfway through the semester and withdrew from the operating systems class. This left me with only three credits necessary for graduation next fall.

Given that I barely had time to even sleep with my schedule last semester I didn't get around to applying to summer internships until very late in the process and wasn't able to attain one. One major obstacle I'm facing in the field of internships is my cumulative and major GPA of 2.85. I struggled for quite a while trying to find exactly why I wanted to be a computer engineer, but this last year I have found my drive. I did manage to score a 3.3 GPA last semester while taking some of the most difficult classes of my program while simultaneously completing my senior design project, which I am extremely proud of.

Sorry for the long intro, but I guess my question is what would be my best course of action now? I live in the Northern Virginia area which is just ripe with employers and I've been applying to every opportunity that has arisen, but like I've said nothing has bitten. In the mean time should I take the FE just to buff up my resume? What is the best course of action to take at this point to get the biggest resume? Certifications that a computer engineer should really have? Sorry If I'm rambling, I'm just lost and looking for a direction.

TL;DR
Have no summer internship and am looking for a way to best help out my resume in the time that I have. "

Do freshmen have to be exceptionally great by comparison to upperclassmen in order to get really competitive internships (i.e Google, Facebook, etc.), or do these companies set a lower bar for freshmen? I've heard of programs such as the Facebook University and Google EP, but I noticed that most of these programs are for ""historically underrepresented groups in computer science"" which I probably don't belong to (does first generation college student college student count)?

Around 2 months ago my computer crashed, was beeping 3 times, and would not turn on. I took it to an Apple store, they changed the RAM, and it was fixed.

A few minutes ago my computer shut off and started to beep 3 times. However, now it is back on again.

What should I do? I am out of the country for a software engineering internship, so I can take it to an Apple store but I will have to travel pretty far. What are my other options? Should I keep on using it normally, or take action immediately?

Thanks!

edit: It is a mid-2012 Macbook for clarification"
3a970k,98,2015-06-18,Microsoft's dev tools are really quite nice,Call_Me_Salamander,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/3a970k/microsofts_dev_tools_are_really_quite_nice/,"I recently started an internship and my company exclusively uses Microsoft dev tools, including VS and some of their web stuff. I've had a blast using all of the Microsoft tools. At home I am exclusively a linux user and my dev environment is an Ubuntu set-up. I moved away from Windows, with the exception being when I play games from time to time.

With all the UNIX-like fanboyism and Mac/Linux hype on CS boards I rarely see Windows mentioned, and it almost seems like people look down upon devs who use Windows as their OS and dev environment.

What's up with that? After using VS and some of the other Microsoft tools for a few weeks I'm certainly impressed by how nice their enterprise software suites are. The VS debugger has been phenomenal (way better than the Xcode debugger IMO), Azure has been a pleasure to work with, Virtualization is pretty damn snappy, and I've had a positive experience learning C#. Bash/tcsh are definitely far superior to cmd/powershell, and that is the only thing I miss from Linux."
3a976b,3,2015-06-18,How should I feel at this point in my programming learning.,brownbob06,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3a976b/how_should_i_feel_at_this_point_in_my_programming/,"I THINK I have this in the right sub. If not, please just let me know.

It was hard for me to come up with a title for this, but basically, this is what I want to ask (with a rather lengthy preface):

I am going to school at a 2 year college for Web/Computer Programming. So far I have taken courses in: C#, Visual Basic, COBOL (2 courses in it actually), Systems Analysis &amp; Design, and Database programming (SQL).

I only have 12 more credit hours of classes to take (although it will take me 2 semesters because of courses offered). These classes will be: ASP.NET, Microsot I, iOS mobile app development, and Special Studies in Information Technology.

I feel like I'm not even remotely close to ready for a programming job. I do well in all of my classes and my COBOL instructor told me while she was evaluating my final project that I am the most talented programming student she has (We don't have many instructors so she was also my instructor for SQL programming) so I don't think it's just that I'm a crappy programmer.

My real question is: Did any of you feel this way while still in school? Or did you feel like you were completely ready to go after learning the languages in class? If you did feel this way, did you find that once finding a job things just kind of ""fell into place"" and you were more ready than you thought?

I'm sorry if this is confusing. It's hard for me to put into words the way I feel about this lol. I went to the school to look for internships but they had no programming internships available so I took an internship at my local district library running the web page and basically being ""the IT guy"" for the main library and all 7 of it's branches. Before that I worked at the IT help desk at the school. I figured at least some IT experience would be useful instead of just a sales/construction background."

The company I am interning with will be doing an office and server room move shortly after my departure (worldwide HQ moving offices as well as absorbing a satellite office).

In talking with the sysadmin here, it sounds like he is planning on upgrading the backup server(s) as well as vSphere/ESX (5.5 to 6.0) during the move. 

I do not have much experience with VMWare or fully virtualized environments, and tend to have more old-school views when it comes to IT operations, but this does not sound like a good idea to me.

Do you agree, or am I overly paranoid?

3a9wu2,3,2015-06-18,"[20/m] My girlfriend (21/f) of two months told me about her past. I love her. Help me deal with it, please. (very long post)",throwawayAdvicePast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3a9wu2/20m_my_girlfriend_21f_of_two_months_told_me_about/,"Hi, I don't know what information you would need so i am giving the whole story--

This is my first ever relationship. We have only been together for two and a half months but i know things are clicking between us. We both seem to understand each other and I can be myself around her and vice-versa. We both love each other at this point.


For the first few dates, we talked about general life, philosophy, science, universe, meaning of life, music, movies, travel, sports, random stuff and she was someone who loved to talk about such stuff. It was like she is my girl of dreams. We didn't discuss anything about past. After a while, one day we were celebrating her birthday drinking whiskey and watching a movie, only two of us, and I said that I want to kiss you right now but do not want to do it under the influence of alcohol, I want to make my first kiss large and devoid of any negatives. She smiled and kissed on my nose, and I was just busy playing with her hair. After a while, somehow talk drifted and she started crying and said that she was stupid once and got involved with a guy who cheated on her. I comforted her, said it wasn't her fault, it was just that guy was asshole. I didn't heed much then, probably thought that she went out with him a few times and got to know about him being involved with someone else before she got involved in anything.

This incident made me a bit apprehensive of advancing first and i refrained from doing anything unless she starts, thinking that it might hurt her. A few days later, during moonlit night, on my rooftop, large skyscraper in distance on one side and planes taking off and touching down on another side and melodious songs on background and we were lying gazing towards sky; and suddenly she leaned over and smooched me and then we kissed for a good hour after that. It was one of the few times of life I can tag as pristinely beautiful. It was amazing. She asked me, how many girls have i kissed before and I said you are the first one and that made her kinda happy. I asked the same but before she could answer, I said tell me some other time, I don't want to ruin this particular moment. 

After some days of dating, roaming around, we made out and all but this topic never came up. No, once or twice it did. She sometimes asked weird questions like (i) you aren't just doing it because you're lonely, right? (ii) I am afraid that you would leave me. &lt;end&gt; I used to comfort her that no horrible thing is going to happen, we will try things and I will give it everything and I promise it won't be ugly, there won't be any filthy stuff like cheating etc.

During make out sessions, she said she doesn't know how girls masturbate, or how blow-jobs are given etc. and first time giving me handjob, it was evident she hasn't done it before. So i got under the impression that it was her first time too in everything and we were learning together.

2 weeks back, she had to leave for internship and she said she want to do it, to have sex. And I was commenting something on the sorts that first time sex is quite a thing and we will remember this moment for the rest of our lives. Then she told me that this is the thing I have been wanting to tell you but couldn't till now; that she is not a virgin. BAM! Something went right through my chest. Then she started telling that there was this guy who got her drunk and then did it. I comforted her, I was still okay, was mature enough to understand that everybody has a past, all that matters is she is with me now. And then we got condoms, and did it. Yes it was my first time.

She left for internship after that and since i was alone, I overthought about it. And now I needed full information to calm my speculations, what happened, who the fuck had the guts to made her drunk and do this and etc. She shouldn't have told me things at all or now i need complete info. Then sometimes bits and pieces and after stalking her facebook profiles and suffering for the past 15 days, I asked her to tell me as detailed as possible. I guess it was a bad move but anyway I love her, and I want to keep things solid and confront the demons rather than be in denial or forget them, that's what i thought. Here is what happened with her--

High school, her parents left the house for jobs in different cities and her brother was sent to boarding school, she was alone at home. And at that age, you need somebody supporting you and she found that through friends in school. That guy was a good friend to her for entire one year, cared about her and all, but he was committed with somebody else. Then one day, watching a movie in a theater with friends, he planted a kiss on her cheek, she said she was shocked but thought it was cute. Then after some days, she went to his house for some books etc and there he smooched her for a good minute. According to her she was shocked but again didn't push him back(I think that had she not had feelings for him, she would have pushed him and asked him not to do it or something like that. Being a weirdo, i checked her facebook and she posted something along ""that was cute"" and ""i have one word to say-'OUCH' "" during those days. Yes, i know the dates apparently). Then he confessed that he broke up with the other girl and was in love with her. She said that he should be with the other girl and she wouldn't be a bitch. This went on for 2-3 months and nothing happened. Then the guy went to different city for college and was still in touch with her. And then after a period, she got convinced that he loved her instead of the other girl and he had broken up with the other girl. And she started loving him. After 2 months he comes to her house uninvited since he knows nobody lives there except her, and convinces her to drink(which she hadn't before) and proceeds to have UNSAFE sex(here guy tells her that he is a virgin and no need for condoms, which she later after break-up finds out that he isn't). She said,' he came twice but for her, it was painful rather than orgasmic, she didn't come even once'. And that was it -- no fingering, pleasing, handjob, blowjob etc. He gave her contraceptions that day itself. But after a month, after periods were delayed she came to know that she became pregnant. Then after a week, he comes, and being underage, he took her to a shabby place(not proper hospital) where abortion procedure went for 4 hours while she was on anesthesia but still in enormous pain. She asked him to stay for the next few days with her, but he left citing important. Here she was, dealing with mental trauma and physical pain, and he fucking left her for 'something important'. After some days, she got to know that he hadn't actually broken up with the other girl and they were physically involved.(he was having sex with 'other girl' while my current GF was pregnant or had abortion!!!!) It shattered her completely, and she tried committing suicide and screwed her exams and basically screwed her life at the time. But she recovered after some months of being totally numb to everything. Then the guy begs to have a second chance, and after constant begging she gives her another chance but things don't work out. And that was it. I know those kind of guys by the way, they take girls for granted, they think they can sleep around but if she does something then she is a slut(yes he called her that after he knew she started hanging around with other male friends).

That was it. In terms of physical- kisses and one time sex, In terms of emotional it was based on lies told by him and thus cast null and void, Outcome - she was shattered but it taught her many things and she is a very strong and independent woman now(I love that about her by the way).

Now the way it has affected me is following -- I don't think pregnancy has affected even a single bit, it actually deepens my bond that she trusts me in telling something she hasn't told anybody, and I have a liking for broken things having a shitty childhood myself. But what bothers me is that when she was telling the story she was happily describing her first kiss on the cheek or smooch and that makes me think that she actually **LOVED** him. And that doesn't go well with me. It clashes with my concept that a person truly loves only once. To me, true love or soulmate thing is something very sacred and unique, happening only once, a relation unmatched, like the bond we have with parents and own kids.(yes, i have been on 2-3 other dates but had no connection at all so i think it is unique). She is a very understanding person and tells me that whatever happened between them wasn't really love, since it wasn't both ways. But i still think that she loved somebody before and she won't love that innocently ever again. I mean, it just sometimes kills me in thoughts. I am not sure if it is because of her past, because i sometimes do think about our time spent together and then think that how she might have spent it in past, imagining him in my place!! :( Though i think it is the emotional and love part, because I want to spend my life with her and can't bear to think that she loved somebody else once, and this thought takes away the uniques aura from it. Please help. Writing it down certainly helped a bit. Is it too early on to decide about living life together(neither of us has said this, but deep down i think she is the one) because it is my first relationship and we have been together for 2 months only? Is the unique soulmate concept childish? because if it is then i shouldn't take things very seriously because it will happen again, just like friendships, and that thought just kills it for me. What should i do, does anybody understand what i am saying, please I am suffering for the past 2 weeks. And she asked me to ask anything because she is over her past and sees it just as another story, but i knew that she would get hurt recalling that again and again but she convinced me that she wouldn't; so i asked her and she was hurt at some points and i feel bad for that.  I want to keep this relationship, and she is amazing but these demons are haunting me.

Whoever read it, i want to thank you 1000 times, even if you don't have any suggestion to offer. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

tldr - I love a girl, been together for 2 months, she had a traumatizing past, she told me before leaving to a different city, i overthink that and dying in those thoughts, not sure if it is the physical aspect(only 1 guy and 1 time sex) or the emotional(that she has loved somebody else because to me, true love is sacred and happens only once).

3a9xkg,23,2015-06-18,my first emacs defun :p,VanLaser,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3a9xkg/my_first_emacs_defun_p/,"... a small step for me etc.

The path to my 'real' configuraton files (`vimrc`, `init.el`) varies between machines, operating systems etc. and I just wanted to have a ""commodity function"" which visits the file quickly. So I have this function in my configuration file:

       (defun EditInitEl ()
         ""Edit my emacs configuration file""
         (interactive)
         (find-file (symbol-file 'EditInitEl)))

Success! :D

And I can almost bet there is either a built-in way, or a faster way to accomplish the same thing.

(EDIT: already edited the heck out of it)

----

EDIT: `(find-file (symbol-file this-command))` should also work, and it's even more generic  
(you can change the name of the function at will).

----

UPDATE: Here's a macro which, when called, creates a function that will return the filename in which it was created:

    (defmacro place-beacon (func-name)
      ""Create a function that returns the file path in which it was defined.""
      `(defun ,func-name ()
         ""Return the file-name in which I am defined.""
         (symbol-file ',func-name)))
    
    ;; example, create a function to access my 'init.el' (all this stuff is written in this file):
    (place-beacon get-init-file)
    
    ;; and let's use it for the original purpose this thread was made:
    (defun edit-init-el ()
      ""Edit my emacs configuration file, v.2.""
      (interactive)
      (find-file (get-init-file)))


So you can ""place beacons"" in any file to have their path readily available.

----

UPDATE 2: (Following a [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3a9xkg/my_first_emacs_defun_p/cscbao2) by [politza](https://www.reddit.com/user/politza)) ... Here's an even more 'automated' *defmacro*:

    ;; When called from a file, this defmacro creates a defun named
    ;; ""get-path-to-&lt;file-name-base&gt;"" that returns the full path to that file
    (defmacro place-auto-beacon ()
      ""Create a defun get-path-to-&lt;filename base&gt; that returns its own filepath.""
      (when load-file-name
        (let ((fn-base (intern (concat ""get-path-to-"" (file-name-base load-file-name)))))
          `(defun ,fn-base ()
             ""Return the full path to the file in which *this* defun was defined.""
             (symbol-file ',fn-base)))))
    
    ;; This content is inserted into ""&lt;some path&gt;/init.el"" file
    ;; place a beacon here (=&gt; get-path-to-init defun gets created automagically)
    (place-auto-beacon)

    ;; EXAMPLE: you can place this anywhere
    ;; Use the beacon: get quick access to the file called *init*
    (defun edit-init-el ()
      ""Edit my emacs configuration file.""
      (interactive)
      (find-file (get-path-to-init)))
    
Of course, to use this, you have to know at least the base filename for which you want to find the full path, but you can check what `get-path-to-...` functions got defined and pickup the name from there."

Just looking for anyone who identifies, and I think venting all this may help me too.

I'm a 35 year old, generally happy guy. I graduated high school in 1999, and for the first 5 years I was out of school, looking back I made some bad decisions, but overall, I was happy. I worked as an assistant supervisor for Best Buy, had a gorgeous girlfriend, things were great. I had not a sign of any sort of anxiety, agoraphobia, nothing. 2004 was the start of that changing.

Later on in 2003, I decided that while I was happy in my job, I wanted more. I signed up for classes at a local college to go into graphic design, and started taking classes. I set things up so it didn't interfere with work, and things were good. Best Buy however, didn't share my optimism with it. Seeing I had no intent to be a lifer, they demoted in late 2003, then fired me on a technicality in early 2004. At the time I was making just south of $13/hr, had a car payment and such. I filed for unemployment, Best Buy challenged the claim and ultimately had it denied, so I was without income for about 2 months, until I got a part time gig for $6/hr less than I was making at Best Buy. One credit card suffered; I had to make my car payment so I could get to work at all. Long story short, that credit account went to collections, so I had collections hounding me.

Compounding this was my now ex gorgeous girlfriend. About a month after losing the Best Buy job, I found out she was cheating on me. I also found out that she'd went off birth control, not told me, and was trying to get pregnant, and trap me. Her friend got wind of it and told me, and once I was sure she wasn't in fact pregnant I ended it. Not sure if any of you have been through one, but a pregnancy scare of the unplanned sort can be pretty stressful. Especially after just losing a job, starting to miss credit card payments, and trying to find a job.

Once I found the Toys R Us job, tried to balance work, making bills that were falling behind and school, I started showing my first signs of what I now recognize as anxiety. I remember my first ""attack""... I was driving to my soon to be ex girlfriends place to break it off with her, now that I knew she wasn't knocked up, and my heart started beating crazy, I was shaking... I pulled over, dry heaved twice, got myself together and went on.

It was the only attack for a while. Things stayed chaotic until late 2006, when they went to full on crazy. I left the Toys R Us job so I could work at the college I was attending for my last semester, had met a new girl, and was at the verge of having my degree, and the means to get life back to normal. Things were pretty good, and I was managing the stress, and just happy for the new love I'd found, and all the thoughts of post graduation life. Then I came to school and my new girls ex bf was dropping her off at school. She too was cheating. We argued a bit, and ultimately after breaking it off for the last few months of school, started seeing each other. During our ""break"" her friend and I started talking, just friend stuff, nothing romantic, and got pretty close. Ultimately I fell in love with her, but never could tell her, she had a boyfriend and I wasn't going to put her in that situation. Her and my again girlfriend decided to room together at a University about two hours north of where we live, and I had landed a paying internship (I was in school for graphic design) locally for more money than I was making when I left Toys R Us. After just getting back together, my girlfriend and I were going long distance, and she was rooming with a girl I was in love with to boot. This put us in June and July of 2007, with them starting school in September.

Summer was pretty uneventful, didnt' see much of the girlfriend, the internship was going ok, life was actually pretty decent. I helped them move to their apartment at the new school one weekend, and they invited me up for a weekend after school started.

Fast forward to then, a paycheck had bounced for my internship, and I was late on a credit card payment again, prompting a collections call. I went up to visit my girlfriend and her friend at school, only to find the girlfriend drunk to the point of near alcohol poisoning while her friend was at work. I dealt with that, calling the medics and such. What'd I get for my good deed of potentially saving her? (The medics told me she was ""on the verge"" of alcohol poisoning) She broke it off with me. And, later I found out, her ""ex"" too, whom she'd been still seeing on the side. I never spoke to her again after that weekend. I never spoke to her friend again either. They both just disappeared.

Once I got back home, about a week later, another check bounced at the internship, the collections people were bugging me like crazy, and I was in a deep depression over losing my girlfriend, and her friend whom I loved. Nothing really would perk me up. I was having my anxiety attacks on almost a daily basis from the stress and the depression. This all came to a head the day after Christmas when I went to work at the internship, and was told that they were shutting down.

I was jobless from Christmas of 2007 to Valentines of 2008, when I started working where I do now. I was being paid under the table for the internship, so I couldn't get unemployment. This made the collections agents really happy. I started getting things under control, then the financial crisis hit in 2008. A credit card I hadn't gotten current went completely default. The bank belly flopped when the markets died, and I owed $2500 immediately. By this point I was having MAJOR digestive issues on a daily basis, could barely keep food down, and was a wreck; unless I was at work.

All of this has lead me to where I am now; my finances have been completely repaired - I have 2 credit cards now, both of which are current and with no balance, just bought a new car a few years ago, and make about 2.5 times what I did at my peak at Best Buy. But after all that damage, all that stress, all that having to be strong for that long, I'm left holding the anxiety bag. It's not an all the time thing. For a while, since it's primarily acid reflux and digestive issues that manifest for me, I went gluten free, thinking that was the issue. It didn't dawn on me until I was going to a concert in 2014 with my brother, something outside my comfort zone, and had 3 anxiety attacks that night, that I had an anxiety issue.

So here I am... it's been 11 years since the start of this roller coaster, and I finally know what I'm dealing with. The worst thing about it? Certain situations outside my comfort zone, knowing they're coming, and that driving me to have the attacks I have. I don't have them every day like I used to, but as all of you will vouch, any anxiety attack sucks. Through all of it though, I try to be positive. I've come so far, and accomplished so much that I know anything my brain can get me into, it can get me out of. I can beat this, I just have to figure out how. Maybe venting all this off will help."

Naturally, I'm pretty excited but I'm unable to tell anyone as most of the people I interact with are my co-workers..

I'm also a bit worried, because I don't live near one of their locations and my wife doesn't want to move. To be fair, I don't want her to move either. While I'm willing to go if it were just me, she is close to her family and it would be sad to take her away from them. Its not really something I'd like to do.

I also feel a bit traitorous about the whole thing because I just got my brother an internship at with my current company :P

Concerns stated, I am really excited to see how it goes. Even if I fail horribly I'm pleased that I'm able to say I've gone this far. The innovation that is huge with Google is something I've wanted to be apart of since I started my career. I'm also excited about the challenge itself. To see if and how I compare to the geniuses at Google with be very engaging to me."

It helped me out getting my internship, getting my post college job, and now moving even further up in my career all within 13 months!

I am now up for an entry level position at a large insurance broker - now owned by the one of the largest consulting firm in the world (not bragging here, but I feel it's important as it may mean future opportunities maybe?). This job would begin on Monday the 22nd. I just interviewed for another company that is in my field and offers good pay and benefits. The company is fairly new, about 10 years and is growing pretty quickly. It has a feel similar to a start-up would (flexible hours, work from home, really young group), it is fast paced and very current in healthcare and constantly changing. 

Writing it down it seems like for me, the 2nd company is the better choice. But I also do not want to be out of a job. So if I start Job #1 and then get the offer from Job #2 how would I handle it? The people at job 1 are very nice and friendly and the job seems to be very stable and secure and have some prestige as well. Job #2 has a lot of what I am looking for and I am pretty excited for. I think it is secure as well, they have been growing every year, and I actually have worked through partnerships with them via my current and previous employers.

Starting the first job and being only there a few weeks would make me feel like a shitty person, but I need to do whats best for me. I'm in an ""at will"" employment state, but I don't like when people tell me ""who cares, it's at will you can leave whenever you want and they can fire you whenever they want"" for me that's not a good enough reason and seems like a very sloppy way to handle yourself.

I am close to graduating, and they know this. I would like to tell you about my predicament.

So far this position has involved learning on my own about web development (full-stack), working with 3rd party hardware, learning about how radio frequency works, learning how a start-up operates, and learning the business side of products (something I never really considered, but quite fascinating how important understanding the client is). The pay is good enough, but not great. Also no overtime pay, which is disappointing but understandable considering the current business. 

I have been present for a lot of the founders meetings because we share an office together. Hence they trust me hearing in on all their discussions. These founders actually have a network of people who each have their own companies at different stages. 

Now, there are 2 main things I am disappointed about. The fact that I am not getting guidance in software related techniques from peers, and am literally learning everything from internet sources. I feel like compared to my peers this will really hinder me.

The second is that once the project is done and demoed, until further notice there is no more work. Now, I was told of the risk, but also told the founders would try and get me another place to work in the worst case where no investment comes. But this insecurity kind of worries me.  

Now, I admit that I was sold on the founders vision because it seemed really great at the time. Even now I really believe this idea is great and that investment is most likely going to happen. However, I don't know if they see permanent value in me, or are just saying these positive things. A founder was constantly telling me how I am a key part of their future because i have all the knowledge of their system and the future of the company.

I would really appreciate any feedback from everyone here about how much trust I should put in this. Are these guys trying to groom me for the future? "

If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

So as you can assume from the title I'm having some troubles with my parents. A lil bit of background, I'm currently a Sophomore in college with a good gpa and I work 3 jobs plus I'm handling an internship! I'm a good kid who never went through the rebellious phase and I never drank until college. 

Anyways, my parents can't be a bit unreasonable and always analytical. One example would be that I was commuting to my job yesterday from another town, about an hour away, and I made sure to text my mom that I got there safely. Well 6 hours later, while I'm still at work, she decides to call me. Being that I work in an office environment and she knows when I get off, I was easily annoyed. Here's our conversation:

Me: Hey why did you call? I'm still at work.

Mom: I didn't know if it was actually you who texted me back this morning. I was so worried that something happened to you and you got kidnapped.

Me: -.- sigh Mom I'm fine but you can't call when I'm at work.

This is a normal occurrence and I'm really starting to get frustrated. My dad is in law enforcement and he's even worse. Whenever I'm talking to him I can't make any facial movements without him suspecting that I'm lying. 2 weeks ago on a visit home he asked why I kept blinking when I was talking to him and that it was suspicious behavior. 

My dad also has to add his 2 cents on what job I should do with my degree,even though I've told him multiple times that I already know what position I would like and what field I wanna go in. Plus whenever I remind him, he constantly belittles my dreams and tells me there's no way I'll achieve them.

Their attitude towards me is extremely frustrating. I've done more than prove I'm perfectly fine being independent, seeing as I live an hour away, have 3 jobs and manage school full time. I don't know what to do, I've tried talking to them but it's pointless. They're good parents but I'm ready to pull my hair out. Thanks for reading:)

tl;dr: my parents are extremely paranoid and always think I've gotten kidnapped."

My FPGA classes in school have been by far the most interesting to me, a large part because they are so flexible in solving many situations.  From what I've seen browsing around various companies that do FPGA work, jobs for them are almost exclusively looking for people who have been working with them for 5+ years.  

Is there a path to breaking into this field via something else?  For example, do most people get hired on doing entry level embedded work and then moving into FPGA design from there?  There's also almost no internships I could find related to exclusively FPGAs to get me some baseline experience.

I'll be a junior next year and am very interesting in this part of CpE and wondering how best to get into it."

Although the intention of this thread is not to review my resume, but I am sharing it as a reference: http://imgur.com/a/JYKq9

I have a friend (who is way worse than me in computer science) who went from an internship in HP last summer to one in Schneider this summer. Although the first one because he had some contacts inside HP and second one at Schneider was likely due to the same reason, I am worried that I am getting left behind even though I am a stronger computer science student.

Me being in a community college, being in the summer of my second year and having a not very high GPA (out of a couple that actually responded positively to me regarding internships, only one asked for the GPA) is already going against me. I fear I am falling behind despite all my efforts. The only company to ever interview me was Microsoft, who conducted 2 interviews with me and then never contacted me again.

Luckily the user Varion from NeoGaf has translated the important parts and these 2 comments stood out!

- 2 million is the bare minimum for the game to exist, and if that was all they got, it would just be focused on the story. The more money it gets, the more of the things he wants to do will be possible.

- As far as money goes, he expects the game's investment will primarily come from individual backers, so he wants them all to be happy with the finished product. Doesn't sound like Sony and others are giving them all THAT much.

These points are so so important. We have people not pledging high amounts because they think that Sony (and other investors) are going to jump in. These comments state, directly from Yu's mouth that that is NOT the case! The kickstarter is the main funding for the game.

Now I know people are sad that there might not be a physical PS4 copy, and I understand that you don't want to pledge over the $29, but really how are you going to feel when the game that you have waited 14 years for gets stripped of content that Yu wanted in his original vision?
Please guys, lets get Yu as much money as we possibly can so he can make the game that he wants, and that he deserves!

Help share this message, as you still have people in the kickstarter comments, on here, on shenmuedojo saying that there is no reason to back the game as Sony are stepping in to fund it...

Edit: Here is the Full Article [Famistu Translation](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=168899118&amp;postcount=6043) - Thanks to Varion from NeoGaf!

Edit 2: I have been trying to spread this around as much as possible but still see people everywhere saying that Sony are going to fund the game in a big way (which is incorrect). From this point on, I think we need to focus on getting the words Directly out of Yu's mouth. He has said in the Famistu interview that he expects the main funding to come from the Kickstarter, so we need to make he re-iterate that in today's Reddit AMA. More specifically, we know that he cannot comment on the amount of funding that he has secured from outside sources, but I feel that we might be able to get a number of out him that HE WANTS the kickstater to hit. If we can get that number, we can quote him and spread that news like wildfire. Even news sites like IGN, Kotaku etc will be interested in that.

We need to get this info and then need to get it out there. If Shenmue fans see that Yu wants (for example 12 Million), then we will get Yu 12 Million:P.

**Today's AMA Goal:**

**Ask Yu Suzuki ""Where does Yu-san expect most of the Funding to come from for Shenmue 3? And more importantly, how much does Yu-san want the Kickstater to reach in order for him to make the FULL vision for Shenmue 3?**""

If we know the above information by the end of the day, we can flood news outlets with this and intern remove a lot of the miss-information regarding the outside funding."
3abw62,100,2015-06-18,The shadowy world of Blizzard's 'internal testing',Mullet_Ben,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3abw62/the_shadowy_world_of_blizzards_internal_testing/,"First of all, let me just say how happy I am that David Kim wrote up a[ response](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/18132606976#1) to specifically address a lot of the concerns that people have had about Blizzard and feedback. It goes a long, long way to making it feel like we're part of a conversation, rather than shouting at a wall. Seeing /u/BlizzDavidKim responding in [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3a6lcy/what_if_siege_tanks_can_get_picked_up_by_medivacs/cs9yd56) is fantastic. It's clear that Blizzard has got the message and wants to [change how they are communicating](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3a6pcb/legacy_of_the_void_feedback_june_17th/cs9sa3w?context=10000). I just want to take some time to emphasize why I think all this ado started, and what Blizzard needs to focus on when interacting with the community.

It's really good to hear that Blizzard is testing community suggestions. though we've always had our suspicions.  But when you say things like:

&gt;Some are concerned that the feedback being provided isn’t being considered or used. This has come as a bit of a surprise to us, as so many changes that we’ve *tested* and *implemented* in Legacy of the Void were from player feedback. [Emphasis added]

It's clear where the disconnect is. You may test, internally, every ridiculous suggestion that's ever been posted on the bnet forums. But the only times we ever hear of are when the suggestions are actually implemented (often altered considerably from the original idea), or when the community causes enough of a fuss that Psione or Dayvie finally deigns to tell us that ""we tried it internally, and we didn't feel like it was right for the game.""

To the community, the Starcraft II backroom is a dark, mysterious place. It isn't that we think there's anything sinister going on, it's just we have no idea what *does* go on apart from the very few glimpses we're given. We don't know when you test things, when or why you reject them unless you tell us. Maybe you spent days more rigorously testing DH than anyone in the community. Maybe you spent a better part of an afternoon. Maybe you just skimmed the TL post. For all we know, the SCII team is just David Kim, Psione, and some interns.

It's not that we don't trust you Blizzard but, well... when things like the [Warhound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8VKon9F-zM), and the pre-severalnerfs Hellbat make it through ""internal testing,"" but things like [modified unit formation ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkCx-1VUtU) don't, you can excuse our skepticism. Mainly, though, we just wish we were more involved.

You started the beta early. You said it was going to be a long beta, because you wanted to make big changes. I think [a lot of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/39pca5/blizzards_behavior_is_the_exact_opposite_of_what/) took this to mean that we would be privy to a more volatile time in development, where the changes are big and frequent. Instead what we get is... a longer beta. Oh, sure, there are big economy changes to test, and we start with 12 workers now, but is this really that different from the HotS beta? Everything that makes it to the beta has already been vetted by Blizzard's internal testing, and is something that Blizzard is confident, with some iteration, will ship in the final game.

[Posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/39figp/i_really_hope_theres_a_lotv_patch_with_some_big/) send a different message. **Blizzard, we want to be your internal testers.** We want to try the things that you *don't* think are going to work. Better yet, we want to be a part of the team that decides whether or not something is worth pursuing. Because as much as we make extension mods, and organize showmatches, none of that amounts to half the testing that one week of beta would.

Maybe I'm being naive, or ridiculous. Blizzard recently [explicitly refuted](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/19801932/legacy-of-the-void-beta-balance-update-preview-june-12-6-12-2015) the idea that they would be trying game-changing ideas in the beta (apart from, of course, the ones that Blizzard's internal testing have deemed fit). But when something gets as much momentum as Double-Harvest (or, do I dare mention, Depth of Micro?), ""we tried it internally, and we didn't feel like it was right for the game,"" is just far too dismissive. Maybe all we need is more communication when you test things internally, so we can hear your concerns and have an opportunity to respond. And when you *do* [make a statement](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/17085919227#1), and the community issues [rebuttals](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/legacy-of-the-void/483599-in-response-to-david-kim-re-sc2-economy), continues to discuss it on talkshows, and organizes showmatches, consider that the conversation is not over and that maybe you ought to say something else within the next couple of months. At some point, it becomes hard to tell if the community is losing support for DH because it no longer seems to do what they hope it will, or just losing hope because they think that Blizzard has closed the book. If we had just gotten another statement or two on DH, or moving shot, or the chat system, then maybe we wouldn't have had the bother we did.

Then again, if we're using feedback from extension mods, showmatches, and internal tests to decide what is the right direction for the game, well, then what is the beta supposed to be for?

3abydd,0,2015-06-18,MIS degree: job options? Certifications?? Where to start???,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3abydd/mis_degree_job_options_certifications_where_to/,"So I'm going to be a junior next year in college. I'm double majoring in MIS and Spanish (went to Spanish immersion elementary + middle school, might as well study it in college) I landed a internship last summer in a large company that does defense contracting, and I was asked to come back, so I'm currently working here this summer as well. 

At my internship I've I've worked with unix/linux to deploy software to radio towers, some basic IT stuff like cloning hard drives/setting up computers in a lab, I used CIS-CAT Benchmark Assessment Tool for group policy stuff, I know a bit of coding: C++, javascript. I'm currently being trained to troubleshoot radio routers+ talk to field techs at radio sites (my company is currently working on a contract with the FAA), as well as help work on projects with OSSEC and Splunk. 

I've been doing a lot more research on possible jobs after college, like junior business analyst and system analyst. And a lot of them require certifications? But there's so many of them and I'm honestly just confused. I want to become more proficient in linux/unix + sql/databases and understanding networking. Honestly the IT and information field just really interests me as a whole, I think the security end of things is really interesting as well. But I honestly don't really know where to start??? Anyone have a guide to steps I should take to learning more and looking good for employers. I also live in northern virginia (15 minutes drive to DC), so resources/job opportunities are honestly every where. 

Any help/advice is deeply appreciated!! "

After the next academic year I'll be needing some credit to start out in whatever city I end up in working. I figured I may as well apply for the card right now to start earning some points to hopefully get some Summer travel in before I start work full time in 2016

So I applied for Citi Prestige yesterday and was denied. No questions were asked by the Citi rep when I called the number to get a final decision, he just said I'll get the denial letter in the mail which will say why I was denied.

My CreditKarma report shows:

- Transunion: 755(Very Good)
- Equifax: 729 (Good)

The only issues with my scores from Credit Karma are:

- I have a new line of credit from an autolease I signed with my father last August so that's still pretty new. Aside from that, I only have a Credit Card from my bank, which I have had for 2+ years now. 

- I only have 2 lines of credit open (no student loans)

- Equifax finds 5 hard pulls for credit history (4 without the recent Prestige check), but Transunion report one

My questions are:

- Sould I wait for the Citi letter stating why I was denied? (I'm assuming it's cause I don't have much old and active credit) before calling their reconsideration line

- Call their reconsideration line now and argue my case now?

- Give up on Citi and apply for the Chase Saphire Preferred Card? I checked their prequalification and it showed that I pre-qualified for it
- Any other card I should consider applying for?

Sorry if this isn't in the right place/I should've consulted another thread first, I'm pretty new to this whole thing

EDIT: Yea, I probably shouldn't have applied to the highest end card that Citi had. How long should I wait before applying for a different card (i.e. Citi Premier or Chase Saphire)? Two of my hard credit pulls will have been 1 year ago by September."

Also, not sure if this is the right spot for my question but whatever.

To give a little background this passed week was my work conference in my industry, called NEOCON in Chicago. We went down there with all of the staff related to it. Designer, Business Development Manager, Operations Director, President, and myself - Project Manager and Marketing Director. Now to go into finer details I'm 21, the President is my father. At the company i'm pretty much guaranteed to be abused almost 90% of the time with jokes, comments, etc. I'm the young guy and I'm the bosses son. I've worked here for two years, I was brought on board to be a marketing intern, within two weeks I came up with a proposal that has completely been the reason for the success in the company the passed year with my marketing plan.

Fast forward to NEOCON, the whole place is an open bar, we go out for drinks each night and to clubs, etc with the industry. During dinner I am openly insulted by the rest of the staff when the president isn't there. Everyone is drunk and I try and brush stuff off but this is fucking offensive. Stuff like I'm useless I'm riding my dad's coattails, etc. etc. Shit like that. I try not to take it personally but keep my mouth shut, I know i'm the only one in the company who works countless overtime hours, I run multiple projects and most of my days are spent trying to fix projects that my coworkers have screwed up on. Anyways, any input i have in a conversation gets brushed off since i'm young, ""have no place here"", and don't know what i'm talking about. One on one they're all relatively decent to me but together it's like mob mentality and they tear me apart. 

Now on to the nights, it's a pretty great industry party lots of people in the industry meeting with clients, friends, customers, etc. I would be off on my own talking to people when the group of staff come up and say don't talk to him (me) as i'm greasy and gross and young and shit. Again, I keep brushing it off I don't want to be that guy to overreact. They openly tell other people that if I wasn't working for my dad I would be unemployable, etc. Just some pretty offside things in my opinion.

Anyways, how do I go about this? Listening to this ridicule is making me fucking depressed and I feel like if I keep brushing shit off it'll make me sociopathic or something. The main person who dishes it out is the BD. The BD and I sit together in the office, the BD also makes the most money out of the employees I listed because she makes commission for answering the phone and meeting new clients. EVERY single one of these calls is from my marketing plan, not one piece of business has actually been 'developed' by the BD personally. That's what pisses me off the most. I make the least amount of money, have to put up with endless abuse, don't want to bring my dad into the equation too much since I'm a big boy. Part of me want's to just shut off our fucking marketing program and put our BD out of work. Part of me want's to quit and accept a job offer I've received. And part of me wants to stay in the company and continue helping my dad be successful because it's the closest we've ever been. My family is starting to notice that i've been depressed, I can't sleep, I'm just at the point of breaking and I don't know what to do. I like my job, I like the clients, I like the industry, but I can't keep being happy here right now. 

TL;DR: Co-workers are dicks to me at my dad's company. Co-workers get drunk at a conference became even bigger dicks to me, seems to be getting worse and worse. Insulting me in public in front of people I know and try to make business relationships with. Looking for some advice on what to do."

Back when I was an intern, I heard that there was a specific user that caused a lot of trouble to our IT department. Normally simple things such as plugging in certain peripherals such as keyboards. However in this case, something remarkable happened. 


It was akin to jesus coming down from heaven and making it rain hundred dollar bills


The user submitted a ticket. 

Now you might be asking yourself: Isn't this standard procedure? What makes this so special? Well in this case our user submitted the ticket in the correct category. Before she would submit tickets under: URGENT, IMPORTANT, THE WORLD IS ENDING, however, this time she submitted a ticket under the happy term of REQUEST ASSISTANCE. 


Our happiness was short lived. It seems she did not need assistance from us, but from a literal God of IT. When my leader and I approached her cubical we looked down at the ground in shame. 

There, on the table, lay an open HDD, and a slightly upset user. 

We asked her what caused her to open up her computer and rip out the storage of her PC. She took a good long look at us, shook her head, and looked back at the HDD and said: 'It was rattling'.

She didn't understand why we couldn't fix it."

It all started when I broke up with my best friend that I had known since I was 12 (I'm 20 now),  and in doing so we called of our engagement. It was a devastating blow to me and my emotions. Admittedly I was close to the king suicidal thoughts, but I was too scared and new that was wrong. 

On a different note after I broke up with my best friend I started lying about the hours that I worked at my internship. It's been a few months since and I've continued to do it until this past week when I became very ill. I have been sick for the past few weeks, but this last Saturday I had to go to the hospital. I am currently under careful watch because my liver is having major issues, and I have to get blood work done almost every other day. 

The real problem is this: I got an email from one of my co-workers today saying that I needed to call him as soon as I can because it was urgent. Long story short tomorrow morning I have a meeting with him and the head of human resources (which funny enough is my ex's mother) about some confusion regarding my time card and my work. I am absolutely terrified. I don't know where to turn and I am scared my life may be ruined completely. 

I have already told my mother the truth about everything and tomorrow morning I am going to try and be resigning before anything bad happens. I am aware I am in a lot of trouble, as I rightfully should be, but I realize I made a huge mistake and just want to get out fast. I will pay back the money over time if that's what they want, but I am just scared that there will be more than just that. 

I  just need someone to help and pray for me and also to just turn my life around. I used to be all for Christ, but over the past few years things have gotten in the way and I've lost sight of it all. Back then I was always a good boy and never did anything wrong like this. I am tired of being stuck in my sinful nature like this and want to change.


TL:DR - I really messed up in my live emotionally and might be in a lot of trouble legally. I am about to start the long process of recovering from all of this, but am scared of the road ahead.  "

I'm thinking of going abroad (mostly USA or England) and I would like to find a company where I'd be working as an Intern. The reason for this idea is that if you have experience abroad, you're much more desirable when you apply for a job in certain company, plus I love to travel. I was thinking of being an intern after I graduate (Faculty of computer science), though this is gonna take some time (currently a freshman). 
Some have suggested me to go on Erasmus which is an European (i think) exchange program, but i'm not very interested in that because that is more or less the time to party. If I would go abroad, I want to benefit from it. 
So here come the questions:
1. Does anyone know where could I find myself some roommates and share the flat with them? Any forums of that kind or anything?
2. Are abroad internships a good way? 
3. Are there many internships for foreign students?
4. Do you suggest that I go after I graduate or sooner?

P.S.: I started working (part time) as an Android developer, so by the time i graduate, i'll have some experience, thus being more desirable for internships (i assume)."

When I search entry level or development internships it usually says something bemusing like ""have 5 years experience in development and be a javascript master"". Web development seems to be in high demand, and it also seems like your ability to hack and learn is a little more interesting to employers than formal education. Am I looking in the wrong places? Or is my measely knowlege of HTML, CSS, Wordpress and Drupal not enough to be in the game yet? I kind of doubt it, but who knows. 

I'm not trying to make a lot, but would love to work with/for people who are better skilled than me. I've been hired for freelance jobs but its mostly CMS/template work, would love more guidance in getting better at making, rather than modifying that stuff.

A.A.S Comp. Science with Database Concentration
MYSQL, PHP, AJAX, HTML5/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript. Java. Microsoft office tools (Access, Excel)
Worked on three different website projects, two of which were in a classroom. Created a basic web form from scratch.

I've recently finished all of my classes. Many of which were database related. I'm hoping to land a junior/entry level position doing database or web development work but after looking for about the past month in my area it's been difficult.  

I had an internship last fall doing web development work converting a paper system into an online form. I had interviewed starting last summer with about ten different companies over about five months. A couple of which told me I was rejected just because a better candidate was identified. I now have internship experience, albeit it was unpaid and unfortunately I don't think I can use them as a reference as they wanted me to continue doing work. I did not leave them in any kind of a bind either and saved them money.

I technically graduate this summer only because I missed an ungraded exit exam, but all of my classes are finished and I walked stage. Most of my peers passed the interviews I failed and they have jobs. I suspect it was from lack of experience or low 2.8 GPA at the time.

I'm just trying to figure out what my options are – kind of a “what now?” moment after going five days a week. Obviously I have a little bit of experience and a degree whereas I did not before while going to interviews. The problem is PHP isn't being used in my area much for web development and people are using .NET. I'm not seeing many positions for PHP. I could learn ASP.NET or C# but that would take a specific project idea and time. (I had a class with C#, but it was all basic and mostly involved the visual studio GUI.)

I could wait for a job as I'm living with family and have no immediate financial need but if I do that I want to stay active. I suppose I could also relocate but I have very little funds and it would have to be paid relocation. I have a minimum experience making flash/HTML5 games but that's somewhat unpredictable as far as income goes. I've considered remote jobs but that seems to be for really seasoned developers.

What are my options?

**bold** TL;DR Recent graduate going on about a month and a half unemployed. Hoping for a jr. position doing web/database development but .NET is taking over and I'm experienced with PHP. What are my options? I'm willing to work hard but needing advice.

I live in the Knoxville / Oak Ridge Tennessee area."

So I finished my first year of EE in April (with a less than stellar GPA (3.12/4.33) but that's not the focus of this post). I completely failed at getting an internship this summer (Only managed to get 1 interview, 2 looked at my resume but ""have chosen to pursue other candidates"", and the rest did not respond).

So my hope/dream was to have an internship and/or research experience every summer giving me 3 work experiences before I graduate.(Ideally want to get hired full time right out of school if I choose to go straight into the workforce #BayAreaismydream). (If I choose to attend grad school which I most likely will then that gives me another summer to work).

But here I am one summer gone with no internship (Definitely not from a lack of trying).

So my question is did I miss the boat on trying to setup an ideal career path/future? Maybe my ambitions are greater than what I'm capable of and I need to accept that.

Would love to hear all of your opinions/similar situations/stories etc.

I wanted to share my experience in undergrad for people who are at the beginning of their college experience. I also want to share what I did leading up to me accepting a full time offer. I also want people to flood this post with positive stories about what they did in college/directly after college that led to be gainfully employed. In addition, stories that showing how you went from a job you hated to one that fit you more would be appreciated. I also think it will be very good encouragement to all the younger ChemEs. 

My story started freshman year. I initially wanted to go the medical school, but knew that if I changed my mind I needed to get some work experience. During the first co-op day I signed up for some interviews. I had so few hours that I only got the scraps.   Every student got 5 interviews, I was only able to scrounge up 3, because all the other slots were taken. I went to the interview day, AND all the interview prep sessions. Long story short I was offered a co-op the first semester of my freshman year. I tell that story to highlight the importance of seizing opportunities as they come up. Unless you are very lucky a ""perfect"" situation will not arise. Its up to you to make the most out of every career related service on campus. What I'm saying is go to the career center every semester and get your resume reviewed and updated. Do not wait until you want to apply to something. Some of you may be thinking but I don't have anything to add to my resume, which leads me to my next point. 

In this era you need to be involving yourself in extracurricular activities if you can afford it. College is more than a set of course work. It is a combination of all your experiences. Get involved your SGA,engineering clubs,honors colleges,business clubs. Signing up and not doing anything is not what I'm advocating. Actually get involved. The experiences from other clubs will give your resume a boost, and it will give you practice working with others, and more importantly give you situations to talk about during your interviews. 

Back to the co-op, when you finally get co-op/internship give it 110% even if its not your favorite field. Your first internship does not determine your first job, while it can influence it ChemE is so broad that if you work hard and open your eyes you will be able to see how different skills are transferable. When you get that internship/co-op, you need to make it your goal to perform better than every new hire in your dept. That means contributing ideas to the team, giving your mangers possible solutions to things you hear about in meetings( if good enough they may let you lead a team to work on your idea). For example, I had an idea to have an outage on a unit, I gave my reasons and my bosses let me find the contractor, develop a safety plan, outage execution plan and start it back up. I was even allowed to start up a piece of equipment that they shut down for a few years based on my findings. When people say stuff in meetings pay attention and ask questions and give people solutions. All this will again help you stand out in interviews when you talk about your internship/research lab. 

Finally the job hunt, it is the most daunting part, but it doesn't have to be as long as you remember that every employer is looking for someone to solve a problem for them. The job hunt is not about you. It is about showing the company how you will help them save more money or make more money depending on your role. The first place to start is the career center/dept chair that you have been cultivating a good relationship with since you have been getting your resume consistently critiqued and have been developing a strong rapport with the people helping you. Second,look to your internship/coop to see if they have open positions. Third, remember all those contractors that you worked with at your internship. Reach out to them. since you were getting fully engaged in the work process they likely remember you. Forth, reach out to your network on campus. Since you have been very involved on campus you have a lot of friends from all walks of life. They likely have family and friends that can help you if you pass your awesome resume to them. Fifth, get on linkedin and cold contact alumni in your chosen field to see if they can help you. 

Lastly grades. They are important. Get help early in course. Getting a greater than a 3.4 is not impossible, and it will keep you competitive for a wide variety of jobs. With that said, don't think you 4.0 entitles you to jobs. There are hundreds of other students with just as good or better grades than you. You need to show the employer you know the material, and you can help them make money. 

This is basically my story in college. I had a job before spring semester senior yr. A few of my friends that followed a similar path as me were also employed. People who only relied on high grades struggled through the hiring process. The single most important thing I will say is get a coop. Try every semester starting fall freshman year until you get one. Any co-op will help you it doesn't have to be at the biggest company. 

tl/dr: You should read it all if you are a student trying to figure out how to get a job. In short, 
1.Go to all career fairs/co-op days. You are not to young. I got a co-op first semester freshman yr. 
2.Use your career center resources consistently. Aka make friends with career center ppl bc all jobs flow through them. 
3.Get involved on campus. It is good for you, and it will help you stand out. 
4.At your internship, seek out ways to make a difference. Act like its a try out. Your goal is to perform as well or better than most new hires by the end of your term. 
5.You have to network. Think about all the friends you made in points 1-4
6.Your grades matter. Dont play with them on the other hand your high grades dont entitle you to anything. you still need steps 1-5

These are just my 2cents. It would be great to hear some other stories. Maybe this post will give ppl direction and prevent so many job related post in the future. "

Made my mentor something for father's day and I want to brag (long but I gotta vent),",whiskey-monk,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ad53w/very_happy_and_cant_wait_for_my_next_therapy/,"Some background:
You can fish around my history in this sub. I post all the time. But in a nut shell my mother was extremely abusive when I was growing up. Like I have scars--both literal and emotional--from her parenting. 

My father died when I was 12. He was murdered by a wanted felon. I found out when I was 17 that he (my father) was a child molester and abused someone I was close to in my family. Then I was told that my mother knew and did nothing about it. She actually stayed with him and had me not long after. No idea how she continued to touch that fucker but whatever. 

So, naturally, I was a horrible student. Always acted out. I'd miss chunks of the school year then show up on the last day to take the finals and pass with low/mid 90s. I had teachers tell me *to my face* that I was a waste of intelligence and that I'd never do anything with my life. 

Buuut...then I met Mr. D. My therapist said he thinks Mr. D ignored what was legal and did what *he* thought was morally right. Ignored the slack that he got from other teachers (and I had to ignore being teased by other students on my end). What I mean to say is that I quickly became a teacher's pet. Guy was only 10 years older than me--and two years younger than my sister who raised me--so naturally it was easy for me to open up to him.

We got pretty close. I don't know how it happened but after a mere month under his tutelage I began caring about my grades. I realized I actually felt bad if I earned a poor grade in his class. So I did my homework, participated in class. 17 year old me must've been ecstatic because he gave me positive attention. 

I'd stay after school all the time to hang out with him. I quickly realized we had a whole mess in common. Loved the same movies, music, books, hell both of our fathers raised us loving horror. Turns out his father died when he was 11/12, around the same time that I lost mine. Maybe this was why he originally reached out to me; I never asked. 

During the last week he was distributing grades from his computer. We had the option to go to his desk and have it written on paper or to have him say it out loud in front of the class. I opted for the latter and assumed it'd be the usual 30/40 out of 100. Turns out I earned a low 90. When he said it I practically jumped out of my seat and had this *huge* grin on my face. I excitedly yelled, ""Really?!"", and I can't tell you how hard he was trying to hide his pride. It was all over his face.

Senior year comes around and I intern for him. He ends up losing his job because of budget cuts. I was actually with him when the principal came in to call him to his office. Christ, I felt like my parent had lost their job. 

The local newspaper kept interviewing me--I had been sending them letters about the teachers' union fighting the school board for months at that point. Reporter ended up quoting me saying that Mr. D was ""my hero"". The following school day he had the article clip taped to his blackboard. So the next day I made him a t-shirt that had our school logo on the front and the word ""HERO"" on the back in big black lettering. He wore it the day I gave it to him and on the last day of school. He paid for my cap and gown so I could walk. Then when I graduated he gave me a check for $75 and a copy of Randy Pausch's *The Last Lecture*

So five years has passed since then. Every Christmas and Father's Day I send him something. We keep in constant contact. Well, this year I really wanted to get him something special. 

Guy is a writer, right? He wrote this excellent book and finished it my senior year of high school. He revised it countless times and I'd reread it each time to check for errors and as a first reader type of thing. It eventually landed him a agent but unfortunately no publisher wanted to pick it up.  However, in my mind, the book meant a lot to all of us. I know I felt very close to it after being involved with it to the extent that I was. 

He created this fictional town that essentially started in that book and carried on to his other works. He called it Warrenville, after his late father, Warren. At one point in that book the main character (who is a teacher) wears a ""Warrenville Wildcats"" shirt. 

[So I made him that shirt for Father's Day.](http://imgur.com/a/j5XPU)

He loved it. Also, those are shovels behind the ""estimated date"". It's related to a major plot point in the book. The ""estimated date"" is the year he finished the first draft. Attached is also his response.  

For those confused: A year after I graduated I had asked him if he'd mind being my pseudo-father (I said ""father figure"" but that's the term he ended up using). He agreed and said he'd love to be there for me. I'm 24 now but he's still my hero. Thus, he'll refer to himself as ""Papa D"" when things get sentimental (i.e. when he signs my Christmas cards, birthday cards, etc). 

I'm so happy he likes it. Seriously--it's the kind of happiness I can't feel with my mother and the kind I *know* I never felt with my real father. There's a disconnect with them. But with him I feel like a little kid sometimes. Once I described it to my therapist like this: hanging out in his classroom all the time was awesome. It was like wearing your parents' clothes when they're gone. Just being near his desk and such made me feel safe. Something I rarely felt with my parents. 

I'm so lucky to have him in my life. I've learned so much from him. I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for him. Hell, I may not even be here--I had originally planned to kill myself before graduation prior to us meeting. He changed all of that and made me realize my true potential as a scholar as well as a person.

Life is pretty great.

Also, please excuse any grammar errors and such. I'm wicked tired, hah."
3ad54y,7,2015-06-18,"i'm so stressed. everything's changing and i'm feeling overwhelmed. how to cope? (it's long but please, (if you have time) take a read)",rosiexox,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ad54y/im_so_stressed_everythings_changing_and_im/,"there's a lot of things keeping me up at night and preventing me from accomplishing my goals/tasks. for example, i was supposed to start reading my accounting textbook, send some emails, do yoga but i got a call from my mom at around 6pm when i got home asking me roughly what what day i'll be able to find a place for myself after my mom and dad move to a different province.  that brings me back to issues that i keep thinking about.

#1) my parents moving to another province.

i'm 20 years old and i accept that they want to move to another province where my older brother recently moved to. but then on the other hand, something creeps up and gets me really emotional realizing that i've lived with my parents all my life and that living without them-not even near my proximity gets me into a crying mess usually when i'm trying to go to sleep at night. i'm such a baby aren't i? 

#2) where will i move? (anxiousness, nostalgia, depression)
i know that i have to stay in my current area because i'm in my last year of university and am looking for a place preferably downtown. i'm excited for that new experience but am sad that my parents want to sell our house of 12 years. not to mention that it's in a great location in Toronto and personally, i wouldn't want to give it up. but when they leave, i don't think even i could handle being in the house all by myself. they're not selling it until i find a place but they're leaving in less than a month. i just get so anxious and nostalgic about my house, the whole city in general and not having my parents around because i've practically lived there all my life with them(ugh i'm crying just typing this out)..

#3) balancing school + work life
i currently started a paid internship and previous to starting the job, i took 3 online courses and dropped them all because i couldn't handle doing both. but i am starting an in class course in 5 days because it's a mandatory course that i need to take in order to graduate which hopefully goes well. but it's hard working 9-5 and having time for anything else. 

#4) i'm not happy with myself
i'm not at my goal weight and gained back the weight that i recently lost due to stress eating and whatnot like going out to eat with coworkers. i'm constantly stuck between wanting to get to know/meet more people and then just wanting to hide away on some days and just having feelings of inferiority. i want to start biking to work but after one incident last year after my tire getting stuck in the streetcar tracks, i've been hesitant. i'm on day 4 of this yoga challenge I've already ate badly today. overall in the future, i want my bike to be my main method of transportation so that i can save money.

#5) feeling so detached/different from my long-time bff
she's 20 years old like me but the thing is, she's never had a job and can't wrap her head around growing up or even dressing somewhat appropriately. (i know i'm horrible for judging but the last time we hung out, i was dressed professionally and when i was with her, i felt like i was with my younger cousin or something). for my birthday last year, the dress code was a dress and she didn't follow it. i just felt like she didn't care at all and it made me sad that she and my other friends from uni didn't get on well.  she's not ambitious, always reading fan fiction but we always seem to find common ground when we catch up. i can always count on her to hang out and watch movies. although she did accomplish growing some magic shrooms.

#6) i want to start living a minimalistic life + fashion lifestyle (only owning 33 items of clothing)
i have so much items in my room and when the time comes for me to move out, i don't want to have too many baggage. 

how i'm coping thus far: avoiding what i need to do, eating, and using asmr (relaxation) videos everyday to keep me calm and put me to bed. i can't go on like this.

reddit, please help me analyze my situation and what actions i should take to move forward? 

thank you so much to whoever takes the time to read this and answers. "

I never actually knew that this subreddit existed - but now that I am about 1/2 way through studying for the CCNA, it has become a wealth of knowledge!

I am currently going to a community college to finish some prerequisites and plan on pursuing a degree in either Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering. In the mean time, I am looking to work my way up the IT ladder to help offset the god-awful costs of college.

Basically - I am hitting a bit of a wall when it comes to what to do from where I am now. I already have my A+, Net+, and Security+ certifications, but would also like to get the MCSA Server 2012 certification by the end of the year.

---

I work for a computer recycling company and have easy access to 'old' equipment. Because of this, I set up quite the cool home Cisco lab to practice with.

It consists of:

* Cisco 3845 router
* 2x Cisco 2821 routers
* 4x Cisco 2960G switches
* Cisco 891-W wireless router

For starters, I want to confirm - I know this setup is a bit overkill for practice, but I had fun setting it up and it didn't cost me a dime. I was curious if it would be enough to get me by for both the CCNA and CCNP.

---

Moving on - I don't quite know what I should do from here. I am moving to a new area to begin my sophomore year of college in the fall, and will also be transitioning jobs in the process. With the certifications I have now (including the CCNA, which I should have in about two months max), I am not quite sure where to go.

I had an internship through my school district from the beginning of my sophomore year in high school, right up until I began community college. I then transitioned to my current job. In total, I have three years of experience as a ""Network Technician Intern"" in a large school district and almost one year of being a ""Senior IT/Computer Technician"" for my current company. A few months ago, the position for ""Online Sales Manager"" opened up in my company and I haphazardly went for it. The pay (about $16/hour) was nearly 30% higher than my previous position ($12/hour), and as a poor college student, I couldn't pass it down. I also feel that the word ""Manager"" in my resume will prove to be quite helpful. However, I do not think there is any more room for expansion here, so I have started looking elsewhere.

---

I work on servers during my work, study, and free time, and have been keeping a portfolio/photographs/videos of all the personal projects I have 'embarked on' over the past year. It consists mainly of the following, but there is a *lot* more to it:
&gt;Firewall setup with:

* PFsense
* Sophos
* Barracuda

&gt;Linux home/server use:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* XenProject

&gt;Virtualization using:

* QEMU-KVM
* VMware ESXI
* Hyper-V 2012

&gt;Home Automation using:
* Insteon
* Homeseer
* MisterHouse

---

The problem is, I am 19. At my age, most people suggest something along the lines of a help desk position or an internship, but I honestly think I have the experience/certifications/ability to handle a lot more than that now. I don't know where to go from here.

I honestly love working with virtualization, but I don't know what sorts of certifications would be the right direction and - furthermore - I don't even know if there would be much in terms of jobs in my new location.

---

I don't mean to ask y'all for a direction to steer my life in, but I think that is basically what I am doing!

TL;DR:
I don't know what to do with my experience/certifications/skills. What sorts of job titles should I be looking for? What would be a good starting salary to keep in mind for the upcoming job hunt? What certifications should I go for after CCNA, CCNP, and MCSA 2012? Would it be a better idea to put the IT work aside and just focus on my degree?

If anybody has **any** tips, suggestions, pieces of advice, kind words, etc. to calm my worried mind - I would be so appreciative. "

I'm looking for some advice on how to get started in the construction industry. Some background about me, I graduated in structural engineering from UCSD a year ago in 2014. Since then, I've looked for jobs in the design industry as I thought that was what I wanted to do, but haven't particularly had any luck in finding a good job in the area. A lot of my friends from school have found jobs in the construction industry and seem to be happy with it, so I'd like to give that a try as well.

I have done volunteer work for Caltrans, worked part-time for a small design company, and had an internship for one summer in Brazil for a large structural engineering company.

So far, I haven't had any response from only sending my resume online. Is looking straight up for a field engineer position too much for someone with no experience in the construction industry? Should I apply for some other kind of position? People have said to meet someone in person, but to be honest I wouldn't know where to start.

I appreciate any insight or advice you guys can give.

Before we met, she was attempting to cope with the death of her close friend, who took his own life during her senior year of high school. When I was getting to know her, the suicide obviously still was having a big impact on her. However, as time went on, her mental state seemed to improve dramatically, and we both seemed to be taking positive steps to become the people we wanted to be. 

However, this last year has been brutal. Last summer, she had an internship in a foreign country. We were barely able to communicate, as she didn't have phone service, and I didn't have regular internet access. It became clear to me that her depression was getting worse. She was thinking of her diseased friend often, and her happiness seemed to be draining away from her. Being barely able to talk to her, I felt incredibly powerless. She then confessed that she had cheated on me, while away in another country, with a man that I knew and trusted. 

I was devastated. However, immediately after I learned of her infidelity, the situation got much worse for her: she was sexually assaulted. Although she had hurt me deeply, I still loved her and wanted to help her. She wanted me to stay, so I stayed, and in time, I really felt like I had forgiven her. 

The following semester, the weight of her depression fell down hard upon her. Due to the combined weight of the suicide and the dreadful summer, she was struggling severely with most aspects of her life. She was seeing mental health experts, and decided to leave school temporarily the following semester to manage her depression. Knowing what had happened last time we were divided, I was apprehensive, but I knew she needed to get better.

She continued to see therapists, and she is currently taking antidepressants. However, I would be lying if I said she has beat her depression. And honestly, I am getting frustrated. Not because she isn't better, I mean come on, defeating depression can take a while. What bothers me is that she doesn't seem to be committed to getting better. It doesn't seem like she wants to change. She treats her therapy begrudgingly, as if she only goes because someone told her to. She continues to deny that she could handle stress or emotions better, claiming that she is just emotional and that is the way it is. 

This came to a point tonight. While talking on the phone, she said something that I found offensive and hurtful. A ""shut up"" slipped out of my lips before I could catch it. I apologized, but I was then chewed out for ten minutes. After a while, I was tired of hearing it, and asked her why she took it so personally. In case you haven't noticed, I am not so great at filtering my thoughts. Regardless, she immediately hung up, and I haven't heard from her in hours.

It has now been 6 months since we have last been together, as she returned home, 1500 miles from our college, for her time away from her studies. There is no guarantee that we will be back next semester, and neither of us have the financial means to visit one another. Meaning I have no idea when I will see her again. And as much as I love her and care for her, I really am feeling like this might be too much for me to handle. I really don't want to leave her, but I am feeling pretty miserable. I am tired of these random fights where I am always doing things wrong. I am tired of shelving my issues to help her, without her doing the same for me. I want to help her, but I also want a healthy relationship. I want us both to be happy, both now and going forward. But I am at a loss on what to do.

I've also dealt with depression and anxiety my third year and I feel like no matter what I do or did I couldn't get the grades I wanted (3.0 and above GPA) during the school year. I've also heard that it's 10 times easier to get an internship during the school year than during the summer because there are more vacancies. Right now, I feel absolutely burned out from school and I hate my classmates and many of my professors.

Is it recommended I take next year off to work at an internship/co-op? How much easier is it to get an internship somewhere? I'm trying to get something related to my major but the job market is skewed towards EE/CE/CS/ME jobs. 

Edit: I'm just extremely angry that because I spent so much time and effort applying to internships, I didn't spend as much time in my schoolwork as I should have and so my grades dropped. But then I still didn't manage to get an internship and because of my lowered grades, it's going to be harder for me to find work in the future. It's the worst catch-22. 

It's kind of like the other day when I was at a bus stop and my bus was 15 minutes late. I decided to walk to another bus stop just when the previous bus I was waiting for arrived. I then ran frantically back, trying to get the driver's attention, but he left without me. But then the second bus I was walking to arrived and left without me, so I was stuck there waiting for an hour for another bus to come."

So, there is a lot going on here so I'll try to keep it neat.

I've been with my fiancee for about 3 years this July and we've been engaged since last Christmas. We live in Indianapolis but a turn of events has caused my fiancee to move to Cooperstown NY for graduate school (She's going into museum studies and that is THE BEST school for her field - no joke), unfortunately my job field is a little more complicated. I graduated with a degree in Media Studies and although I have looked and applied everywhere I possibly could and after a year of working odd jobs, the ONLY opportunity given to me in my field is at a local news station in Indianapolis; forcing me to stay for at least a year (I start this job on Monday).

What I guess makes this more difficult for me is that my fiancee and I have lived together for 2 years now (not including practically living together while still living in dorms in college). We are inseparable, she is my best friend and my life (and I mean that in the best way). I have ZERO experience with long distance with the exception of a few months one summer when I took an internship in Denver while my fiancee was in Indy--and even that was difficult.

I felt like I needed to take the job opportunity in Indy because it was the first real offer in my field and I graduated from college 13 months ago. I knew that if I didn't get a jumpstart on my career soon, I never will. Here's one of the catches though... the job is part time and wont fully pay for my rent, bills, loans, etc, so I need a second job (NBD, I know) and I'm fortunate enough to stay with my current job BUT it is forcing to have a 7-Day work week with one day in the week going from 5am-5pm.

Though I'm looking for a different second job I hate to admit it but the one I do have pays pretty well. I feel like I'm living one of my big fears because not only am I not being able to see my fiancee, I am unable to be able to visit her; let alone able sit down for five minutes. For some reason just the idea of being able to have a single day where I can wake up and say to myself ""I don't need to be anywhere today"" really matters to me. I may have to spend my day off doing chores or running errands but at least I don't need to be somewhere.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to keep our relationship strong and make sure that I'm doing well enough to not smother her, annoy her, or get constantly upset about not being able to see her. She doesn't leave for another 2 months but I'm already feeling like she left or everything is the ""Last This or Last That"" and I'm constantly breaking down at least once a day (which, as a 23 yo male, beforehand that NEVER happened).

There are a lot of other things going on which have made things worse. Within a month I have a big wedding to attend in Chicago, move into a new apartment, my parents have been divorced for a year but through complications have to still live in the same house up in Chicago--which is messing up my younger siblings, my father has been diagnosed with several types of cancer (I'm not making this up), all while starting a new job and plan a wedding in Wisconsin.

All-in-all, I feel like my fiancee is the only good thing in my life and now she's moving away and I can't go with her. There isn't an issue about trust or anything (which is good), we've started doing this texting thing where we're making up our own story through the texts in a sort of RPG theme, and there will be some breaks; so why am I still a wreck?

I think it's safe to say that I'm terrified of such a drastic change, especially for not being able to wake up next to my fiancee. I'm afraid to be alone (though I have a cat), because I can't be by myself to deal with my nearly explosive anxiety now. I have friends here but they like to party, live without problems and stay out late (which I just can't do much anymore). 

I guess I should state a big elephant in the room: I haven't been on my anti-depressant meds for a while. I was on them for about 3 years and when things in my life were going pretty well I felt like I didn't need them anymore. But things started getting tense and I went to go refill my prescription but it was expired. I got my prescription from a psychologist from my college and I can't get it from her anymore. I'm trying to look around for a doctor I can go to that will accept my health insurance and be good enough for me to be a regular patient but money so EXTREMELY tight right now (I just had a week where I had LITERALLY 12.38 in my account) but I know I probably need to just bite the bullet and spend the co-pay.

On top of everything going on at my parents house in Chicago, staying in Indianapolis while my fiancee is in Cooperstown, and having a 7-day work week, I just keep trying to tell myself ""It's only temporary, it's only a year"" but I sometimes fear that I will have a serious mental breakdown. Sometimes I don't know if I can make it. My heart feels like it's going to jump out of my chest--CONSTANTLY.

Sorry about the novel, and I can say that I'm telling the 100% truth on everything. No exaggerations or dramatizations. Please, just tell me something that will keep me going... 

tl;dr: Have to do a long-distance relationship while my life is being turned upside down, I'm a nervous wreck / How do I go about it and stay happy?"

I am an intern for the community development division of a medium sized city.  A project they have assigned to me is taking a list of affordable housing projects in the city (about 500) and making an online map that displays all the housing projects with dots or icons. They want information bubbles to pop up when the dots are scrolled over with a cursor. It would also be great if these bubbles gave the option to edit the information right there, but editing through a database would be just as good. Being able to display dots based on certain criteria (two family and under only, handicapped accessible, etc) would also be a great feature

Some GIS professionals and professors I have consulted with suggested looking into getting access to an organizational template for the the city. Some think it can be simply done with ArcMap online. Others have said that I should look into learning how to use leaflet. What do you all think?  If this was your project how would you approach it? I have an excel spreadsheet of the affordable projects with some details on each.  I'd like to make a good product but not spend more than a couple weeks putting it together because they would like me to move on to other things. 

Thank you all so much. "
3aepa4,2,2015-06-19,Question about whether I should see if I could be bisexual or not,mtlgaycurious,AskGayMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/3aepa4/question_about_whether_i_should_see_if_i_could_be/,"Hi,

I am from Montreal and I have been, until very recently, in a relationship with my wife of almost 20 years. I am 40.

**First, the background:**

Over the last few years, our couple had been rocking the boat, with me notably having a short-lived girlfriend 2 years ago during a bit of separation during a few consecutive months of separation.

My wife and I have been on and off for the last 4 years or so, never close enough to have weeks of good time in a row, but never moving apart. The problem is that I want the relationship to continue, and she wants to be alone.

But here is the problem: during the bits that I try to get into a new relationship, all I find is women who are totally unwilling to compromise or adjust anything in their lives.

They want a man to share their own life, but don't really want to share the live of that man.

My short-term girlfriend was a little better but between you and I, she was a back to school student who decided to return to become a doctor in her mid-thirties and between her workload, her debts, her isolation (she was in a far away hospital to finish her training), she had to compromise with a man to just have one in her life. We broke up when she failed her internship and suddenly became demanding, needy and controlling.

My friends all say the same thing and many have decided to remain single. If appears that there is something in the education of Quebec women which does that.

Until today, I thought we were alone, but right now, the debate is even in the Journal de Montréal, our biggest newspaper.

To make things worse, I was raised in a very homophobic family (my mother went to many anti-gay wedding events) and I was raised with the understanding that if I was gay, I was worse than anything else.

I was also bullied by kids and called a faggot just for being a nerd...

**Experiences**

About 15 years ago, my wife and I were swingers. We went to a few swinger's club and even to bisexual evenings, since back then, my wife was bisexual (now, she is zerosexual).

I had very small experiences with men, and what I disliked is the too abrubt approach. A man decided to start a hand job and he almost tore off my penis.

Granted, these are NOT Gay man, but rather married men who want to do stuff with other men, while their wives have sex with other women.

But I definitely wasn't turned off by them, and exchanged a few kiss and one french kiss.

My wife however, didn't want these to go further. I wasn't allowed to experience more, like blow-jobs (I somehow was interested in giving a blow job back then) and sodomy (I was really, really interested in feeling a man inside of me, and I actually preferred sodomy with my wife than vaginal sex).

**My problem**

My specific problem is that I think I am both a demi-sexual (I only really feel sexual attraction within a couple, as a result, I only had sex with 2 women during our swinger years, while my wife had sex with over 30 men and 20 women and yet, I am not sure I was demi-sexual with men, from my small bisexual sample. I seemed to feel more inclined to go further with a man than with a woman). and need to be in a couple to feel healthy emotionally (I know, cliché).

When we did threesomes, I had no problems being naked with the man, and I really liked how simple it is with guys. All of the guys seemed ready to do anything and to adjust to our needs, while the few women had long lists of requirements (including those from my wife).

In short, I have grown to love the flexibility and simplicity of guys versus the complexity and requirements of women.

**Furthermore**

I have developed multiple desires and fantasies over the year, which require a certain open-mindness and flexibility.

I really enjoy nudity and went to naturist events. I am often (if not always) naked at home since our separation (even if we still officially live together as roommates) and nudity is a taboo for most women.

Even my short-term girlfriend, she appreciated spending a morning watching tv in bed with me still naked from the previous night, but I barely saw her naked for the whole relationship, having sex only in the dark under the covers.

I also enjoy BDSM, on both sides, including chastity play. I know I would enjoy being sodomized by a man while wearing my chastity cage, and would enjoy sodomizing him while he is wearing it...

It's weird, in vanilla sex, I am apparently mostly heterosexual, but in BDSM, I think I am mostly gay... I sometimes masturbate to the idea of sucking the cock of my master while chaste, and then, a few days later, having him suck mine.

and at the same time , I'd love to share passion with my SO, like doing Arduino circuits, watching Jason Statham movies, and reading Sci-fi books in tandem, something that is very important to me and which my wife (and most women) don't share.

My short-term girlfriend, for example, the thing that appealed to me the most was her love for Dune books, but in the end, it was only because of the honore matrones sexual manipulations over men, she only read them because of an ex who pushed her to read them.

**So, do I pursue this?**

Should I try to see if perhaps, I would be bisexual and happier in a couple with a man that might share similar interests or is my situation insulting to them, a little like if I was saying: I am only into guys because girls are too close minded.

Considering I mostly masturbate to women, would that be a problem or is that again a repressed gay feeling? That perhaps I couldn't visualize guys because it might be a repressed emotion?

There is a gay naturist center in the Montreal area, with a sexual section and I was wondering if perhaps, I should investigate my emotions regarding this.

If so, is there a protocol I should know? Is it as simple as more people say?

I am so confused...


**EDIT: I just found /r/gaykink and it seems rather interesting...**

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

Thursday, 26th March, 2161 AD - 84 AGW

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Liam Hawke Ex Brotherhood Of Steel Knight Height: 6""2"" Weight: 96 kgs. Muscular body type. Eye: Bright Blue Hair: Black Gender: Male Sexuality: Straight Age: 26

Liam was with the California chapter of The Brotherhood Of Steel for a fair few years and he thought he would be with them for more. But after a load of changes by new leaders and rules that were being conservative and stupid Liam had enough. He had asked two of his best mates if they wanted to leave this place with him but they said no. So that left Liam on his lonesome out in the wasteland.

Liam was a a lot luckier than most people in the wasteland, having power armour and the best range of weapons and explosives. So he didn't really have any problems with any humans he encountered they would usually stray away from him when he had his armor on. Though he did have to kill a a lot of mutated creatures.

Liam spent all his time traveling across the U.S, going to the East Coast he decided. But after awhile he stopped and thought why the hell is he going there? He didn't really know. He stopped in abandoned buildings, remote settlements and semi destroyed cities when he needed rest or wanted a break.

After months of the same process he saw signs that he was approaching the state of New York. Liam smiled, he had always wanted to see New York.

Hello there people! This was the start of a story that I had going with someone else but due to personal reasons they had to leave but now I am looking for someone to revive it. I would play the role of Liam so I am looking for someone to be Scarlett. I want this to be a long term role play. Don't worry so much about the large wall of text if that worries you as i do want long detailed rps but normally do a paragraph or two/three per posting. This is obviously set in a post apocalyptic/ post nuclear world of the video game series Fallout. I would prefer to role play over platforms such as kik, yahoo msger, skype, google docs and google chat/hangouts. I can send the rest of the story or we can make our own start from after these two posts. If your interested send me a detailed message.

3af0ou,1,2015-06-19,The one and only school list plea.,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3af0ou/the_one_and_only_school_list_plea/,"Hey guys, I have a list of schools I'm interested in. I looked through all of the MD schools and tried to find fits based on the OOS rates and MCAT/GPAs. I've submitted my primary, but I can always add. Just hoping to get some input on my list and chances! (I know my MCAT and volunteer experience are likely going to keep me out of the higher-tier schools.)

Overview of me –

Florida Resident

White Male

Graduated in May 2014 from a mid-tier liberal arts college in Tennessee. Have moved back to Florida since and am working and taking a few classes (1 pre-req). 

GPA: cumulative: 3.90, science: 3.90

MCAT: 33 (10/ 11 / 12); 91st percentile.

Research: Selected for a fellowship where I worked a little over a year and 1000 hours at a top tier institution (research was clinically relevant, but is primarily animal based). I presented at a national meeting and will be coauthor on a manuscript in preparation (and hopefully out by interview time).


Volunteering (Total: ~100 hours. I know I am lacking in depth and continuity and am continuing to build on my gap year) –

Clinical: 25 hours total throughout the schools year of volunteering as the assistant to an MRI Tech.

Non-clinical: I worked as a healthcare liaison at tax sites for disadvantaged individuals; I briefly volunteered at a bike co-op during my time in college and am continuing to do this where I now live at a similar outfit; distributed public health information at an event in New Zealand (Sadly could not get clinical experience in NZ, but it turned out this was a meaningful experience as it pointed me towards access to care and Navigating). 

Extracurricular Activities: Was on the club fencing team for 2 years and an assistant captain my senior spring. 

Shadowing: Selected for an internship at a children's hospital that included rotating through various clinical specialties and shadowing doctors and medical students for a semester (100 hours).

Work experience –

Clinical: I worked briefly as a part-time medical scribe for a private surgery practice (60 hours), but they were bought by a big-box hospital and could not bring me with.

Non Clinical: I was Navigator for the Affordable Care Act during my gap year (400-500 hours) and will continue to do this through the next Open Enrollment period that ends January 31st. This included working one-on-one with disadvantaged populations and helping people understanding their healthcare options. (Will be stressing this throughout my application as it was a very important experience for me and has helped really develop many skills that will be critical to being a physician. Plus, it is unique.) Early in my college career, I was also a primary camp counselor for two summers (800 hours). I think stresses more important qualities and was a significant activity to me.

Miscellaneous things:

1.) Immediate family in medicine: Mother, Father, Grandmother, Grandfather (x2) are all physicians. 

2.) Nothing really sticks out, but I'm leaning towards a sub-specialty within pediatrics. Maybe hem-onc, surgery, or cardiology? I really don't know at this point. 

3.) 2 Letters of rec are great, 2 are good, and 1 is okay. 

4.) I'm planning to take a month long solo bike tour throughout parts of the US after my job as a navigator ends. 


Schools I have in mind –

4 Huge Reaches:
Baylor, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Case Western.

4 Reach Schools that are a little better stat fits (still big reaches):
Emory, Tufts, Brown, Dartmouth.

10 Reasonable Fits: 
VTC, UVM, SLU, Miami, USF, UCF, UF, FSU, FIU, FAU.



Let me know what you guys think of the list! All suggestions, criticisms, and comments are welcome! I appreciate the help. "
3af0rs,1,2015-06-19,"Getting micromanaged by my supervisor, complete freedom and respect from my boss.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3af0rs/getting_micromanaged_by_my_supervisor_complete/,"So I got my first internship this summer, and I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity. Really, it's a lesson in learning to be a better software engineer...and dealing with bureaucracy. 

The structure of my internship is that I have a supervisor, a young graduate student that has worked at the company before, and a boss. We work on 8 different teams on projects each designed by one of 8 bosses. Our supervisor checks our work before it is sent to the boss (to avoid any embarrassing, poor-quality submissions), and our boss tells us if our projects are meeting his needs. 

And man, our boss is great. He gave us complete freedom on our project, and he said our proposal ""exceeded his expectations."" It's going to involve machine learning and data mining. Our proposal intelligent, experienced, and really interested in teaching us. 

I was voted project manager, and my team is fantastic. The administration is also great. 

And then there's our supervisor. The graduate student. The relentlessly condescending man who's ruining what would otherwise be a 10/10 experience.

He told us to reply to all emails within two hours. All of his emails are several pages. We once asked for some resources on how to use one of the computational tools in our company and he told us that our email was unprofessional because we should have googled it first. We were asked to submit a “GENERAL” proposal of our project to our boss by the end of this week. It was done last week on Tuesday. It's now Friday night and our proposal has not been approved by our supervisor (which means we can't email our boss yet) because we forgot to capitalize the c in C++. Yes it’s an error, but this our tenth revision. It got sent back at one point because we said we were going to use a piece of software to rip data from the internet, run an algorithm on it, and get our results. Instead, he insisted that we instead rip the data, store it on dropbox, then run the algorithm. Also, every time we write in our schedule that we’re coding something, it must be followed with “error check and comment the code.” We know this, obviously, but he wants it written. I don’t even necessarily disagree with his suggestions. But to put it in perspective, our proposal was supposed to be 2-4 pages. At first, it was 3. It’s now 8. After 6 revisions, he finally approved the content. Since then, we’ve been correcting grammar to his liking. And that means if I write an equation, I have to put it on a new line with a colon on the previous line. I feel like my eyes are going to bleed again if I read it again, and every time he tells us that we need to read “every letter, every word” before we send it to him again. But he won’t correct it himself, he’ll say “look through it again. there are errors in sections x, y, and z.

And we just got an email at 11 PM today (Friday here), that he can check our revisions tomorrow. This is driving me insane. Our group members are freaking out and asking me if they need to cancel their weekend plans. I told them no, but I have no idea how that will turn out.

He said in a recent email. “If I can’t trust you to have an error-free document, how can I trust you to code without supervision.” My blood ran cold when I read that. He’s already slicing our productivity in half, and already I see him standing over my shoulder to read every comment.

Part of me thought it was just me, but I asked other groups. They all said that their boss has given them more stringent demands, but their proposals were done after one week and their supervisors only corrected grammar and sent it back once. Besides that, they only intervened when asked for help. Now I’m worrying he will hinder our performance. We’re already ahead of schedule programming, but this stupid bureaucratic BS is taking excessively long because of him, and our boss said he’s just planning to scan it. Now our supervisor is threatening our code too. 

Part of me wants to ask HR. Part of me wants to talk to my boss. Part of me thinks I would just look bad by complaining. 

tl;dr Awesome internship and boss. Micromanaging, condescending supervisor. What do?"

Eventually, I want to work in IT security, with the main goal of becoming a pentester. And one thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to get into academics.

People I've talked to about it have differing opinions. I have a couple of professors who always state that your formal education in IT doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is what you can do. There are also some who recommend pursuing a Master's degree as you can dive into the topics more, and get a more detailed perspective on them.

From what I've seen in previous posts about this topic, the consensus seems to be that real word experience&gt;certifications&gt;Master's degree.

However, I still want to ask you for your advice because my case is a little different. For one, I live in Europe and I don't have to worry about tuition, which seems to be the biggest reason why people don't recommend doing it: it wouldn't be worth paying that much for. On the other hand, some of the certs I see recommended around here are either unavailable here or too expensive for me. 

The IT security Master's degree I'm looking at seems to have a pretty interesting curriculum, it's not one of those management oriented degrees. It would also be at one of my country's most respected universities, which has great connections with big tech companies and has pretty good internship programmes. The university I'm attending right now isn't that well regarded. I mean, it's not horrible, but graduates form the other university generally are much better sought after on the job market. Also, from what I know, having a Master's degree makes it easier to get a job abroad, which I eventually want to do. 

On the other hand, there are a couple of up and coming tech firms in my area that are growing rapidly right now, and there aren't enough graduates for them to hire. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to find a junior level job at one of them pretty soon after I graduate. I already had an opportunity to go work for one of them but it would have been a full time job, so I had to turn it down. They also send their employees on day release courses to get certs regularly, which would be a good way to obtain some necessary certs for free. I'm also worried that their expansion will slow down by the time I would be done with my Master's and it would be harder to get a job.

I really can't make up my mind. As far as I know, after finishing a Master's degree with close to zero professional experience, I'd be eligible for the same junior level positions I'm gonna be eligible for after finishing my Bachelor's, and the 2 year work experience would look better on my resumé than a Master's with no experience. Also, not sure if this is a thing anywhere else, but here you have to be paid a certain wage for a certain level of education and you can become overqualified for jobs as companies look for the people who they can get away with paying the least to. I've heard of people taking their degrees off of their resumés for this reason, although not in the tech industry.

Also, do you think it would be a good idea to cross-post this to /r/netsec? I was reluctant to post there because they have ""Use /r/AskNetsec for questions."" in their sidebar, but I would like as many arguments as I can get, to make a more informed decision and that sub has a lot more users."

I moved here from a different foreign country, not in Europe. It's a transitional time in my life and I am currently sorting out my visa status and then I can focus on local business (i am a web designer)

She is a university student who is struggling to finish school and is currently doing a paid internship which is ultra stressful. Her English is great so we can communicate on practically a near-native level. But she is also in a transitional period in her life at 22 she is feeling the pressure of responsibility and adult life. Yes I am aware its a 12 year age difference.

It gets more complex. She ~~is~~ was a nymphomaniac when she was away for college. She has calmed down but sex is still **VERY** important to her.
I have a medical condition that has slowed my production of sperm and subsequently testosterone and has lowered my sexdrive a lot.

And to make it even more complicated, she lives with her mom (who just recently divorced which I had to deal with partially being her love) AND I live with family also. So we are both dependent and limited in our assets financially.

She is getting really frustrated and is often disappointed when I do not show her the attention (emotionally or sexually) that she wants.

I must also say that I told her I wasnt really looking for a serious relationship when we started which she agreed to but has since ""changed her mind""

We love eachother but its a struggle.
I am looking for advice on how I can push myself to be more intimate or make this work. I can give more background about my and her past relationships if it would help.

TL;DR
An expat american (with less testosterone than needed) in a relationship with a local Greek girl is struggling to keep his young GF happy in bed. Hoping to find a way to make it work.

So I have some questions for you experienced folk. On Tuesday, I have an interview at one of the big 4 music labels/conglomerates, and I need to nail this interview. This is the first and only interview I've received, and only got it through a connection. 

So I just graduated college last May, and I'm currently interning in the field I want to go into (marketing), but not the industry. My interview is with the director or talent acquisition, so it isn't an interview for a specific job. 

So I guess it comes down to a couple of things... 

* How do I communicate properly that I know what I want to do and the path I want to follow, but I'm willing to work anywhere to get my foot in the door? 

* I don't have all that much on my resume right now... I mean I spent years working at a summer camp and getting promoted there, and I have 2 internships on my resume (one in music that fell apart, one I'm doing now). So how do I make myself stand out and show my passion?

* When asked do I have any questions, I usually ask ""what have people who have been in my position moved on to do?"" but I am not interviewing for a specific position. So what should I ask?

* What are the chances I am asked about an expected salary in this first interview, and how do I answer that?

* Most importantly, how do I not bomb this thing? I've had jobs and internships, but none of them required interviews. The few things I have interviewed for never went beyond that interview. So how can I make sure that I am offered some kind of job at this company or one of their subsidiaries? How do I blow away my interviewer?

* Hand written or email thank you note after the fact?

Please, give me all the advice you can. This is the first interview I've landed after applying for countless jobs all over the music industry. I'm desperate to get a second interview or an offer or something.

Thanks!"

I had one internship and a part time dev job during school.

Basically, what should I be doing to meet my goal of getting a job there?

Here is what I am doing Right to improve myself

- I have been working on building on an android app for the last few months.

- I like solving problems on hackerrank.

- Should my side projects be done using microsoft technologies? I have a little bit of .NET (C# and VB) experience, but I would say 90% of my expertise is in Java.

- When should I apply? Since I have only been at this job for 6 months.

1. I'm her boss, and even though we're an office of less than 10 people, including the interns and we have no policy against it, it just seems wrong.  I can't help but think that some of this might just be making excuses in my mind to stop me from doing this.

2. I have some severe self-esteem issues, and while I do a good job of outwardly masking that, in situations like this it makes me question whether or not she is even flirting with me or I'm just completely misreading her.  I have noticed she acts differently with me than with the other guys in the office, though, which makes me think maybe I'm right.  I still can't allow myself to believe that anyone would actually like me, even though I know that's bullshit. TL/DR: I have unresolved mental issues.

3ah4wf,35,2015-06-19,Tonal Dissonance in Nightcrawler,s_connoisseur,TrueFilm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/3ah4wf/tonal_dissonance_in_nightcrawler/,"Hey /r/TrueFilm,

I know Nightcrawler gets a lot of talk in this sub, so I think I'd better use it as a starting point for a more general discussion.

It really got me thinking about the use of score - I think James Newton Howard's score is actually a very good one, and I enjoy the sound, but I don't believe it matches up with the tone of the film. The quiet but somewhat soaring guitar of the title track is nearly ambient - as one viewer on YouTube puts it, ""though the score is set to a sociopath's journey, the guitar score makes me yearn to fulfill my dreams."" That's exactly what I felt throughout the film - this uplifting, ambitious music superimposing itself onto Lou Bloom's disturbing acts. 

An obvious answer for why this is done is to enhance the psychopathic perspective of the protagonist. It makes sense to further engross us in his world by turning this death and destruction into ambition and profit, but as I watched the film I felt that the score doesn't feel jarring enough to carry with it some creepy irony. Serial killers singing lullabies and career criminals singing top-40 pop hits are more than explicit enough, perhaps excessively so, in their disconnect. Scoring a murderous rampage with the tinkering of a child's music box is clearly a move that enhances atmosphere. Though I can see the intent in Nightcrawler's score, I don't really feel it worked as well as intended.

I would put the severity of this disconnect down to the clash between cinematography and score. I don't think you can deviate so greatly between the two without invoking a sense of irony, and I don't think we reached that point throughout the film. It didn't feel enough like commentary; it wasn't utilised well enough to make a point in it's own right. I don't know how they could have utilised this discord any better, and so I don't think I would have utilised it at all. It was just... off.

Certain sections of it seem misplaced and poorly timed. That's not to say that James Newton Howard isn't a fantastic composer - his work on films like King Kong (2005) and Treasure Planet (2002) is beautiful. Take, for instance, the track 'Making the News.' 'Making the News' feels like it would be better accustomed to an intellectual drama such as Good Will Hunting or A Dangerous Method. It feels too melodic for the subject matter at hand. This may be a part of Lou's disconnect from others, and it may represent his clarity of mind and the peace with which he does his job - even if this is so, I did expect something darker and more menacing. It may have even suited the tone better. Certainly, there are times when the score delves to this level.

I felt the darker parts of the score were bookended by two moments in the film - the moment Lou enters the house following the shooting and the moment the car chase ends. Here we get a bit more pulsing bass and a little less treble, reflecting Lou's descent further into complete depravity. But then, we get to the epilogue scene where Lou hires his interns for Video Production News and the treble returns with all its ambition - though Lou has undoubtedly won, and this is his triumph, it's almost too much. I want to be worried that Lou's still out there, and I am, but the music greatly defuses this menace.

All this having been said, I am a huge fan of David Fincher and, by extension, Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor. I might have gone into the film expecting a darker tone, based on the [trailer music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC95NXEQruQ), and maybe this made me see the score as unnecessarily light in certain places.

&gt;Do you agree? Disagree? Are there any other films that you can think of where there's been some kind of tonal disconnect between elements?

PS: So I found both [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2l4zor/nightcrawler_and_the_importance_of_score/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2p9dcr/does_a_films_soundtrack_have_to_tell_the_truth/) after I was done writing, but I think I'll post regardless because it seems like it hasn't been discussed *too* recently and I spent a while on this (granted, I should have used the search function)."

He took one glance at the ID and immediately said ""fake, out of line."" Did he just look at me and assume I was underage? I really don't look underage, and I was wearing similar clothing to other people at the bar. Was it the fake or just me?

I took an Uber home, and on the ride the driver told me that most of the bouncers in Broad Ripple (where I got it taken away) were excise police who were specifially hired to do this. Is this true? Is this common practice in college towns?

She's the most genuine person in this world, and I love her to death. Our relationship has always been great.


We are both still finishing up school and living with rents, but planning to move out and do everything right with our personal lives once we get our professional lives together.


Plus, we're broke-as-fuck college students. I bartend and she has an internship alongside school.


Anyways, we don't see each other much, right? Always communicating though. I understand how important that is to a relationship. Also, when the fucking stars and planets align, and we do get the chance; we seem to fuck like we're the only survivors of some nuclear holocaust or some shit.


Which makes this part so weird. I worked 80 hours one week about a month ago, and my company gave me the next Saturday off for it (those of you who have never worked in the service industry: that's like not having to come in on a Monday for people that have real jobs. Never happens.)

So we really haven't seen each other in about a week. We go out, get drunk have fun etc. The night was a complete success, ya know? No nit-picking or passive-aggressive jabs back and forth over cocktails as you get more in you.

Since we haven't been out in a while, she went a little overboard. I mean, she was pretty damn drunk, but whatever I was driving, and I kept it cool. I do not drive intoxicated. 

She gives me road head on the way home, right? We're so ready to tear into each other that we have sex right there in the car in front of her house. 

We jam some music afterwards, smoke a cig, etc. when she turns to me pretty seriously, and asks if I like girls. I was confused.

""Wait... Do you think I'm gay? What the fuck?""

She looked at me with such a glazed, blank look. I've never seen her look at me this way. This took her some mustered up courage. 

Im a really laid back guy. Im very trusting, and understanding now. I used to be sort of a control freak, and couldn't figure out why I chased away all the ones that I love. I used to get angry. I turned that around before her, and decided that I need to let my significant others lead their own lives, and I should feel privileged to be included, and vice-versa, of course. I grew up a little from 18-25, I guess.

I was really upset. I didn't know whether to scream or cry. I finally found a girl that made me think, ""wow, so this is why people get married. I could really get used to having her around all the time,"" and she thinks I'm gay. Great.

""Amanda, Do you think I'm gay?""

She dodged the question, and kinda stammered out something about hearing people think that I was gay. My friends. This made me even angrier. I started interrogating her; just confused and desperate as fuck to figure out what the fuck was going on.

Finally, without discovering any other information, I told her to go to bed, and that we would talk about it that next day.

The next day, I'm hungover more so from the work than the beer, but I drag myself over to her place. She's all sobby, whiney, and crying saying how sorry she was, and hoe much she fucked up, and doesnt know what the fuck she was thinking etc. etc. 

I basically forgave her and told her that I just wanted to forget about it. Mostly just to shut her the fuck up, and stop her from telling me that she was sorry for the 1000th time. 

That was the last we talked about it. It kind of eats me up inside now though. I know that alcohol is almost kin to truth serum, and that question didn't just spring on her that night.

In high school, I played baseball, football, basketball, golf, ran track, and jumped triple jump. I was also the only straight dude in the LGBT club. I'll never forget the look those queers gave me when they saw me walk in the first day :)

I wanted to be a politician. I wanted to fight for single mothers, and the LGBT community. I felt like single mothers were some of the most neglected; and that gays deserve the same rights as every other human being.

So, I started going to meetings and really getting to know these people. I've even gone out and shook some hands during Pride. I was quite the tolerant jock, if you will. Pretty rare.

She didnt know me then, but she knows about it.
I could see how this could be turned around by others, and people could probably think I'm gay without knowing me, but it is especially weird for the woman who has been penetrated by me more than once to ponder this.

Regardless, I dont like dudes, and she was asking it in a tone as if maybe I didnt even know that I was gay. Why does she think this way, guys? I dont want to lose her, but I don't think I look at her the same anymore. 

Sorry for the long story. Im not very eloquent,  so I appreciate you sticking through to the end.

**tl;dr**: my girlfriend got drunk and asked if I was gay. I am not. What do."

I come here because I have no idea what their expectations might be or how to prepare. I have very strong generalist/math skills but no experience in anything ML/big data. 

1. How can I best use my time to prepare? Improve my SQL skills, get a statistics book, study typical SE interview questions?

2. Any good resources for someone in my position? Most blogs/lists focus on experienced DS hires.

3. General advice? Any tips on how to impress them?"

The first time I started dating her (let's call her Jane)  was in the 7th grade, right after we first met each other. Ever since then we have been intertwined. We dated for a period of at least several months four or five times throughout high school. Half way through our senior year, I had just broken up with a another girl after a year, because of my feelings for Jane. We hadn't been close during that relationship, but it was a very rocky one (like most high school relationships), so we eventually started talking even before I ended it with the other girl. (Nothing inappropriate, but I know my girlfriend at the time still wouldn't be happy). A week after I got out of that relationship, I took Jane on a date. We had fun, but she didn't have feelings for me like i did at the time. But I kept trying and trying to woo her, until there was a about a month left in our senior year. After a while I decided I had to give up, my feelings for Jane were very strong and I felt they'd never be returned. So I started seeing this foreign exchange student from Columbia. We really fell into that infatuation period and things started moving quickly, even though she was leaving in just a month. As soon as I took my attention off Jane, hers was on me.  Things ended with the Colombian quite badly, and Jane and I started dating just after a couple weeks. 


From there it moved quite quickly. We both already knew each other well, and our flame didn't hesitate to come back. But it was an interesting dynamic, because we had both already picked the colleges we would be attending. There were both about 8 hours away, in exact opposite directions. We only had summer together (three months) and we didn't know what we would do. But after about a month of dating we decided we didn't want it to end there, neither of us could let that happen. That was very emotional for Jane, and it led to her kissing one of my best friends. (He is known among our friend group for not respecting the boundaries of our guy friend's girlfriends). I understood it was an emotionally difficult time for us, and we decided to stay together. We recovered and the summer went really well for us. But that was the easy part. 

Come August and we are moving out to our schools. I am an introvert and she is an extrovert and this was reflected on our initial experience in college. I became close with my roommates but was still very lonely. She was having a lot of fun making new friends. The shock of being apart was hard and i pushed really hard for attention from Jane. Within a week of being at school we broke up. But we only stopped talking for about a day and we were back at it like normal again. Talking every day. Telling each other we love each other. It was like we were dating, but we technically weren't. After about three weeks of that, and failed attempts to get her back, I said something I shouldn't have. I made a comment about how it was her fault we weren't together, and she took it very harsh. It was right before I was leaving for the weekend and wouldn't have cell phone service. When I returned, I got a text saying how we would never work again, only a friendship was possible. She also told me she saw someone else over the weekend. After that, contact stopped. I was completely devastated. But after about two weeks I texted her. We were really into just being outside and observing nature so one day I texted her saying I saw her favorite bird (a bald eagle). She only responded with ""no."" From there I figured we really were done. But an hour later I received an ""I miss you"" from Jane. She had been drinking a little bit that night and I don't know if that just made her be more honest with her self or what, but from there our flame was rekindled immediately. We both came to our hometown about two weeks later, and got back with each other within an hour. 

From then on things went really well for a good while. I ended my time at school after just one semester and moved back to my hometown. This distance was too much for me so I was more than willing to be eight hours closer to her. I worked for a semester with the plan of returning to school at the university in my home time In the fall. We struggled a little during this time because I had a problem with weed and lied about it. During the summer she came home, but we faced more trouble because I got arrested for weed possession. Nothing major, I got my record cleared and all my fines were dropped, but she took it very hard. After about a month we recovered from that and we were very much enjoying our summer. She would still bring up the arrest from time to time, but we seemed mostly recovered.


Come fall, Jane really wanted to get into letter writing when we went to back to school. I never been very needy in relationships, and I think this makes me forget about the needs of others sometimes. She sent me a letter every day for about two weeks, and I lazily only responded once or twice with letters. She was sad, but it was nothing major at the time. We had gotten into the habit of talking on the phone everyday, so communication wasn't an issue. She was always busier than I, so she always ended up being the one who called since it was much more convenient that way. After a while though she expressed she wanted me to call more often. I didn't see why it mattered too much since we talked everyday anyway, but I obliged her request. After a while though, my calls kept coming and hers waned. She had put in a lot of effort before but now that I had been returning it, she withdrew. We still maintained a good amount of communication but we weren't as close as we once were. We made it through that school year, and we were doing pretty good most of the time. 

When summer came, she didn't move back home, but to the city just three hours away, for an internship. We saw each other most weekends and had a really great summer together. When school started back up, we kept up our communication really well for a while and were doing great. After that one semester, she had found a work program through school where she would work for a semester, so she moved back to same city three hours away this last January. It was a very hard semester for me so taking all the time became especially difficult. We got see each other most weekends, but our phones calls had reached an all time low. I stayed busy with school and was happy with our weekends. It was very different for her though, she had almost no friends in her city, and was not nearly as mentally busy as I. Over the past couple months she expressed she was unhappy, and lonely. But everytime we got together for a weekend, we didn't fight. Things were perfect. A minor spat here and there but there were no major problems when we were physically together. But as soon as we would split up, she would immediately tell me how down she is. There were times too when she would tell me how horrible life seemed. That she struggled to get out of bed, and she felt completely foreign from her family. (She has the closest family of everyone I know). Out of concern, I asked her is she thought she might have depression, or possibly bipolar disorder. (Some days her sadness seemed to disappear only to return a couple days later). Right away she didn't think the bipolar thing was impossible. She admitted that she had problem and said her parents wouldn't believe her even if she tried. But this conversation quickly turned into a very very bitter point for Jane. She no longer recognized any grounds for my suggestions, and she thought I said it to emotionally control her. She felt I said it to blame our problems on her.


This was really hard to deal with. I never meant to hurt her. But said I called her crazy. And couldn't get over it. Our phones all turned into fights but whenever we were together we were just fine. I didn't really understand what was going on. I would come to visit, and the day after I left she would call me and we would fight about everything. I mean everything. Every problem we had, we would list systematically, dating all the way back to the beginning. I didn't understand why we had to talk about every problem we ever had every time we fought. It felt like she was trying to destroy me. She would shine new light on the problems we had very clearly talked about and resolved a very long time ago. Any attempt to try to get her to admit to any mistakes (like kissing my best friend, only led to her being more resentful). Another stressor during this time was our living situation for the summer. She would still be working three hours away then and wanted me to move in with her. We were texting about it one day and I said all I would need is a job. Her immediate response was negative because she thought I was using that as a reason to not move in. I thought it was pretty clear and I just meant it as a prerequisite. I really did want to live with her, but I certainly had my concerns too. She lives in an expensive area, and her apartment is rather small. We never got tired of each other when I came to visit but I knew this would be different. Eventually I decided it would be okay for us to live together. Towards the end of this last month, days before I was supposed to move in, we got in a fight and she said she didn't know if we should live with each other. I figured that was a clear sign to not move in the next day, so I agreed with my current roommates to sign another month where I was living. My plan was to live there long enough to get ready to move in with Jane, and that I would move in midway through the month. But during this time communication was the best between us and what was happening didn't really get put out there. First day of June comes and she asks what going on. I tell her we signed another month to buy sometime, and she becomes furious. She never took any initiative after our fight to tell me she stilled wanted to come, so I was giving her space. My thought was i would just make it worse but my moving in when we weren't ready. But apparently I failed by not taking the imitative to make sure we lived together for all of June. 

So now I've pretty much finished the backstory. The not living together thing had us fighting constantly. She was mad that i didn't tell her I signed another month. Which I understand, certainly, that was a mistake on my part. She didn't take any sort of step either. Nothing. Yet it was all my fault. I told her I still wanted to live together but she said it was too late. Now she claims I never expressed any desire to live with her, at all. But I told her I was excited. I told her I was looking at jobs, I remember specifically talking about it. But these last months I haven't gotten her to admit any sort of wrong doing. She is an amazing girl, but no one is perfect. Last week she calls me and says she can't do it anymore, and she's too lonely and unhappy. I get her to agree to let me come with to her family lake cabin for the weekend. But she already had made up her mind to be angry. We still had fun, but she would analyze every little detail possible with an attempt to find something negative. By the end of Sunday she was ignoring me (for not trying her salad her sister made after a I had a very big meal). We went back to our homes that night and broke up over the phone. That was this last Sunday. But all week, we didn't stop texting. We even called a couple times. We didn't about anything but our issues, it was clear she was still searching for answers to our problems, and it seemed some part of her still wanted us to work out. We talk and she agrees to let me take her out on Friday (yesterday). 


Now comes the confusion. First our conversation was very angry. There was a lot of bitterness about our breakup. She listed off all the ways I've hurt her, and I defended my self best I could. Things got less angry and she started to say she knew it was completely my fault. I asked why and started to talk about the depression with her. She immediately shut down. We had been walking around downtown just talking, and she wouldn't say anything about it. Wouldn't even look at me. She simply refused to accept any sort of depression but in her eyes I could tell she knew it. She asked me to her home. I couldn't make any ground there, so I changed the subject and got her to calm down. I managed to make her laugh a bit, and we quickly became comfortable again. I went through and listed everything I've ever messed up, and why I thought it happened. I told her how I would make things better if we were together right now, and she really perked up. Had a couple joyful tears even. There was still certainly plenty of anger about the past though. We calm down and go in for drinks. We talked like we would normally, almost like we were on another first date or something. I liked it. We left after a bit and started taking and walking some more. Some more bitter topics came up, but it was getting much better, it seemed like we were finding some sort of resolution. Being able to talk without being together seemed to help open up the conversation  and we hit some topics we hadn't before. We went to another bar and returned to what was like normal conversation for a while. Talked about her job, and she opened up a lot about her best friend who betrayed in high school. (Had been an untouchable topic before). We realized we could be very mature about this and resumed our relationship talk. We both agreed that the best course of action was to stop communication for a while, except by letter. I had already started this week, and she liked the idea. I told her I would send one everyday. She talked about how she needed time apart to see if this is what she really wanted. She made it very clear that I shouldn't have absolute hope is us getting back together, but I know she was just being courteous and realistic. She tells me she loves me. And that I'm her best friend. But that she needs to see what it's like without me. Now comes most of the confusion. We bought tickets to a music festival a while ago, and when we first broke up we said we'd just sell them. But now she tells me she doesn't think that we should sell them. That she knows we can go. I agreed to it. I don't get how she can want that with the place we're in. After that, I take her to her parents house where she was staying for the weekend. As we sit in the drive way we had a very emotional moment. She was crying, and grabbed her hand and just looked at her. That lasted about 20 seconds. She leaned in, kissed me on the cheek, then for about 5 seconds on the lips, said I love you, I left my car. When got home I texted her saying I knew I was already breaking the rule, but that I wanted to rap up the night. I apologized again, told her some sweet things, and reminded her about how I can be better. We exchanged texts for another hour and she told me she was sorry. That she it was her fault too that we weren't together. Because she was difficult and tough to deal with. I pressed her to explain what she meant, like I had done very much for her, but she said it was too late (it was 2 am). I acknowledge  that most of our problems were my fault but to hear her give a little bit felt so groundbreaking to me. She hadn't taken any blame for anything in months and it felt good to hear for once that not everything was because of me. This was the last we talked. 


I apologize it is such a long story. It probably seems like we have had shitty relationship overall, and it's maybe not worth it to chase her anyway. But it's hard to describe how well we were when we were together. We've had amazing chemistry for 8 years and I don't think we would've tried at all if we didn't think we could make it through college to be together afterwards. I'm in a very strange state of mind. We aren't technically together. But it's very clear we're trying to find a way to make it work, and that we wouldn't decide to pursue others without telling each other first. So to me, it feels like a break. I know there's a chance she'll never come back, but I am more hopeful than not. So for now, my only way of winning Jane back is through the letters I write. I'm not really sure what I should keep the topic too. If she wants me to try to woo her with romance, or if I should keep it more to a friend level. The reason she liked letters originally was because of the romance. So I don't know. What do you guys think?

So I'm trying to study for the exam. I have no prior experience with PC's (I've only used Mac computers) and have only a passing understanding of the components of a computer.

How much time would it take for me to study sufficiently and pass the exam? I have Meyer's  A+ Certification book, but just through reading and highlighting passages and taking the end-of-chapter quizzes, I'm only getting around 3/10 questions right. Is it feasible to get the certification before the end of summer? What are other tips you can give to help a complete beginner?"

I come here because I have no idea what their expectations might be or how to prepare. I have strong generalist/math skills but no experience in anything ML/big data. 

1. How can I best use my time to prepare? Improve my SQL skills, get a statistics book, study typical SE interview questions?

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Play current games (mostly DOTA2) at 144fps (1080p), fast PC for software development / some video editing.


**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I wanted to do 4k with a high frame rate, but I don't think that the technology is there yet. I'm content with 1080p for now, as long as I can get &gt;120fps consistently for DOTA2 on all high settings. I'd also like to casually play new games at higher FPS, maybe on a 4k TV.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**


Was budgeting about $2000...but went way over to about $2500. OK to spend a bit more though at this point.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'm in computer science and I'll be starting a PhD this fall, and I'll likely be doing information retrieval. I've wanted to build a monster gaming rig for the past 15 years now, but never had the money to do so. I got my first internship this summer, and since I'm getting paid quite well and have no debt, I figured I could afford it. I did a lot of research, and though I didn't want to spend so much, I tried to get really good components and I ended up spending a lot more than I anticipated.

I'm planning on upgrading the ram to 64GB or 128GB (if 16GB sticks become cheaper) sometime in the next year so I can use a RAMDisk to work with large amounts of text/database data quickly. I'm not really sure how feasible that is. This was one of the reasons why I didn't just go for the 4790k (only 32GB allowed on Mobo). I was also able to get the processor half off by buying it through my work.

I think everything should work well together, and all the parts should fit. This is my second time building a computer, but the last one I built several years ago only to learn, and only spent around $280 so I didn't have a whole lot to think about. 

I'm planning on attaching the CPU cooler to the top of the case, and I'd like to overclock my CPU and GPU as long as the power consumption and noise doesn't get too high. 

I've ordered everything, but I can still return things if it means a significant improvement. Since I already spent so much, should I have gotten a better motherboard? Do I have enough cooling? Are there any parts I'm missing / anything to keep in mind?

I'm really excited to build this and give it a go, and I'd appreciate any input beforehand."
3ajtau,12,2015-06-20,"Astrophysics major, +1 year in a failed startup, looking for a stable programming job, where to start?",Hi_Im_bob___,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ajtau/astrophysics_major_1_year_in_a_failed_startup/,"Greetings,

I was an astrophysics major ('14) and in my first year, I took the risk of participating in a business startup that failed over a year. I was the manager and headed the company for HR, but due to unforeseen circumstances with my partners and the nature of the business, it folded in few months time. I learned many things, including how to build a website, mechanical engineering skills, finite element analysis, sales generation, and marketing, but it was really too much for one person to handle for such a short time that I was extremely frustrated by their lack of output to put ourselves out there for a good product while they just moved onto to do something else.

Anyways, I am currently learning programming to see if I can break in, and I don't know how I'd do. I barely know C++ and Javascript through CodeAcademy, with some basics down flat in Python, but I'm concerned about how I'll look infront of future employers. 

I'd like to get into a stable, long-term programming job with possibility of growth and so far I like what I'm learning, but I need a job by the time August rolls around. What kind of projects can I commit to look better for presentation? Should I design an app I have in mind, should i get a certificate, and how should my astrophysics major part play up? I did well in my advanced courses in the later years, but the few years prior to that I struggled with many low grades and emotional problems. 

I thought about going through internship if I had to, but I'm hoping to find some companies out there that can ""guide"" me up. If geographical location helps narrow down the search, I live in Minneapolis. 

Thanks in advance, looking forward to the responses soon."

3ajykh,3,2015-06-20,"My [20F] roommate [20F] not doing her share of the cleaning, running out of ideas",plzclean,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ajykh/my_20f_roommate_20f_not_doing_her_share_of_the/,"I'll put the tl;dr at the top since this is so long:

**tl;dr: My roommate won't do her share of the cleaning in our apartment; we have a couch drenched in cat pee, kitty litter on the ground, dishes that aren't being done, and trash that is overfilled and I can't do it all. What do I do?**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background:**


I've been living with my roommate (we don't share a room, just an apartment) for two summers and since the beginning of the school year. We've been friends for about 3 years, since the start of college, so we decided to live together. She's what I would consider one of my better friends and in the group of people that I hang out with regularly. So I'm trying to not mess with that.


Before this year, during the summers, I'd have issues with how she was cleaning but since it was summer and I was only working I'd compensate for it. Each summer either I or her was barely home too so I guess the mess didn't bother me as much as it has this year.

We've been living at this apartment since September 2014 and our lease is up mid August, after which point I'll be living alone at a different location. During the year I've done my best to keep everything clean but I had a moderate courseload and was spending 20-30 hours a week working and on extracurricular activities. This summer I'm studying for the MCAT and taking summer term classes so I'm busy studying most of the time. She  is working 40 hours a week at an internship less than 15 minutes from our apartment this summer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Problem(s):**


The apartment has gotten bad enough this summer to the point that I don't leave my room except to get food. It's not usually not a large amount of things making a mess that's the problem, just that she leaves in really unhygenic states. The apartment we signed a lease on together this year allows cats and she brought hers with her, which has made the cleaning problem exponentially worse.



The cat pees on everything. If you leave it and it lays on it, it will end up smelling like cat piss. The couch is to the point that if you sit on it for too long you should probably change whatever clothes touched the couch because the smell seeps in. Of course, you can smell it when you sit on it too. Her room (which I don't frequent) also smells of cat pee, but since we don't share that's less of a problem.



She tried to deal with this problem by putting in two litter boxes for the cat, but this has just lead to two parts of the floor of our apartment (the entry and in front of the bathroom door) to always have kitty litter that the cat kicks up there. Its not really possible to avoid it, so I end up walking through it multiple times a day.



She doesn't take the time to clean out the litter boxes, or change out the cats water regularly (its often yellow), which I'm sure isn't helping with either of these problems.
 


Aside from all the problems with the cat, she also doesn't do her dishes regularly. This has lead to three fruit fly infestations and an ongoing ant problem that I've dealt/am dealing with. She leaves food out too, at one point there was a kettle with coffee still in the bottom sitting out for 2 weeks growing visible amounts of mold in the kitchen.



Finally, she just doesn't take the trash or recycling out, but instead chooses to overfill it. She considers this both of our responsibility (which it is), so if she took it out last time she'll overfill it until I see it (I'm not always home) and have to reach into the trash to put some into a new bag. She also doesn't wash up in the tub after shaving or pull her hair of the drain, so I have to do that before I shower unless I don't want it to drain or to step in what I assume are pubes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**What I've tried**


During second semester I tried to do my best to her dishes/tidy up the apartment for her too. She wouldn't come home except at night, so I just assumed she was busy, even though she had a lighter credit load, wasn't working, and wasn't involved in any extra curriculars. This ended up a lot of time onto the housework I already did, and she never acknowledged that I was even doing things for her. The 3-4 times that she actually did my dishes, I made sure to let her know that I appreciated it... but the 30+ times that I did hers she's thanked me once.



I've tried talking to her about this situation multiple times. Usually when I tell her to do a specific chore (ie, you haven't been doing your dishes! They need to be done today!) she'll do them, but then will revert right back to what it was before. Even though this works, I don't have time to try to chase her down every day and tell her what she needs to do. It's almost more tiring to nag her to do it than to do it myself.



I also tried talking two weeks ago about exactly what she should be doing and how often. At that time she promised that she'd wash the couch when she got paid on Friday (three days later, we have paid laundry in our building), and that she'd start sweeping up the kitty litter regularly, claimed that she rarely left dishes in the sink, and said that she forgets that she leaves hair in the shower. She ended up not doing any of these things (except sweeping up the litter once), and got angry at me when I brought up the fact that she still hadn't washed the couch, that there was still kitty litter on the ground (she actually claimed she'd been sweeping. I didn't know what to say, there was obviously litter still on the floor), and that there were dishes in the sink.



What do I do? Am I doomed to do her chores until  I move out? Or should I just deal with it and not leave my room? All I want to do is be able to relax on my own couch, use my kitchen, and be able to walk through my apartment without stepping in litter. She's one of my friends, so I'm trying to not have her get permanently angry with me for this (like taking her dishes, and putting them in her room)."

Maybe this only applies to me, but allow me to rant anyway.

I moved away from Atlanta for college in 2006, and moved back in 2013 to undergo chemo around friends and family (I'm all clear so far).  Now that I'm up and aware it seems like the ATL has gone through some changes.  What really made write this was picking up the Creative Loafing this week about the music scene and how it's adjusting to the sudden influx of money and expensive development.

Around my teenage/young adult years, 99X was the station to listen to (mainly for Toucher, Rich and the Duplex of Retro Pleasure).  Adult Swim seemed to be the coolest thing coming out of here, and the only movies shot around the city was something with Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton, and the prequel to Dumb &amp; Dumber.  Atlantic Station and IKEA just arrived shortly before my move (at least as far as I knew).

99X, well, most if not all rock radio is gone.  The biggest change might be the huge influx of what's filmed here.  Two Marvel movies, Anchorman 2, the sequel to Dumb &amp; Dumber, Zombieland, Archer, The Walking Dead, The Internship, I know I'm leaving countless stuff out on top of that.  Creative Loafing is still plugging along in print, and Adult Swim is just as relevant and maybe even bigger.

Traffic and public transport is still a headache.

But something seems different to me.  It's like I left home to study abroad and I came back to my little brother finishing his doctorate.  I lived in New York for a year, and I think I'm having a similar reaction to when I met up with a woman in her late thirties in Bushwick, and she marveled at how all the empty warehouses and abandoned buildings were now lofts and gastropubs.

Has Atlanta become like Seattle in the 90s or Portland and Austin now?  Is it a destination city?  What all happened when I went away?"

At this point, I don't know what I was thinking. I think I was looking for love any way I could find it. I was sexually/verbally/emotionally abused by my father from birth to 12, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.

I do think P is extremely interesting, he is an academic (in fact, he teaches at the university I graduated from). I also think he's incredibly attractive, and I love being intimate with him. But I've realized there is literally nothing of true value for this relationship and I'd like to be with someone in the future that is able to be what I want and would be more conducive long-term.

I just feel extremely down on myself knowing I'm this man's girlfriend. And that I live with him and I am completely financially dependent on him. At this point it is almost impossible to move out because I have an internship that doesn't make any money, so I have no source of income and I do not talk to any family (due to all of the fuck-upedness). 

I just feel so uneasy that he would let things get this far with me at my age. I've just had so many revelations in the last couple of weeks because he has been gone across the country doing research. 

I do not know what to do. He's not at all abusive, he treats me like an equal. So I don't feel in danger of being harmed. I just don't have any money, and I don't have any family. I really don't have any friends to help either, seeing as to how my close friends are 1500 miles away.

I guess I'm just looking for any kind of advice to get out of this situation.

Me and my boyfriend are both juniors in college, and we started dating right after winter break last semester. We started off real strong -- we get along really well, our friends like each other, etc. etc. I really feel like I have something special with him. 

This summer I went home because I have an internship in my hometown. He stayed in our college town because he has summer classes and work to do. This has made him very busy -- he is working maybe 30+ hours a week in addition to two intensive courses. Basically, he works, does homework, and sleeps. 

Recently I have noticed that he has gotten a bit distant. He doesn't say ""I love you"" as much. He doesn't initiate conversations very often, or say good morning or good night. He doesn't seem to really care when I tell him about my day or my thoughts -- he will ask, but it feels like he isn't listening. We communicate almost exclusively through text and snapchat, and he often doesn't reply even after he has seen a text. Like, consistently. He replies to maybe a third of my messages. I don't send a bunch -- but I do enjoy talking to him. It seems like he doesn't enjoy talking to me anymore, though. We Skype maybe once a week, and he always acts like he has something that he'd much rather be doing during the conversation. 

I... I really love him. I know it hasn't been a super long time, but I really feel a connection with this boy. I have tried talking to him about how I feel, but he says that I am basically too needy. Things like, ""I'm sorry I can't give you what you need,"" or ""I feel like you always need me. I'm at my wit's end."" All I want is for him to talk to me! There are some days when things are almost normal, and some days where I feel like he's giving me the cold shoulder. It's stressing me out, and I don't know why!  

I'm going up there this weekend to move into my new apartment, and we were planning on hanging out on Friday. I feel like if I get there and he acts the same way in person, then I'm going to have to end things, and I really, really don't want to. I'm scared. I love him so much, but I deserve to have someone who actively cares about making me feel loved. Thoughts? Am I being too much, or asking too much?

I have an internship currently, and I plan on taking another job once I return to uni. I repair computers on the side. I hope to make more from that in the future; that's not more than $1000 extra per year. By the spring of 2015 I plan to have a solid setup of some type of IRA and investment portfolio.

IRA: Roth or Traditional
                
I am young, I plan on contributing at least 2k a year then 5k a year after employment in my field, IT. I have read plenty, but I still think I am missing a key concept to understanding the difference. Is an IRA a 401(k)? What about converting one to another later on in life?

Investments

Should I setup a Vanguard account? Where do I go from there? Mutual funs, ETFs, stocks? What's the answer? From what I understand Vanguard is more of a ""they do all the work"" sort of thing. What if I want to manage individual stocks, E-Trade, Scottrade, Fidelity, etc?

I have read some other posts about IRAs and such; maybe I missed one that more aptly applies to my situation. Anyways thank you to the PF subreddit for any and all help."

As of now only a handful of my close friends know that I'm gay. I've been going through a lot of depression and I've been in some pretty abnormally negative situations in the past year. I've been falling behind in school and my relationship with my family is deteriorating (they're really conservative and I have a hard time connecting with them for obvious reasons). 

Anyway, I just moved to Washington D.C. for the summer via a school internship program that I'm participating in. I decided to start being more open with my sexuality now that I'm so far from home and there is a lot less fear of being outed. Tonight I met up with a guy and we went for a walk in the rain, and I told him I wasn't comfortable doing anything because it was our first time meeting. He turned out to be really nice and I decided I wanted to kiss him. So we made out. 

I'm 20 years old and it was my first time kissing anyone (as I said, very conservative). It was sort of a dull affair, considering I didn't know what I was doing and he kind of just stood there. But I'm glad I have the experience and I'm starting to be a bit more comfortable with myself. We're meeting tomorrow for a movie, and while he is looking for casual sex and I'm looking for something a little more serious I think this is going to really help me get out of my shell and start living my life. 

This community has been great in terms of helping me better understand myself. And I really appreciate the support everyone here provides, I wanted to tell someone about this and gaybros just seemed to be the most natural place to go. Hope everyone has a good rest of their weekend!"

Where some may have it that way, their is nothing saying that they didn't work their asses off, unlike I, and have achieved some sense of accomplishment and success. 

I am the reason I haven't achieved anything so far in life. I'll be graduating with a bachelors this last semester with Cum Laude and a GPA around a B+, there's no reason it isn't an A except I'm a lazy pile of trash. I have an internship and also a job that is less stressful and pays a couple dollars more than my last job, there's no reason that I don't have graduate program already lined up or a salaried job somewhere where I can help my family and pay the bills. Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, I AM better, I should be BETTER, yet I'm just trash trying to make myself feel better in this brief space of time that we call life. I could blame this anger, self loathing, inability to trust, melancholy, asocial, lonely personality I have developed on the last 11 years of depression, the multiple divorces and fights I had to sit through and watch yet never initiated, the pressure of feeling semi-responsible for the upbringing of my four younger siblings (being a father, brother, and role model), yet still not being fully matured myself. But that irresponsible of me to my family and myself.

My inability to act, to care long enough to scope out a better path and/or decision, my flagrant disregard for the ones closest to me, and their thoughts and feelings while I only think about myself, just so I can to return to the normalcy and familiarity that is loneliness and my room just so I can continue to disregard... well everything.

This is my manifesto, my promise to myself and a promise to the poor people who sat here and wasted their precious time on my ramblings. I will do better, I must do better. I will lose this extra weight and gain and maintain a healthy BMI. I will work on and improve myself until I can look into a mirror one day and feel pride for the waste of space peering back at me. I will stop regarding myself as something less than human. I will try my best to practice what I preach. I will spend more time with family and less on wasteful activities like videogames (that E3 Fallout 4 reveal though ;_;). I will not lose my sense of purpose, my morals, or treat anyone less than myself. The other day when I was talking to my mother she told me that I don't have any self-confidence. I thought to myself ""that that's just not true"", I believe myself to be able to accomplish many things. I do, however, lack self-worth. So I vow to place some value on myself and my life as an individual and not just another meaningless cog in the machine. Thank you for reading. 

And if I'm successful maybe I will post to r/progresspics in a years time. Here's hoping I finally act and change everything I need to, to be able to look back on life as a decrepit old man and say it wasn't a waste. "
3al2rd,13,2015-06-21,Why should I vote for Sanders?,ahistoryofnothing,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3al2rd/why_should_i_vote_for_sanders/,"First and foremost, this is not a post to ""troll"" or anything else like that at all. It's a genuine post in which I am completely serious and I want to have a serious thread on. That being said, I don't think Sanders is serious in the least bit, so why should I vote for Sanders? 

Let me explain. 

I have done numerous political internships and I have met various politicians, including Hillary Clinton. I am politically independent and I would say I have voted Republican a third of the time and Democratic two thirds of the time. I have always liked Sanders via interviews I have seen with him it (there's a good one in which he is with Rand Paul on a committee in which he kind of mocks Paul a little, it's pretty good if you haven't seen it). However, only since he has introduced himself into the race that I have started to look what he actually done while in Congress and Senate. 

Honestly, there are two fundamental things stopping me from supporting him: 

1. **You can't actually do the vast majority of things Sanders wants to do as president - that comes from Congress and Senate.** I completely agree with a lot of his stances, but you can't do almost anything he claims to want to do from the presidency. The president cannot introduce a bill. He can only sign it into law or reject it. Given this, I am completely sure that Sanders will veto anything he disagrees with. However, nothing else can really be done except to lobby your fellow party members to sway one way or another. This is one of the most frustrating things I hate hearing from friends who support him. We aren't going to have the kind of socialism everyone is begging for (which I think would be great for the country). It is literally not going to happen. 

2. **Compromise is INCREDIBLY important.** Given the limited things you can do as president, what concerns me isn't the TPP (mostly because I don't think anyone has actually read it; I don't support it because I want it to be read first, then I may support it), what concerns me is that when the budget gets on his desk then he is going to veto it because, guess what - Republicans actually have to be compromised with - and possibly allow a long, drawn out battle like what has sadly become the norm. 

As of now, I have read ""Hard Choices"", ""Living History"", and ""HRC"" and I fully support Clinton. No matter what happens, I want everyone to keep it civil and remember that Clinton isn't actually the devil that everyone makes her out to be. That kind of talk just makes me even more distant from the Sanders team. I am more interested to see what happens during the debates. "

God I’m tired. I am so tired. All I want to do is crawl into a ball and sob on the floor. My head buzzes and my nose is blocked beyond belief. Breathing through my mouth for the last 10 hours has made my breath smell awful, and my mouth taste even worse. I’ve drunk about 6 half-litre energy drinks in the last 8 hours, and I flip between feeling energised and crashing so hard my vision goes blurry. The quite untraceable hum of god-knows-what in every office has become the sound of millions of swarming locusts. I hate this office so much. All I want to do is leave. 

I’m not allowed to though. I still have at least 5 hours of work to do, if I want a full time position at this company, I have to be the best of the interns. I have to want it. The last intern left 3 hours ago, didn’t want it bad enough I suppose. I do. The work they wanted me to do was finished 2 hours ago, what I’m doing now is far and beyond what I was meant to, but I want it. My family needs me to get this job, the image of me going back to our dingy apartment, seeing the five disappointed faces of my mum, grandma and three brothers when  I tell them I didn’t get the job would kill me. 

I have to pee, I’ve had to pee every 20 minutes for the last….the last? I’m not sure, I lost track of time a few hours ago, and my eyes are to unfocused to make out the numbers in the bottom left corner of my computer that will tell me. On the walk to the bathroom I try and take in my surroundings to stay focused. The harsh neon lighting, blinding in the dark of the deep night. The city outside may be beautiful, but I can’t focus, all it seems is a bunch of lights.  This office is so boring, on the floor, ordinary carpet, the type that burned you as a kid when you slid on it. I look at people’s desks, computers, papers, the odd collectible here and there, this is meant to be a “fun” workplace. Big windows, a good view across New York, that’s what you get when you’re a fortune 500 company. The fact no one else is working this late surprises me, surely there’s some other poor soul grinding his guts out here. I know I’m alone, the janitor handed me the keys when he left for the night. 

Shaking my wet hands as I exit the bathrooms, I feel a little better. The water I splashed on my face helped me wake up a bit. It was really cold though, and I feel a little shivery as I leave, nervous almost. Really nervous actually, my hands are shaking. This office is making me bug out a little bit, a lot to be honest. I take a few deep breaths and remind myself not to be ridiculous. My chair makes a pleasant squeaking noise as I sit in it, and it distracts me. After a few minutes of editing a spreadsheet about god knows what I look up. There’s a man in the corner. My pulse skyrockets and I want to be sick. There is a man in the corner, in an office that is locked, and occupied by only me. He’s about six foot tall, clad in mostly black, and a pair of weirdly elegant brown gloves. I have to be imagining it, rub your eyes Jason, sleep deprivation causes hallucinations you know that. I close my eyes, rub them and open them again. He’s gone. Of course he is, a powerful current of relief surges through me, there is no one hear of course, but it’s hardly surprising I would think there was. This building creaks and groans and makes all kind of noises that sound like people. 

The printer whirrs as it spits out performance reports, it’s been roughly an hour since I saw the man. Although I’m sure it was a hallucination, I can’t shake it totally. I remember the time some kids at camp showed me the exorcist when I was seven. My mother couldn’t get me to sleep for an entire week. Chuckling at the memory, I turn back to the main office. He’s there again. Oh Jesus he’s there again. I spasm with fear and begin trembling. He’s making a hissing noise that sets my hairs standing up. A gloved finger creeps up his body, and come to rest at his lips, making a shhhh gesture. I thought it was a man, but I’m less sure now, it seems to have gotten taller since the last time I saw it, and less human. Its body is disturbingly arranged, elbows at odd angles, physical geometry all wrong. I rub my eyes again, trying to convince myself it’s a hallucination. I open them again and it’s still there, back turned to me and walking away. 

In a state of uncontrollable panic, I wheel on my foot and run to the door, it’s locked, the keys are in my desk. I sprint back there. The drawer is empty. My phone makes a dull beep as the out of battery symbol flashes. My last lifeline gone. There is nothing left to do, I’m trapped in here with whatever it is. I’m crying, I realise as my breathing becomes rhythmic hyperventilation. I lay down on the floor and sob, howling as utter animalistic fear overcomes me.
 In the artificial glare of neon lighting, Jason Alexander Peterson realises he is going to die. Or does he? An idea has occurred to Jason, and an expression of determination has become lodged on his face.

 I stand up and rifle through my desk, and grasp what it is I need. I pull myself up and draw a breath. “Come and get it boy” I scream into the eyrie silence of the office. “Come on then, I’m ready” my voice breaks halfway through the ready. I don’t care all I need is for it to come over. It delivers, hissing still. As it rounds the corner, I collapse to the ground, trying to make it look natural. This aggravates it, I crosses the rest of the room with terrifying speed, coming to a stop. I let out a whimper, intriguing it. The awful scarred face leans in closer to mine, right next to my ear. It gently drifts over till its right above my mouth, and extends it translucent, pulsating lounge. I fight the urge to scream as it forces its tongue into my mouth, the taste of decay and rot making me sick, the hissing noise is a thousand times louder now, like a kettle being tortured. The time is now, its body is right above me. The scissors slide out my pocket, and fly through the air into the creature’s chest. I drive them deep, ignoring the hideous crackling noise, it’s like stabbing a pile of leaf litter. The creature howls, an awful, ugly sound. Taking the advantage, I stab again and again, each time more aggressively. The creature has rallied however, and is pushing me off it. It wrenches the scissors out of my hands and plunged them into me stomach. The pain is blinding, and I roll of. The burst seems to have exhausted it however, as it collapses next to me. My shirt is slick with blood and I feel cold.  

As he dies, Jason Alexander Peterson thinks of three things. His family, in their dingy apartment, being turned out by the landlord because he couldn’t support them. Those stupid kids that showed him the Exorcist on camp. He also thinks of the fact that very few people will care that he’s dead. He could think of 20 at most, but he can’t because he’s dying. He is found by a colleague at 6:37 AM on Wednesday the 27th of June 2016. 

****************************************************
 NYPD Incident report
Pertaining to the events of: the evening of Tuesday the 26th June 2016 and the morning of Wednesday the 27th of June 2016

Event/occurrence: Homicide

Victim(s): Garcia, Fernando Joseph

Perpetrator(s): Peterson, Jason Alexander

Incident location: 227 24th street New York, offices of Gordon and Robinson stock trading 

Incident description: *NOTE* account based upon security camera footage viewed by Officer Lopez attached to the homicide department *NOTE* 

Peterson had been exhibiting unusual behaviour leading up until 11:38 in the evening, mostly twitching, and talking to himself, he was however, functioning fairly normally in terms of working and regular trips to the bathroom. However, at 11:38 he became very alarmed at the sight of his colleague Fernando Joseph Garcia using the printer in the office. At this point his behaviour became extremely unusual. He stood on the spot for five minutes, convulsing, believed to be the first obvious signs of a major psychotic episode by the coroner. After this, he used the keys the janitor of the floor had given him to lock himself and Garcia inside the building. He then proceeded to sit at his desk another two hours, absolutely still. As Garcia was working around the corner from Peterson, and the two barely knew each other according to colleagues, this unusual behaviour was not noticed. When Garcia went to exit the building, at 1:42 AM Peterson began screaming at his desk. Severely frightened at the prospect of being locked in with Peterson, who’s behaviour was extremely unnerving, Garcia attempted to smash down the door. After a few unsuccessful attempts Garcia confronted his colleague. Asking him where the keys where, and demanding and explanation for his behaviour. After this, Peterson lay down on the floor, and began to scratch his arms until they bled. Terrified by now, Garcia ran over to his colleague and attempted to talk to him. At this point, Peterson attacked Garcia with a pair of scissors he had in his pockets, stabbing him 3 times in the chest. After a struggle, Garcia stabbed Peterson in the stomach, then fainted due to blood loss, dying shortly after. Peterson also died of blood loss. 

Conclusion: According to the coroner, Peterson suffered a psychotic episode brought on by stress and sleep deprivation. When interviewed, his mother told Officer Lopez, he had a fear of monsters, and used to suffer occasional night terrors in which he became convinced members of his family were trying to attack him. Even once injuring his brother, Tom, with a stapler when he was 12. She never reported it however, as she couldn’t afford for him to see a doctor. These episodes began after he was shown the film, the exorcist, on a camp when he was seven. His behaviour on 26th and 27th of June was attributed as an extreme continuation of these episodes. He most likely saw Garcia as some sort of monster, and attacked him with the scissors in self-defence. An inquiry into the workloads of the interns of Gordon and Robinson trading, as well as several other companies has been launched in order to ensure their employee’s wellbeing is being protected.

3alecl,21,2015-06-21,Thoughts on a intern pocket card?,ankihelp,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3alecl/thoughts_on_a_intern_pocket_card/,"Hi meddit

My class is graduating medical school this summer and moving on to intern year. I wanted to give everyone a graduation gift but I own a negative amount of money. I thought I would make them something useful - a laminated intern pocket card. The idea is a pocket sized card with all the information you constantly quickly look up before you take action. Converting opioids, dosages of common painkillers, antimicrobials etc.

Could interns/PGY1-2 give input as to what they would like to see on such a card?

EDIT: Thank you for all the suggestions! Some really great ideas. I'm hoping to keep this a pocket sized, double sided single page of laminated paper. While a basic approach to EKG and indication for radiologic studies would be awesome I don't think it would fit. 

1. ACLS/BLS algorithms. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
2. A graphic showing an algorithm for metabolic/respiratory acidosis/alkalosis and differential diagnosis. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
3. Common antibiotic indications and dosages, e.g. CAP: Azithromycin 500 mg POx1, then 250 mg PO 4 d or 
Clarithromycin 500 mg PO bid or Doxycycline 100 mg PO bid. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
4. Love the idea of the basic things you need to work through for common inpatient problems /u/Wohowudothat . Sidenote: is there any checklist that I can work off of?
5. Opioid conversion chart. 
6. Common pain management protocols, nothing fancy. 

Any more suggestions?"
3alvid,2,2015-06-21,Good friend passed away and a mutual friend seems to just not get it...,Lord_dokodo,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3alvid/good_friend_passed_away_and_a_mutual_friend_seems/,"I'm sitting here just thinking about all this.  It happened last night, a freak jetski accident.  Another mutual friend is actually looking to lose a lot as well but it also resulted in the death of one of my good friends.  

I'm in a fraternity and my roommates are all brothers.  One of them, historically a stupid motherfucker, comes in last night drunk as shit and bellows out, ""DUDE DO YOU KNOW [blank] IS DEAD"" in this almost yelling voice.  He knows we are all in a facebook group/group text but he comes in and says this because I've come to realize at this point that he will bring up past conversation topics or a hot topic just so he can be a part of a conversation with the rest of the group.  He also does it because he wants to be noticed and is a total fucking attention whore who would die without being in the spotlight.

So after I respond, ""Yes, [dumbass] I am well aware of this happening, it wasn't just posted all over our facebook wall or anything."" I said it pretty coldly so I'm sure he got the message.

Fast forward this morning and I just got off the phone with [blank's] best friend that have known each other since childhood.  I texted him last night when they announced it, but I gave him a call this morning.  He is under the impression that this is a huge and cruel joke and that we are all messing with him and it was not fun to have to tell him that I wish I was kidding but I'm really not.

Then [dumbass] walks in and LITERALLY SAYS THE EXACT SAME THING IN THE EXACT SAME TONE.  At this point, I've about had it with his mundane and pretentious shit so I told him that ""YES [DUMBASS] I AM IN THIS GROUPME AND I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  STOP BRINGING IT UP LIKE ITS A FUCKING JOKE."" 

Then he proceeds to call me an asshole for not wanting to talk to him.  This guy is literally like a 5 year old child in a 300 lb body and has not a single clue about how social interactions work.  He doesn't even walk in and say ""morning"" or anything.  Almost with a grin on his face, he walks in and says ""DUDE DO YOU KNOW [BLANK] IS DEAD"" almost peeing himself with excitement at my response.  This guy gets off from leading conversations but when you really look how he starts his conversations, it's really just recycled bullshit from conversations 2 weeks prior.  He'll bring up an old conversation topic during quiet moments just so people will be talking again.  I can't really put to words how annoying this can be, but after being around it and noticing what he's doing for the past 6 months, it's made me quite sour.  Now, to top it off, one of my good friends died and this dumb hulking motherfucker prances around asking me if I fucking knew when he definitely knew that I knew just so he could have an excuse to say something to me. 


tl;dr if you don't have something smart or productive to say, just keep your god damn mouth shut because when you say things for the sake of saying things, then 90% of the time, people will see your bullshit and cringe and think you are a dumb socially inept moron.


____________________________________

Re-reading this and it kind of sounds ambiguous.  Let me expand:  

This is the guy at every party who says they just killed a handle of alcohol and threw in 5-6 beers while they were at it (I am half his weight and have gone shot for shot with him and barely lost--there is not a chance in hell that he can finish an entire 1.5L of alcohol.  he got drunk as piss after 8 shots but when no one can verify, he will walk around with an empty handle just so he can tell people that he drank it all)

He is also the guy who says he gets only with 7-8s but never sees him with a girl and his past ex girlfriends are usually around 4-5s.

He is also the guy who gets a summer internship and makes a little money and pretends like he is a CEO of goldman sachs and just cashed in a $5 million check.  

He is also the guy who brags about all of his connections but when you really dig deep into those ""connections"" they are really just him knowing ABOUT someone else, not actually knowing them, and really aren't a connection afterall.

These are not analogies, they are ANECDOTES.  He has done all of this shit in the past and continues to do so I don't know why he is in my life but I am about done with him and, in retrospect, having him in my life has only put on more stress than relief.

This guy is the epitome of try hard and I am quite an observant person, especially when I choose to, and I have noticed that this guy is truly deep down just a piece of shit that wants acceptance from others but never will because of his stupid attitude and his tryhard personality.  A blind person could see how hard he tries (and fails).  A fucking dead person could see it.



Nothing will top off this.  Everytime he approaches me and starts this conversation, I know I'm going to be mad as hell by the end of it.  He recently started to invest using RobinHood, which allows beginners to get started with as little/much cash as they want.  He knows like 5 technical analysis methods but he acts like hes the fucking stock broker of 2015 and will come up to me EVERYDAY telling me to invest in some shit 50m market cap stock.  I humor him and ask him why he thinks i should buy in and he proceeds to give me some elementary 10 year old version of why I should buy that stock ( I think a 10-year old could convince me better than him).  He tells me its because of so and so and just hearing him talk automatically makes it clear that he has no idea what he is talking about.  

So I tell him, well I'm not sure I'm very convinced and I usually lie about not having any freed money.  Basically his investment strategy is to randomly choose some company that he heard about on CNBC and then buy it everyday and sell it everyday.  He has picked up GEVO on about 8-10 different occasions and ALWAYS brags about his earnings but I can tell when hes had a bad day cause he won't come in and say anything to me.  But if I prod him about it, I'll learn that he just lost $25 on GEVO.  But then he turns around and says to other people ""that he's made some decent money off investing so far"".  He also uses his $1000 balance on his portfolio as a bragging chip, which isnt really that impressive.  The average person makes that money in like a week."

A couple of notes that might influence your interest:

   * Stylus is missing. No clue where it is, I'd be willing to go buy another one for your convenience but it will have an effect on the price.

   * Box for Alpha Sapphire is missing. Think it got tossed out in the house fire I had a couple of months back.

I might have Pokemon Black 2 laying around, I'll see if I can find it.

I'm asking $150 for the 3DS + Alpha Sapphire. If I find Black 2, you can have the whole bundle for $170.

3am2bs,0,2015-06-21,"Me [24 M] with my Fiance [26 F] of almost 8 years. I think I may have been being abused. Ultimatum was given in Feburary due to her weight, causing her major health problems.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3am2bs/me_24_m_with_my_fiance_26_f_of_almost_8_years_i/,"Edit : I'm SINGLE

Hello everybody, almost eight years ago my fiance and I started dating during high school. We've had maybe 3 large arguments since then, all of which have led to us trying to split but we always recovered.


I believe she has been emotionally abusive and physically abusive but I have tough skin and the abuse never got to me. At the time was also depressed, with anxiety over change, and desperate because an attractive girl was giving ME, a socially awkward and morbidly obese WoW nerd attention and sex.


Starting at year 2 my fiance gained close to 100 pounds, I didn't care due to being fat myself but while I was fat, I did not have health problems caused by weight like she did, for example a bad back, bad knee, and being extremely lazy.


To really start, I'd like to talk about my percieved abuse, I'm sorry it is do detailed... I wanted to be as through as possible.
Emotional - at the start of our relationship she had a guy trying to date her who was always calling her and texting her. It was causing us major problems, so she agreed to talk to him and get it to stop. She never did and I had to take matters into my own hands and talk to the guy. He stopped eventually but she always used it as a weapon to get what she wanted since I had only female friends.


A year later my best friend said "" lol, I love you"" on a facebook post. I was informed that I could no longer talk to her because I had asked her to stop talking to that guy, I complied because sex! This started a downward spiral of losing all of my female friends, I was left with my girlfriend and my sisters boyfriend as the only people to talk to. I began to have issues communicating and was petrified of talking to any female.


06/11/08 - we graduate high school. As a graduation gift I am given a brand new car. My girlfriend absolutely loses her shit, leaves dinner, and doesn't come back for hours. When she comes back she complains how it isn't fair that I get the car and how I am so spoiled because I got a car and her parents had made poor choices in life and couldn't afford to even care for her... my dad had bought her a used Honda civic five months earlier, made her pay 1k out of the 4k that was owed and gave it to her as a graduation gift. Sure it wasn't new or shiny but he had no obligation as she had been living here rent free since October. At this point in time I am still in a puppy love phase of the relationship.


8/25/08- we start college at a local community college, she tries to talk me out of going and instead going to work at walmart full time so we can move out, because she wants kids. I go for two semesters, skip two semesters because I thought walmart was a good choice. During this time she refuses to use condoms or birth control, luckily one of us is broken sexually and no pregnancys occur.


Thanksgiving 2011- I buy an engagement ring. I accidently leave the reciept in my glove box and she finds it. Gets upset due to not spending more money, I did the three month ""rule"" but at a Wal-Mart wage. She then proceeds to ask me to give her the ring... every hour for days, I finally cave and at that point I am so mad I just throw the box at her, that is how we got engaged.


11/20/11+2/25/12 - Uncle and Grandmother die.
My fiance calls to tell me while I am working that my grandmother is doing bad in the hospital, I didn't know she was in a hospital. She tries to guilt me into getting a quick marriage so my grandmother could see it, I flip out and have the biggest emotional breakdown of my life... a week later my grandmother dies. I am absolutely devastated by my grandmother's death, she was my favorite adult and I was her favorite / only male grand child. I repeated inform my girlfriend that I cope best being alone, she ignores my requests.


08/25/12- I have graduated with an A.S in sciences, I now must drive 45 miles each way to attend school. She gets super upset that I have to go that far and tries to talk me into finding a job and starting a family. She is currently working at a small retail store making 26k/gross a year with benefits and retirement options. I continue with school but the arguments increase due to being at school 12+ hours a day with bad cell reception. She gets pregnant sometime in here due to refusal for condoms and I'm still a horny piece of shit with no self respect, luckily for me it miscarried and shortly after my penis stops being in control.


April/2014 - I have finished my first two years of my B.S with a GPA of 2.00~. I have been hounded relentlessly to spend time playing video games with her while I should study. Or spend time watching movies, I know for a relationship ship to work that this must happen, but I had gained close to 60 extra pounds since the start of this relationship, when I had already been morbidly obese. I had no energy, I couldn't concentrate in school, and I could barely drive without passing out. I question leaving her to try to go out with my former best friend whom I was not allowed too talk to, this causes a huge argument where she was going too move out, but I was a little bitch and begged for her to stay.


June/2014 - I start a research internship. I am informed that I must pass a physical within a month to be accepted into the field research part of the job, so I hit the gym and diet. Within a month I have lost 35 pounds due to excessive cardio and a rigid diet. I get paired with an older woman for field work, my fiance is not happy that I am working with as woman, but has no say and I ignore her.
August/2014- internship complete, I have lost 60 pounds, I am more confident than ever, more social than ever due to being forced to communicate for work. For my birthday I request she makes me a belt, she gladly accepts but I have to pay for the materials because she is giving her labor, I accept. She informs me that it will be done by November, so I can wear it during my research presentation, while not a big deal it does hurt to not get a present from the one you love, especially after spending countless hours finding their present, and spending three weeks of pay($210... yes 70 per week at the time). As I type this now on June 21st, over 10 months later, I have not got my birthday present, I am salty.


The first week of my senior year, I talk to the first person I've ever talked to at the school which I had already attended for 2 years, Serena is her name and she is in everyone of my classes. Serena is following the typical marriage path of waiting until marriage for sex with her long term/ long distance fiance. My fiance gets jealous that I am talking to another, demands I stop because I might cheat on her. I dont stop talking to Serena, instead I give my phone to my fiance to allow her to read all of my messages daily. She begins to trust Serena and my chain is loosened. Fast forward to the end of the semester... Serena, Matt (only important because of being a male, otherwise there woukd have been more female drama), and I have written a grant to perform field research as a group. The three of us are spending roughly 16 hours a day in constant communication due to insane deadlines and studying for finals. My fiance gets jealous and starts requesting me to spend more time with her... I refuse because I am attempting to get straight A's, because I had an amazing oppertunity at Kansas State for grad school, if my senior grades were good, again she repeatedly tells me that she cannot wait any longer for kids, which I understand, she had urges and need but I had made it known that I do not want kids until I can support a family, argument ensues, we agree to have after baby after two years in a PhD program, luckily I do not get accepted


February/2015 - My fiance I'd starting to have major health problems due to her weight (5'5, 225lbs) I give her an ultimatum that she lose weight or we cannot be together because I need to know my wife will be able to have enough energy to help with chores, with kids, and at the end of the day not whine that she constantly tired, I know it is an asshole move but I handled it as carefully as possible offer to be her workout buddy AND offer to teach her how to cook healthy, on my dime. I am informed that she loved me while I was fat, so I must love her while she is fat... I agree to this but inform her that I was not having health problems while I was fat. I get threatened with her leaving me, and God damn I didn't accept... she informs me that no one will ever tell her what/when/ how much she can eat... but she will start a diet. This diet consists of sweat tea for every drink, and then maybe skipping a large bag of popcorn every night.


At school, I make friends with five more females, they are all very physically attractive but I am a committed man and I would never cheat nor try to cheat. I become very close with one of these ladies, we both have dark senses of humor, humor in which I haven't been able to use due to my fiance not liking it. Me and this girl joke constantly, making fun of each others ineptitude, calling each other whores, generally trying to be assholes each other but there is no chemistry. At this point in time I am very confident in myself as I have lost 90lbs, gained a large amount of muscle, and started to be able to concentrate. My GPA is resting comfortably at a 3.88 for my senior year and I have friends!


May/June/2015- No weight has been lost from fiance, she is talking about marriage still, and doesn't acknowledge our ultimatum. I start pushing towards my final cut from 180-165lbs. During this cut my fiance is getting more jealous, requesting I spend time with her and not work out as often. This would be easily accepted except spending time with her involves Teen mom 2 or Reba (tv shows). She has stopped helping with cleaning chores, which I don't mind because I am an expert cleaner and unemployed, however the problem is that she has lived with my parents and myself for SEVEN years, rent free. My parents kind of expect her to pull her weight... shocking I know. I pick up the slack late at night/ when parents are at work and give her the credit...


Physical/money abuse -

Physical abuse is rare, at least for what I can recall,  I've never been bruised or made to bleed. It tends to always come from her over reacting if s tickle her or poke her. I have been slapped, primarily in the arm, for poking her. She had attempted to slap me in the face but luckily I am quicker than her. I have been kicked for tickling her, and not as I was tickling when she was jerking around, afterwards. 

She also has anger problems, no one is sure why it started. Her anger and constant complaining has stopped me from playing video games as she now plays with me and the nerd rage is strong with her. I am unable to play games such as WoW because she refuses to let me have alone time to play and will ask me to do stuff, such as get her a water

October 2007 - my puppy dog love+ chance at sex costs me roughly 2400$ in dinners, dates, and dresses in a one month relarionship.... yes I had fucked up.

December 2007 / valentine's 2008 - requests a promise ring for Christmas.... and I fucking do it. Valentines day is earrings. I stop bowling in a league because of her insisting that she takes our 4th place on the team. She is verbally abusive calling me an asshole I try to assist her in improving,  I am told I don't care when I try to let her learn on her own.


July 2008 - I start a job at Wal-Mart with good hours and decent pay for being s full time student. Dates resume constantly, I am broke constantly with 700$ of credit card bills monthly that I can barely pay. She is now trying to find a brand new car, because I got one... her car is in perfect shape but is a 94.

November 2008 - requests we move into an apartment because my parents have a rule that she must be in school to live here for free, we can't find one. At this time she is making close to 24000 a year and spending all of her money on stuff, I assume fast food as she is gaining weight but never has new clothes or accessories. What money I do not spend on my paying my credit card, somehow ends up being used on her for makeup or fun.

June/2009 - admits she has a sending problem, denies it shortly after but does start saving money.
December/2009 - spends her $4000 on Christmas / stuff??? I end up paying for a majority of Christmas gifts
December 09 - May 2013- randomly buys 200$ shitty smart phones... her 94 civic has been neglected, as I knew nothing of car repair and she just wanted to abuse it to have reason to sell. She is adamant to sell the car instead of repairing... she sells the car, cashes part of her retirement($2000) and buys a 2012 ford Fiesta for that had 30000 miles on a one year old car.... over pays because she tells the dealership ""she needs a car today and loves fords!"" She drives the car for two months, but doesn't like the transmission. I tell her I am okay with her eating the costs of a trade in, because she is making 32k and had just been offered a large promotion.  My one condition that she buys something used, like an 05 camry or civic... she comes home with a brand new Chevy Cruze, with an ungodly interest rate(bad credit) plus she ate the cost of the Fiesta.  She was upside down $10,000.00 after the trade in and had a monthly payment of close to $400.00.


2014 - starts paying her over due bills off, at the minimum payment of a couple dollars a month.  She loses her cushy job but keeps the car.  Gets a job at Wal-Mart making ~16,000 a year.  She is now paying close to 50% of her income for the car, insurance, and gas. She is living rent free with free food.


2015- after the previous pregnancy scare, I'm afraid to have sex, she refuses to use Condoms or the pill, I do not trust her to use the pill. She is requesting that I spend time with her next week at her friends, whom she is house sitting for, for sexy times. I have already refused adamantly!

I am now being pressured for sex but as I have other goals, like grad school, and I am not ready for kids. As you might have guessed, I now notice these issues.

I have grown tired of her constant bullshit, this compounded by the hospital visit a week prior due to straining a back muscle, due to her weight, and me constantly having to baby sit her for the last week as she was unable to walk.


The question:
Am I being unreasonable? I assume I am not but I know I'm not perfect and I know I have caused a few issues myself.

To those of you who have read it all, I'm sorry my grammar is terrible. I am unable to sleep properly due to the stress of this decision and the stress of applying for jobs.  This was also typed on a phone.

What I wish to hear from you guys - opinions on how to end a toxic relationship when you feel badly due to them depending on you and loving someone for so long. She has no family, can't afford rent and food. I know this isn't my problem but I do have a heart, I don't need people to inform me to grow a pair of balls, trust me I've known for years of my inadequacies.


Tl;dr- OP has a soft spot for charity cases, needs advice other than grow a pair of balls. An 8 year relationship with perceived mental, physical, and monitory abuse.  OP is unsure if over thinkin or over analyzing. Advice needed on whole ordeal, specifically if I am justified in my ultimatum.  Also, how to go about ending in when she has no place to go and I am not leaving my parents house to get away from her."
3am69z,3,2015-06-21,Creating a for loop on a button click in Access Forms?,hobbitqueen,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/3am69z/creating_a_for_loop_on_a_button_click_in_access/,"I have spent days trying to figure this out at work, so hopefully someone can help me...

I took a class the first semester of my masters on databases, and we used Access and Visual Studio to create databases and forms used to access those databases. Now I'm doing a summer internship and they want me to create a simple inventory system for their sample lab, which creates a lot of samples and often gives them away for promotional purposes. Awesome, pretty sure I can do that. Well they don't have visual studio on their computers so my professor from that database class suggested using the Access Forms which I am slowly learning how to do. They definitely make connecting to the database easy (something I always struggled with doing correctly in VS) and I have almost the whole system set up, except for one thing...

My form looks like 3 combo boxes, a button, a text box, and another 2 buttons. The three combo boxes allow you to select the specifications of the sample (size, type, and color) and the first button runs a query to let you know the current inventory:

    SELECT COUNT(itemID) 
    FROM tblItems 
    WHERE colorID=Forms!inventoryform!cboColor 
    AND typeID=Forms!inventoryform!cboType 
    AND sizeID=Forms!inventoryform!cbcoSize 
    AND dtRemoved is Null

I have a date entered and date removed to allow the user to run a query on how many items have been created this month/year in addition to seeing how many are currently on hand. This code works perfectly, except I would love to figure out in the future how to paste the result into a label or a text box instead of popping up with a new table, but that's not really my issue right now.

Then there is a text box and two buttons. The text box is for the user to input the number of items they have created or given away. Then there is an 'add' and 'remove' button. The add button runs a insert into query...

    INSERT INTO tblItems (colorID, typeID, sockID) 
    VALUES (Forms!inventoryform!cboColor, Forms!inventoryform!cboType, Forms!inventoryform!cboSize)

My database dtAdded column has the date autogenerated to current date (date()). This works great, I can add an item to the inventory from my form.

The remove button runs an update query...

    UPDATE tblItems 
    SET dtremoved=(date())
    WHERE itemID=(SELECT min(itemID) FROM tblItems 
    WHERE colorID=Forms!inventoryform!cboColor 
    AND typeID=Forms!inventoryform!cboType 
    AND sizeID=Forms!inventoryform!cbcoSize
    AND dtremoved is null)

This grabs the relevant item with the correct specifications with the lowest itemID and no removal date. If my code is slightly off, that's because I'm typing it from memory but I assure you that this also works. It updates one of the entries in the database to have a removal date, which removes it from my 'current inventory' count query. 

So. This is where I am, and everything is working. Now I need to get the form to run the add and subtract queries the same number of times for the value in the text box. I know if I was in VS, I would simply use a for loop, counting down from the number entered into the text box to zero, and re-running the insert into and update queries every time. But I can not figure out how to run a for loop in Access forms! I can access the little code section of addbutton.click, etc, but anything I type there does nothing. I think I might need a separate event, but I'm not sure the correct way to go about that.

Oh, and PS, my work runs Access 2003 because we're stuck in the stone ages, and I have to turn ""buffer overflow protection"" off in the antivirus software when I'm creating forms or else it crashes Access. I have to do this after any time my computer falls asleep. It's super fun. 

**TL/DR: Is there a way for me to run a for loop in Access Forms in order to repeat my insert into/update queries a number of times as specified by the form user in a text box?**"
3am90i,4,2015-06-21,I'm 19 and I've been smoking consistently for 2 and a half years and practically daily for about a year. Am I insidiously ruining my psyche?,ThePentaMahn,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3am90i/im_19_and_ive_been_smoking_consistently_for_2_and/,"Hi all. I am relatively busy and not in the mood to completely go all out on this post, so forgive me for the grammar and any ambiguity. I'm starting to get concerned with my weed habits. I first smoked when I was 15, but I didn't truly get into smoking until I was 17 (junior year of highschool). Until senior spring of high school, I smoked on average twice a week for practically every week. When senior spring hit, I started smoking 4-5 times a week. When summer hit and i got to college I then started smoking practically daily. The longest T break I've had in the last year is 10 days, and besides that I've had maybe five 3 or 4 day t breaks. Considering the last year, on average (so averaging out all the seasons, obviously my smoking patterns deviate between summer and school) i smoked throughout the day probably once or twice (so 4 or 5 times a day), then two or three days i smoked 2 or 3 times a day (so 5 pm till i fall asleep), and then the remaining days i would smoke once or twice (so at night). 

While writing that down, I obviously feel a little shitty about it. However, I am happy/ content where I am at in life. I have a 3.8 after my first year of college (I should have gotten a 3.9 or 4.0 however) and I have a lab internship in place that will last me for the next 4 years. This internship is in field i want to study and I'm very happy with where it will potentially take me. I have a great group of friends (like 10 or so friends that i would call ride or die) and I have a good social life. I've been in a long relationship and I've hooked up with a decent amount of girls in the last two years. I also am in shape and I have cared for my appearance through fashion and lifting. So I guess what I'm saying is that despite my weed use, I feel like I am in a good position in life and have not completely succumbed to the negative effects of weed use. 

I used the word completely because i obviously feel its effects. There definitely is a haze, there definitely is a loss of motivation, there definitely is addiction and fiending, and it definitely exacerbates pre-existing self-esteem and anxiety issues. Some of these issues are masked by my adderall script, which significantly helps me with motivation and escaping the haze. I got this script in December. I ""used"" adderall probably 2-3 times a week without a script during first semester of college and practically daily for the last semester. I am still using it daily despite it being summer. Furthermore, i used it 3 times a month during senior year, prior to stopping after college applications. I ""love"" adderall, but i dont know if I actually had ADHD (definitely do now due to weed use i think) or if its just masking the effects of my weed addiction. Also, not so much anymore, but there have definitely times of ""deep"" depression when on adderall (nothing suicidal but just a complete and utter lack of energy and emotion when i'm coming down). Furthermore, it hurts my eating habits, which isn't too bad, but I should be eating more considering that I'm lifting and my frame is still relatively skinny (5'7 140). I'm concerned now that i'm mutually addicted both adderall and weed. Coming down from adderall fucking sucks without weed, so whenever i take it I always want to smoke at least at the end of the night. Furthermore, I can't really be truly productive without taking adderall, so I'm stuck in this addictive cycle where I have to do both to function and feel right.

Anyway, enough about adderall. The addiction to weed sucks at times. When i have nothing to do, it's very hard to control myself and not vape or bong and just play a game of league or make a beat. I have money, so I always have weed and I also have a $350 bong and a $250 vape, so i'm getting very zooted very efficiently. I have realized that smoking during the day is bad (ruins any productivity, makes you tired, forces you to nap at absurd hours and ruins your sleep schedule) so these moments have become less rare, but they are definitely still there. I also just can't imagine myself being in a social circumstance where I don't smoke, besides with family or with a girl i'm on a date with. That is kind of bleak to me and I don't know if i like it. Smoking also exacerbates my anxiety and self-esteem issues. Last semester I had an anxiety attack in one of the dining commons because I was really high and I thought that 400 people were commenting and ridiculing me for how high i was. I also get very critical of my looks when I'm high and often times think I'm fucking alien or ugly as shit. Since then I've been seeing a therapist, and she told me that I've had preexisting anxiety issues and that they came out this year due to these attacks. She's helped me get my anxiety and self-esteem under control, but it still sucks that weed subliminally makes these two things worse. Lastly, I can't really underestimate the haze, but i really do not know how bad it is at this point. I have smoked daily so often that the haze is just a fact of life, and I do not know what feeling sober for an extended period of time even feels like, so i cant really compare it to anything else. 

Looking at this post, it seems obvious that i should just quit, but weed has transformed my life and has given me so much happiness. Prior to smoking, I had no stable group of friends, i had no social life, and i believe i was a less interesting, less ""cool"", and a more narrow minded person. Weed has played a part in so many happy moments, and has played a large role in why the last 3 years have been the best years of my life. Furthermore, I am still on a fruitful path and I still have the drive to succeed. I can't imagine quitting: I am so addicted to weed, every single one of my friends smokes practically daily, it is so ingrained into my social scene, the comedown from adderall, generally addictive personality, etc etc. I guess what I'm asking is do i have to? Will my IQ drop so significantly if i continue that I will be a shell of my former self? Will i lose all of my drive? Will i be an emotional wreck? How sustainable is what I'm doing? Thanks for any and all comments and advice. Sorry for the grammar, I'm not great at writing and i just woke up. "
3am9e6,1,2015-06-21,Have you ever wanted to play in a CS:GO league? TEST POST,[deleted],CompeteLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/comments/3am9e6/have_you_ever_wanted_to_play_in_a_csgo_league/,"Hi, I’m Noble, the founder of [CompeteLeague](http://competeleague.com/) and we’ve been around the League of Legends scene for almost two years now, completing several tournaments and giving a professional experience to a wide variety of players. Today, I’m proud to announce that we are expanding to Counter Strike: Global Offensive officially. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted CS:GO league, we’re hosting 2 month leagues for Silver 1-Silver Elite Master and Gold Nova 1-Master Guardian 2 that are open to all. More info below. Launch date should be around Late Summer, leave your email at [competeleague.com](http://competeleague.com/#page5) to get more info when it’s available, and if you’re interested in helping out you can apply for a role on our staff here: [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6)


**About CompeteLeague** 

First and foremost, we promise not to use your computer to mine for bitcoins. CompeteLeague launched 2 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition. We had only 1 league featuring 8 teams. We had 4 casters and only about 10 people on staff. Needless to say, it was very hard to run, and quickly we learned to be more prepared and to plan out our structure. Following our first successful season we had a chance to broaden our staff and host 3 leagues at the same time, featuring a total of 24 teams. Our staff had grown to over 30 people for North American League of Legends. We tracked player’s stats, helped them on game day, and answered many, many questions. It required long hours of work, and it paid off. It was a very fun and successful season. Recently we’ve taken some time off to improve our service across the board and create a much improved environment for the players, we’re now expanding from only featuring League of Legends in North America to European LoL, NA LoL, and now NA CS:GO. 


**What We Need**

Our CS:GO expansion is just beginning so we need people who are willing to volunteer their time to help create an awesome competitive environment for lower bracket CS:GO players. We have needs for casters, admins, moderators, game day managers and more. If you’d like to help but you’re unsure about what you can do or would like to do, feel free to message me on here, ask in the comments, etc. Please note that all staff positions are not paid and completely volunteer based, if you would like to help please visit [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6) More information on the staff positions can be found below.


**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for CS:GO will be as follows:

Silver 1 - Silver Elite Master | Gold Nova 1 - Master Guardian 2 | TBA
-------------|----------------|----------
Thursdays | Fridays | TBA
5-10 PM Central | 5-10 PM Central | TBA

Leagues are being developed and are scheduled to start late this Summer.


**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for nine weeks, and will be streamed and casted. Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | CT | T | Map | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 |de_cache| Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 |de_cache| No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6| de_cache| No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |de_mirage |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 |de_mirage |No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 |de_mirage |No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 |de_dust2 |Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 |de_dust2| No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8| de_train| Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| de_train|No (1)


Our Open Leagues also run for 9 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in -1 point. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners happen over the space of 4 weeks. 


**Pricing**

Unfortunately, for Counter Strike, we will have to charge for our services due to the costs of dedicated servers and anti-cheat software that is exclusive to CS:GO. It’s against our business model and desires to charge our players, but due to the costs of operating in the CS amateur scene it’s necessary here. All the money from teams will be invested back into competeleague to cover those costs with any extra going towards prizing, upkeep of the site, and improvement of services.

Our first estimates have it at $37.50 per team to participate ($7.50 each for a team of 5, or less if spread out with substitutes), which covers a full season’s worth of playing, including playoffs (a total of 13 gameplay weeks from when you sign up). No matter when you join, the cost will cover the same amount of time for playing. Even if you join halfway through the season into the Open bracket, your team pays the fee and you’re ready to go. You’ll enjoy playing the rest of the season, and playoffs (if you qualify), and it will cover the first weeks of the next season, until the join point of the previous season. 


**Qualifying**

For teams signing up for the first season, there will be a qualifier tournament for each Premier League, the top 10 teams will move onto the Premier League, while all other teams will participate in the Open League. This tournament will not count towards the 13 weeks of gameplay paid for, and will just be to seed the Premier League teams for the first season. After this tournament all new sign up teams will be entered into the Open Leagues and have to qualify for Premier Leagues through promotion.


**Smurfing policy**

We have two years of experience with similarly formatted leagues for League of Legends and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly, to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be very effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion.



**Cheating policy**

Cheating has been a notorious problem for every league and tournament hosted in Counter Strike. We will be using the best anti cheats that we can find and every game in our premier leagues will be monitored by a CompeteLeague moderator. When games are reported for cheating in premier and open leagues they will be reviewed and judged by multiple moderators. In the event of a player cheating the player will be permanently banned from CompeteLeague competitions, and teammates will be banned for two seasons. There are a few exceptions to the two season rule, such as if the teammates of the cheater report him to CompeteLeague staff and we have enough evidence to make a ruling, they will NOT be punished, however all wins from the time the convicted cheater played on the team will be defaulted to losses regardless.


**Transparency policy**

Unfortunately, there are always conflicts with competitions of any sort, and there will almost certainly be cause to restrict services or ban players from our site. Every single punishment will be documented publically with reasoning and evidence. We will never ban a player without reason, and without giving information on the punishment. 


**Prizes**

Each tournament will be prized, and will include prizes such as Steam cash, rare skins, cases and keys. For CS:GO we don’t have the specifics about our prizes yet, but we will NOT have cash prizes, all of our prizes will be based around Steam or the game itself. 
 

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be doing a case opening giveaway. Throughout the stream, you’ll be able to enter the raffle (opening at random times during the games) and we will open a case, and whatever is opened is given to the winner of the raffle. Whether it is a Karambit Fade or a Glock Bunsen Burner. In addition we have plans to give away moderately priced skins to the MVPs of each week.


**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run the first season. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being Dominic ‘Sata’ Roemer who now casts for Riot in the Chinese LPL) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. You can apply [HERE](http://competeleague.com/#page6). The different positions we have for volunteers are:

- Admin

A position as administrative staff behind the scenes of leagues, organising casting schedules, managing team disputes, handling staff and ensuring broadcasts go smoothly, and more.

- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails casting at least 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so it’s likely that we’ll hold tryouts for casters depending on how many applications we receive. 

- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred, but past experience is helpful but not necessary, we have graphic work for many different levels of skill.

- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

- Writer (currently not-listed)

CompeteLeague is also going to be expanding into hosting articles covering our leagues, eSports, and further topics. The article submission system that we’re looking to build and set up is still a while away from being completed however, so this position is not currently listed. However - Soon^tm.

**What Makes us Different?**

Experience. We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always try to reach out to orgs, offer to help (with advice and cross promotions, as far as I’m aware we’ve never shared casters?)and share casters, things of the such, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We’ve had a long time to prepare our site and our staff for this upcoming season. Hopefully you can be a part of either helping the site, or playing in one of our featured leagues!


**FAQ**

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). The Open League, (any number of) teams can join at any point in the system (and be playing within a week), and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. 

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

There will be a feature on the site, if you’re in a league you will be able to request a reschedule, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team MUST accept the reschedule request. Your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time, however we know that emergencies happen, and we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. (we should have a discussion on how to handle rescheduling at the next manager meeting, just to figure out the best system for it.)

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There will be a free agents feature on the site, where you will be able to sign up and include yourself. Teams will be able to see you and add you on steam from the site and send invites to their team. (also teams can meet there and team up to join)

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new rank.

*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in leagues for multiple games with CompeteLeague.

3am9xo,0,2015-06-21,Microsoft do not want feature suggestions and bug reports for their products?,[deleted],microsoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/3am9xo/microsoft_do_not_want_feature_suggestions_and_bug/,"This is not the first time that I've spent far too much time trying to find the appropriate place to make a feature suggestion or bug report to Microsoft. Surely there should be a website for customers to do this? Its a blatant example of the disconnect between their developers and their users. How do they actually know what users want when there is no way to tell them.

My current issue is exporting some data from an excel spreadsheet. The application I'm exporting for expects string values to be surrounded by double quotes. Exporting as csv just gives the strings. So I added quotes to them manually, and now when it exports it replaces the quotes with three quotes. ""hello"" becomes """"""hello"""""". An alternative solution to this would be to export it as json, a pretty common data format these days, something an intern at microsoft could probably put together in an afternoon, but still excel does not support exporting this format.

So once again, I'm finding myself in a position where I have to look for a product that does what I want it to do. Or as a developer myself, a product that is open source that I can contribute the features I need to. While I'm at it, why is visual basic still the only macro language for office? Surely C# has proven mature enough to be integrated.

Anyway, enough time ranting it's time for me to find a solution."
3amaw0,10,2015-06-21,"My (22M) gf (21F) thinks she is a burden on me and, no matter how many times I tell her she's not, she still insists she is.",hubda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3amaw0/my_22m_gf_21f_thinks_she_is_a_burden_on_me_and_no/,"Some background, we have had a great relationship so far, right now we're long distance (about 2.5 hr flight) but in August we will both be back at our respective schools and will be a 4 hour car ride away. We both have a year left of school. 

She took a break from school in September 2014 to study abroad and then take an internship from January-August but will be going back after that. I am taking a summer internship close to my home. Our respective homes are a couple of towns over. 

At one point a couple of months ago, she started thinking she was a burden on me. I don't truly know why but I suspect it's because she doesn't have many friends in her area so she relies on me for someone to talk to. However I am not always available so I can't always talk. I do pick up and ask if I can talk to her when I'm done though. 

I love talking to her and we talk almost every night (Skype 0-2 times a week depending in the week. She's not a burden on me at all and no matter how many times I tell her she brings it up again within a few weeks. 

Yesterday though she said she was feeling really upset and didn't really want to talk for a few days. She didn't want to say why though. Later in the day she said she felt like a burden.

We didn't talk at all today but I sent her a couple of text messages. I don't want to bother her too much because she doesn't really want to talk.

She's flying over to me next weekend and I'm flying over to her for the July 4 weekend. After that we don't have anything planned until mid-august. We wanted to, but she's busy almost every weekend until then and she said it would be exhausting. 

My question is, how can I convince her that she's not a burden on me? Just saying it doesn't work and I'm really not sure what I can do from a plane ride away. 

TL;DR: Long Distance Gf is persistent in thinking she's a burden on me because I can't always drop what I'm doing to talk to her (I think that's why anyway). How do I show her she's not?"
3amedz,33,2015-06-21,"29 year old 2nd bachelors CS student, some questions about finding an internship",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3amedz/29_year_old_2nd_bachelors_cs_student_some/,"I'm 29 years old and currently just about halfway through the Oregon State post-bacc program. I'm eager to start applying for internships and have been working my way through Cracking the Coding Interview. 

I live in a small city in a southern state that isn't exactly known for its tech sector. I'm most likely going to have to relocate to find anything and, to be honest, I'm pretty eager to get out of here. I'm not necessarily looking to move to one of the coasts (though I'm certainly open to that), so I'm fine with major cities closer to my current region, and I don't really care about working at a big name company at all.

How likely am I to be able to find an internship out of state? Obviously I'd like to have my relocation paid for but if that's not very realistic I can move myself out of pocket. 

I know I've completely missed the boat for 2015 summer internships but how common are internships that don't start during the summer? Ideally I'd like to be starting something any time from August to January but I can wait until next summer (when I'll be finishing up my degree) if I don't find anything.

Is the fact that I'm a former English major pushing 30 going to hold me back? I've done really well so far and I think I could handle most of the interview questions/tasks that I've read about but it kind of scares me that I'm going to be competing with people nearly a decade younger.

I've had one phone interview that didn't go so well, mostly because I wasn't really prepared for it. The biggest issue the interviewer seemed to have was that I was doing a second bachelors instead of a masters. He kept asking me why I didn't just skip straight to the masters and didn't seem to like my explanations. Is this going to be a common occurrence?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm mostly worried about finding a way to get myself an internship out of state so if anyone has any experience with that I'd love to hear about it."

FB msg a lot and texting too. During the winter semester at school, he finally landed his dream internship with one of the Big 4's (software development field). The internship is about **3 months** long. I'm on the East coast, he's on the West coast.

&amp;nbsp;

We had talked about how to cope and how to keep in touch and keep the flame going. I had a few breakdowns since and due to my past online relationship with a cheating guy, I have trust issues and I still do now. I find it very difficult to cope with when my bf is out and about town with his new friends (women and men) almost until midnight on the weekends. I know he is def not the kind of person to do cheating but I always end in doubt after pushing away those thoughts. 

&amp;nbsp;

We did try Skype 'dating' and Skype calls daily and some messaging, yet it doesn't seem to satisfy me. I had a small scuffle recently over Skype and talked about it. We only talked in the morning and decided to leave each other some alone time to recuperate from the upsetting talk / anger. He doesn't want it to become a responsibility to talk to me, he wants to enjoy talking to me but I can't help to feel that I'm a low priority on his list. 

He recently moved and because we talked about me visiting him after his official moving in to a studio, I was supposed to get his new address and figure something out together so I can visit. That didn't happen yet, he told me that he would link the proper address soon as possible and that was forgotten when he decided to go chat and hang out with people there. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want some **serious** advice, from those who have made it work. I want this to work and he does as well. I feel like I'm going insane, I guess being jobless at the moment and not having many friends doesn't help. 

**tl;dr**: Bf is away for 3 months, I feel low priority - wanting to visit but have no info as of his whereabouts and no plans yet. He says to link me the details soon and forgets when he hangs out with his new friends. TIPS NEEDED."

3amoqk,27,2015-06-21,Two Steps Past Tomorrow - Interlude #1,[deleted],HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3amoqk/two_steps_past_tomorrow_interlude_1/,"Excerpted from *Full Speed Ahead*, Science NOW! magazine:

Light, as everyone who has ever watched an episode of *Cosmos* knows, is the fastest thing in the universe. But given the enormous size of the universe, even something zippy as light is agonizingly slow. For example, a single photon traveling at 186,000 miles a *second* takes just over 8 minutes to cross the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Photons and their brethren can only do this because they exist in the realm of subatomic particles with zero mass. Trying to accelerate anything larger - say, a space ship weighing several kilotons - to that speed would take more energy than several Suns could ever produce in their lifetime.

But assume for a moment you could accelerate your ship to light speed to cruise the interstellar medium. Stopping would be a problem. As the saying goes, it’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end. And in this case, also killing everything else that happened to be in the general vicinity as the shockwave from your travels kept going, crashing into whatever planet you were planning on visiting. Sort of like your cousin Benny who stayed for that one weekend and set fire to the couch, blaming it on the cat who never liked Benny in the first place.

While physics says that *matter* cannot exceed the universal speed limit, it doesn’t say anything about *information* - which is how quantum dot technology works. These amazing things can now be found in a variety of products, sidestepping the rules by existing in a kind of ghostly ‘twin’ phase, two identical particles maintaining the same energy states at all time, no matter how far apart they might be. Einstein rightfully called quantum mechanics “spooky action at a distance,” and his words have never been more true. Combine these ‘q-dots’ in the right way, and you have an effective wireless power transmission to and from anywhere on or off the globe - the holy grail Nikola Tesla had been searching for just before his death.

If you pack enough of them in the right configuration, apply the right amount of energy at exactly the right time (among other things), you can not just sidestep the rules, you can duck out for a quick smoke before anyone notices. As long as you take the proper precautions, of course.

Otherwise you’re going to need a towel or two to clean up the mess.

Much of our modern world owes its very lifeblood to Nikola Tesla and his intuitive understanding of electricity. Many say that he was a man out of time, his genius so far beyond his peers that he had difficulty interacting with the mundane world, resulting in much of his work being lost. We should consider ourselves lucky that this time around when another Serbian genius ushers in a new era, that he is far removed from the reclusive tendencies of his predecessor.

Zoran Nikolajević looks like he should be playing violin while conducting a full orchestra. Instead, we are standing in front of a chalkboard as he explains his theory and how it makes space travel not just possible, but practical. It takes some effort - Zoran is a demonstrative Serbian, prone to slipping into his native language and shouting, excited about his work.

And he has good reason to be excited. The Z-Drive (don’t call it a warp drive to his face unless you like to be cursed at in multiple languages) promises to open up the universe, bringing untold wonders to our doorstep. Or untold dangers, depending on who you listen to. Indeed, the former superpowers - America, China, Russia, along with their allies - are each planning space navies just in case the next alien race we meet are not nearly as friendly as the Dulutewae.

A century of speculative fiction has reinforced the concept of aliens being the aggressors, coming to steal our resources (or women, or brains, depending on the story), or just wiping us out and moving right in. Most of these movies are reflections of our own history as conquerors, subjugating the natives to take their land or resources (brains we leave to daytime TV). More recently, fiction has taken the opposite approach, portraying Humans as the invading army in search of rare minerals that let us maintain our way of life. Given what we know of other alien life forms and cultures from our Dulutewae guests, the latter seems the more likely scenario. If so, then it will be aliens who tremble in fear as the armored boot of the Human race stomps across the face of the galaxy.

The truth, however, may lay somewhere in between. The universe, as we have found by peering deep into the inky blackness with generations of telescopes, is mind-boggling huge filled with infinite wonder. It is almost a given that there are lots of resources and planets to go around, some of them with life forms that may bring something new to the table.

As long as we don’t run into something worse than ourselves.

The inventor of the Z-Drive (or Z-Gate, depending on who you talk to) cheerfully admits that he got part of his theory from a children’s television show that debuted in 1963. The iconic blue box of BBC’s *Doctor Who* has groaned its way through more than a dozen lead actors and a thousand adventures. Along the way, it has acquired its own fan base separate from the show, legions of fans postulating elaborate theories on how it works.

Zoran is not one of those fans.

“Oh good lord no,” he chuckles. “I never watch TV. An intern mentioned it and the name struck a chord. It occurred to me that certain dimensional theories could hold the key to rapid travel. We already know that faster than light travel is possible,” he adds, referring to the *Jewel of Paxs’wan’l* that brought the Dulutewae here. “The trick was figuring out how to keep things from falling apart.”

Falling apart, indeed. It turns out that ignoring the laws of physics is not without cost. Moving from point A to point B in an instant requires the use of alternate dimensions where concepts like distance are meaningless. The downside is that these other dimensions also have completely different rules defining what things should be composed of, turning normal matter into a soup of subatomic and quantum particles. Based on the limited observations of the *Jewel*’s star drive when it was in operation, it is now believed the transition display was this effect in action.

And this is Zoran’s second stroke of brilliance: leveraging the same q-dots that power the system to anchor a tiny bit of our reality within a protective barrier long enough to make the transition. A shell that then pops through a dimensional gap, only to reappear elsewhere - much like a web bar of soap that you have squeezed a bit too hard.

Controlling where it lands is the next great trick, and one that the Mars laboratory should be answering for us very soon.

I have just finished a CS-focused high school in Romania. We have the prestige of the first Computer Science high school in Eastern Europe and one with very good results in competitive computing.

That said, I've gone through probably the equivalent of university first year of curriculum in 7 years, sometimes even further. As a computer geek, I played with almost anything that I came across with and sounded interesting. x86 assembler programming, ZX BASIC, Turbo Pascal, C#, Java, Scala, the Plan9 operating system, rule-based machine translation, turtle graphics, esoteric programming languages. I have been and still am a Linux user for 6 years.

I have practical experience with C++ for problem solving, PHP, Python (mostly for scripting, but I've used Django and Flask), Javascript (Node.js, Meteor.js, Socket.io), MySQL, NoSQL (MongoDB, limited experience with RethinkDB), CSS (basic bootstrapping, media queries etc.) and HTML5.

As a soon-to-be international student, I need cash to pay the rent and common living expenses (some ~ $1-1.5k/month). For the past months, I have tried doing freelancing over Elance, with roughly $ 4k made from January until now.

But it is not the pay that I despise, but the kind of projects I get to work on and ridiculously long hours that are by no means sustainable. I took part of two internships during high school, and I enjoyed a lot working with technical people, as opposed to computing-illiterate clients. It's not that the latter are by any means bad in a way or another, but I feel like I'm more productive in a coders environment. Also, working by your own is a somewhat isolating experience.

It would be really nice to find a stable entry-level job, even for a smaller salary, but where I can find stability and work that leads to meaningful stuff. Now, without a degree yet, a CV doesn't tell much about me. I don't have much of a portfolio either, and haven't focused on any stack in particular.

The acquaintances in the same situation as I am that have found a job have done it through clients over Elance. While most of the work I do now is through recurrent clients, I haven't come across any circumstance in which one of the clients could land me a job.

I'd be much grateful if you guys would give me some advice? Would contacting individual start ups that I like over the phone / mail be a solution? Submit a CV for regular jobs and hope for an interview? Start an SaaS and hope for the best?

TL;DR: stable income as a remote entry-level programmer with no degree?"

I am in charge of making new Windows images, and I want to know how to do it legally. We certainly can't afford 350 licenses, if only 6 or 8 of them will ever have Windows on them at any one time. And many weeks, none at all. I believe there's an enterprise program but I think its more money than we can spend.

I'm currently graduating from High School and will start an internship in a tech company this summer. At first my plan was to at least get something done about my anxiety &amp; mood issues but yeah I somehow ended up with this. 

I've got the job and they wanted me to introduce myself so I wrote everything (I wrote crap) and sent it together with a photo of mine that doesn't look too good but was probably the best I had made of me. Somehow I feel a bit weird about the people there looking at this. Furthemore I'm really worried about the first day, I have terrible social anxiety and I'm pretty certain that the first day is going to kill me while the other days might but don't have to be equally stressful. I was at the company already once and was very shortly introduced to some there and yeah I was really awkward... When I left I was stuck with my ""I'll kill myself"" mantra which I don't mean literally but gives me short time relief from the stress.

Now I was wondering what I have to expect like in general? Is it usual to have a meeting in a smaller company to introduce someone or will I just be introduced to two, three people there and then somehow get to know the others? Is there any way I can prepare myself so I don't black out or something?

I know I should see a therapist/psychiatrist to get help with my mental health issues but I just really don't have the time for that right now -_-

3an5ja,5,2015-06-21,I'm [30/M] trying to deal with elderly parents and a grandparent.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3an5ja/im_30m_trying_to_deal_with_elderly_parents_and_a/,"
I don't know where else to ask this.  I read /r/askreddit 's rules, and it seems like it's for jokes and other silly things, so I hope this counts as relationship advice.


I'm about 30, the youngest in my family with two older sisters whom I never speak to.  One is a severe alcoholic that simply cannot be trusted or counted on for anything.  I mostly just pretend I don't know who she is.  The other is married with three children of her own,  I won't go into the details of her life, but needless to say, she is busy with her own things, and possibly in denial of our present situation.


Introduce the parents;  My mother (mid 60's) has dealt with a rare form of cancer, in fact several forms, for the majority of her adult life.  She has suffered from seizures making her afraid of leaving the house.  She will not leave the house for any reason other than absolute necessity (ER visits, and so on).  She has been this way for 20 years.  She has limited mobility, and to me is suffering from severe depression, anxiety, and so on.  My father is in his early 70's.  Around 40 he had a heart attack and several bypasses.  He's had several heart attacks since then, in addition to diabetes, neuropathy, and a yet unknown neurological condition that I would say is something akin to dementia.  It's like he has the mentality of a 6 year old, including the ""I know better"" attitude, attention seeking tendencies and all that comes with it.


I joined the military immediately after 9/11, mostly to escape I guess, but also to maybe escape poverty by earning a college degree since the military was essnetially the only way for me to pay for it.  After being discharged I worked for a short time but lost my job due to the economy at that time.  I thought it would be a great opportunity to attend graduate school.  I did the preparation and got into the school I wanted, but before starting my father had another severe heart attack, limiting his ability to function.  Mainly drive.  With my mother unable to leave the house, and my father's terrible health, I unwillingly decided to start a different program at a school near them.  Hey, I can save money on rent and whatnot, good idea right?  Wrong.


More recently my grandmother (my only living grandparent) became unable to live on her own.  She was living by herself for many years prior, which I don't think was a good idea at all.  She is worse than my mother.  She now has severe dementia, is afraid of new people, leaving the house, she has panic attacks, no bladder control, basically no rational thought aside from the occasional memory or funny story.  She requires 24 hours supervision.  For a few years I would visit her every other day, bringing groceries, handling anything she needs, and that sort of thing.  But since her dementia has worsened (it was like it happened over night..) Myself and my mother decided she needed to come stay with us much to my fathers resistance.


Now I just don't know what to do.  I really don't.  I am a student that barely earns enough money to eat.  I've put my graduate studies on hold for about 3 years now, only taking the occasional class because I am busy dealing with the elderly.  When my grandmother was moved in, I decided I need to seek a real job, but with a big gap in employment, my particular field, that has proven difficult.  I also feel like quitting now will mean I never return to finish my graduate degree.  I have been getting by with just the little bit of money that the government grants me while I am a student, and I have taken out a small student loan.


The past 6 months have been even more hectic, and I have not been able to take any classes at all, so I essentially have no money.  My mother, father, and grandmother are both legally disabled and on medicare.  Their home is payed for, so fortunately it's enough to get by on.  The cost of medical equipment and supplies, things like diapers and diabetic supplies, as well as food electricity and all of that consume their income.  I make 3-4 trips to the doctors each week, pick up all their medication, grocery shop, clean, do minor cooking, and anything else I can do which takes up almost all of my time.


I guess lately I have been depressed myself and didn't really think much about the sitaution.  I think my father will pass away any month now, he makes no effort to do what the doctors tell him, and gets angry when I basically force him to ""eat something healthy"" or ""take medicine"".  It's like he feels as though it's an attack against his masculinity or role as a parent when someone suggests or forces him to do something.  His last heart attack required surgery, afterwards the doctors suggested he go to an assited living facility for a few weeks so he could get physical therapy (he can't walk anymore), and whatever else he required.  But he simply refused, and instead came home.  He literally does nothing.  He just sits around in the same position all day, requesting my mother to shovel food directly into his mouth.  It's absolutely pathetic.  With this, his child-like attitude, I have just lost all respect for him.


My mother does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to my grandmother's daily requirements.  My mother has no business doing this with her legitimate disability, and honestly, I have come to realize that my grandmother has no business being here.  She needs more care than we can provide her, but a care facility is too expensive and she has just enough mental capacity left that she would be really upset over it anyway, and besides, I don't think my mother would ever send her to such a place.


I am left to manage these three people as best I can, without actually having any actual control.  But at the same time, I cannot leave.  If I leave what happens?  I've been kind of compliant with anything that anyone asks of me for the past few years.  Putting school and work on hold, and just dealing with this, and I want to just run away.  It didn't really occur to me until recently.  A girl I have been studying with asked me on a date and I wasn't sure how to react, I've been too busy to think about dating anyone.  But as much as I wanted to, I just couldn't go.  I can't afford it, and I wanted to tell her so bad, but I don't think anyone will understand.  She left for an internship in another state for a few months and we still talk every day.  I guess we both expect to date when she returns, but I am just afraid of that day coming.


I don't know why I'm really writing this now.  Looking up at the last several paragraphs, it just looks like a lot of whining, and I'm eating, I have a roof over my head, so I shouldn't be complaining to anyone.  But I just can't get over this terrible feeling.  All I have ever wanted to do was get an education and not be poor.  But I can't even do that now.  I've kept some money away to move away when I graduated, when it seemed like that was a possibility, but I've since spent it on living expenses.  I have a student loan payment due next week since I have no time to be in school, (time to stary paying), and while it's only a 1500 loan, I can't even make the 50 dollar payment that will be due now.  Yesterday I went to one of those places where laborers go to find work, waited in line at 4am until 2pm and there was no ""daily"" work.  I can home and my grandmother had pooped herself, didn't tell anyone and tried to handle it herself, making a huge mess.  My mom almost lost it because of all this, and was trying to handle the situation, and my dad, well, he just lays around criticizing other people, so that's what he was doing.  Needless to say that whole day was wasted.  I tried it again today, and earned 45 bucks but that + coming home to this is too much.  Fortunately I found someone looking for some programming help on reddit, and that will earn me a hundred bucks provided they actually pay me the second half when I am finished.


I just want to leave.  I just want to do whatever it takes and just move anywhere.  But I can't.   What can I do?  I don't know what my options are.  I can't get any sort of in home care, there is nobody I can turn to for help, I simply don't know what to do anymore.  I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, I guess to just get it off my chest and hear what everyone else thinks.  Am I a terrible person for feeling this way?  I feel like I am pretty aweful, and that I should love my family (which I do), and do what it takes to take care of everyone, but this is ruining my life.

Where should I go from here?,clbgrdnr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3anets/me_m19_and_my_ex_f19_where_should_i_go_from_here/,"This past year has been the best time of my life; largely due to me getting a girlfriend. I started talking to this girl at highschool as a friend and slowly started developing feelings for her. She was with someone for over a year before me, but it was more so a friendship than an actual relationship. She went with this other guy to prom and it really hurt me, because I liked her so much and I knew she liked me at that time too. Long-story short: she dumped the guy and told me about it, then me and her seriously started talking. A week later and we were dating.

The problem with not being together until senior year summer was that I was going to a school 5 hours away in a big city, while she was staying home and going to community college. I was scared to be in a relationship and then leave to go to school, but me and her felt like we wanted to try to date until the end of the summer. 

Last summer was such a beautiful time for me. Her and I went to Florida with my family. We walked on the beach and I fell even more in love with her. Everything felt perfect and like it was going to last forever. We had sex for the first time in Florida. It was her first time and I am grateful that she shared something so special with me. I really wish she was my first, because she is my first true love. I've never felt this way about anyone before her. 

That entire summer we spent almost everyday together. Made love. Talked about how much we loved eachother. I always had made fun of the idea of a ""true love"", and I feel like I am a fool for not believing in it before her. Then August was in full swing and I was gearing up to go to college. We were supposed to break up then, because neither one of us wanted to hurt any more than we had to. We decided against breaking up though, because both of us felt like we had found our other half (I know we are young, but sometimes you feel like you know).

School was tough for me this past year. I tacked on 18 credit hours of nothing but high-level math and science (engineering discipline) both semesters. I was really starting to struggle at this time. My grades were going down slightly, I would do homework for 5 hours, and would have difficulty getting up to make my early class because I had been up to 2am doing homework. I was averaging 4-5 hours of sleep. The only thing that sometimes kept me going through the homework was that I rewarded myself after completing my homework by skyping her. It made me so happy.

My girlfriend wasn't really the social type though. Very much a homebody. She really didn't have anyone besides me and her mother, so the entire time I would be doing homework she would be worrying about what I was doing and waiting staring at the phone for text messages that would be scattered throughout the day. I felt so guilty, because she wasn't going to college and didn't get the college experience of being in a dorm with friends. Luckily, I was blessed with having access to a train in my city so I could come home to see her and my family. The train ride was 6-9 hours long sometimes, but I would take the journey alot so I could be with her. It costed $260 for a 10 pack, and financially I couldn't keep coming home after the first semester even though really tried to. 

I guess the distance must have changed something in her, because she was so happy when I would come back from school on the weekends. So when I finally came back it was just ""Oh... /u/clbgrdnr is back"". She said that she kind of lost the feelings of longing for me. During Finals week I couldn't really talk to her either, so she started talking to a coworker [M/19]. I guess because I wasn't giving her the attention she needed, but the finals were 35% of the grade for my classes and I was struggling in Calculus II and Physics. It was the difference between passing or failing. I don't think she understood what I was going through and how close I was to fucking up my classes, because I never really wanted her to worry so much about me. I wasn't putting her first, because I was so worried about school and knew I had to make good grades if I want to provide for the family I wanted to make with her.

I performed to the best of my abilities and got away with grades I couldn't have pulled off if I wouldn't have focused so hard. I was offered an internship too for $11 dollars an hour, but I turned that down because it costed too much to live in the city by myself and I really wanted to come home to be with her and see my family. This summer was supposed to be perfect. Everything was set up perfectly. We were to attend summer school together taking the same courses, and she got into my school! I was so excited that we were going to be together in the city, and I had plans for finding an apartment together close to school and finally living together. 

Her father then got cancer, and she was told that she'd no longer be able to attend the same school as me since it's so expensive. I was devestated more than her I think. Around this time I think she was just scared of me leaving her again. 

This is when stuff started really going to shit for me. She started to really talk to this coworker of hers alot and also became friends with a female coworker [F/20]. I knew something was wrong because we'd be kissing and she'd push me off of her to text this guy. I was so confused and knew something was wrong. I kept begging her to stop texting him so much, and to focus on me, but she just wouldn't do it. Around this time she started bugging me about giving her space and how she needed to hang out with these new friends of hers. Of course she can, but that doesn't mean I didn't  want to text her, or that I'm worried about this guy you say is just a friend. Maybe i was keeping too close of tabs, i dont know. I was so confused about what was happening. I can't explain how I had been acting, I was acting defensive. 

It was like this for two weeks until she started talking about how I don't make her happy anymore and that she just needs space from me. I read her phone and she told this guy that she liked him after he admitted he liked her. I didn't understand why. Was it something I did? Is it me? What's wrong with me? A week after that she and I took a ""break"". I still wanted to be with her though, because it just felt so strange. This was my soul mate. I love her more than I love myself. I went over to her house during the break to talk to her, she'd been hanging out with her new friends and swimming at this guy's pool. She had been alone with him. She told me that she still loved me and wanted to be with me still. The next day she hung out with this guy at his house. She told him that she had to stop talking to him, and how she needed to get back with me. She and him then kissed. She called it a kiss goodbye, but it didn't feel like a kiss between me and her. I was so upset when she told me this. A kiss was something between me and her. I didn't know what to feel. I never looked at other girls, I stayed faithful. I was so in love with my girlfriend that a woman could walk by and the thought that she was attractive never crossed my mind. She was so scared that I was cheating on her in chicago, and I did whatever I could to make it known that I wasn't doing anything like that. And she kissed this guy. We were on a break, but that didn't mean that we were broken up and I wanted her to see other guys. This was supposed to be for her to be by herself.

The next day though she apologized to me and said that she wanted to get back together. I was so hurt, but I know relationships are work. She said it was wrong. I forgave her and wanted to move on with our lives. We had make up sex, we kissed that night and it felt like it used to. Then the next day she was back to doubting our relationship. She later told me that she couldn't stop thinking of this guy the entire time, and how she didn't want to go back to being unhappy with me. I still don't know what I do to make her unhappy. She says that her friends and her job are what make her happy, and I don't really fit into that equation anymore. I just don't think she knows what she wants, and all I'm wishing for is that she wants to be with me. Two days after we had gotten back together she broke up with me again. At this point I have been betrayed by the only person I have ever truly loved and I have also lost her as my best friend and confidant. She went 180 on me and changed as a person. She still tells me she loves me and hopes to get back together in the future. I just don't know what to think. I don't know how to act. I'm making myself sick. I haven't eaten and I haven't told my family but I have been having chest pains, headaches, and I haven't been sleeping. I force myself to eat til I puke. I count sheep. I take sleeping pills to try to help me relax. 

I'm a logical person, but all my logic went out the window it seems. I know what I'm doing to myself is wrong. I need to work on myself, but how can I not be upset when she's talking to someone else? How do I let my first love leave me? 

I'm a proud person, but all my pride left with the thought that someone else is better than me. I think I'm intelligent, I treat her like gold, I've never purposefully hurt her, and I got a wonderful future lined up. I think I'm an awesome person, but Why is this guy better than me? What does he have that I don't have?

I'm acting like an idiot. I'm scared this guy is using her and I don't want her to fall in love with someone else. All in think about is her night and day. I'm crying for hours on end. I know it's wrong. I'm trying to fight this mind over matter, but my body feels like it's in flight or fight mode. I text her mom and friends asking if she's okay. I just am making myself out to be crazy to everyone else. I'm scared of being alone in a world without her. I wanted to marry this girl. She was the one I felt. I know we're young, but I feel like I know what I want. She fit perfectly into my life before this happened. I was and am willing to forgive her still. My thing was that you don't buy a new car if there is only one thing wrong with it. You can try to fix that one thing. If our relationship is done, it's done but I feel like there is still something unfinished here. It ended wrong. I think she feels sort of the same way.

I know what I want out of someone romantically. I want them to return the same amount of love that I give them. I put my entire being into this relationship, and for a time she did too. It was perfect. 

I want someone I can trust, I want someone who loves me and knows in their heart that I'm the only one for them. I think this is where the relationship would be a little sour for me if we got back together right now. She's too random with her feelings. she's unstable right now, and I'm the stable one. She doesn't know what she wants from life, she constantly changes her mind. I guess it's sort of like trying to build a house on the sand with her... but the beach is so beautiful to me. I know it's safer to have two stable people and build your house upon the rock, but I'm just scared and worried for her because I love her so much. I don't want her to go through life, and regret me. I don't want to regret her. I just want her to see what I see. I want to be her rock in tough times coming up with her dad and life. I want to be involved in her life.

I know she's not right for me right now. This hurts so fucking much to say, because of everything. 

So my questions reddit are: Where do I go from here? Should I try to set up dates with other girls? Should I be single for a while? Should I hold out hope that she changes her mind and wants to be with me? How should I stay busy? How do I get my mind off her? Should I be angry at her? If this is it, how do I get over her? How can you open your heart up to trust someone again? Do I avoid her? Do I try to be her friend? 

I have no clue what to do right now, but I know if this continues I'll have wasted a summer hoping for something that never comes and being upset. I know that ill end up in the hospital if I continue this. I just don't know what to do, because I've never had this happen before.

I'm sorry if this is written crapily, I jump around and lot in thoughts and I'm typing on my phone so formatting is bad and spelling errors. Please don't bad mouth her either in the comments, I don't want to see that. 

TL;DR Girlfriend broke up with me after a year. I'm heartbroken. Where do I go from here? 

Thanks reddit."

3anz5x,7,2015-06-21,Skullface identity Theory: What if Ocelot isn't The Boss' son?,TadeusPadron,metalgearsolid,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/3anz5x/skullface_identity_theory_what_if_ocelot_isnt_the/,"Hi, greetings from Venezuela. Like the title says: What if Ocelot is not boss's son? 
We assume he is because of the short dialog with EVA and the statement of The Boss to BB in MGS3.  

EVA explains that Ocelot is the commander of the Ocelot Unit as a type of ""special treatment"" for the legacy of his parents, one of whom was a Legendary Hero during World War II. Snake proceeds to ask which one was the Legendary Hero and EVA responds that she doesn't know since Colonel Volgin never gave her all the details... but apparently during the war Ocelot's mother is shot in the gut and she gives birth to him as bullets are flying past her and her unit and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.

The Boss' speech before her and Snake's final battle explains how on June 6th, 1944, D-Day her and the rest of the Cobra Unit were sent to destroy key enemy rocket installations and during the mission she was injured and gave birth right then and there and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.
2+2 = Ocelot is boss's son. Right? Well, i have my doubts.

Let's check the dialog between EVA and BB after the battle with Ocelot.

*Snake: ""EVA, I wanted to ask you about Ocelot...""

EVA: ""Yeah, I know. He's pretty infatuated with you, isn't he?""

: ""That's not what I meant. Aren't the Ocelots an elite unit?""

EVA: ""Yeah.""

Snake: ""Then how'd he get to be their commander? He can't be any older than 18 or 19. I can't believe he's already a major...""

EVA: ""I heard from the Colonel that he's been given...special treatment.""

Snake: ""Special treatment?""

EVA: ""Yeah. He's the son of some legendary hero or something.""

Snake: ""No wonder he seems to have the right stuff... So who is this legendary hero, anyway?""

EVA: ""Beats me.""

Snake: ""...""

EVA: ""The Colonel never told me. All I heard was that his mother was supposedly
shot in the gut during battle and that he was born right there, bullets
whizzing past them.""

Snake: ""A pregnant women in the middle of a battle?""

EVA: ""That's what I heard. They say that when the stitched her up, the scar was shaped like a snake.""*

Ok, so Volgin said to EVA that the soviets were giving a special treatment to Ocelot because he is the son of a legendary hero. Also according to what EVA heard, Ocelot's mother was shot in the gut, so the birth came early, and when they stitched her up, the scar had the shape of a snake.
Perfect. (Or not?)

Now let's check again what Boss said to BB (sorry for repeating it)
The Boss explains how on June 6th, 1944, D-Day (DD sounds familiar:) ) her and the rest of the Cobra Unit were sent to destroy key enemy rocket installations and during the mission she was injured and gave birth right then and there and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.

Of course, we also know that this kid, the son of the boss, was later kidnapped by the philosophers to control The Boss. (See also EVA's tapes from PW) not even The Boss knew where is son was. So let's assume that her son was somewhere safe where the philosophers could have a constant eye on the kid. 

As the title says, I'm trying to uncover the Skullface identity (At this point you should know where im going) so we need to remember the backstory of this big motherfucker. 

Skull Face lived in a village that secretly repaired weapons in a local fabric. Some ""spy"" leaked the info and that fabric was bombed by their enemies while Skullface, his family and friend were in. BOOM, FIRE, DEATH, and Skullface suffred the serious burns that hide his face. Afterwards, he became prisoner and blabla they tortured him blabla forced him to forget is language blabla new languages, etc. 


Now that I have stated the ground zero for my theory, I will (again) ask you the question: What if Ocelot isn't the Boss's son? 

The soviets thought that Ocelot was Boss' son and thats why they received and put him as the leader of a spetnaz special unit despite the fact of being so young. Maybe the confussion was provoked by the philosophers, while the real Boss' son was kept hidden in some place safe and isolated (SF village). After some folks bombed the fabric, the village is taken, and the son of The Boss kidnapped. The people that captured him also tortured him trying to get information. (About the fabric? (if they recognize the kid) About the philosophers?) As we know, at this date, after the death of the wisemen's comitte and the loss of the philosophers's legacy, the philosphers lost the control of the intern tension and teared the group and the world into three superpowers; America, Russia, and China. They don't have fun for each other. So, wich group took little Skullface? I would say the chinese (EVA worked for them, but its not related.) or the Soviets. Why? Keep reading. They put him in some small village, in a territory controled by them, and he grew there. Skullface mentions in his backstory that his people repaired the weapons so they could have a chance to win the war. The problem with this, is, wich war is SF talking about? There are not a lot of important wars after the end of WWII... ¿Vietnam, maybe? (Under east block influence)The vietnam war started in 1955. Boss' son would be 11 years old. He also, of course, got to be white, so he would stand out from the asian poblation. Now, at this point, we need to remember the past of Big Boss as green beret. Maybe the people who bombed the fabric, were USA. Maybe Skullface child meet with Big Boss then, when the green berets invaded the Village. As I say, Skullface would stand out from the asian poblation, even with the burned skin. There is no doubt that skullface suffred horrible tortures after the events, as we can hear in the GZ tapes. Maybe somehow the American Philosophers identified him as the kidnapped Boss' son, and took him away. After a while, the CIA trained him. He later would found out who is himself, who was his mother, and who is Big Boss: The man who killed his real mom. ""V has come to"" ""Vengance has come to""¿?. Maybe BB, at some point of TPP, will have the chance to explain everything to Skull Face. And Skull Face, feeling that Big Boss is like a kind of older brother, will ally with him with the objective of destroying cypher (founded with the philosophers legacy, one of the main causes of Bosses dead) and the remainings of the philosophers. (From Boss two phantoms were born?sorrow &amp; sf)

Of course, I know this is not the best theory you can find around, but I wanted to share it with the people around here. Cheers!"
3ao22i,3,2015-06-21,"25, with some call center experience with a BA in telecommunications trying change industries and career.",lifechanger88,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ao22i/25_with_some_call_center_experience_with_a_ba_in/,"After two years from graduation with a BA in telecommunications where I thought I had a shot of getting into the telecommunications infrastructure industry since I had a great internship at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia as the Telecom Director's assistant in setting up communications for big events like the March Madness Tournament along with Flyers and Sixers games, but it didn't pan out the way I hoped. 

After graduation I searched relentlessly for 4 months with no job then I delivered pizzas for a good 7 months before I found a temp job in a outbound call center scheduling boiler inspections in the insurance industry. Even then that was a something I didn't want to do but I sucked it up because I needed experience and I couldn't find anything else. Also I couldn't take that pizza delivery job anymore in Pottstown PA. It's been a year and I've been full time doing this call center position as a dispatcher for 4 months now and I just don't see myself doing this as a career and I'm worried that since this experience dictates my career in general. I don't want to be making phone calls all day anymore and I didn't want to in the first place.

Right now I'm thinking about a major career change. During the past year on and off I've been teaching myself web development and general software programming. I know a little but I completed Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS tutorials on codecademy and code school websites. I liked it and I've been strongly thinking about going to school for it with doing one of those coding bootcamps like App Academy and Gschool or Galvanize as they're now called. I've been in touch with a buddy out in Colorado who I'll be visiting next month to see the Galvanize Full Stuck Web Developer program and find out to see if that is for me. He'll complete the program as well next month when I see him when he'll be looking for a job. One of the main problems though is that the program costs $20,000 and I'll have to take out a loan to do it let alone move out of state and find a way live there for the duration of the program (which is 6 months long). However, if I do take that route I want to see if my buddy gets a great career out of it making at least $60,000 like most graduates do before I make that bold decision. 

I also have been speaking to a cousin out in Austin, TX (heard great things about that city). He's an inside sales rep for Office Depot and said he could put a good word in for and I looked at the job description for it and it seems like it's something I could do from my experience with my current job. From what my cousin told it's less phone work, more money($45K plus bonuses) and more time off (28 days paid time off) than what I have now. I need to follow up with him to see if everything he told me holds up true.

I've been also looking around to see what I can do with my degree as a BA in Telecommunications. Market Research Analyst and Economic Development Coordinator caught my eye since I do enjoy researching figures and I feel as though I'm pretty good at since I aced every History research paper I wrote and group projects where I researched demographics of the Washington metro area for a media programming class and my group and I aced that too.

I've been trying to get out of the area I'm in for the past two years now and I need a change. What job titles should I be looking for as a BA in Telecommunications (communications major)? Could I make it as a market research analyst/consultant or economic development coordinator? In essence what can I do with BA in telecommunications? I also don't want to be in a career that will be automated in at least 20 years form now.

Any advice would be helpful and I thank you for all of those that reply back to this post.


**TD:LR - Working at call center for past year, thinking about options in web development program in Colorado, Inside Sales job for Office Depot in Austin TX along with getting into Market Research Analyst and Economic Development Coordinator positions. Need advice for what direction to take.**

I already have a few job offers, so skipping the master's is an option if it isn't worth it. However, during my internships I gained a lot of experience in programming, web dev, working with databases, and statistical analysis software. While it was just the tip of the iceberg, it REALLY interests me, and taught me that I really don't want to go work on the manufacturing floor. So far, I've figured out that web development I can just learn on my own, but now I'm trying to decide between a Data Analytics or Information Systems degree. Basically, I want to lean towards more of working with systems, being able to work with data from how practices are implemented and the data is collected (Industrial Engineering) to being able to write and analyze the data to a database. If any of you can give any insight, I would be very appreciative, as it is stressing me out a lot. Thanks"

My department wasn't hiring, but my supervisor told me if I saw any jobs I wanted at the company to just let her know. I have maintained a friendly relationship with her , we send occasional short e-mails back and forth, I have updated her on my job search and she has sent me internship and mentorships she thinks I would be good for and should I apply to.
Anyway, two weeks ago I saw an entry-level position posted for the company that I used to work for. It was a different department, but I couldn't figure out the exact department it was for, so I sent my old supervisor an e-mail asking if she happened to know anything about the position or if she knew of anyone who might.

I sent an e-mail to another higher up in the company and they responded and said they would put in a good word for me, so I am not worried that I won't get a good shot at the job but I feel uncomfortable that my supervisor never responded, especially because I thought we had a good relationship. I know that she is super busy, so I was anticipating a week for a response (even when I was an intern it would take her several hours to a day to respond to certain e-mails I sent her) but even if she would take a while to respond in the past, she would always respond. I feel like maybe I phrased the last e-mail poorly? Do I send a follow up e-mail or just let it be? If the former, what do I say?? Also am I worried for no reason? Help, I'm awkward."

He helped me get on my feet: we moved out together, he helped me get into grad school, he was helping me get my life in order. 

About halfway into the relationship we started to find that our personalities were clashing. I found him controlling and unpleasant, I'm sure he'd have some choice words about me too. We broke up, which I was OK with, but things took a turn for the worst when I just couldn't seem to get him out of my life. 

After we broke he started treating me like someone he had no respect for. He dragged his feet moving his belongings out of my place, he talked about having sex with new people in front of me, and bragged about how much better his life was now that he was single.  

If these were all tactics to make me feel jealous and low, they worked like a charm. I went crazy upon hearing these things. I became mad with jealousy, and I never felt lower in my life. I admit, I was young and had low-self esteem. It was a recipe for disaster. 

After seeing me breakdown, he happily went along to his new apartment and life, and I was left sobbing in the dust. The harshest fact was that I was now studying the same profession as him, and I ended up working at the same company as him later that year as an intern (luckily, we worked in different departments/buildings).

Altogether, I feel deeply embarrassed at how the whole situation unfolded. He was an asshole post-breakup, yes, but I am more upset at how I responded to his actions.  I wish I could have controlled my emotions and not make it worse, but I am also certain that I did not deserve to be treated how he was treating me. 

EDIT: Here a couple specific behaviours of his that made me lose my mind:

- he passively aggressively broke up with me over the course of two months. This took the shape of emotionally withdrawing from the relationship, not inviting me out to evenings with friends and lying to me about what he was doing. This is a slow cooked hell for anyone who experiences it. 
- he barely helped moving our stuff out of our apartment to my parents' place. I took care of nearly all of and paid for the rental van myself. 
- he took 1.5 months to move his stuff out of my parents place. I was trying to use all my patience to remain sympathetic and help him out while he looked for another place, but instead of moving his stuff out of my parents' place to a storage locker he took his sweet ass time looking for another apartment, but for some reason kept me on the hook. 
- he would come over every weekend and take ONE load of stuff from my parents' place to a friend's house. ONE load, not like, everything. And, every time I would make sure I helped him. 
- I finally lost my patience and told him to get everything out of the house. I did this in the nicest way possible: I said I would help him move everything out over the next couple days. He then proceeded to absolutely loose his shit and berate me over text, including saying he 'wanted to punch me in the face'. 
- He came over that night, took everything from the house, didn't thank me for anything, and left me absolutely bewildered at what just happened. In hind sight, this was a crazy tantrum on his part that really worked effectively: I was terrified of him again. He made me feel intensely insecure, scared and unsure of myself. 
- two weeks after that event, he contacted me to go for coffee. I was expecting an apology, but instead, he shrugged off that event like it wasn't a big deal and asked me to help him build a shelf in his new apartment. I was speechless and walked out. "

Well, I'm actually doing it. And here is how it's going so far...

Since posting the reply, I’ve been receiving emails from all over the world with people asking for help building the HACKberry for their own friends and family.

Realising I'm one guy with limited resources who can't possibly build a HACKberry for everyone, I've been in touch with (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)[https://www.ornl.gov/] (home to several of the world’s top supercomputers and the world’s largest 3D printer) to see if they can print HACKberry’s for as many of the amputees who have contacted me as possible, including (Rosa Moreno)[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/lost-hands-making-flatscreens-no-help] who lost both her arms in a manufacturing accident and was only awarded a $14,400 settlement and can't afford the prosthesis she needs to get back to work. It was an awesome Redditor named Michael who emailed me to put me in touch with Rosa.

Also, just to give you a bit more background, Oak Ridge 3D printed a (Shelby Cobra)[http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/videos/a25659/watch-the-government-3d-print-a-shelby-cobra-replica/] for the Detroit Auto Show in 2014, so the HACKberry should be a piece of cake. 

After a brief email exchange, my contact at the lab (who is a great guy and also a Redditor) has requested a Skype call with me tomorrow to discuss the project further. 

Oak Ridge has also recently launched a summer internship program, so the plan is to task a team of interns with performing structural tests on 3D printed HACKberry components in various exotic materials as a part of their education. This way we'll be able to check the performance of everything from aluminum to carbon fiber.

The plan is then to provide /u/DrSpaceMann's brother with a prosthesis built from the material that proves to be the most effective.

I have also been contacted by a wonderful hand surgeon from Melbourne, Australia who is acting as a medical consultant for the project.

Make wrote a little (article)[http://makezine.com/2015/06/16/open-source-prosthetic-hands-focus-function-personality/] which was cool too.

I will post again tomorrow to let everyone know how the meeting with Oak Ridge goes.

3apxgy,4,2015-06-22,"Not long distance, but we still talk daily/share feelings: Do I wait for him to come back?",climbevrymtn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3apxgy/not_long_distance_but_we_still_talk_dailyshare/,"A few months ago, I (24F) started dating one of my coworkers (21M).  He was at my firm for a 4 month internship and we developed a friendship during long hours at the office, business trips, etc. Nothing romantic escalated until the week before he left, when we got a little tipsy at a going away party and told each other how we felt. 

We went out to dinner, hiking, etc. for that week before he left. Although it was technically only a week, remember that we'd been talking, eating lunch together daily, and traveling several times together for the prior 4 months. So I felt we knew each other as friends fairly well.

When his assignment ended, the company offered him a full time position, which he accepted. The catch is, he has 1 year of grad school to finish before he starts working. His school is 1,000 miles away, so he only comes back to my city twice a year or so to visit family.

When he left, we agreed we would both be open to new relationships (ie weren't going to go long distance etc). We're both conservative Christians and share the opinion that dating is for discerning marriage. Neither of us wanted to pursue a relationship that intentional over long distance.

The problem is we still text every day and talk/video chat every couple of weeks. It's obvious we still care about each other (he's told me straight up that he still has feelings for me, to the point where it's difficult to go out with other women). Neither of us have been with anyone else in the 3 months since he moved away. 

I really do want to give him a shot, but I can't truly be open to other relationships because I can't go out with other guys without thinking about him. So now I feel like even if I'm not long distance with him, I'm still ""waiting.""

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Is there benefit to cutting him off and picking it up when he comes back? Is there benefit to being in this ""limbo"" of waiting?

EDIT: I asked him last week if he wants to do an LDR and he said no, so it's clear he does not want to try long distance.

TL/DR: Do I wait for someone if we're not long distance but still talk daily and have feelings for each other?"

**My current job**
I'm in a job that can lead down many paths. One of those paths is a career that I've been training for since I was 15 - I studied it in high school and university. I have been in this job for three years now, starting off in the ""grunt"" position, and now I'm the lead of my team. I do not enjoy my job that much, but I have a lot of respect for the sector and that leads me to wanting to make us all better at our jobs. I have put time and effort into researching how to be better and I'm slowly getting there, however this can only be successful if the management and higher ups in the office actually pull their fingers out and help me. Unfortunately, they're either afraid of change or are so stuck in their ways that they think change will make their lives harder. I don't know what to do anymore. My team don't care because this job is seen as a stepping stone to other careers - they're right, that's what I'm trying to do, but the difference is I still actually care about the outcome of us doing our job.
I'm also underpaid. I've been hiring people to join my team because of people leaving (promotions, internships coming to an end), and I know full well that one of the new recruits will be earning more than me, despite me being the leader of the team.

**My career path**
As I stated above, I am trying to get a job in the career I have chosen. Unfortunately one of three things could be holding me back:
	1. I'm doing so badly at my current job that they're keeping me here until I get better at it (managing a team)
	2. I'm doing so well at my job that they're keeping me here
	3. I'm not good enough at what I really want to be doing, so I'm being kept here
What makes me say this is that since I've been in my ""management"" role, two people have been promoted to the career I want. One deserves it, I'll admit. The other has not proven to be better than me at all - I've done far more than him and to a good standard. (Don't get me wrong, I really like the guy.) So why them and not me? To me, it has to be one of the above statements.
I also keep getting told I'm going to have cool new things to work on that will help with the career I want, only to find they're given to other people to do, such as the two who got promoted instead of me, because they needed something to do.

**My ""talent""**
Apparently I'm a pretty good writer. I can write well enough to be complimented by someone who doesn't often give out compliments. I enjoy writing when I actually do it, but that's the hard part - actually doing it. I am so fed up at work that I'm finding myself with no motivation whatsoever when I get home. All I do is play games and avoid real life.

I suppose I'm looking for advice, but the one piece of advice I would like to avoid hearing is ""get another job"", as that's not a realistic prospect right now. Thanks in advance.

*TL;DR - People keep getting promoted before me and I'm losing motivation in work and my personal life.*"

Okay, so this is going to be a long one. I’ve been holding off on making a big wordy post until I’ve gotten to this point, so I’m going to be as verbose as I please. If all you want is progress pics [here is a face progression from 2007 to now (up and then back down again)](http://imgur.com/a/T85LC), [and a bit of body comparison, from around my heaviest to June 14](http://imgur.com/a/vawSG), and you can go on your merry way without having to scroll all the way down.

**Part I: What the hell happened?**

Well, an abusive childhood happened. A whole lot of trauma happened. But I guess what *really* happened was I lost control over my life, if I ever had it. My abusive mom had (has) a ton of food issues after being raised by her abusive parents (they ain’t lying when they call abuse a cycle, it completely is), but she kind of failed in passing them on to me. We were very, **very** poor for a long time, and there was a kind of feast/famine dynamic there. We would go hungry for a while, and then we’d get a little money, and it would be immediately blown on luxury. Part (not all) of that luxury would be food, and she would binge, enormously, and I would get dragged in, because she would accuse me of having an eating disorder and tell me that she’d take me to the mental hospital where they’d never let me out if I didn’t eat. When we were really poor, she’d try to buy away the guilt from physical/psychological/emotional abuse by bringing me home **boxes** of dollar store baked goods, because she knew I liked baked goods. I felt like I had to eat it then, because it came out of money that we genuinely did not have. 

There was little to no cooking in our household, ever, because cooking requires having the gas, the electricity, and the water on all at the same time (stove, fridge, dishes/need water for recipes respectively), and that didn’t really happen. When she was employed, she’d be too tired to cook anyways, which isn’t really her fault. I don’t know if I had non-potato vegetables more than once or twice a year, my whole childhood, because 1. They need to be refrigerated and 2. By the time we could afford them at all, I was already firmly a ‘picky eater’. I take the blame for that second one, even if it isn’t really my ‘fault’, because it’s not really anyone’s ‘fault’ and it was my choice to be a dick about food that wasn’t processed to hell, no matter my age.

So despite all this (and there was certainly more to it, but I don’t really want to dwell any longer than I have to for context), I stayed mostly at a ‘reasonable’ level of fat, maybe around 150-170 for a good long time. I was ‘chubby’, and still at that point where if I called myself fat people would correct me just to be polite, partially because we still had the ‘famine’ periods, partially because I was **very** active. I was on the basketball team, then volleyball, then swim team. I was actually a very competitive swimmer, the best on my team, the 2nd best in my whole school district (varsity, as a freshman), and on my way to states.. and then I misjudged a backstroke flipturn (looonnng story, but the flags were different from what I practiced/raced with in my district and nobody warned me for you swimmers out there) and fucked my left knee up GOOD. I finished that race still in 6th overall (against 50+), but I couldn’t get out of the pool or walk. My old coach from the YMCA had to carry me to the car. After that, I took a break from sports and just never went back. I had a lot of shit going on in my life, and I just… stopped going to school, almost entirely. I just barely passed high school and graduated (with honors and as an AP scholar with honors, because those are both based on test scores and not actual class grades), and I graduated at my all time high of 270, which I stayed at for the next 2 years. 


So where am I going with this? I **hated** myself. I didn’t have disordered eating per se (I didn’t, still don’t, and probably never will like eating large portions, I just had no concept of how high calorie the garbage I was putting in my body was or even how calories worked), but I hated my body, I was heavily suicidal, and I just felt weak, fat, and worthless.



**Part II: What the hell changed?**

I was the first of my generation in my family to graduate from high school. I hated myself so completely by senior year, that I didn’t even bother to apply to a single college. I had been conditioned my whole life to believe that college was meant for a whole different class of people than myself… small example: when I was double accelerated in math all through school, my grandmother told me that it would be a really good skill to be able to add numbers quickly (lol not what post middle school math is at all), and that maybe I should consider being a waitress, or a cashier. That’s one of the most sincere compliments she ever gave me. 

However, I always admired my older brother, even though we were never close, because he was a car mechanic (Making him the highest achiever of my 6 siblings). He had something he was good at and he did it, and most importantly, he had almost completely severed ties with our whole family. That was my **dream life**. So I applied to my local community college, which had a program for automotive repair. It was then that I realized that the automotive repair classes required several thousand dollars worth of equipment in total, bought by the students… and that dream died quickly. But I enrolled in other classes, because what else was I doing with my life exactly? Working a bunch of shitty, under the table jobs? Not exactly great prospects, they can’t even go on a resume. I wanted to be better than my siblings and my family. No drugs, no alcoholism, a good, *taxable* job. Really attainable goals. My thoroughly underwhelming (academically) inner city school had given up teaching me math at trigonometry. They taught no further math classes whatsoever, and I had taken trig as either a freshman or a sophomore (honestly can’t remember), so it had been a long time since I had seen math. But something possessed me to enroll in Calculus I, that first semester. I met a professor in that class who actually **believed** in me. He encouraged me to transfer to a 4 year college when I had the funds together to afford it, and I spent almost every day in his office, even in semesters when I didn’t have a class with him, talking about video games, and math, and *very* occasionally how shitty life is. 2 years later, I graduated with the first college degree I had ever seen… an associates in Mathematics. 

I transferred to a good 4 year university, out of town, where I now have 2 majors and 2 minors (yes, one of those majors is math), and I just finished my first year with a 4.0 GPA. I started living on my own, only supporting myself, nobody else. Not having to dread going home, not having to deal with anyone except for the people I chose to include in my personal life.

And that’s what changed. I lost 40 lbs, down to about 230, without dieting or even paying attention to my weight at all after moving away. It just came off, and suddenly my clothes didn’t really fit anymore, and I had a general inclination to keep the whole thing going, but didn’t know how, since I wasn’t about to join sports teams with how unfit I was. One day I found /r/fatlogic, then /r/loseit, downloaded MFP, and have logged every single day since then. My life is better now than I could even fantasize about as a kid. I get up every day and appreciate a hot shower, appreciate fresh food, APPRECIATE the enormous opportunity I have, spending 4 years of my life just being here and learning. I’m already so close to so many faculty members, I’m doing crazy awesome math research as an **undergrad**! I got an internship offer from the frickin’ CIA! People talk about me like I’m a big deal!!! It’s beautiful, and terrifying, and *surreal*.


**Part 3: Yeah, yeah, just get to the weight loss tips!**

Okay, so here’s what I can tell you, in descending order of importance.

1 Count calories. If you can’t count calories because it makes you too obsessive, I recommend pre-planning your meals. Spend a whole day making your lunches ahead of time, leave them in the fridge in little rubbermaids and nuke ‘em. Come up with a few breakfasts that are low calorie that you **enjoy**. I cannot stress the enjoy part enough. Have a general idea of what a reasonable dinner is. Calculate the calories out strictly on these things when you make them the first few times, but you don’t have to log. Make it so if you eat according to your plan, you’ll be in the right ballpark.
	
However, I do warn you that this will give you so much less freedom than counting does - because I count, I can have pizza when a friend orders one for us as a group. I can eat on campus and at restaurants if I have to. I can have unplanned snacks. If you’re doing the meal plan thing, do not allow yourself to snack if you don’t have that factored in. Everything counts.

2 Don’t get stuck in the binary of good food vs. bad food. Yeah, there are foods that are gonna make you feel a hell of a lot better in the long run than others. Don’t force it, though. When I first started, I was eating 1800 calories a day of.. spaghettios, buffalo chicken wraps, frozen meals, chocolate bars, etc. Not exactly nutritious, satiating food, but like I said I never had a huge appetite when left to my own devices, so it worked. Whatever you want to eat, if it doesn’t put you over goals, it’s FINE, especially at the beginning. 

Perhaps more importantly than that, you might surprise yourself with your tastes… when I used to hear friends talking about how they eat fruits/vegetables as a snack, or that they love apples, or cauliflower, or whatever, I assumed they were completely full of shit and that they just hated those things slightly less than other ‘health food’. Well.. now I’m one of those people, and you couldn’t get me in the same room with anything other than a potato less than a year ago. I started being curious about all this stuff I’d never had. I started off small… started cooking my own junk food. Then I maybe added some chopped onion (!! plant matter!!) to a recipe that called for it, and kind of dreaded that maybe I ruined all these expensive (to me, haha) ingredients with vegetables. But it tasted good! Got my standard buffalo chicken wrap on campus, and they accidentally put lettuce on it instead of no lettuce like I ordered. Was too polite/nervous to say anything other than ‘it’s fine’... but I wasn’t about to waste the money. Hey, it actually added some pretty nice texture to a pretty bland wrap! Fast forward a few months.. I honestly made some cauliflower in a little bit of butter the other day, put on some hot sauce, added feta cheese, and it was HEAVENLY. Not “ugh I hate this but moral superiority of eating vegetables” heavenly, genuinely as good or better tasting as whatever else I would have eaten. When I make stir fry, I now have way more vegetables than noodles or chicken in there by choice… because they taste good and bright and diverse. I find myself eating nearly ‘clean’ just by choice now that I mostly cook my own meals and eat what I want! So don’t force yourself. There are definitely things I still hate, but if I try things cooked in a way I’ll probably like, especially in soup or something similar, usually I actually really like them. It’ll come, so just count your calories and occasionally be brave. I guarantee that you’ll eventually start making some choices based on calorie ‘cost’ on your own and stumble your way towards what is generally considered health food without trying to. You don’t need to cut anything out as long as you treat your calorie limit as a hard limit, not as a suggestion (it should go unsaid that you should choose something reasonable! Don’t go right down to 1200/day just because a lot of people do!). Of course, this might not work if you have a food addiction/binge eating.. I understand there are some people who genuinely cannot handle a lot of the stuff that sets them off.
(Side note: as I have less and less bizarrely sweet/processed food, the better veggies taste to me, for some reason. I still hate almost all fruit.)


3 Exercise is really pretty cool, when you’re ready for it. When I was 270, I was very not ready. When I was 230, I was still not really ready. I don’t know if it had to do with the physical weight of my body or whatever else, but I wasn’t enjoying it. I distantly remembered how great I felt being ‘in shape’ (comparatively!) back when I did a ton of sports, but there was no way anyone was getting me near a pool, and running, bodyweight, kickboxing, everything just felt like fucking HELL. I would tough it out, get out my old ‘just one more’ mentality, do genuinely a decent amount of exercise.. but not feel good. I just felt tired, and defeated, and weak, even though I had just done a great job. So I stopped for a while.

Somewhere along the line, and I really do think it was ultimately weight related, I kind of had an exercise epiphany. My body suddenly wasn’t so fat that it was getting in its own way. I could run without my chest feeling tight, or my old knee injury throbbing. I still couldn’t go very far or very fast, but it was more like a hill to climb to get through it, and less like the Mt. Everest of willpower. I remembered what it was like to feel strong again, and I hopped right back into it. I run a ton now, I do bodyweight, I signed up for the weightlifting class on campus in the fall… I relish the soreness again, just like I used to. It feels like a reward to work out now, not some kind of tax I have to pay for being flabby. Not to say everyone should wait until they magically love exercise, but… exercise isn’t supposed to be hell. It’s supposed to be challenging, but achievable. You should feel good at the end. Maybe not nirvana good, but if you dread working out, switch up what you’re doing. You’ll lose weight either way at a calorie deficit. Don’t force yourself and give yourself something to rebel against and resent in your lifestyle.

4 Mirror time. This is gonna be a weird one, and honestly one I’ve never seen posted around before, but it’s something I started doing and I think it really helped me. I didn’t have a really good picture of what I looked like in my head. My weight ballooned up, and I still thought I was fat but reasonable, when I wasn’t. I would be shocked and discouraged by pictures, and the mirror, and clothes, and anything else that tried to touch that delusion. I started giving a lot of power to that stuff, even though I barely care about my looks at all. I just couldn’t accept how big I had gotten.

Somewhere around 220, I started spending time in my apartment just looking carefully at myself in the mirror, usually at night when everyone else was in bed and I could just chill out in my underwear and look. It started out uncomfortable, and I would try to suck in or pose in such a way that I looked less big. Doesn’t really work that way. But pretty quickly, I started to get kind of logical about it. I accepted the way I looked. Not accepted as in HAES body acceptance whatever, but I looked long enough at my (near) naked body that instead of attaching a ton of bullshit to it mentally, I just went ‘okay, this is what I look like’. I carefully inspected. I grabbed fat rolls, moved them around, let them drop back into place. I checked out old scars, watched my fingers wiggle, watched my own gestures and whatnot. I watched the way I look when I tuck my hair behind my ears, when I smile, when I shrug.  I didn’t learn to love my body per se, I more learned that my body isn’t something that is separate from me that I have to learn to love. It is me, and that’s what I look like right now. Even though I still was (and still am) fat, pictures, mirrors, clothing sizes, etc didn’t bother me anymore. They accurately depicted me, and if I don’t like what that depiction looks like, I just have to change a little bit at a time until I am what I want. Now when I do my nightly look in the mirror, it’s more like a maintenance check than some kind of self-therapy. I might notice the beginning of prominent collarbone, and feel happy, because I personally like the way collarbones look, and now I get to see them when I see myself. I might notice that my femurs are disproportionately long compared to my shins, and wonder absently if that’s something that anyone else notices. I might notice my stomach looking a little bloated, and play around feeling the difference between fat and bloat, not really caring about it, because I’m used to those little changes. It’s a completely neutral to positive experience no matter what I notice, because I don’t have this awkward self/body dissonance anymore. I’m not some beautiful soul trapped in a substandard body, I’m a pretty fucking cool carbon based organism with some pretty fucking cool processes going on in me, and my body *is me*.

So yeah, that’s about it. Sorry for the novel, but I hope someone gets something out of my experiences. Thank you /r/loseit, this is such a great community and I would not have made it without the faq and the awesome posts here.

3aq7vo,12,2015-06-22,"[Advice] LC with Nmom, she doesn't seem to get it.",kastacrona,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3aq7vo/advice_lc_with_nmom_she_doesnt_seem_to_get_it/,"I have been low contact with my mom for basically most of this year, up until recently its been pretty much a non-issue. Life just carried on like normal. Lately however, it seems like she might be testing the waters and I want to be ready and maybe get some ideas on what to say to her when it is time, or how to handle this with as little blow-back as possible. 

For some background, I was keeping distance already, but then there was the incident with my Gpas heart surgery(have posted this story a couple times), and later with her smear campaigning her friends to let me know ahead of time, ""So, if they are nice to you...THAT is the only reason why"". (The story she wanted to tell at grandpas surgery, she just forced it on me later at my little brothers football game when it was just the two of us). 

 Here is the short version of the present story : After weeks of NC I made arrangements to take my 13 year old sibling camping. Nmom let it happen, but was short and snotty to me on the phone about it, as though it would in some way be an inconvenience to her, and then tried to steer the convo into how poor she is and how sick of SG brothers shit she is, before making her parting jab of ""welcome to LIFE"" (as though I've experienced nothing of significance) when her guilting and complaining failed to get the response she wanted. Anyway, when I went to get my brother, she was nice to me, but instead picked on my brother in front of me. Nothing that couldnt be dismissed as ""just joking"", of course. The camping trip went great, we had a blast and I took him home when we were done. 

Fast forward a few more days, I get a call from my Uncle inviting me to a fathers day potluck. I told him i was working and he says ""Oh, well your mom was saying you were gonna be her ride out because her car is running shitty"". Interesting, I hadnt even talked to Nmom since taking brother camping. Her car only runs shitty to family events (never has a problem getting to work or to bars), like she wants to force me to go together so it looks like everything is cool between us to the family. She did this on Mothers day too, and Im almost certain she will try it for the reunion at the end of summer. Two days go by, she finally texts me, 

Nmom: Can (brother) and I ride with you again if you are going tomorrow? I also have some info and contact info for internship with (very relevant opportunity in my field) if your interested. :)

me: Im working tomorrow so I cant go

Nmom: Shit my car is over heating worse than ever and didnt want to risk it. 

I didnt reply after that, i thought sweetening the deal with relevant information she didnt just share was a nice touch. Basically, I dont want to have to keep having excuses as to why I cant take her(I did actually work, but I dont want her trying to control me and force me into doing things for her without the basic respect of *asking first* ). I did drive her on mothers day, but she cant just volunteer me to do things for her without even asking me or giving me notice. She made it out there on her own just fine. Going completely NC is not an option for me right now, but I am unsure how to explain my boundaries to her without starting what I've been avoiding. 

Also , for what it is worth, I have had that talk with her where you explain basic courtesy in asking and giving notice for what your are asking about. Back when she was calling me drunk to scream-explain how horrible her bf and friends were being and getting mad at me for not hopping up out of bed to go get her, or coming to my house unannounced at night to climb over my fence and in my window to crash on my couch because *she was mad at her ride and her other friends dont like it when she does that*. She still didnt stop until my boyfriend said something, and then moved in with me. She has absolutely no respect for me at all. Im pretty sure she only texted to ask because she talked to my uncle, who probably realized I was confused since I didnt know she decided I was her ride. 

I hope this makes sense. Its not a big dramatic deal yet, but I have ""that feeling""."

Her uncle worked in another department entirely in another town. He recently got transferred over as the head of accounting where I work. (Accounting) He's gay. I am not. I have zero issues with gay people, however I feel really uncomfortable with this guy because he constantly tries to flirt/send inappropriate messages on Whatsapp etc. He has my number due to work issues, there's about 17 people in this particular department.



I've told my girlfriend and she was really uncomfortable about it. Yet at the same time tried to just brush it off due to the fact she has an extremely massive amount of stuff work related plus her best friends upcoming wedding so she's a busy gal, I'm in the bachelor (group/party) too so that's cool.




Not ten minutes ago, I was in the washroom at work and her uncle was there, no biggie, I was busy wondering what to get for dinner, Mondays gf and I usually go grab dinner and just laze around her place or mine chatting etc etc


I was wearing a hoodie because work is basically in the artic circle, anyway boss asks me something about a cheque made out for some other company then proceeds to grab my dick through my work pants and rub it and says I've been waiting so long to do this, at this point I freak out like what the fuck, go back to my desk, sit and now here I am, freaking out internally and not trying to make a scene.


I should also add I haven't said anything to anyone but the gf due to uncles flirtations stopping for a few weeks till today.



What do I do, I love this job, I'm good with numbers and figures and enjoy working here but I'm feeling so fucking uncomfortable now.



EDIT:- Not a big update so I'll leave it here, leaving work now, 1:45pm to grab lunch going to a nearby police station and filing a report, I should be back at work by 3 where I'll talk to HR. Thanks for the advice everyone especially /u/kallisti_gold for pointing it out that it would be pragmatic to go to the police first. Will make an update later in the afternoon, maybe.  





**TL;DR Gfs gay uncle has flirted with me, I've been ignoring, he grabbed my dick while in the male bathroom at work, what do I do? I feel violated, literally**





Update reposted here:- 


Alright, I know this would be really hard to believe, I went to the station this afternoon. There were a few people around, I went to make my report etc, I had to speak to one of the officers in charge, now I'm a tall guy, a bit beefy and when I informed him of what happened at my place of work. He literally burst out laughing, now bare in mind the officers here are pretty much a bunch of rednecks and called over a partner and told him about what happened. Something along the lines of this guy got touched up by his fag boss etc it took every ounce of willpower not to punch this guy in the face. The report was made though.




After this I took the advice of a couple of pms and got in touch with a lawyer, it was late, there was some trouble, but I got in touch with one through a friend I had to call really last minute, we went into my work HR around 5 this evening, work closes up around half 6, HR and administration specifically, everyone else heads home at 4.30/5ish. I filed a complaint with HR along with friends lawyer buddy there, HR basically took my complaint but let me plus lawyer know that unless there was concrete proof of harassment nothing would likely happen, the lady there was somewhat sympathetic or maybe she was just tired and wanted to go home, I'm not sure. Lawyer knows boss whatsapp'd me a few times, but I deleted him from my contacts as well as on whatsapp so those are most likely lost. However he has told me if anything comes up to call him as soon as possible and has let me know that without concrete proof it's possible that nothing will come out of this.


So there it is everyone. That was basically my evening, I went home after grabbing a pizza, I had dinner with my gf just now where I told her about the situation and she was pissed about it, I managed to get her not to call her uncle and bitch him out. She's fuming though but fell asleep watching World War Z. Now I'm here.


EDIT:- Someone asked how I know a person who could put me in touch with a lawyer and I'm only 21. Working for the past two years I've met a good amount of people that I'm friendly enough with plus I study part time and know some people who are interns at law firms etc Not a whole lot, but enough



TL;DR filed a complaint at the police officer about my boss sexually harassing me, they laughed at me, got a lawyer, went into HR, was told without proof nothing might come out of this so don't hold my breath, had pizza with gf, told her about her uncle, she's pissed at him, my evening in a nutshell everyone"

I've received a job offer with a company in Munich for a Software Engineer Internship for 4-6 months. They're asking me to name my salary but to be honest I don't really know what's appropriate to ask.

In the past, working as a Developer in the US I've been paid roughly the equivalent of 20€/hour and was going to ask that amount - but I'm told it's too much?

I figured I'd ask in a subreddit instead of just relying on the answer I got from one of my German friends.

A little about my background, I'm an American still finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and have extensive experience in corporate software.

Thank You!

This is my first post and it might be a bit long to tell the story. I just want to get this off of my chest. This is a story about how I lost a best friend and hurt his family, all without clear intentions and through blurred lines. I want to begin with a quick description of myself. 

I’m 24/f and Type A, and people would describe me to be a generally good person. I feel very strong emotions, which allows me to relate to people, but can also send me into crippling anxiety and sadness. I have aspirations in the health field, and am working on my second degree to fulfill that. I have experienced family troubles since I was young, and have an overbearing father and a broken home. According to my father, my mother was promiscuous and that’s why our family has fallen apart. A few years ago, my brother cheated on his fiancée and began dating someone new. At the time, I was very black and white and voiced very open opinions about how disgusted I was about this arrangement. As you can already imagine, coming to terms with what I have done has been very difficult. 

About a year ago, I met 26/m Jacob through mutual coworkers. He was here in the city for just a summer internship, and lives across the country, where he goes to school. The first night we all went out for a drink, we both got really drunk and had a one night stand. The next morning, I found out that he was married. He wasn’t wearing a ring.

I remember feeling utterly disgusted (with myself, and him), as I went home in the morning. We came up with a cover story and didn’t tell any of our mutual friends. He made a mistake and we wanted to move past it. However, not bumping into each other would be hard, given our close social circle. But really, I didn’t think I would hear from him but within the week, he emailed me and asked me for a coffee to chat. I agreed. 

On that Saturday afternoon, we talked for three hours at a local Starbucks. We had similar aspirations, and he had agreed to help me with some school applications. He was a sensitive, quiet kind of guy. A nice guy. Everything from the night before was a mistake. He admitted that he was clinically depressed and was trying new things to “feel.” He was also a bit awkward maybe, probably doesn’t speak his mind a lot. Jacob was an orphan, and had a pretty interesting life story. We decided to be friends. 

Over time, I could feel Jacob developing feelings for me. I did not ever reciprocate though, I was curious. In late August, he left for home. We stayed in contact through text often (he was helping me with school applications) and in October, he confessed his feelings to me. Immediately, I told him that we probably shouldn’t stay in contact/talk so often anymore. Now that he’s acknowledged his feelings, it would be inappropriate for us to develop it further. He disagreed. He had become quite attached to me (a symptom of his later diagnosis of borderline personality disorder) and I, unfortunately, succumbed.  

A few of my friends raised red flags about our friendship, and even I, logically knew that this wasn’t a good idea. I used the excuse that “he needed me,” which was mostly true, as he had become a friend who had suicidal tendencies and whom you would worry and ask about. In retrospect, I think I needed him just as much as he needed me. I was fighting my own demons and he helped me through my depression as well. 

Fast forward a few months of daily texting, chatting, and mild flirting, to February. I didn’t think very much of our friendship/relationship whatever, because he was physically so far away. I was not successful in my school applications or work at the time, so I was in a rough patch. He helped me through a lot of it. But Jacob had his own problems too. He had problems with his wife, and career direction, and we clicked well because we became somewhat like a pair of tired souls, who drifted together and searched for brief comfort in each other’s presence. Over time, he had become my best friend, and I was not afraid to be uninhibited in front of him. 

Somehow, in our damaged state of mind, we got our hands on molly and decided that we would try it when he came to visit. It was Easter weekend, and we spent entire days indoors lying on the ground, feeling the effects that liberated us from our real lives. Before he left that weekend, we had shared a kiss and some rubbing in the pants. Despite the m, we were both very conscious and knew what we were doing. I felt very ashamed of myself. We didn’t talk about it very much the next day. Our “relationship” continued on the way it was after he left. He remained a friend whom I always had in my pocket. 

Last weekend, he came to visit again. Once again, we spent an entire weekend indoors, high on m, trying to get a break from life. We were very close, in a mental and physical sense. We cuddled and lay together and he brushed my hair behind my ear and told me nice things. I want to say that we were genuine. Many instances and moments passed by where he showed an interest to have sex with me. I amused myself about it for a bit and we finally committed to it the next day. We had dirty, slamming sex. 

I know that so far this may all sound very typical. I somehow became “the other woman” without really deciding to. For me, this was beyond romance. Jacob and I connected on a level that was beyond what I shared with my other friends. I was not in it for the hand holding, or the cuddling, or the touching. When we were together (and with help from the effects of m), we existed as one. In companionship and friends, I always seek people who could understand me on a deeper level. Jacob possessed this, almost, sad sensitivity that only somebody who had gone through enough trouble and family struggles would have. 

We had breakfast the next day and he left for his plane home. At the time I realized that… I was not sorry for what I’ve done. Maybe I was still coming down, maybe I was still in my afterglow… I just didn’t feel sorry.  I told him that. But this changed over the next week. 
On one of his connecting flights, he got a call from his brother in law. His wife had found our recent gmail conversation about the m. She was 100% against it, and was very upset. He became very anxious. He said he’ll message me sometime later. 

For a whole week, I suffered the side effects of a rolling three consecutive times. I self loathed, broke down in crippling guilt, and was anxious for everytime my phone buzzed. I chronicled most of this in my blog.  I tried to write down as much as I could remember from the weekend. On one of the days I wrote him a long apology, because I felt that he was deserving of a much better friend than I. 

Finally, he texted me 7 days later asking if I had a few minutes to talk. He then began to paste a pre-written letter to me, which basically said that he had told his wife everything because what we were doing was wrong and that it had hurt his family. Now, he needed to focus inwards and try to fix his own psych problems, and we need to go on our own journeys separately. There was a paragraph in there about making our own choices, and then one about despite it all he thought that I was a good person and that one day I will find somebody who loves me. And that I’ll achieve something great in my future. It had a tone of finality to it, a “good luck and good bye” sort of thing. And as you can guess, he had then blocked me off of every social media outlet. 

I was so pissed off that I answered him in a babble of ungraceful curse words and emotions… though I knew I had no privilege to be ungraceful. I was the other woman, afterall. It took me awhile to think through it. I was very upset because after all that we had shared, he came to “end things” with me abruptly and I did not think I deserved the lecture on “making choices.” In fact, I felt that if he had only asked me, perhaps, for what I thought we should do next, I would’ve wound up at the same conclusion. Instead, he wrote me a long letter about how he had to do what was “right” for him.  Silly Jacob, don’t you know that all I ever wanted for you was what was right? I just wish he gave me the chance, before painting me as the bad guy, the whore who was too stupid to know she wasn’t wanted and is now in the way of his true affairs.

Most of all, I’m hurt because I’ve now lost a friend. Someone I wholly connected with. Such that sex or romance wasn’t even a part of it. We shared our spirits, troubles, and souls, everything that was beyond what a kiss and some sex could’ve given me. 

I also know that I am not deserving of a platform to voice how “hurt” I am when our irresponsible actions had permanently scarred someone else. How could I have my safety at the cost of someone else’s? I did not have the foresight to think about the impact that our actions would have on the rest of his family and friends. I misled myself to think that this whole affair was OK because he seemed to think it was. If I were her, I would be utterly destroyed. I would hate me, him, and the other woman. For what my actions had done to her, I am forever remorseful. 

It’s all over now. I miss him a lot. How do  I get over this sadness, and fill this void?

My internship with Company A ended about a month ago. An entry-level position opened up around that time and I was immediately put into consideration for it. 

I just got an email from the manager asking me to come in to ""discuss the next steps."" I'm 98% sure I got the position.

This isn't my problem, however. 

I have an interview soon with Company B for a position that I like more than the position at Company A. I have a very, very close contact that works for Company B and she personally knows people in the department the position is for. I feel like if I have a solid interview there's a high chance for me to land the position. As I said, I would rather work for Company B than Company A.

Should I delay the meeting with the manager at Company A? Should I tell him straight up that I have an interview with another company and that I would like to wait a little longer to weigh my options? 

I honestly don't know what to do...should I just go ahead and meet with the manager and see what happens from there? The thing I don't want to do is accept an offer from Company A, interview with Company B, accept their offer, and then quit Company A after such a short amount of time. I have good relationships with people from Company A that I don't want to tarnish. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

3aqrps,1,2015-06-22,"Looking to buy a car and get a credit card, looking for advice!",ANewEnding,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3aqrps/looking_to_buy_a_car_and_get_a_credit_card/,"Hello wonderful people of PF!

I’ve been a long time lurker here and I’ve learned so much in such a short time from being in this sub. This is my first post here so please be gentle!

 

A few details about me: Currently a college student that will be entering my 3rd year in January. Have an internship that will end late November, paying $19/hr. Rent is $400/month. The only outstanding debt I have is federal student loans, which I don’t have to start paying until I graduate in two years – or three if I decide to pursue a masters (my school has a blended program where you can take graduate classes earlier and finish your masters in 5 years). I currently have $4K in savings.

 

So I have a few questions for you all! First, I am looking at buying a used car. I’ve gotten pre-approved for a $6K loan at 5.2% interest, and my parents have agreed to help me with $5K. I’m currently borrowing their van for work (it has terrible gas mileage), and I would like to get a smaller car that has much better gas mileage (any car could beat it by 2x or 3x really…). I’m thinking of purchasing a car around $10K. Is this a financially sound decision? Also, would it be better to spend a little more for a newer car (I’m thinking $15K for a 2013-2014 model car) so I don’t have to worry about maintenance issues as much? Insurance will be split half and half between me and my parents. I intend to do this before mid-July.

 

Secondly, I’m also considering getting a credit card. I’m very responsible financially, I don’t spend very much at all aside from necessities, and I know to pay my balances in full. I’m currently using a debit card to purchase everything (yes I know this is a terrible idea, hence I’m trying to change). However, I don’t know if this is a good idea given I’m currently trying to finance a car. Would this be advisable? From financing the car I know my credit score is just below 700 if that helps (which was a surprise to me because I haven’t had any credit). What card could/should I get?

 
Third, should I pursue my masters? I'm working towards a degree in computer science and was wondering if the masters is worth the extra year and debt to get. Benefits would be not having to pay off the loan an extra year and the degree itself, cons are that it's one less year working and whether or not it will be worth it.


Thanks PF for all your help! I’ll be editing my post / answering in the comments if I’m missing anything!"
3aquls,3,2015-06-22,Salary Help,KittenQueefs,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/3aquls/salary_help/,"Hey guys,

I suck at salaries and definitely low-balled myself at the last job I accepted. I wondered if you guys could give some advice.

I have a BS in Graphic Design. 1 year internship experience.

Located near Cleveland, OH. So relatively low cost of living.

2 year professional graphic design (print) experience. I left that company making $35k/yr.

1 year professional email design/coding experience. I am currently making $38,500 a year. The original mention for this job was $45k a year. I was an idiot and desperate to get out of the other job, so I accepted $38,500. I was also afraid to sell myself higher due to not having a lot of web experience. Now I could code emails in my sleep.

I have an interview Wednesday for a web design job, mainly design oriented. I wondered what range I should go for? Currently due to bills, cost of living, debt, I can't even afford student loan payments, so it'd be nice to get my pay up and not struggle and defer so much. Any suggestions would be great.

So basically I have three years of professional experience, plus intern experience and 5 years of freelancing in spare time. Thanks in advance for your help! :)"
3aqv7q,1,2015-06-22,Upgrading processor causes computer not to boot,Omnipotentgrape,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3aqv7q/upgrading_processor_causes_computer_not_to_boot/,"Hi /r/techsupport, I'm currently working as an intern, and they're currently having me upgrade the processor and RAM on their lab machines. The upgrades are the processors and RAM. I am going from 4gb to 8gb (we're going to upgrade to Windows 7 later, so the RAM will be useful), and the processor from a **Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5300 @ 2.60GHz** to a **Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 @2.66GHz**

&amp;nbsp;

This is the rest of the machine:
* OS: Microsoft Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3
* Motherboard: Supermicro C2SBC-Q ATX Motherboard
* 400 Watt PSU

&amp;nbsp;

I've gotten most of the machines to work just by unplugging the machine, grounding myself on bare metal of the case, removing the old processor and RAM, and installing the new processor and RAM. The computer would then boot just fine. However, for one machine, I put in the new processor and new RAM, and the computer will not boot. The fans will go on, but either nothing will show up on the monitor, or it will freeze on the bios information screen. Once it even made it to the login screen before freezing.

&amp;nbsp;

I put the old Pentium back in, and the computer worked perfectly. I then swapped in two more (different) Quad cores in, and both of those would also do the same thing as the first Quad core. I would think the chances of three faulty processors is low, and that this computer just does not like the Core 2 Quads.

&amp;nbsp;

Why is this so? It's the exact same computer as all the other ones that worked, but it won't work with the upgrade processor.

&amp;nbsp;

Any ideas? Thanks."

I'm so excited to have found a Crohn's community as I have been recently diagnosed (less than a year ago) and the majority of the online forums I've seen are ghost towns. Here's a little background on me:
The summer before my junior year of high school I started developing my first notable symptoms. From there things got worse, and for whatever reason I didn't tell my family. After I developed my first fistula I realized that something was seriously wrong and tried talking to my dad about it. I was so embarrassed that I didn't really know what to say and he shrugged it off. By the time I went to college my symptoms were pretty much my entire life. I could hardly eat, socialize, pay attention, you name it. I lost ~35 lbs, developed another fistula, and didn't know what to do. Some family came to visit, realized how sick I was, and my medical help started from there. I was soon officially diagnosed with Crohn's (which I expected) and things got a little worse before they got better. Anyway, I left campus to live with family, got on a bunch of meds, modified my diet, and recently had a procedure to aid my fistulas (which the doctors finally recognized for what they really were, thank goodness). Although it has been a stressful ordeal I am worlds better now. I'm even being taken off of one of my meds, my moon face has gone down, I'm exercising more, I'm sleeping less, I'm eating more, and I'm not so unhappy!

Next semester I will be going back to taking classes on campus (as opposed to the online classes I had last semester). I will have my own off-campus apartment, will be a tutor after completing an online internship, and want to get a part-time job. I am also considering getting a dog (to give companionship, to get me to exercise more, to give some structure to my life, and to protect me). I know this sounds like a lot when compiled in one paragraph, but I'll be easing into it. I would appreciate any advice :)"

I enjoy what I'm doing, but I'm getting paid $10 an hour to work full time over the summer ($0.85 above minimum wage here in Connecticut) and the lowest 10% of ""entry level"" software engineers in my area get paid $26/hr (source: http://i.imgur.com/LHDhceI.png (salary.com))

I'm not sure if it's my place to ask for a raise.

So my question is should I ask for a raise, or should I just stick it out and just ride on the fact that a CS internship will be beneficial to my college resume?"

I would like to get a summer job but its very hard to get a job because most employers don't want me to start and then leave for 14 days in July, and leave one weekend per month.

Im either with the football team, in class or at home. Its not great I'm not going to lie. I would like to make enough money to at least save a little bit. I really would like to be a little more financially stable. But Im afraid it means giving up the internship. I really don't want to do that. I really believe this internship will help my career.

3ar3sa,1,2015-06-22,"[Campus network] Very regular ping spikes (every ~29 seconds), help needed to identify the problem",Linkinito,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/3ar3sa/campus_network_very_regular_ping_spikes_every_29/,"Hi /r/homenetworking,

I'm currently living in a campus residence for an internship in Paris. It provides its own network for internet connection. I post this problem here because I think /r/networking is more designed for professional use, and this is a problem I really want to know what it's all about.

So first of all, I'm connected via Ethernet with my own router, a D-Link DIR-600, which worked perfectly fine on another network. I use it to share my connection throughout multiple devices as there's only one Ethernet plug. My Ethernet cables are in perfect condition. As with many university networks, it is heavily censored with basically every non-necessary port blocked, and a lot of websites are blocked too. So like everyone who has to deal with that kind of restrained network and wants to do some other stuff like playing online, I use a VPN. 

The main problem is the residence network seems to be completely fucked up. When I was using my VPN, I could barely browse the internet. So I decided to go a bit further away and check all the pings to the first hop. And when my VPN is active, the ping simply goes haywire being most of the time over 2000ms, when the ping comes back. Because I have to deal with roughly 50% packet loss.

So without the VPN, I decided to check again and I realized something quite strange: my connection looks fine, but every 29 seconds or so (give or take 1 second), there is a spike that goes over 150 ms and slowly goes down to 2 ms. Then, at t+29, another ping spike, that slowly goes down, and rinse and repeat forever. It happens at every hour of the day, but it's much worse at peak hours (7-11 PM) with much more jitter. I basically have 15% packet loss, going up to 30% in peak hours.

I've tried to contact the ISP (RENATER - french provider for university networks), by giving them the ping plots to the first hop, and they basically told me to contact the network administrator of my residence (so basically ""fuck off we are not responsible it's not our fault""). But that's kinda surprising as it's the first hop when I do a traceroute. There might be a hidden router or two in the university to handle all the connections (because I'm definitely not alone in that residence - there's like 1,000 rooms), but I can't find them in any way possible.

When I do some connection tests on SpeedTest, it looks fine, ping &lt;10 ms and solid 10 Mb/s down &amp; up. But on PingPlotter, it just jumps every 29 seconds, and when I use a VPN, it simply goes all over the place. Therefore I can't browse websites online correctly, and don't tell about playing online due to the impossible lag.

I've read multiple posts trying to identify what this problem could be. I suspect it could be bufferbloat, but something's sure, it's definitely a problem due to the residence routers. The ping spikes can't be that regular if it was faulty cables or stuff. Those spikes happen way too regularly for it to be a random problem. It must be something with the main residence router that delays all the packets after a certain time, hence my bufferbloat theory.

Here's a [perfect example of the ping plot.](http://imgur.com/atFLSNC)

Btw my router (192.168.0.1) has always &lt;1 ms ping when I do ping plots, so it's definitely not my router. And when I plug in my PC directly to the Ethernet plug, I hae the same ping plots with spikes every 29 seconds or so.

Being a simple resident, I can't act on this directly, the only way for me to solve this problem would be to contact the network admin and tell him the problem in detail. That's why I ask you for help, to be sure about what the problem is so I could bring it to him, and possibly solve this problem not only for me but for everyone who uses the connection here.

**EDIT:** Apparently, my VPN falls under traffic shaping as I could understand from /u/squirrelpotpie (it uses port 443). However it's not a very-known VPN (it's called Unshade) and worked flawlessly on another residence in Grenoble which was also supplied by RENATER. However, it's not ""plug &amp; connect"", you have to get a login and password to access the network (usually provided by the university and/or the residence - depends of the networking system used).

Actually, we have a choice about our internet: either we use the university network for free, either we can use the telephonic line (there is one in every room) and get ADSL (that's the main thing in France). However, to get my own ADSL line, I'd need to spend a lot of money, and the rent fee is already huge for me. And basically, the residence's stance on this is ""if you want your own internet connection so you can do whatever you want with it, you have to pay for it fully, we won't pay any charge for you"".

Internet is cheap in France (€20/month) but reopening the line would cost me €70. However I only stay in this residence up to August 31, so paying €110 for 2 months would be kinda too much. Hence my try to find the existing problem in the university network which is clearly flawed even in low-traffic hours. If this can be fixed for me it can be for everyone. However, I'm aware that the available bandwidth is not unlimited and even with good networking, with 1,000 rooms using internet, it can't be easy to serve everyone.

Also  these 1,000 rooms will always be full because they are the cheapest you can find in the vicinity (as they are state-owned and usually they are prioritizing foreign students and students from low-income families). And they offer you a choice for the internet connection which is not always the case but won't spend a single cent if you make the choice of getting your own internet connection. It might be their telephone line, the cost is all up to you.

So based on what you've said to me, I'm gonna contact the network admin of the residence and tell him what the problems currently are. But chances are he's gonna tell me ""we can't do anything about it"" or ""it's always been like this"" or ""if you want your own internet you can"". I'll still try to be convincing."

3ar6iz,2,2015-06-22,Traditional financial analyst role or a MEAN stack (web app) developer at a startup?,opus666,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ar6iz/traditional_financial_analyst_role_or_a_mean/,"Hi. I just got a job offer from a place that I actually wanted to work at. It is an investment firm, and I'll be working as a junior analyst, where I'll just be an Excel monkey. However, I've talked to the two senior associates who had started in my position, and they say that the job does get better as I gain more experience and earn my CFA certification, which is expected of me as a junior analyst.

However, the problem is that I've taken a job at a start up doing some Excel work and hopefully being a MEAN stack developer for the same company in the future. I've been at this position for two weeks, and the start up culture is not bad. It's very flexible and laid back, but I'm not sure if I'll be up to scratch. I have zero experience programming. I've done R and MATLAB as a math major, but nothing like web development and database architecture, which is what my position will be in this start-up. As a young 22 year old, there is no better time for me to learn all these programming skills, but at the same time so much of my undergraduate career has been towards a financial career.

To be honest, I don't have a burning desire to work in the financial industry. I'm just a guy who liked math, and now that it's time for me to start looking for a job it didn't hurt me to take a few classes in investing and apply to those positions. I've never had an internship in the area nor do I know many people in this industry. The only thing that is more attractive for me for the analyst position is that it's the devil that I know. This whole programming position I have now presents a lot of opportunities for growth in the future, but I am starting from square zero.

**TL;DR**: here are the main questions
   

   1.  Should I select a more traditional junior analyst role in a rather rigid, traditional office setting, or attempt to be a database developer without any experience whatsoever?

   2. If i do select the junior analyst role, any advice on quitting a job after only 2 weeks?

Thank you"

Hi, I’m Noble, the founder of [CompeteLeague](http://competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for almost two years now, completing several tournaments and giving a professional experience to a wide variety of players. Today, I’m proud to announce that we are expanding to Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm off to bed for tonight, I will answer all other questions when I wake up tomorrow! Thank you guys for the support!

&amp;nbsp;


**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted CS:GO league, we’re hosting 2 month leagues for Silver 1-Silver Elite Master and Gold Nova 1-Master Guardian 2 that are open to all. More info below. Launch date should be around Late Summer, leave your email at [competeleague.com](http://competeleague.com/#page5) to get more info when it’s available, and if you’re interested in helping out you can apply for a role on our staff here: [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6). We are also considering a higher ranked tournament if there is enough demand for it!

&amp;nbsp;

**About CompeteLeague** 

First and foremost, we promise not to use your computer to mine for bitcoins. CompeteLeague launched 2 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. We had only 1 league featuring 8 teams. We had 4 casters and only about 10 people on staff. Needless to say, it was very hard to run, and quickly we learned to be more prepared and to plan out our structure. Following our first successful season we had a chance to broaden our staff and host 3 leagues at the same time, featuring a total of 24 teams. Our staff had grown to over 30 people for North American League of Legends. We tracked player’s stats, helped them on game day, and answered many, many questions. It required long hours of work, and it paid off. It was a very fun and successful season. Recently we’ve taken some time off to improve our service across the board and create a much improved environment for the players, we’re now expanding from only featuring League of Legends in North America to European LoL, NA LoL, and now NA CS:GO. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What We Need**

Our CS:GO expansion is just beginning so we need people who are willing to volunteer their time to help create an awesome competitive environment for lower bracket CS:GO players. We have needs for casters, admins, moderators, game day managers and more. If you’d like to help but you’re unsure about what you can do or would like to do, feel free to message me on here, ask in the comments, etc. Please note that all staff positions are not paid and completely volunteer, if you would like to help please visit [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6) More information on the staff positions can be found below.

&amp;nbsp;

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for CS:GO will be as follows:

Silver 1 - Silver Elite Master | Gold Nova 1 - Master Guardian 2 | TBA
-------------|----------------|----------
Thursdays | Fridays | TBA
5-10 PM Central | 5-10 PM Central | TBA

Leagues are being developed and are scheduled to start late this Summer.

&amp;nbsp;

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for nine weeks, and will be streamed and casted. Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | CT | T | Map | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 |de_cache| Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 |de_cache| No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6| de_cache| No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |de_mirage |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 |de_mirage |No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 |de_mirage |No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 |de_dust2 |Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 |de_dust2| No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8| de_train| Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| de_train|No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 9 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in -1 point. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners happen over the space of 4 weeks. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pricing**

Unfortunately, for Counter Strike, we will have to charge for our services due to the costs of dedicated servers and anti-cheat software that is exclusive to CS:GO. It’s against our business model and desires to charge our players, but due to the costs of operating in the CS amateur scene it’s necessary here. All the money from teams will be invested back into competeleague to cover those costs with any extra going towards prizing, upkeep of the site, and improvement of services.

Our first estimates have it at $37.50 per team to participate ($7.50 each for a team of 5, or less if spread out with substitutes), which covers a full season’s worth of playing, including playoffs (a total of 13 gameplay weeks from when you sign up). No matter when you join, the cost will cover the same amount of time for playing. Even if you join halfway through the season into the Open bracket, your team pays the fee and you’re ready to go. You’ll enjoy playing the rest of the season, and playoffs (if you qualify), and it will cover the first weeks of the next season, until the join point of the previous season. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Qualifying**

For teams signing up for the first season, there will be a qualifier tournament for each Premier League, the top 10 teams will move onto the Premier League, while all other teams will participate in the Open League. This tournament will not count towards the 13 weeks of gameplay paid for, and will just be to seed the Premier League teams for the first season. After this tournament all new sign up teams will be entered into the Open Leagues and have to qualify for Premier Leagues through promotion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Smurfing**

We have two years of experience with similarly formatted leagues for League of Legends and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly, to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be very effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cheating**

Cheating has been a notorious problem for every league and tournament hosted in Counter Strike. We will be using the best anti cheats that we can find and every game in our premier leagues will be monitored by a CompeteLeague moderator. When games are reported for cheating in premier and open leagues they will be reviewed and judged by multiple moderators. In the event of a player cheating the player will be permanently banned from CompeteLeague competitions, and teammates will be banned for two seasons. There are a few exceptions to the two season rule, such as if the teammates of the cheater report him to CompeteLeague staff and we have enough evidence to make a ruling, they will NOT be punished, however all wins from the time the convicted cheater played on the team will be defaulted to losses regardless.

&amp;nbsp;

**Transparency**

Unfortunately, there are always conflicts with competitions of any sort, and there will almost certainly be cause to restrict services or ban players from our site. Every single punishment will be documented publically with reasoning and evidence. We will never ban a player without reason, and without giving information on the punishment. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Prizes**

Each tournament will be prized, and will include prizes such as Steam cash, rare skins, cases and keys. For CS:GO we don’t have the specifics about our prizes yet, but we will NOT have cash prizes, all of our prizes will be based around Steam or the game itself. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be doing a case opening giveaway. Throughout the stream, you’ll be able to enter the raffle (opening at random times during the games) and we will open a case, and whatever is opened is given to the winner of the raffle. Whether it is a Karambit Fade or a Glock Bunsen Burner. In addition we have plans to give away moderately priced skins to the MVPs of each week.

&amp;nbsp;

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run the first season. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being Dominic ‘Sata’ Roemer who now casts for Riot in the Chinese LPL) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. You can apply [HERE](http://competeleague.com/#page6). The different positions we have for volunteers are:

- Admin

A position as administrative staff behind the scenes of leagues, organizing casting schedules, managing team disputes, handling staff and ensuring broadcasts go smoothly, and more.

- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails casting at least 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so it’s likely that we’ll hold tryouts for casters depending on how many applications we receive. 

- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred, but past experience is helpful but not necessary, we have graphic work for many different levels of skill.

- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What Makes us Different?**

Experience. We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We’ve had a long time to prepare our site and our staff for this upcoming season. Hopefully you can be a part of either helping the site, or playing in one of our leagues!

I took a job as an administrative assistant right out of college. I would help with front desk and AP. Our company was acquired by a larger company. 

There was no full-time staff accountant and there still isn't. This is a private corporation. So, I received on the job training for everything. They even had to teach me debits and credits. Now, I do bit of everything: AP, AR, costing, financial reporting, monthly closings, etc. They even gave me an intern this summer. I'm 26 now and I will complete my MSA in August and I am CPA eligible. 

Unfortunately, I now have all these student loans and need a larger pay increase. They don't really pay their employees what they are worth. My annual review is in January 2016, but our recruiting fair is this fall. Should I go through recruiting and begin salary negotiations if I get offers (fingers crossed)? Or should I leave anyway for the public experience? 

I know my work/life balance will take a hit, but my husband wouldn't mind and we aren't planning to have kids for at least 4 or 5 years. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

So I'm feeling a bit down and hopeless.  I have been working tirelessly for almost a year now to try to make it in LA as a sound designer and post production audio editor.  

I have done 4 internships...A post house, a voiveover studio, a podcast host, and for UCLA.  I have worked for free on several indie films, podcasts, ect.

I have actually landed a couple paying jobs.  My biggest was for a major video game release for Xbox 1 and PS4.  I have been told that my work is good, so I don't think I am laking in creativity or skill.

My lease is coming up, and I'm not sure if I should continue paying the extremely high cost of living here in LA.

Everyday, all day, I browse craigslist, mandy, entertainmentcareers, elance, upwork, indeed, monster.... you name it!  I still continue to look for internships, although I am tired of being taken advantage of for free labor, and feel my previous internships and education are worth minimum wage, at least.

I even made a website to try to promote myself.  taymdep.wix.com/fixitinpost

I have great letters of recommendation, a ""no task too small"" attitude and a good ear.  What do I do to try to make a living in LA?

I would love to hear any advice, suggestions, or personal stories of those who have succeeded in this field!  How long did it take?  What steps did you take?

Thanks so much!"

3arhqe,7,2015-06-22,Me [27M] with my girlfriend [26F] of 6 months - I'm struggling with self-confidence and letting paranoia set in,ughanotherthrowaway3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3arhqe/me_27m_with_my_girlfriend_26f_of_6_months_im/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now, and let me just say that she is a wonderful person.  There’s so much that I like about her and I can feel myself falling for her.  The first five months of the relationship were amazing; however this this past month has been a difficult one for us.  There are multiple external factors that have applied pressure to our relationship – her busy work schedule, me working an internship in a different state for the summer, and several other stressors.  Essentially, everything caught up to us all at once, and she shut down emotionally and started pushing me away in order to get some space and recharge.  We have had two discussions about this in the past month.  What it boils down to is that she was so used to being single for so long that she is still trying to figure out having another person (me) in her life.  She said that she cares about me and wants me in her life, but she’s still figuring this whole relationship thing out.  All in all, things have not been the same, but I’m doing my best to remain patient and not pressure her – but it is hard at times.


This recent speed bump has left me feeling insecure and paranoid.  I generally am an extremely confident guy, but I’ve been having trouble finding that confidence as of late.  Her inability to commit to the simplest of plans in advance gets me anxiety – plans make her anxious haha.  I find myself constantly checking her Facebook page and her Instagram activity.  I misinterpret one word text message responses has her being angry with me and I selfishly get mad when she doesn’t respond to me for hours at time.  This is a terrible, terrible mindset to have, but it’s hard sometimes.  Maybe it’s the distance between us this summer?


The thing that increased my paranoia the most though was a recent discovery.  We were out on a date a week and a half ago and she opened up Snapchat later in the evening when we were grabbing drinks.  I noticed that she had a “snap streak” of 11 days with a guy that I had never heard of before.  It’s a silly thing to be upset about, I know, but with things being difficult for us over the last month, for me to see that it just reduced my confidence even more and increased my paranoia.  I should also mention that I was emotionally cheated on in the past and this is a constant fear of mine – people acting disloyal towards me.


My question to you reddit is what can I do to manage my stress/paranoia/confidence issues?  What should I do about seeing this “snap streak?”  I care so much about this woman and I don’t want to stress her out, but I have to look out for my feelings too.  I was so tempted to snoop through her phone that night I saw the Snapchat thing, but ultimately, I didn’t.  I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because I don’t want to sound like I’ve lost my confidence.  Am I being overly sensitive here?  Regardless, I hate feeling paranoid and I just want to find my confidence again.  I really care about her and the relationship and I want this to succeed, so I don’t want to bring anything up that would ruin what we have.


TL;DR – My self-confidence has decreased in the past month and my paranoia in the relationship has me emotionally exhausted.  I saw that my girlfriend had a “Snapchat streak” of 11 days with a guy I had not heard of before and it’s been stressing me out.  Unsure of how to proceed based on the difficult month we have just had."

I always feel so on top of it, then a couple weeks in I hit some roadblock. 

The boss needs X done, but the way he wants it done doesn't make sense. Every time I think it's done, I ask him and he says he wants it done differently. His explanations don't make sense. I'm looking at a week of time wasted over this stupid task. 

This has happened to me every time I've had an internship. Last summer I had an issue like this and wound up riding it all summer doing nothing and getting away with it. But I don't want that.

How do I say ""Hey, I think I'm not getting this, and I don't want to waste my time trying to learn it because it's not getting me anywhere."" And no, you can't just say that to your boss black and white. 


EDIT: just to be clear, it's work in R&amp;D. It's technical stuff. So far I have got all the technical stuff, but this is really technical. I already tried it, I already asked, I already googled it. It's a menial task that is gonna require a lot more brain power than it is worth. I am not trying to be lazy, I'm burning out trying to do this one thing."

It's just too dangerous and violent for me. I just got my first internship this month and while at work someone broke into my car and stole my spare tyre.

I've lived in England for a year as part of my sandwich graduation and loved it there, but I know that moving to the UK is not an easy thing to do, so Canada or other (safer than Brazil) english speaking countries would be good as well.

3arn9f,3,2015-06-22,"I [20M] go to college with 19F but there may be some roadblocks, including myself",throwaway_11201,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3arn9f/i_20m_go_to_college_with_19f_but_there_may_be/,"This is a pretty complicated situation, bear with me... I'll attempt to make this somewhat understandable.

There's this girl at my school, we'll call her J, who I like. We're both about to be juniors in the coming fall. I really like her, she's cute, is a very sweet person, and has a very fun vibe to her. I had a class with her second semester freshman year and we've texted/fb chatted each other a couple times since then, had some in person chats here and there in the hallways and quite a few snapchats between each other (well, mostly from me). Her snapchats to me were pretty 'exclusive', as in they did not appear in her story but she didn't send me snaps that did appear in her story. I was also on her top list last week but as of this morning I'm not on there anymore (there was the smirking emoji next to her name, but now it's gone). Our conversations through chat/text were pretty generic things, nothing much honestly... though I do feel like I should've at least asked her to hang out one weekend.

Here's where the issues arise: she's from the area where the school is and I'm from the opposite coast. I'm not going to be back in the area until late August because I'm working here, so there's no chance for me to see her until the start of school. I guess I could keep snapchatting her and maybe spin up a fb chat with her, but honestly I think it'll be just a dead end there without in-person interaction (also I really suck at IM'ing girls I like). I don't think Skype's an option here, I'm pretty awkward with phone conversations as it is and I think it'll be awkward for both of us with video attached to it. I'm also pretty potato with in-person conversations, but that depends on how sleepy I am (I sometimes can't even formulate proper sentences or thoughts when talking... it's shitty).

The second issue (or maybe a very great addition, I honestly really don't know...) is that she's now best friends with this other girl we'll call S. I'm pretty good friends with S and we've been chatting and snapchatting each other quite a bit and have been bf's on snapchat for a while now. The thing is, S and I had sex last year and we agreed to never bring it up with anyone and keep that between each other. Basically, when we talk to each other we know what happened but it doesn't affect our friendship much, plus she's now dating some other guy at our school. Anyways, a good chunk of her snapchats to me were when she was hanging out with J, which included pics and videos of places and selfies of them doing things. From what I can tell, J is mostly working in some office and then hangs out with her female friends afterwards, but mostly with S and her boyfriend at the moment. I'm sure they gossip about me when J and S are alone, though obviously I can't be too sure, and I don't know if S told J about our one time interaction.

Some extra info: a friend of mine tried helping me out/wingman'ing and asked her what kind of guys she liked racially (I'm white, she's Asian), and she said she preferred white guys. Of course this doesn't say much at all, but considering the majority of our school is South Asian, it could be a plus. And as I mentioned above, it doesn't seem like she hangs around guys unless it's some larger event hosted by the school or someone's birthday party, etc.

What should I do? What should I say when I decide to chat her up? There's no possibility of going out on a date with her until school starts up again and I don't want to lose out on by being slow and/or late. I really want to at least date her and I feel like she's someone who will be worth my time (and hopefully vice versa!). It's been a while since I've had a proper relationship with feelings attached (over three years now, wow), and since then it's either been some cuffing season BS or one night stands. I've really got feelings for her and I want to try to get us dating. In the meantime, I've got my friends here, hobbies, and an internship for the summer so it's not like I'm stressing too much over her that I'm not being productive with my time.

What do y'all suggest?"

But he just finished his PhD so I wanted to reward him by paying off some student debt and buying him a new car of his own.

I'm gave him a total budget and told him that he could decide how much went to loans, and how much goes to a car.

He decided between 30-35k for the car.

We've gone around test driving lots of stuff, and what he's really narrowed it down to is the Mazda 6 and the Dodge Charger.

It'll be a daily driver for him, not so sure on his daily commute since he's now hunting for a more career-relevant position that isn't a glorified internship.

He told me yesterday that he wants me to make the final decision because he just can't pick between the two. So I figured I'd try you guys out and see what your opinions are.

He's 26, has been driving since he was 16, and has driven everything from a Subaru Forester to my RC F. So I'm confident he can handle either vehicle.

-----------

He wants the most bang for his buck in terms of both performance and amenities/convenience options.

What I'd like to know from you all is what your personal opinions of each/either vehicle is, what experiences you've had with them, and, and some pros/cons for each. Also which options are worth buying at the dealer, and what we can get added in aftermarket for a better value/quality.

We know they aren't in the same class - so it's a lot of apples/oranges but he liked them both equally enough that he asked me to choose for him. He hasn't asked me to pick anything for him since he was probably 10 and it was between a Nintendo or a Playstation.

If you need more info please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to provide you with what I can.

Thank you.

-----------

Edit: After speaking with him some in regards to his options he's let me know that he went to test drive a Subaru BRZ today and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Not enough for it to be the definitive answer, but enough to add it to the running. As if I didn't already have a difficult decision in front of me."

Right now, I enjoy learning about PowerShell and there is a immediate need to do a small script at the workplace.

I am being given some guidance by another IT manager. He is super busy and I am mostly learning doing this on my own.

I am following small course on lynda.com (I have access through univ.) and then found some on MVA (Microsoft Virtual Academy) as well YouTube (forgot the name).

My issue is not about grasping the concepts, but it is about learning what is needed on the job fast enough to make a somewhat working script that will essentially pull a list of data, compare that with another list, and then report the unique values (similar to Conditional-Formatting in Excel - but we want PowerShell to do the heavy lifting and eliminate manual work).

ANY ways I can just get a kickstart into writing small scripts and testing them against dummy csv data?

Also, the eventual goal is to go into some servers through vCenter using its own PowerCLI commands using PowerShell, pull some lists of server names out, and compare that with the backup list available through other means (which I don't know yet, or will be provided) and then compare the two to see if they match. The idea is for the script to work independently, but be configurable through XML so that anyone can somehow tweak the script to their hearts' content through XML and not have to deal with the actual script in PowerShell.

I would really appreciate any feedback on this as I have super cool managers who are really open minded and flexible in letting me pursue this direction, while I started as Tier 2 Desktop support, picked up on the basics rather quickly and now wanting to do this because it gets me 1 step closer to programming, which is what my eventual goal will be after graduation.

Thank you for your time and advice!"

I've been unemployed a long time and unable to get my foot into the door, but am very competent with JavaScript, including the Node.js API. I'm also competent with PHP, SQL and Git- and though I develop with Windows, I do like to stay in Git Bash and multiplex it with ConEmu along with common Unix tool use.

And although it's hardly worth mentioning, I have some familiarity with C# .NET

As for frameworks, I'm fairly familiar with React/Flux and Angular on the browser side, while I'm familiar with Slim and Kohana on the PHP side. (As for server JS, I've only ever briefly used express in Node.js, but it's simple enough, and I've been thinking about using it when I try developing/porting to an Isomorphic application with MartyJs)

I want to work and make money- and it may take some time to be in a position to do so- but I *really* want to soak up knowledge from senior developers if possible.

I watch a lot of talks and hang out in the JavaScript related IRC channels (with thousands of users and lots of discussion across them), but nothing beats direct exposure to someone else's experience and skill set.

Thanks!"

It's recently struck me that when I apply to job postings, the application will ask for my employment history and I give it to them. 

The problem is, however, that I don't have any any actual work experience at the moment. My work experience is purely part-time work I had on the side while I was attending school. My school did teach us to include a section in our resume for ""technical project experience"" as we had many of these projects throughout the course of our undergraduate degree. I understand that these experiences are not the same as actual work experiences, but I feel like there's still some aspects of doing the projects that gave me some kind of experience in doing technical work.

With this in mind, I'm just wondering if there's any way I can let employers know this on my applications? I feel like when I only put down my part-time employment, it's kind of detrimental to my application just because they might not immediately see my full resume and may think that I don't have ANY type of experience at all.

Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there a better way I can display that I do have some sort of experience in working on a technical project for a client? I also know it might not help that I had no internships while I was in school but that's not a point I'd like to discuss at the moment.

Many thanks for any advice or comments you can send my way."

So here I am in the Shark tank trying to get a job with no career experience except for two internships. I've always said I wouldn't want to do support type roles, just because most positions don't require a four year degree, and it feels like a waste. In addition, these positions seem to be the lowest paying branch of the IT field (correct me if I'm wrong). But, I've been getting the vibe more than more that it's better to start somewhere. That being the case, I've been applying for the rare support positions that DO require a degree. I have an interview on wednesday for one of such positions. Even though i'm probably far from an offer, I have no idea what do say about asking salary. 50k has been my magic number, but given that I have virtually no leverage (other than a fair amount of internship/misc. work experience for my age) so I don't know really what would be fair. I don't want to under-sell myself because I do have student loans looming, but I also don't want to ask too much and eliminate myself from consideration.

I'm currently working an internship on the Android team of a pretty big company. I find it reasonably fun and satisfying as I enjoy the visual aspect of building something, and I feel like I'm starting to actually develop some professional skills as well. 

I was considering pursuing a career in Android/mobile development, but my mom (who works in the EE industry) is telling me Android developers won't enjoy the same pay, demand, and lucrative career path as other jobs would offer.

I understand that we all like to say ""follow your dreams, if you like it stick with it"" but I'm still young and haven't really tried out any other options, so I'm kind of curious as to what to do after this internship (I'm going to be a junior next year). Deciding whether I want to focus on Android and become really experienced in it or whether I should swap is hard for me.

So I'm wondering the answers to these three questions...
- Do prestigious big companies/hot startups seek out Android developers the same as more backend oriented ones?
- How does an Android career path differ others? Does it make working for certain types of companies easier/harder? (e.g does it make getting a job for Microsoft harder, but getting a job for some mobile-based startup easier)
- What do you think the future looks like for Android devs? Will we always be in demand, and will a career in Android still allow us to switch to other SDE positions?

Thanks a lot if you can help me out here! "

Like a lot of people on this thread who had an Nparent, and as a result later educated themselves extensively on the topic of emotional manipulation, I can recognize and detest psychological manipulation from a mile away. 

Enter my boss. This isn't just ""any"" job for me, either. This is my ""articling position"", which is the 10 month internship I have to complete in order to get called the bar, i.e become a lawyer in Ontario, Canada. To date I have sunk approximately 9 years of my life and $100,000+ into my education, and like many leaving an average law school with average grades, I had to fight like Hell to get that first job. 

But get a job I did, in a small family law firm in the same geographical area as my SO. I was elated. Doing piecemeal work from home quickly progressed into ""full time"" work, meaning all of a sudden I was being asked to come into the office 3 to 5 days a week. My Nboss appreciated my work, gave me endless positive feedback, and eventually back in April, offered me the coveted articling position. It was a verbal agreement the two of us came to while in my car coming back from the courthouse, so nobody else witnessed it. But he asked me to be his articling student, in no uncertain terms.

I went home and cried tears of joy to my SO. It felt like all my hard work, and outlay of tuition, and years of anxieties had paid off. My SO cried. It was a beautiful moment. Until it wasn't. 

Approx. ten days later, on a Sunday, I get a text from my boss. I knew something was wrong because he wanted me to call him and it was a Sunday. I also knew he'd been a total jerk to me over the previous Thursday/Friday for some vague reason I did not totally understand. So I called him. He said to me, ""I like having you come into the office to do contract (piecemeal) work, but I don't want you to get your hopes up that I can give you an articling position"". Then he tried to reframe our verbal offer and acceptance of an articling position (something the Law Society takes VERY seriously; there are strict rules re: offers of employment for articling students) as him just basically talking about maybe, perhaps, there's a possibility, if i'm a superdupergoodgirl he'll give me the articling position. I KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME AND HE OFFERED ME THE JOB. I KNOW WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND THE EXCHANGE WE HAD. But his response was basically ""at any rate, I haven't submitted the paperwork to the law society yet, so tough luck"". So what can I say, right? I've struggled so much and worked so hard to get my foot in the door ANYWHERE that I need to take any experience I could get, so I simply dried my tears, went back into work the following day, and continued to work my @$$ off, like whoa.

A month later, I'm back in his good books somehow, and he offers me the job again. This time I waste no time getting the papers signed and submitted to the law society ;))) So I am ""officially"" articling now, working towards becoming a lawyer for realz. Things are good for approx. 3 weeks. 

The way I was getting paid until 2 weeks ago was just sending him an invoice for my billable hours. In a typical 10hr--12hr work day, I bill maybe 6 to 10 hours. So for 50/hr to 60/hr work weeks I was making less than minimum wage. 

So last week my Nboss hands me a piece of paper that has a salaried wage outlined on it: $500/week, or $1,000/pay period. Not much, only a few $1,000/annually above minimum wage here in Ontario but whatever. It made me feel like my long hours and hard work meant something to him and that we were finally getting off to a good start. We had a brief conversation about the pay stub, he mentioned how it will be nice to not have to calculate the tax deduction because it would be the same every time he did my pay cheque now, he asked me if what he was paying me was ""enough"" compared to articling students in other firms (it was not, most make $45k annually, but I lied and said it was really generous), he said I'm doing a really good job and he would like to pay me more in the future but he'd have to see. 

Today, I came in after the weekend to a slew of emails sent at all odd hours of the day. I did this wrong, I did that wrong, he's deleting my billed entry for this work, for that work, drilling me on the most idiosyncratic details of my work. Half way through the day, he rings me up on the phone and barks at me for my invoice, I explain I did not think I required one because he had indicated I was on salary, and BACK PEDDLES. HE DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN, and this time he tells me that he ""can't believe I have the gall to tell him what he's paying me"". 

I confronted him again at the end of the day, handing him my invoice and stating simply that I was happy to work for billable hours, and I was really more here for the learning experience and to become the best lawyer I can be, but I did not back down from the position that he had offered me a salaried wage and redacted that offer. He had a reasoning for everything: he explained away the paystub, the conversations we had after he gave me the stub, everything. Talked himself in circles and even made the comment ""the more I look at it, the more I know I am right."" He would not stop arguing with me and engaging in this revisionist history even though I was not pressing him to pay me more, I accepted the fact that I was in a vulnerable position and will take what I could get pay-wise. I left the conversation by saying simply ""I am not interested in arguing with you about this any longer, as I said, I gave you my invoice and I accept that is my pay for the week"". 

I am sooooooo triggered by this behaviour. I want to jump out of my skin and claw my own face off. That kind of antsy, can't sleep, angry-but-helpless feeling I used to get all the time as a small child. Unfortunately, due to aforementioned reasons, quitting is not an option for me.

Sadly, we didn't know his difficulties as he had not been home for 6 months away on an internship.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, every day is very hard for me, as I struggle with addiction, anxiety, and depression, even before he died, I was still messed up. I really think the best way to die would be for a shotgun or something to get you when you are fast asleep. Seems quick, and painless. I wish someone could do that for me, not right now, but I feel like my destiny is suicide. Maybe in 5 or 10 years. I'm really, really fucking sad guys.

I just got back from giving my dealer a ride, he was picking up a few pounds of weed, I just don't even care about riding with something that could get ME in trouble, since I'm the one driving..we drove by a couple cops, I just felt my stomach sink, such close calls with so much illegal shit.

As soon as I get home at about 10:40, my mom is pissed off saying I'm sneaking around, saying I know you're still smoking pot, etc, I deny it but she's such a bitch sometimes, then she just makes me feel like shit. One of her 3 sons already killed himself, I feel like she is just pushing me to suicide.

Vancouver seems to get passed over by /r/CSCQ as a foreign temp for holding tanks.

For FT work, I'm only referring to Canadian citizens or permanent residents who get a permanent, full-time position in Vancouver. So, no foreign temp holding tanks like FB and GOOG.

Some of the things I've heard is that MSFT and SAP Vancouver pay low salaries to their interns, and MDA out in Richmond pays low salaries to pretty much everyone. There's also EA Burnaby and Capcom Vancouver (confusingly, also located in Burnaby) but I have a mistrust of AAA game studios. Low salaries, high hours, routine shipment of teams to Montreal (depending on how strong the Canadian dollar is), etc. And of course Hootsuite but I'd never work for a company that has unpaid internships."

My life is huge mess and I truly don't know what to do with myself.

I started wanting to become an engineer, but having performed horribly in my first semester, I transferred to my university's college of arts and sciences instead. At my school, we had to declare a major by the end of sophomore year. Having no passion in anything whatsoever, I struggled to decide. There was that one class that I got a B+ in that I enjoyed; it was a political science class on Shakespeare and politics. Thus, I declared political science. I should probably mention that I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia during all of this. I broke down during the spring of my sophomore year and decided to spend 6 months studying abroad to give myself a break from school. 

After returning to school at the second half of my junior year, I scrambled to pick up what I had left off before I went to abroad. I had 3 semesters left not only to finish a degree but to finish the core requirements for graduation. So I spent the rest of my time trying to graduate.
My academics were a huge mess, but what I did enjoy on the side was my work study jobs where I was able to acquire some experience in IT and web development. I was also an Administrative Assistant for 2 semesters. I wasn't able to land an internship at all after my junior year and spent my summer volunteering at random non-profits and offering private tutoring. I enjoyed worked at these random places even though they don't really make sense or fit together in a cohesive image. 

For months now, I've been applying to work as various types of analysts and project manager and have only been called for 2 interviews - neither of which resulted in an offer. I told my parents that I was gonna go back to school to get a MA but my research tells me that my GPA and coursework do not match any of the requirements for Stats or Computer Science programs. My mom wants me to get a useful degree this time. I really just want to get employed and stop being such a mess. But what can I do? My work history is so random and my GPA sucks. I can't get a job. I can't go back to school. What do I do with my life? Sorry for rant/blog style but god, I'm feeling like total shit these days.

3asw6i,3,2015-06-23,uncertain about transferring--advice?,throwaway_01002,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/3asw6i/uncertain_about_transferringadvice/,"i'm hella late to the game and should have probably posted this a few days ago but i've been on the fence about this choice for about a week now sdlkfdsjl. so i was accepted into columbia as a transfer (off the waitlist) and my response is due by 11:59 pm on wednesday. i currently attend amherst college, my gpa is ~3.75, and i'll probably major in either neuroscience or psychology + studio art. possibly premed but i'm pretty on the fence about that too, especially since orgo is next year lol. the difference in cost of attendance at each school is pretty marginal imo (columbia is 5k more expensive per year), so financial aid isn't really a factor, although i kind of worry about how expensive nyc would be to live in. anyway, i honestly have NO idea where i'm leaning on this decision; at first i was most definitely leaning toward staying at amherst, but the more i think about it, the more i'd like to be in nyc.

i initially applied to columbia because i was very, very unhappy with my situation at amherst. the town is incredibly rural (think 40k population comprised mostly of college students + basically one street downtown), and growing up in a city surrounded by cornfields and cows, i kind of wanted to broaden my horizons, cliched as that sounds. moreover, i was pretty displeased with the huge athletic presence on campus and i wasn't very happy with my circle of friends. second semester, however, went much better overall, and i found myself with some friends who are absolutely lovely. i'm not sure that the social impetus for transferring is still there, although the athletic presence/tiny town are still factors. however, nyc hasn't lost its allure--the thought of being in a place where i can see concerts/museums/what have you is very captivating. getting an internship in the city would also be pretty cool. and the thought of being around more people interested in art rather than athletics is also nice.

academically, i'm a little worried about transferring. although my gpa at amherst is okay, it's not the best, and i'm not sure if classes at columbia will be harder to get good grades in. i've also heard rumors that it's a pretty stressful environment/it's not as collaborative (although both of these concerns are very minor at best). all of my classes seem to be transferring at least, but i'm not sure what that means in terms of the core. the credit breakdown goes like this, if it matters: visual arts - 4, chemistry - 8, humanities - 4, math - 4, music - 8, anthropology - 4, psychology - 4. i'm not sure if there are core classes that most transfers get out of or if there are any i can attempt to get out of with my credits. basically, how many core classes would i have to take a semester vs. classes that i can pick? the thought of the core scares me a bit, especially since amherst's open curriculum means i can take literally any class i want to take. the core is also a bit problematic because i'm unsure as of now what i want to major in, so i'm not sure that i'll have a lot of room for experimentation. an additional part of the academic thing is the quintessential liberal arts college vs. research university debate--teachers here are very helpful/accessible and care a lot, whereas i remember once how one of my friends at columbia couldn't get help with a physics question because there were too many other people in the room. i'm not sure if the difference here is really big enough to mean anything though. moreover, if i decide to pursue neuroscience, the laboratories at columbia are definitely much, much better than amherst's. 

finally, i'm pretty worried about leaving my friends behind/making new friends at columbia, especially as an incoming sophomore. amherst is ~4 hours away from nyc, so i could visit my friends (and will do so if i transfer), but it's not going to be the same. i do have a couple friends at columbia, so i won't be going in completely friendless, but i'm also scared that i won't manage to carve out my own friend niche. idk i guess i'm hesitant for a repeat of my first semester of college where i was pretty miserable with my social prospects. this is probably the biggest thing holding me back from transferring, but i also feel like it's kind of a stupid reason? one of my friends actually told me the other day that if it was the only thing holding me here, that i should definitely go to columbia. like i'm sure i'll be able to make friends at columbia. AHHH i dunno i'm so indecisive. and my friends here are such great people.

ultimately, i guess the three most important factors for me are a) location (nyc  &gt; amherst), b) core curriculum vs. open curriculum (open &gt; core), and c) friends (eh.....). lately it's been boiling down to a nyc vs. friends here debate with the curriculum thing being tangential, so i guess i came largely to get some of my academics concerns cleared up. any advice about any of this would be greatly appreciated, however, especially from any columbia transfer students that came from small liberal arts colleges in the middle of nowhere."
3aszvd,1,2015-06-23,"I have to write this feeling down, if nothing else just to document it for future reference",BinghamL,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3aszvd/i_have_to_write_this_feeling_down_if_nothing_else/,"I'm 25, male. Today was my first day of my first internship. Long story short, this material is super complex compared to anything I've learned in school. I'm in my last year for computer science, not that it's very relevant.

I barely slept the night before due to both nerves and a much earlier start than I'm used to. Figured it would all get better after the first day.

Well, it's now midnight here, and I have to wake up at 5. I'm wide awake, my heart is beating hard, and slightly fast. I'm exhausted, but when I lay and think of nothing to try to sleep I start to freak out about.. nothing. I can't pinpoint it. I even cried for an hour tonight. I'm a 25 year old, 6'8 man crying for no reason. It's ridiculous and I get so frustrated when this happens, which only perpetuates everything that's already negative about this situation.

This happens about every few weeks to a month, but this instance is the worst it's been yet. Every negative feeling I have in my life, relevant or not, is magnified and suddenly becomes an issue whether I can do anything about it or not. I feel like a massive pity party and it's embarrassing even for me to write this.

I'm a pretty fortunate person. Decently successful, nothing that makes me physically unattractive in general, good friends, family. Yet tonight, I'm missing my mother and dog terribly, haven't seen them in almost 2 years (lives in different state), I feel sorry for my dad because of the disease he's lived with his whole life and it's starting to catch up to him. The next time he goes to the hospital for it he's not likely to make it I feel completely overwhelmed with the next 9 weeks of my life in this internship, and I don't have enough money or time to change majors, so it's do or die. I even don't feel safe from myself with my gun in my room. I'm getting rid of it first thing tomorrow, and it's disabled for now. I'm not trying to hint at anything, I just don't want a gun around when I'm feeling this way. I don't want to make any decisions I can't reverse, and this situation seems to be getting more intense lately. I don't like the mixture of unpredictability and weapons.

I've tried many techniques to avoid this situation and to make falling asleep as easy as possible for myself. I exercise regularly, watch what I eat, I turn off all blue light 30 minutes before bed, and leave at least an hour to unwind at the end of the day. I've tried different temperatures in my room, too.

I'm making mountains out of mole hills. I know that when I calm down and read this I'm going to cringe so hard. When people reply to this I'm going to feel so awkward. I've always had a hard time accepting help or gifts, or generosity of any kind. This is really hard for me to talk about because when I'm finally able to take a step back it's like I'm just being a big baby about everything. But this time is so much worse than any before, I have to at least get it out there. Maybe someone knows a way to confront this that I don't. Or maybe the embarrassment of posting this will show the calm version of me how truly disruptive this is, and force me to find a solution instead of putting it off.

I'm just rambling on now because I'm nervous to hit submit. I don't know what the goal of my posting this is, but for some reason at this moment I feel like I need to do it. So, sorry if it's random and what not. You don't have to respond, I won't be offended and I'll still be able to read it later when I calm down.

3atoi6,2,2015-06-23,My [25 M] girlfriend [25 F] of 1.5 years nearly cheated on me. Help me process the feels?,thx_intrnt_strangers,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3atoi6/my_25_m_girlfriend_25_f_of_15_years_nearly/,"I didn't think I would need to rely on the kindness of you wonderful internet strangers at /r/relationships, but here I am. My girlfriend and I go to the same small-town medical school, and have been dating for 1.5 years. We are doing long-distance only for the summer - she stayed back near school and I moved 1,000 miles away to a major city to pursue an unbeatable research internship. I moved away three weeks ago. There has been some uncertainty in our relationship since I left town, which makes me feel partially to blame for what happens next. She's been asking me if our relationship is going to last forever, and I am very honest and tell her that we need to live together first and date for longer before we decide to be together forever (i.e. get married). She has a hard time dealing with my uncertainty.

Fast forward to this (June 20) Saturday night. My girlfriend tells me she's going downtown to go out and drink with a very close group of school friends who I trust immensely. Now, meet Guy #1 and Guy #2  - they are not in this close group of friends but rather acquaintances that we both know from school. We both say ""hi"" to, and are cordial with Guys #1 and #2 at school. She is taking the 1-hour train to downtown with Guy #1. Her and I have always trusted each other to hang out with friends of the opposite sex, with no issue thus far. 

Her and Guy #1 drink a lot on the train to downtown. Her and Guy #1 then meet up with my group of close friends and go to bars together. Guy #2 shows up to hang out with Guy #1. I know Guy #2 better than Guy #1. He recently reached out via Facebook to ask for school advice. My girlfriend starts getting flirty with Guy's #1 and #2 (in front of my group of close friends). Apparently she's dancing with one or both of them, sitting on lap (s) and holding hand(s). Guy #2 tries to kiss her at some point and she gives him her cheek. My close friends drive everyone home from downtown (Guys #1 and #2 included) and she falls asleep on Guy #1's shoulder, holding his hand.

She was very unreachable via phone Saturday night so I was extremely worried about her and barely slept. Sunday morning she calls me crying and admits to all of the above. She is extremely apologetic for disrespecting me and we discuss ending the relationship. Eventually we decide that we're good for each other, and this was just a temporary lapse of judgement - perhaps brought on by my uncertainty about our future. We decide to stay together and let this eventually strengthen our relationship. 

Now I have these feelings to deal with. Since Sunday morning I've had this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It feels like I've been stabbed in the stomach, and it just hurts so bad.  There's also this tinge of uncertainty about events of that night - I only got her side of the story and she was near blacked-out drunk. I want to ask my close friends about what they saw happening with Guy #1 and Guy #2, but this feels like a breach of trust with her, and I don't know if I really want to know what happened. How do I deal with the hurt and the uncertainty? The only thing I've found that helps is meditating, and going to the gym. It's especially difficult because I'm so far away. Do I ask my friends what they saw? How long will it take to heal? When I talk to her about the events of the weekend it hurts even worse, so I don't really know how she can help me sort out this pain. I told her I'm hurting because of what she did and I just need to heal on my own. 
   
**tl;dr: Girlfriend drunkenly flirts with acquaintances from school while I'm not around. We work through it together but now I'm left with all this hurt. How do I deal with the pain and uncertainty about what transpired?**



**Edit: Update. Found out she made out with the dude, multiple times. Broke up with her yesterday.**"

I have experience working in tourism, speak 3 languages, but every single job here requires a college degree, which takes like 4 years and a shit ton of money I don't have. I had unemployment benefits for about 1 month, which was only 180 euro a month, and I had to do production work for it. And they have this ridiculous rule, that you cannot deny jobs, so I got offered a full time nonpaid ''catering internship'' at the cafeteria from the place I do production work at. So the offer is basically, working 40 hours a week for 180 euro a month, yeah, you do the math. I politely denied it and my benefits stopped. 

I tried getting a college education but the ones I signed up for denied me, probably because they have a shit ton of applicants and not enough room for everyone.

Anyone got any advice for jobs that might suit me? I would move to another country but I have lots of equipment that are too big and heavy to move and of course no money.

I'm still studying, 12 classes left and i'm out, my school is the most prestigious one in my country but i feel its really really bad(made a few posts about it before), everything i've known now games from internet/online courses/books so two years ago i started doing internships and freelance projects from bad to better, so on and so on, now i've worked in pretty big companies in my city and at the government as a software developer intern, pretty bad paid all the time, so i wanted to try abroad and i did through a well known student organization, i've found great companies and i got response from most of them after i applied, one of them was really great to me.

so i got in touch, i passed the first three stages and then they wanted to do three more stages on me

**What happened**

I gotta be honest i really really wanted to get in there, my problem was that i can do web development pretty well with my current skills but they asked me about data structures and algorithms and when i had that class at university my profesor was really really bad, we didnt really saw anything in there, what i learned came from online and reading so...
i feel really bad right now

i knew i had to prepare last night but my friends and girlfriend came over and they didn't leave until really really late and now im struggling with the fact that the company rejected me at the semi-last stage, i dont know what to do now because i've applied to other companies before and the process is really slow but i feel really down right know, i feel that i need to study more and practice more but at the same time i want to be in a better environment to develop myself professionally better

i want to keep coding but at the same time now i know i have to study over again datastructures and algorithms"

My project description is that I have a folder with about 150 files in it. The number of files in the folder can change. My vba program needs to open the first file in this folder and find the last line that has a specific phrase (let's say ""chicken"" is the word it's looking for. The last row it's mentioned in is not necessarily the last row in the text file nor is it in the same row number in all the files.  Once it finds the word it needs to take specific data from that line and put it in a new row in a new worksheet. Once it's done that it needs to close the file and move (not copy or save as) it to a separate folder. The code must then open the next file in the folder until this is done with all the files and the folder is empty.  My question is is this even possible?

I graduated just over a year ago with a BA in economics and government (double major), my focuses were in energy economics and national security. 

After graduating I briefly held a paid internship working with a lobby focused on a niche sector of renewable energy before leaving prematurely to accept a full-time job offer at a Fortune 150 company working in economics, though in the real estate sector. 

I've been working at the company for eight months now, and they've invested a lot of time and money in me, including a very high compensation and benefits package. 

Last week I received unsolicited contact from a smaller company offering an equally competitive compensation and benefits package working in the energy economics and renewable energy policy sector--fields of study I am more interested in. The recruiter does work for that company, so my hunch is that they're trying to poach me. (note this not an official job offer, but could potentially be one, and I have no experience dealing with a situation like this, so, of course, everything below is hypothetical)

Is eight months too soon to leave a company to risk being labeled a ""job-hopper?"" Moreover, my working group just hired a mid-level analyst and this would mean leaving would require my working group to hire and train an entry-level analyst at the same time as workflow increases--I don't want to screw anyone over and burn a bridge.

My current plan is to return to school to get an advanced degree within a year-and-a-half, and I'm worried switching jobs now would force me to delay that by at least another eight months to avoid being labeled. (unless being poached to a new job isn't a risk I need to worry about or explain)

Assuming I complete my due diligence and I determine the work culture and people at this second company are a great fit for me, they want to move within the next two weeks have me make a decision. I don't know what to do. 

Also, general advice on what to do and how to approach this situation would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone!

My company has struggled financially since I came on-board, and after hearing ""we might close"" a few times over, I'm exhausted and ready to do something else. While I enjoy HR, it's not viable for the area I'm in. In fact, not much is beyond truck driving and minimum wage fast food jobs. 

Enter learning to code. I don't want to treat this as a magic key to career success, *but* there are some serious appeals given that it can open the door to more flexible employment-- remote/telework, contract, etc. I like to collect as much information about any given decision before I do anything, so here I am.

One question I haven't been able to answer based on my search of this subreddit is whether to teach myself: full-time (as in, quit my job), part-time (as in, work a PT job), or during my free time (no quitting, 2-3 hrs/night + weekends)? My fiance's salary can support us both, gratefully, and we have very low monthly bills. He thinks I should learn full-time and that a PT job would basically break even because it'd be minimum wage with a long commute. As the person potentially quitting her salaried job, I am definitely feeling the risk of leaping toward this challenge, despite being excited by it. Of course, my company may go under and decide for me anyway...

Possibly relevant facts: 26, female, bachelors and masters in religion/ethics, minor experience with HTML (LiveJournal &amp; AngelFire, lol) and playing with Ruby on a code academy type site.

**TL;DR Do I learn to code while unemployed or employed?**

EDIT: I should mention that I am *not* interested in pursuing another degree. I feel pretty topped off at two, not because of the financial aspect, but because I understand from others that it's possible to teach myself and find a job (or an internship, then a job, etc.)."
3autjk,1,2015-06-23,The Plight of the Intern,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3autjk/the_plight_of_the_intern/,"Someone whose name you don’t know comes up to your desk. 

He or she starts saying a name that is not yours, but catches his or her self mid way. Kind of like “Ryyyyyya, Oh sorry your name is Mike. Michael. I am Fred” 

You are one of the interns right? Yeah, Bob told me about you, as he answers his own question.  (You think to yourself. Who the fuck is bob? I have been here two years and there are only 5 people in this office and apparently now there is a Bob and a Fred)

After a little bit of mental problem solving and a few awkward seconds, Fred looks you in the eyes and asks you the two questions that every single intern has learned to fear. 

1)	“Hey are you busy?”

And 

2)	“Can you do me a favor?”

Every alarm is going off in your body. You literally cringe in your chair but you can show Fred how you really feel so you pretend like it is a back crap. What could this man want? I didn’t even know he existed 2 minutes ago let alone know what on earth Fred does. 
Is it accounting based? Fuck I haven’t done accounting since freshman year. All I learned in that class was how to play cube runner and look like I was struggling in class every time I crashed so the teacher would pity me and give me a better grade as the end of the semester. 

Wait, I am in the marketing program. Maybe he will ask me to look at some logos or something.  I can do that. People love the color red. If he asks me what color I think looks good. I am just going to say red. That will drive sales and everyone will be happy.  We sell oranges though. Red oranges?? Fuck it, I will say that we can have Marc Eco to sponsor them. People love his shit for some reason.
 
Holy crap he is holding a tablet! I hate tablets. My fingers are too fat to type on the touch screen. It will take me a year to write a page. Little does Fred know that is pretty much holding the equivalent of the nuclear football in in his sweaty hand. If he punches in the go codes and tries to hand that bomb to me, I am putting in my two-second notice and PTFOing. By the grace of god, Fred opens his satchel and safely stows away and football. My life has been spared. I live to work another day.

After all of these thoughts raced around in my head for what in reality was only and awkward three-second pause, I look Fred right in the eyes as if I was peering into this man’s blacked corporate soul and said, “No I am not busy. What do you need?” At this point I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. He digested my words for what seemed like an eternity as a sole bead of sweat appeared on my forehead. His mouth started to move and the utterance of first word made my heart skip a beat. 

“Change” Change what??? Seats? My socks? Do they smell? My lifestyle? How much does Fred know about me? WHO IS FRED!! This man cracked me with out even trying. “Change the” Fred you better fucking tell me right now what has to be changed or I literally may die. “Change the Coffee Filter”. The coffee filter…?

 I let my mind process this unexpected request.  What I say next will make or break my relations with Fred for the rest of my internment. I took a hot second to compose myself and said “ Yeah, sure it’s no problem.”

Did he take the bait? Does he now think that I am so confident in changing the coffee filter that I could do it with my eyes closed? Like Moses waiting to find the holy hand, I waited for Fred to acknowledge what I said as coolly as possible. He smiled and walked away. By the grace of god I made it through my first encounter with him.

Just as Fred rounded the corner to his office and closed the door, a first year intern came back from the bathroom. I looked him with a smirk that screamed, “I own your soul” and simply said, “Fred told me to tell you to change the coffee filter as soon as possible. He wants his coffee. Now.”

I am currently working as an SAP Consultant for Deloitte and I don't really think I want to go this way. So I am considering the switch to Auditing. I thought about talking to a current employe in that area as a networking idea. Anybody done this before or know if it is possible?

* What level (intern, Associate,Consultant, Senior, Partner) of hierarchy should I approach and how (Lets meet up for a coffe; lets go for a meal; approach him in a Deloitte public Event;etc)? 

* Indirect approach through the internal message system (link/Internal skype)?

* What type of questions can I ask that do not hurt my current position but give me the information to get closer or even achieve the switch?

* Do I have to consider the relationship between my actual boss and the person I am approaching?

* May a “simple conversation” backfire me eventhough I am just an intern?

* Do this outside my current firm (other big 4s, MS, Evai,etc.)if yes, do I mention the company I am interested in leaving if they are interested in me?

First I’d like to mention that all of these documents reside on a server, not any single computer. Not sure if that may have anything to do with it.

I have a master workbook that is updated about once a month with new training plans at the company I am interning for. It consists of a column “Training” and several columns of “Training Plans” for each of those trainings (2014 training plan, 2015 training plan, 2016..., etc.). In another column, I use a MAX formula to choose the most recent training issue date in that training's row.

There are approximately 20 separate department workbooks that all have different combinations of these trainings along with the names of the employees in each department. I won’t go into detail as to the other formulas I am using to calculate which employees are overdue for training unless it is deemed necessary, however all of these formulas use “Training Issue Date” cells for their calculations. These cells use VLOOKUP to find the name of the column’s training in the master workbook, then MATCH to find the most recent training issue date. This is the current formula I’m using:

=VLOOKUP(F$1,'masterworkbook.xlsx'!Table3[#Data],MATCH(""Most Recent Training Date"",'masterworkbook.xlsx'!Table3[#Headers],0),0)

The issue I keep coming across is that the department workbooks will only update the VLOOKUP values when the master workbook is open. Unfortunately that can’t happen because 20 different department managers are not supposed to access the master workbook. Every time I or another user opens up a department workbook there is a popup message asking if you'd like to update links or not (links need to be updated for our purposes), then it will say that it cannot update the links. Additionally, if I manipulate those VLOOKUP cells in any way they return a #REF! error.

I have tried editing the data link startup prompt to “automatically update” to no avail.

If this is hard to understand or confusing in any way please let me know and I’ll try to re-word it. As I am an intern I’m unsure of company policy/security for sharing files to aid in explaining my issue. If anyone knows a formulaic or possible VBA workaround to this issue it would be much appreciated!"

* Primarily League of Legends and games coming out in the next 2 years.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* 500 euro's for the case alone is my maximum.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Estimate 2 to 3 weeks

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Only the case

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* The Netherlands

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* None, from scratch

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I prefer to keep it stock till the end of use.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* 500GB of space is enough for me. I won't be downloading a lot, if there is a nice alternative since I don't need much space I would be glad to hear (like a SSD, I don't know).

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* The smaller the case the better with low noise levels. No LED's, since I don't like fancy things. I would like to keep it as simple as possible, only the intern hardware matters for me.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* No, I already own an OS(64bit).

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Help will be appreciated, thanks in advance. :)"

Personally, I made a bootable USB drive with a copy of TAILS linux on it for emergency purposes on the off chance I have to communicate with someone, or research something morally or legally questionable.

3avblp,5,2015-06-23,Current Progress on my Smite SPL app,TheDARKz999,Smite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/3avblp/current_progress_on_my_smite_spl_app/,"Hi everyone! I know there have been a flurry of posts about a smite app recently. I made a comment in the post with the UI designs about a week or two ago. So I figured I would come here and talk about what things look like at the moment from my projects standpoint. I am sorry if this turns out to be a little bit technical!

So first off all data that we are allowed to pull is from the HiRez's REST API. This and all of the legal information binding to it can be found on http://www.hirezstudios.com/hi-rez/legal/. The documents that are included in that page talk about the limits that are put on developers in terms of sessions, call limits and publishing information. Feel free to peruse as you wish, and if anyone else is working on an app you basically have to read it.

So time to get to what I am working on.

I was originally going to create basically a smite guru style app, but people kept talking about an SPL app so I decided to focus more on that style. HOWEVER, everything that I have coded so far can be used for either app style.

The first step was to create a system that controls the sessions you use to talk to hirez so that you don't go over your limit and get throttled. Which, for those who care, I wrote in PhP. After which I then started to pull from the API. This is when I found a bug in the SPL data call the API to not be able to pull data from SPL matches that happened in the same day. This was problematic because it caused me to not be able to pull as close to ""live"" data as I could. Thanks to Hirez APC we were able to get that sorted out in about a week. 

As of two days ago my web backend now pulls and stores all SPL data, this means that I never go near the request and session limit because I only pull from hirez when new data is available. 

This is where the fun part happens. At this point any app that uses my API wrapper either ios/windows/android can pull from the data I have stored and it makes it a little bit more simple to get the exact data that they want without worrying about sessions, tokens, and limits.

So at this point, the only thing left to do is design the UI for the apps then implement the backends of each local phone type. I have started the IOS backend already. I have a lightweight networking library that I wrote for a previous job that I have implemented with my wrapper. I am trying to make it so that you can customize what kind of SPL data that you see and how you see it. I think it should be pretty awesome.

Now here is the catch. I currently work a shitty retail job, a programming internship, and I have some summer classes. I basically code this at night when I can't sleep. There are a few people that have mentioned that they would either start working on one or have already started working on one. To them I say I would be more than willing to make a git repo of the code that I have made for both the php and iOS and have us all start working together. I have already private messaged the creator of the UI post and the other guy who posted today offering to work together. 

I hope that one way or another either if it myself or someone else that we can get something out to the community.

TLDR: Making a smite app, and do not have that much time to work on it. Would love to team up with people.


Thanks guys!

3avdnd,11,2015-06-23,I don't trust myself anymore.,MauPow,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3avdnd/i_dont_trust_myself_anymore/,"(Caution: This is going to get rambly)

I know that I'm a good person. I like myself in general. I think I'm interesting, have some good hobbies, and I'm pretty outgoing. I've never had drug addictions, never hurt anybody, never tried to hurt myself. But it seems like nothing that I do ever pans out, and I'm afraid to even try anymore. The feeling of success is a foreign thing to me.

 I followed the regular path in life, got decent grades, and even felt like I was going places in college where I was on the student government and was invited for special projects in my school (Journalism). But even those failed. I wasn't able to complete my duties to the government, and my part in the projects always failed no matter how hard I tried, it just wasn't good enough.

 After school I went abroad to live in Europe for a few years under the guise of broadening my horizons and a fun time, but really I was just running from my depression in shame, hoping it would be better once I was in a different place. Well, it wasn't.

Everyone around me thinks I'm doing fine, but I feel like I'm that person that no one notices until they do something seriously self destructive.

I've been living at my mom's for almost 2 years now. I tried a few internships in the journalism field, but nothing came of those, and I didn't even get any decent connections. Not like it's a lucrative field anyways. Now I'm working at a food delivery company as a self employed driver, which totally sucks because I have to use my car, which is constantly breaking down. 

I bought a ticket back to Europe a couple weeks ago on a manic whim. I then came to a revelation that I shouldn't run from my problems anymore, and decided not to go. Turns out I forgot to buy cancellation insurance so I'm basically out another $700 and might not be able to fix my car, which isn't really drivable right now, and which I need for my job. I also have $11,000 in student loan debt that is killing my credit, which is in the low 500s. I didn't have anything to do with college tuition, and I'm trying to get my dad to figure it out, but he's busy with his own stuff and never has time to look at it. Meanwhile I get collections notices and my bank account is about to be garnished. 

I'm 27 years old and I have to run to my parents every few weeks for help. I don't know how I could ever move out. I don't even pay rent. Every decision I ever make seems like the wrong one. I look at my track record while trying to make the next decision and I lose all hope. I'm hopeless. Everyone else my age I know has a decent to good job, they're saving money for retirement, investing, going out, having fun, while I struggle at this shitty job and fall further into depression. As I write this I'm waiting for my mom to get home so I can use her car for my job. All I do now is play video games, surf reddit, and make half hearted attempts at job searching until I give up when there's nothing I could conceivably see myself doing. 

I have no idea what I want to do from life, or what I want from it. I've never had a real romantic relationship, just a lot of fairly meaningless sex and month long flings. The world feels empty and like there's no place in it for me. I went to a therapist for a few weeks and all she could tell me is that I seem great and things will look up for me soon. But I've been like this for pretty much all of my teenage and adult life. I don't feel like a part of anything. I have friends but they hardly ever call me to hang out, no matter how many times I call them and we have a great time together. Whenever I feel like I've just had a great time with people and was totally in the moment, I go and look at the pictures and think how ugly and awkward I looked and feel terrible about myself again. I wonder why anyone would want anything to do with me and how I don't look like a normal upstanding 27 year old guy who would have a good job, girlfriend, and his shit together. Everyone always tells me I'm good looking, I'm tall, not fat, but I never get any real attention from girls. I try to dress well but when I see myself I think I look stupid. 

Fuck, I dunno. Anyone able to glean anything from this pile of whining? "

Hi, The title says it all, I want to improve my JS skills.
I've been employed for about 2 Years now, As a full time programmer, (Been testing mostly), Now, I think I've been loyal more than necessary, Meaning, I haven't been studying/trying to improve my knowledge withing core working hour.

Now, I have a lot of free time (no tasks assigned to me since a week so far), So, I wanted to improve my js skills to get better tasks in the future ( I don't want to spend the rest of my life testing.).

The problem I am facing is "" I don't know what I don't know"", So, picked ""Beginning JavaScript 4th edition"" (based upon javascriptissexy.com's advice) and I noticed that I know quite a lot of theory already, And I studied computer engineering, so, I believe I am full of theory, and many resources/blogs recommend getting involved in Open-source project to get better at what you do. well, That turned out to be much difficult than I anticipated. 

I am trying really hard to find a JS projects to get involved with (If that is the best way to get better skills, If not, Feel free to correct/advice me) with no luck, Many projects needs people to write documentation/tests, but that is not what I am after..

I am a passionate programmer, and I really want PURE programming, not testing or documentation.

3aw2rz,1,2015-06-23,"Beyond Money, How Much Support Should VCs Give Startups?",winstonl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3aw2rz/beyond_money_how_much_support_should_vcs_give/,"In the New Yorker’s cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.

One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16z’s portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.

“We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years,” Andreessen said.

It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as “service agencies” that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?

Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they don’t know what they don’t know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.

To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external – consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.

The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).

But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.

This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.

For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways – e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.

What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

More: Here are some other thoughts on whether VCs should provide additional services:
– Openview Venture Partners’ Kyle Lacy on why it makes sense for VCs to provide value-added services
– Vidyard’s Michael Litt on the importance of selecting the right VC.

Parintii unei prietene de-a sorei mele au plecat o saptamana in concediu, asta chipurile nu voia sa stea singura, si sora-mea a invitat-o la noi. Tipa are 16 ani. Eu am acceptat, crezand ca e vreo veverita de-a ei cu care oricum nu voi avea prea multe interactiuni. Aparent m-am inselat...

In primul rand e buna, aka futabila aka nu as ezita sa o urc pe tester daca ar avea cu 2 ani mai mult. In al doilea rand se da la mine, la modul grav.

Totul a inceput duminica, cand a venit. Initial nu am observat nimic suspect, in afara de faptul ca era buna. Spre seara insa, cand s-a schimbat in pijama, si-a tras o pijama din aia sexy gen rochita, care nu acopera mare lucru, si nici macar nu avea chiloti. La modul ca daca s-ar fi aplecat, i-as fi vazut floricica in toata splendoarea ei. Nu as fi avut o mare problema cu asta, daca nu s-ar fi plimbat excesiv prin casa, de fiecare data trecand prin fata mea, eu stand pe /r/romania si incercand sa-l calmez pe mini me. 

Luni dupa-amiaza am fost impreuna cu ea si sora-mea sa-si ia niste lucruri de acasa. A insistat sa stea in fata, langa mine. Pe drum, a avut niste conversatii cu sora-mea, chestii de adolescente, nu am prea bagat de seama, pana am observat ca au inceput sa discute ceva despre sani, iar apoi, din senin, ma intreaba ce fel de sani ma excita la o femeie. I-am dat un raspuns evaziv, sa ma scot din situatie, ea a inceput sa rada, in acelasi timp atingandu-mi mana de pe schimbator intr-un mod foarte pervers.

Luni seara, m-am pus sa ma uit la un film, sora-mea se culcase deja, asta a venit la mine in pijamaua ei perversa si m-a intrebat daca poate sa se uite si ea cu mine la film. Ca sa nu fiu nesimtit, i-am zis ca poate, desi stiam ca s-a dus pe pula tot filmul, pentru ca nu aveam cum sa fiu atent la el, cu asta practic in pizda goala, langa mine. La inceput, s-a plasat la o distanta rezonabila fata de spatiul meu personal, insa putin cate putin a inceput sa mi-l invadeze, pana m-am trezit ca isi pune capul pe umarul meu. In acel moment stiam ca am doar doua variante, ori o fut, ori ii dau eject in camera sora-mii. Am ales a doua varianta.

Astazi a fost punctul culminant, cand a trebuit sa fac eforturi supra-omenesti ca sa ma abtin s-o fut. Dupa ce am venit de la lucru, nu am observat nimic suspect si pret de cateva ore chiar am crezut ca renuntat la idee. Evident, m-am inselat. Pe la 7 seara, sora-mea a iesit in oras cu prietenu-sau, au invitat-o si pe asta, insa a refuzat spunand ca ea vrea sa-si faca un dus si sa se uite la nu stiu ce serial. 

Eu m-am pus linistit sa ma uit la un documentar. Tipa, s-a plimbat putin prin casa, si-a lasat telefonul in sufragerie, adica unde eram eu si s-a bagat la dus. Dupa vreo 20 de minute, a iesit numai in prosop, a venit si si-a luat telefonul. S-a pus ea sa-si usuce parul si sa se schimbe, dupa care vine din nou langa mine, chipurile curioasa de documentarul pe care il priveam. Am inchis rapid documentarul si m-am bagat in Xcode, sperand ca o voi plictisi si determina sa plece. Ea insa a inceput sa-mi puna tot felul de intrebari despre viata mea, invadandu-mi, in acelasi timp, spatiul personal. 

Pentru ca nu eram in stare sa scriu nici un rand de cod in starea in care eram, ca sa nu par penibil ca nu fac nimic decat sa belesc ochii in monitor, am inchis laptopul si m-am lasat pe spate, continuand discutia cu minora. Imediat ce m-am lasat pe spate, tipa a inceput sa-mi bage mana prin par, iar in acel moment rational croco a pierdut batalia. M-am intors cu fata spre ea, am sarutat-o, am luat-o in brate, fierbea de ziceai ca are febra tifoida si totul s-a transformat intr-un makeout session in toata regula. Norocul meu a fost ca dupa vreo 3 minute, inainte ca lucrurile sa escaleze prea tare, a venit si telefonul salvator. Un amic (culmea, curvar notoriu), m-a sunat sa-mi spuna ca si-a pierdut toti banii la pacanele si nu mai are bani de taxi sa ajunga acasa. In mod normal l-as fi trimis in pizda ma-sii, insa a fost oportunitatea perfecta sa ma scot din cacat. 

Dupa ce m-am intors, venise si sora-mea, situatia se mai calmase, insa trebuie sa mai rezist pana duminica cu posibilul dosar penal in casa. Asadar roddit, ce masuri credeti ca ar trebui sa iau?

TL;DR Sora-mea si-a adus o prietena sa stea o saptamana la mine, e buna in draci si se da la mine, insa are 16 ani si prefer sa nu. "
3aw78c,16,2015-06-23,How I got hired right after college,adoucett,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/3aw78c/how_i_got_hired_right_after_college/,"Greetings /r/GIS - 

I write this to you not as a brag, but hopefully as encouragement to anyone who is interested in GIS down the road, or any recent graduates who are still job-searching.

&amp;nbsp;

First, a little about my undergraduate career: 
I started off in atmospheric sciences, at a school with a strong program in this area, with the hope of being a meteorologist. While I was fascinated with the subject, a few of the classes (particularly in mathematics) were proving difficult enough for me that It was holding back my progression in the major. While this was going on however, I started taking classes in GIS and really loved it. I also was slowly learning that maybe meteorology, while a passion, wasn't what I wanted to do for work per say.

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up transferring from that school after Sophomore year, to another, for various reasons, and in doing so also switched majors. During the summers, just having the basic GIS knowledge from those first couple classes got me an internship with the city helping with various GIS projects. It wasn't great pay, or extremely inventive work, but it did get me some real work experience which helped build my resume.


My new program was in Earth Systems, which thankfully had the same physical science prerequisites as meteorology (year of Physics...chem...calc...etc) and with the majority of my ""Gen ed"" requirements filled from transfer credits, I was mostly taking courses in my major. At my school, the Earth Systems major was pretty much balanced between courses from the geography faculty and the geology faculty, so I ended up getting a pretty broad overview. 

&amp;nbsp;


While I never took another GIS Lab during this time (They really only offered basic GIS courses and I already had that coming in), I did whatever I could to improve my grasp of GIS and integrate it into everything I could. I took remote sensing which exposed me to a whole new suite of software and tools, a masters level GIS literature review seminar with an ecology focus, and took on an independent study where I was able to design my own project over the course of a semester. While I wasn't necessarily taking ""GIS"" classes, I incorporated the skills I already had (and was learning) into every other class I could -- for class presentations in urban geography, Hydrocarbon (fracking) Issues, economics, Environmental policy, senior year writing, and others that weren't *requiring* GIS but had the potential to use it independently to produce something for the class or an assignment. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I graduated I was able to say that not only did I learn the basics, but was able to already apply those skills to a variety of fields. Having a strong resume is going to help you get noticed. Even if you didn't have a paid position, just taking on some sort of project, even if completely independent, is going to set you apart. Come up with a research question and try to answer it for yourself, putting together some solid maps in the process. 

&amp;nbsp;

I applied to a few different positions, and ended up having several interviews for one in particular (didn't lead to an offer), but for the most part, I just wasn't hearing back from most of them. I was extremely excited when one of my prospective employers called me in for an interview. I came to the interview well rehearsed on the company, *their needs*, with printed materials including resume, references, and a portfolio of 4-5 example maps I had created, from a variety of applications. In addition to this, I had an online portfolio set up with a bunch of my work on display, including research papers. 

&amp;nbsp;

I still consider myself extremely lucky, but I found out last week that I got the job! I just wanted to share what I did to help others who are still trying to figure everything out...because being there, even for only a few months, was really scary.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR&gt;** 

* Build experience, especially interesting projects you can talk about on your resume and in an interview.
* While still in school, apply your GIS to every class you can, even if it seems unrelated at first.
* Create a portfolio (both print and online) of your maps. You could even create some just for this purpose.
* Think about what skills you can bring, in addition to being a map monkey, to your prospective company and emphasize them. 
* If you weren't taught a GIS/related skill in a particular class, learn it on your own. Then emphasize how you self-taught that skill during a job interview.
* **APPLY EARLY!** Scan the job boards and try to apply as soon as possible when a new position opens. The pile of applicants begins to grow rapidly and if you are one of the first few to apply, your chances of getting noticed are exponentially increased. Even if you are the most experienced and qualified applicant for the job, if you are the 200th person to apply, there's a good chance you won't get noticed at all.


I'm happy to answer any questions although I'm by no means an expert yet. "

I just moved back home and will be finishing my fourth year online while I complete an internship here in Toronto. All of my friends are back where I went to University so I am looking to make a couple new friends to hang with on the weekend. I like to go to clubs and bars, but I don't necessarily know how to make new friends there if I go alone. 

If anyone knows good places to meet people in their early 20s I would appreciate it!"
3awfvs,2,2015-06-23,Firm wants me to stay on longer as intern before full time start date. Advice?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3awfvs/firm_wants_me_to_stay_on_longer_as_intern_before/,"I interned at a firm during busy season, was given a full time offer with a start date in late fall. They later contacted me after a few weeks asking if I could come back to help them for the summer as an intern. I had been planning on doing my best to pass all four parts of the CPA exam before my start date and had scheduled all the exams before they approached me. They were kind of hazy on when the end date would be, but said July so I figured why not. As crazy as it sounded, a part of me missed the work and I figured it might kick start my studying a bit. I accepted and moved the exam dates around to make things work. 


About a month and a half back for the summer, I was approached again about the possibility of me staying on until my start date. Essentially helping them out for the 9/15 deadline. I politely refused, stating I planned on taking time before my start date to study for the exam. Especially since every single person you meet always tells you to try to do it before you start since trying to do it while working is a pain in the ass. In all honesty, I was struggling with studying and working at the same time. They said that was fine.


I received a phone call a few weeks later proposing another possibility where I stay till September and move my start date later down, giving me time to study for the exam during that time. It seemed as if they had lost a preparer for a chunk of clients and needed someone to fill in. 


I'm not sure how I want to answer. If I do accept I'd somehow have to figure out how to pass the exams I've schedule for this exam period while working. If I try to take them after September I'd have to pay for all the exam costs again (I believe my firm only covers the cost the first time you take them), which makes me reluctant to do. I would continue to be paid as just an intern which I guess has it's up and downsides with hourly pay and overtime. I wouldn't receive any of the benefits of a FT employee and won't until later.  


What should I do? Refuse? I feel like they wouldn’t ask me to come back for the summer, and two more times to stay longer unless they really need people and are having trouble filling the spots. Man up, say yes and kill myself to pass the CPA exams during this exam period? Float the idea to them to cover the exam costs if they really want me to push my studying/exams to post-September? I doubt that’d work. Say no…? What would you do in this situation? Any advice is appreciated. "

There is a mandatory speech program for IT/Systems interns. For this program, we have to give a weekly speech about a pre-determined topic in front of our assigned ""speech group"". which is about 8 interns. Only the IT interns have to do this because they feel it's necessary. Why is it necessary? Because apparently every intern fits the computer nerd stereotype of being socially inept. gay gay gay gay gay.

So they gave us a group project where we will meet up with other interns and are given 2 hours to come up with an idea to improve the company that isn't already occurring/in place/been thought of. whatever.

3awq3t,3,2015-06-23,How do my wife and I escape this poor situation?,HowDoWeProceed,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3awq3t/how_do_my_wife_and_i_escape_this_poor_situation/,"**tl;dr**: Wife and I changed life paths, returned to school in our late 20s, and are focusing 100% on academics. My parents offered to ""rent"" us the basement in exchange for household work, and are now treating me like a teenager and trying to control our lives and we do not have the time to properly exit the situation.

**Longer version**: My wife and I are in our late 20s. We both graduated with Bachelors degrees in different fields about 5 years ago. After working in those respective fields for a few years, we both concluded that we are not happy doing those jobs for the rest of our lives, and decided to return to school. One year ago, we moved back to our hometown to go back to college. Considering our very different outlook on life, we both understand that academics is our top priority, and we have both been doing exceptionally well in our classes considering we also have to work enough to maintain our present ""savings"" of around 6 months or so of living. If we lived solely off of savings, we would be out of money completely in 6 months (may be able to stretch that to 8-10 if we started eating purely ramen and never driving anywhere).

My parents kindly offered to allow us to live in their finished basement (which was not being used) for a year, stating that it would mean we would not have to work so much so that we could focus more on school. This means more time for side projects, which means better internship positions and ultimately higher paying jobs upon graduation. Of course, we took them up on their offer as soon as our apartment lease was up.

This was a little over a week ago. This last week has been the most stressful period I have ever dealt with. In short, my parents both have their own issues, are fighting for a divorce, and both seem to think that I am still a 12 year old child, incapable of managing my own time and space. Today, excluding about 15 minutes of driving and 20 minutes for lunch, I spent over 12 hours straight between class, extra academic work with a professor, and a lengthy homework assignment. I decided to play a video game at around 9:30pm, figuring that after 12 hours I had earned an hour of gaming before going to sleep (my wife is at work). My mother walks right into the room, and asks sarcastically ""are you studying?"". When I said that I needed a bit of a mental break and that my time is not hers to manage, she said ""it is while you are living in my house"".

This is absurd. My wife and I are a married adult couple, we have 401k's, own stocks, and have managed teams of people in our respective fields. We have made the hard decision to return to school to have better and happier futures, and have applied the necessary self discipline (that many people lack) to come as far as we have. My parents simply don't speak to my wife, and they treat me like I am still their little kid. The hardest part is that because they see me as a child, they refuse to engage in a mature conversation with me, no matter how much I try.

Obviously we cannot live here anymore...

But we have no idea how to get out. We spent so much time packing our things away in storage (like dishes!) and lost so much by giving away the things that we were sure we wouldn't need (our couch, our dining room table) that we just aren't sure of how to proceed. If we focus solely on finding a new place to live, our academic performance will suffer. We both already only have maybe half a day free each, spread throughout the week. We fell behind a lot in school to get packed up and moved here, and my wife had to trade a lot of shifts that she is now covering. Fortunately, I do freelance work, so my work did not fall behind, but the lack of a steady income makes being sure of what we can commit to affording for a year (rental contract) difficult.

We aren't even sure of where to start. All we want/need is a place to feel safe and secure where we can focus on our schoolwork to make a better future for ourselves. If it weren't so expensive (and they allowed our cat), we could live out of a hotel room for the next few years and be content. All feelings of privacy, safety, and security are gone, and the stress of this situation is already negatively affecting our academic work, our jobs, and our relationship.

Where do we even start?"

I need to mend my heart, he needs to figure his shit out and mend.**

OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3amf1s/me_26f_and_my_bf_25m_having_a_rocky_shortterm/

**Info/BG:** We've been together for 3 years now, we'd spend a lot of time together, with friends or not with friends. FB msg a lot and texting too. During the winter semester at school, he finally landed his dream internship with one of the Big 4's (software development field). The internship is about 3 months long. I'm on the East coast, he's on the West coast.
 

We had talked about how to cope and how to keep in touch and keep the flame going. I had a few breakdowns since and due to my past online relationship with a cheating guy, I have trust issues and I still do now. I find it very difficult to cope with when my bf is out and about town with his new friends (women and men) almost until midnight on the weekends. I know he is def not the kind of person to do cheating but I always end in doubt after pushing away those thoughts.
 

We did try Skype 'dating' and Skype calls daily and some messaging, yet it doesn't seem to satisfy me. I had a small scuffle recently over Skype and talked about it. We only talked in the morning and decided to leave each other some alone time to recuperate from the upsetting talk / anger. He doesn't want it to become a responsibility to talk to me, he wants to enjoy talking to me. 


He recently moved and because we talked about me visiting him after his official moving in to a studio, I was supposed to get his new address and figure something out together so I can visit. That didn't happen yet, he told me that he would link the proper address soon as possible and that was forgotten when he decided to go chat and hang out with people there.

&amp;nbsp;

So that's when the emotional explosion happened onto him. I know I screwed up badly. He's upset and wanted some space for a few days. I decided to go fix my shit, get busy and change the things I do and how I act. Its a long road but I gotta start seriously. The same day in the evening he calls on Skype. He finally opens up to talk slowly and im patient. During the afternoon he apparently talked about our situation to a woman who is also an intern and emotionally got involved and kissed. He tells me there is nothing between them and they both regret it. I told him I'm willing to forgive him because I hurt him as well and I want to fix things. He then says he doesn't want to get hurt anymore but he wanted me to know and still loves me very much and did say he wants to be with me. He is just scared of a reoccurrence because everything was positive until I snapped. 


Some of you may say I'm desperate but after the first year, he is the one for me. He said that he doesn't know how to improve things on his end even it wasn't his fault. He keeps saying he disappointed me. After some time trying to say that I don't want to give up and also want to make things right he said that he doesn't know what he needs to have him trust me again. So I gave him my reasons why and how to trust me again because I'm actively trying to solve my issues. 


He thought about it. We got off Skype because he wanted some time to himself before he can get back to me with an appropriate answer/more opening up.  I'm not sure if it's 100% over. 

&amp;nbsp;

   
**tl:dr**: I screwed up got insecure and exploded on him. He's upset. Asked for space and went kissing a girl. I forgave him because I want to work on the relationship issue. Is this salvageable?

3ax5jh,4,2015-06-24,Quitting Alprazolam Outpatient?,itwillstop8537,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3ax5jh/quitting_alprazolam_outpatient/,"Without going into any details regarding how I became addicted to alp., I would just like to know if it's possible to quit without going to an in-patient rehab. I'm around a year into a 10mg/day addiction and dose twice a day just to starve off the withdrawals.

I went to one out-patient doctor who was a complete idiot that only took a urine test to check that benzo's were in my system. He didn't believe I was taking home-pressed bars and said that he had never heard of that in his 30 years of experience?!

The doctor proceeded to prescribe me 40mg Valium to take a four 10mg pills over the course of a day. He also prescribed me a low dose of some anti-seizure medication I can't recall.

After three days, I began hallucinating from no sleep and had a small seizure, luckily in my bed. At that point, I was scared shitless and went back on alp., because I just couldn't take that torture any longer.

My conclusion to this is, are there decent doctors out there that understand (not naive) that people take home pressed bars and pure alp. powder because psychiatrists will obviously not prescribe 10mg Xanax/day. 

I truly want to quit this more than anything, but I have a very busy life, which will be ruined if I'm in a rehab facility for 2 months. I know how to reduce my dosage and wouldn't relapse, like doctors always assume. Is 10mg/day just too high for out-patient? That's what I'm beginning to think and I will lose scholarships, my job, an amazing internship if they find out and I'm gone for months..."

I am in a program where all interns work part-time during the school year and full time during the summer. There were three other interns on my team when I joined, but one I didn't see for a 5 week period because our work schedules never matched up, but we finally met at the start of the new quarter about 12 weeks ago. We both started full time work last week and have really started to get to know each other better. I now accept that I've developed a crush for my coworker.

We talk, joke, and get along well, have been friends on Facebook for a few weeks already, and have started carpooling to work together as of today. There hasn't been any flirting, and all our conversations have really been friendly, but the amount that I think about this person has lead to me believe that I have a serious crush for them. There haven't been any signs of reciprocation (though I am awful at observation), and I know that I am probably reading into things too much (Things like sitting next to each other at lunch, us looking to the other to decide if we want to go to break at the same time, casually chatting over our office instant messaging system). 

I enjoy our relationship, we enjoy similar things and can make each other laugh, and I don't want to ruin it. I also know its a workplace crush, which adds a level of complexity to things. We report to different managers, though we are on the same team. I need to refer to my workplace's guidelines on this type of relationship, which I can only read at work. It's also worth to note that the nature of our employment also carries through beyond this summer (unlike typical programs), so it's safe to assume that both of us will be working together to at least next summer. 

I really like this person, but I need advice on this situation. I am not very experienced with relationships, and I honestly feel that she's ""out of my league."" I believe I could convince myself to put these feelings to rest with time and necessity, but I also think that developing a relationship with this girl might be something special. I also don't know if I would be willing to transfer to another team if it came to that, and I don't want to jeopardize the positive relationship we have here.

What's some advice on an office crush, with a peer? What's good advice to see if another person might be interested in me? How would I even go to a ""next step,"" from beyond a crush? What if I just want to be a friend in the end? What do I need to do if I need to convince myself to put these feelings to rest?

**tl;dr** I have a crush on a co-intern, don't know if it's possibly reciprocated. Don't know what to do because it's in a workplace, wouldn't know how to get to know this person better if I even wanted to, and if nothing else, I want at least want to be friends with this person."
3axubp,4,2015-06-24,"Artur Mas y su advertencia contra los del ""Sí se puede"" Un fet que no pot passar inadvertit a Podem /Podemos i sobre el que cal reflexionar.",aicneliser,PlazaCatalunya,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlazaCatalunya/comments/3axubp/artur_mas_y_su_advertencia_contra_los_del_sí_se/,"El passat día 20, en Molins de Rei, Artur Mas va fer unes declaracions que haurien de ser analitzades per les implicacions que tenen per a l'estratègia política de Podem / Podem.

http://www.publico.es/politica/artur-mas-inicia-carrera-solitario.html

L'advertiment de l'hereu de Jordi Pujol contra els del ""Sí se puede"" no és el fruit d'una irritació momentània, és part d'una estrategia calculada molt vinculada a la defensa dels interessos dels que manen a Catalunya.

1.- CDC, ERC i UDC fa temps que saben que un discurs que trenqui el maniqueisme ""unionistes versus sobiranistes"", ""obediència catalana versus obediència espanyola"", ""Catalunya contra Espanya"", etc. tenia la possibilitat de connectar amb amplis sectors socials d'exclosos a Catalunya , sectors als que han procurat mantenir fora de la política. Durant tres anys llargs, aquest fet ha estat convenientmente silenciat, i qualsevol que qüestionava el maniqueisme era ridiculitzat i insultat des d'aquestes posicions polítiques.

2.- La victoria d'Ada Colau ha encés les senyals d'alarma. Un increment de la participació amenaça el sistema de ""sufragi censitari"" de facto que va impulsant el projecte neoliberal. L'amenaça es concreta perillosament.

3.- L'advertiment d'Artur Mas té una lectura en clau interna. Avisa que el profitós joc d'escenificacions entre nacionalistes catalans i espanyols, està en perill. Als seus partidaris (i de pas, als altres) els informa d'un nou ""enemic intern"" que trenca les regles del joc i al que cal combatre. És una crida a ""l'unitat nacional"".

4.- En clau externa és una versió actualitzada del costum nacionalista d'atorgar patents de pertinença. Està qualificant als del ""Sí se puede"" como enemics de Catalunya (de la seva, és clar). Una adaptació local del discurs de Rajoy pel que Podemos era una amenaça per a la ""Marca España"".

5.- Interesa molt el recurs de Mas de plantejar ara les dues ""agendes"", la nacional i la social. Mas fa servir parcialment el discurs engegat per la CUP. El fet de que durant quatre anys no s'hagi fet ni una sola menció als conflictes socials a Catalunya, i que ara, de cop, faci aparèixer una ""agenda social"" de la que ningú no tenia notícies. És una altra mostra de que el perill que representem pels que manen no s'ha infravalorat.

6.- També interessa molt destacar que Mas ha evitat identificar a los del ""Sí se puede"" amb Espanya, Madrid, o els tópics nacionalistes habituals. Mas sap que el potencial d'una interpretació ampla del ""dret a decidir"" no es pot conjurar amb els simplismes de sempre. Sap que aquest perill ha de ser anulat per una combinació de confrontació i superació. Un altre punt en comú amb el discurs de Rajoy contra Podemos.

7.- Això marca un terreny a on disputar la hegemonia als nacionalismes,  i uns grups socials amb els que vertebrar-la. Invertint la lògica de la declaració de Mas, es percep que els del ""Sí se puede"" hem d'estar units, respectant els sentiments nacionalistes, però per sobre d'ells. Tota realitat política és una construcció, i Mas posa en evidencia la necessitat de mantenir, reforçar i ampliar els ponts amb les persones que, arreu d'Espanya, treballen contra les polítiques neoliberals. 

Les declaracions de Mas van ser contestades per Ada Colau

3axx33,10,2015-06-24,Birthday is coming up...but I'm sad :(,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3axx33/birthday_is_coming_upbut_im_sad/,"So, first let's get the basics down. I am a 19 year old guy (well, I will be tomorrow).

I didn't know where to post this, but I just feel really bad about myself and reddit always seems kind and supportive to people when they need it. I just came here for the support, even though it's from strangers that don't know me and I probably won't meet, but it'll feel like someone cares enough to show it.

I finished the first year of uni and had plans for an internship right after the finals. However, the guy who ""hired"" me, changed his mind and decided not to tell me, so I just had to find out after dozens of calls and attempts to reach him. So now I have no internship this summer. Which mean I won't have an attractive transfer application (I want to study abroad the final 2 years).

I've been in a sort of depression mood the past few months, but it's a different one because I don't want to waste my time with it. So it's more of an active depression, I still do thing and interact with people. But if you know me, you'd realize I am not okay. As I said that was several months ago, and still non of my family members noticed a thing, At the beginning they probably thought it was just the exam stress, but after that they just assumed it was the norm and that I must be going through a phase (That's the best explanation I could come up with that wouldn't hurt my feeling that much).
A few weeks ago, my sister went into a full depression mode, she's not been out the bed since and barely eats. I'm the only person she still talks to normally. I try to get her out of the mood, but she doesn't want to. But my parents see me as the solution and keep pressuring me and scolding me everyday she's still not okay. And honestly it's hard fighting this depression I have when nobody seems to notice that I have it and demand me to ""fix"" someone else's depression.

Oh, and my GF (my first serious relationship and I do love her) dumped me right after the finals were over. My friends blame me, and because we are in the same friends group she's one of the guys, and they all took her side. She couldn't handle me in this strange form of depression added with the exam stress.

The past 5 years I've been living in my room that was turned into a storage room, I only got a small fraction of the room, just enough for the bed, closet and a path to the door. Every time I try to re-box and clean the room to give myself more space my mom get's sick (she has something with her that affects her health according to her mood, not sure what it's called in English) and I have to get everything back into my room. We're moving soon, so I started doing that again with the excuse of helping the move. But instead of taking the things outside I keep them in the room and work with the small free space I have. I sleep on the floor in the living room now, it's been like a couple of weeks now.

The whole 18 years I've been living on this planet, I've never had anyone make me a party (for any reason) except my family for my birthday.. and not all birthdays. my 12th birthday I didn't even get a birthday wish nor did my siblings come in with a candle singing ""Happy Birthday"". I never told that to anyone, except a guy who I thought was my best friend (until I found out his role in the break up, he tried to fix it by telling my GF .. ex-gf, that it is probably just a phase because of the exams. But he knew something was up and didn't bother telling me, but actually started blaming me when I went to him right after I was dumped) well he probably still is my best friend. Anyway back to the point, while organizing this perfect party for my ex's birthday (turned out the opposite if what I planned, but she was still ecstatic...I still am not happy with the way it turned out) so during the organization I accidentally opened up and told him about my situation with birthdays. Ever since then he'd ask me almost every time he'd see me when my birthday is. So, I knew he was planning something, and he told me that he got reservations in this place in the old town and it'll be me, him, our 3rd friend and my ex (that's our group.. she has to be there). That's it. He didn't invite anyone of my other friends (Like I did with the parties I organized for the 2 other members of our group) nor did he make it sound special. I mean it might be a rouse he's pulling and surprise me with everyone there, but I don't want to have my hopes up.

My ex, every time the group goes out she doesn't even look at me, and I have to be the one starting any interaction. But even then she starts closing and ignoring me after she had slightly started to open up again. The evening ends up with me sitting alone and she talking to my friends. Usually (before the breakup) she'd be talking to me and only a few times we'd include the guys into our conversation. (we didn't ignore them or anything, we talked to them and all, but most the time we'd be talking to each other).

I was trying to give you a picture of how horrible my birthday would be if it actually turned out to be just the 4 of us. Oh and that 3rd friend he's been busy all summer with this internship he got and we haven't seen him since the finals. When my friend told me he convinced him he made sure I'd feel that he tried hard to convince him, he said that he even went through and called both his parents to force him to come. He's trying to show that he cares, but all I got was that my friend is only coming because he was forced to.

I did terribly in the finals (I have a habit of self sabotage when I work hard for something) I knew everything on the exam, they were simple, but I just couldn't answer. I am expected to get the highest scores, but honestly I doubt I'll pass... bye bye transferring.

I decided to group up with some guys I don't know and cosplay payday 2 for an event coming up, I thought the work would get my mind off it. But anytime I'm alone and not busy with something I remember how bad I feel from the inside.

I know all my problems are small and don't come close to what people have been going through, but I feel bad, really bad. But again, I feel like a brat when I say them out loud. People are going through way worse and I'm feeling like hell because of some stupid social problems.

I think I should include this; I only had 2 best friends my whole life, the first traveled to another country and we lost contact, the second was killed while we were in a fight and weren't speaking to each other. So I blame my trust and friend issues on that.

If you made it to this paragraph, then thank you, just the thought that you took time out of your day to read my ranting feels nice.

Edit: I forgot this. Because of my sister being depressed, my family don't realize my birthday is tomorrow. It's like my 12th birthday, but worse.

TL;DR First birthday party is tomorrow and only 3 people are coming. My ex is one of the 3 and she dumped me a few weeks ago. Oh, and I am on the doorsteps of depression."

So I get a Netgear ethernet hub with it's AC adapter on my desk unplugged. I think ""well this can't be too bad"" and I dive under my desk with hub in hand. 

Plug it into the power strip, alright good start. 

The PC already has an ethernet plugged into the wall so I take the wall end out and plug it into the hub but I was thinking something isn't right, where's it getting the connection?

Then when my PC has no signal I unplug the PC end and put it into the wall. Still no internet and I'm left thinking ""wait if the ethernet is plugged into the wall how is it going to get to the computer? Is this also a router of some sorts?""

After sitting there thinking, and reading through a wiki link I realize there is supposed to be a second ethernet cable. 

&gt; Me (to IT guy): ""Hey so uh I thought I had this but I think I need another ethernet cable""

&gt; IT Guy: ""oh my god yes you do I forgot to leave it on your desk, sorry about that""

&gt; Me: ಠ_ಠ

**TL;DR:** Had to set up ethernet hub on first day, took 10 minutes to realize I needed TWO ethernet cables. "

So far, I have been manually migrating files and building sites/pages on the fly.

As you can imagine, this is incredibly slow and monotonous work.

I know that there are tools from metalogix.com and tzumani.com but there is no way for me to get these tools.

I guess my question for all you Sharepoint experts and enthusiasts is: is there an easier way to do this?

I need some advice from you all.

Im currently at my last year in my graphic design bachelor. But right now I have so much thoughts I dont really know where to start or who to talk to. The reason for this is because in November I have to find a place where I can work as intern for six months. After the last semester with the internship Im finally a bachelor student. 

Now here is my thoughts and what annoys me to the end of the earth:
I have been researching design agencies I want to give it a try on but some of them are quite high class and hard to get into as an example Snøhetta. My additional plan is to make such a good job during the internship that they might offer me a job after the internship. With this I also have to consider where I apply, will there be room for me after the internship/school? Sure I could work with the big guys, but then it would suck if I would have to leave them for a smaller company after school.

As seeing this is something required from school (the internship) Im not allowed to ask for payment during my internship unless they offer it to me. Which means I will have a quite heavy 6 months economically. This makes it even harder for me to handle, Im going to be 21 in November and Id honestly like to live closer to the workplace and move out from home. My workplace will be without doubt will be 1+ hour away at least and the travel expenses will be a fortune. 

Now sure, this is all about money so thats not my biggest issue. The worst part for me is how to make contact with the agencies without sounding like a 4 year old applying to a kindergarten for the summertime. How on earth do I call someone/mail someone and ask for a internship when they probably dont even need my help? I really want to learn from the internship so I should be working with an agency and not some graphic designer for a cookiebrand.

How do I present myself? Meet up personally? Call? Email? 
What should I do with my portfolio, how do I make one convincing when Im probably not the first student asking for this? Should I have it printed? Online? Online and print? Should I tell them about achievements or let the design speak for itself?

With other words, how do I convince the big people that Im going to rock their world?

Thanks in advance from a frustrated student."

I had a fairly decent GPA (~3.4) and always excelled in my programming courses but now I'm starting to feel like I'm ridiculously out of place. I've never done any big side projects in my spare time and it isn't because I don't enjoy coding, I just have always spent free time with friends and other such things.

My problem isn't that I don't understand Java or a specific language or any programming basics like reading from a text file or loops or anything simple like that. My problem is more like I don't understand how to apply that knowledge. Using things like Maven/Gradle and designing and developing large multi-class integrated projects from scratch is all brand new to me and honestly its really intimidating. I look at example additions to open source projects or any packaged software and I can't even fathom creating anything remotely close to them. How do I make that leap? I can read all the Java code in their projects for example, but identifying why they did the things they did from a design standpoint is really difficult for me.

For my school projects there were basic instructions like: create a class that does x and can handles b, has methods for x, y, z, and outputs o. So I guess I'm struggling with knowing how to direct and instruct myself. Are there any resources I can look into to improve? I want to improve and become a great developer but I feel very behind and intimidated. "

3az3cb,5,2015-06-24,Career change from science to IT; advice,PsycoCarrot,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3az3cb/career_change_from_science_to_it_advice/,"As per the title, I am looking to move from science to IT.

Background: I have a Bachelor's in Microbiology. I have been working at a Fortune 500 biotech company for 3 years in their industrial waste water treatment laboratory. 27yrs old, married, no children, home owner.

My motivation for doing so: What brought idea of career change to my mind originally, is that science is a dead-end career choice for me. I really enjoy the subject and the lab work, but I basically topped the payscale of a lab worker scientist straight out of college (my position is highly paid for a new graduate, but I had the correct degree and internships to land the role). We have been trying to fill my coworker's newly vacant position, and we are getting applicants with 10-15 years lab exp. This shows me that in 10-15 years, I am looking at making the same wages I made straight out of college. I cannot support a family on these wages, and my wife and I really want to start reproducing soon. If I want to make more money, I need to become a people-manager (gag), and in order to do that, I need to get higher education (read: debt). Basically, pay increases have nothing to do with experience, and only your degree determines your wages. Despite what you learn in school, science in the business world is about results, not discovery, and it is pretty soulless and routine, with tons of internal politics. What made me decide on IT as a target career, is that computers are my real passion, and my main hobby. I don't come home from work and look up science journals and interesting discoveries, I come home and learn about Linux or VMWare etc. The problem-solving and troubleshooting aspect of fixing a PC, setting up a new server or service, and finally getting it working is like an adrenaline rush to me. I love solving puzzles and learning new things in the process. Plus, I hear the pay scales much better with experience. My current long-term goal is Linux Sysadmin.

My IT experience: I have been the family IT guy since I got my first laptop in college. I have built and maintained a gaming PC through those years, and learned alot about hardware and Windows. Towards the end of college, I got very interested in Linux, so I ran Ubuntu and learned a bit about Linux. I started running Arch Linux on my desktop. After finding work, I became interested in servers. I now run a homelab, and have experience setting up and troubleshooting VMWare, KVM, CentOS 6, Bind9 DNS, ISC DHCPd, SAMBA, rsyslog, pfSense, SophosUTM, some networking, etc. I also run a small side-business of PC repair in my local area. I am also taking Linux classes at my local community college (I already know 90%+ of the material we are covering, but the courses are proof that I have some level of proficiency).

My dilemma: I have been applying to help-desk role jobs,  listing all of my computer experience. I also attempt to portray my current role in science in a way that I think would be relevant to IT. By this, I mean that I do a lot of data review, finding trends in data, and finding ways that we can improve and make our processes more efficient. In addition, science necessitates high critical thinking skills and attention to detail. None of these employers have called me back. I know that I have no ""real"" professional experience working in IT, and that works against me, but I should be able to sell myself as someone who loves to learn, has critical thinking skills, and has a decent knowledge of Linux and virtualization technologies, if I could just get an interview. 

I know that entry level certs are a big one, A+ being the main. A couple things I have thought of are hooking up with some staffing agencies, or maybe applying mostly to small companies that don't have the stringent requirements and HR filters that a larger company might.

What other things might I do that could help give me an edge?

3az3xf,3,2015-06-24,"Reddit, I need some help, advice, encouragement or really anything helps.",__theDude,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3az3xf/reddit_i_need_some_help_advice_encouragement_or/,"Years ago I would have never thought I would be in this position as I have always felt that I am decently smart and capable person. 

I graduated last year from the University of Houston with a degree in Finance (GPA 3.15). After a small job search and coming up short I decided to take a chance on myself and move to Los Angeles as that is where I have wanted to live/work for a very long time now. None of the industries in Houston peaked any of my interest and LA is full of everything I have ever wanted to be involved in; plus the weather, people and vast things to do 24/7.

I knew finding a job in LA, at least a decent job would be semi-difficult but I was fully prepared financially and mentally for that to happen. However, it has been nine months and I am still searching and starting to get incredibly discouraged. For those wondering what I have been doing up to this point I will lay it out in detail.

1.) I actually had a semi-job set up through a friend before I moved out here with his start-up business, however, he got started a lot slower than he anticipated and was unable to hire me right away and even though his business has picked up he is still not in a position to hire anyone yet.

2.) Almost immediately after I arrived I went to recruiting agencies such as Robert Half and filled out profiles to start finding work. The day I showed up to the office they offered me to interview for 1-2 positions that were basic data entry jobs for $10-12 an hour. Most of my classmates were making 45-50k a year minimum and I made more than 10$ an hour when I was 17 years old and a junior in high school. I decided that taking a 6 month commitment at $10 an hour was going probably not in my best interest because if I plugged away  I would be able to find something a little more stable, more responsibilities and reasonable pay. Since then, I have tried working with RobertHalf and other recruiting agencies, I apply to positions on their site, email my contacts and call. I never EVER get a response anymore. Not even for the $10 an hour data entry jobs.

3.) I have gone to job fairs to meet face to face with hiring companies and network. I felt like these went well and met a lot of interesting people and companies but nothing has ever panned out to even an interview.

4.) I have applied online to every job you can possibly imagine. ZipRecruiter, WorkPop, Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, Company Websites and every other one has become a home where I apply to jobs non-stop. Literally. I think my count for jobs applications is 200+  I was actually going to start an excel spreadsheet listing jobs I apply to with contact information and what happened. I have gotten some first interviews (not many) and never to a second interview.

5.) I have networked with friends, friends of friends and gotten involved in communities of people to help get a lead on a job, it has helped but never amounted to anything. I even got noticed online by a guy who worked at a major company in LA, he invited me to the offices, bought me lunch, gave me a tour and we had a very long and good informal interview. He really seemed to like me and my drive but I never got past HR to get an interview. He stayed in contact with me every week and seemed upset I couldn't get an interview.

6.) Just as a side note, I have applied to everything in the world that I can think of. Everything from working at SpaceX to being a barista at Starbucks and can't seem to get anything. I will now explain why I think these things are happening but I am running out of time, I DO NOT want to leave Los Angeles. I am not a quitter, I want to succeed here and have a drive to do so, but I am reallllly tired of not working.

1.) My resume is a scattered mess and definitely presents me as a jack of all trades and a master of none, however, I don't know how to fix that because my experience is my experience. When I was growing up I always have an infinite amounts of interests. I played video games, baseball, raced motocross, made films, played card games and graphic design. I learned everything I could but never really stuck to one thing and perfected it. This shows in my resume too.

I have started a handful of companies. One was web startup for an eBay like system for a niche product. The other was a film company in Houston where we shot mostly music videos and did some short films and documentaries etc... I also did a lot of freelance work like Desktop support help for people. 

I had a super strong background in tech when I was younger, missed the CCNA exam by one point when I was 16 and worked as a network administrator at a company for a short while.

I have had retail jobs etc... as well but never really lasted at them as I always had higher hopes for myself and didn't want to end up being the manager of the Gap or something like that, forty and hating myself.

Even when I decided I wanted to finish school I started as a computer science major, went into MIS then decided to finish as a finance major. The reason I chose finance was because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I figured that understanding money and how it works in a business is going to be useful knowledge no matter what industry I work in. Money is universal.

One other thing that I truly believe is holding me back a bit is I am a little heavy at the moment. I used to be super thin, however, a thyroid disorder and being stressed 24/7 at the moment has made me the opposite and people in general, especially in Los Angeles want sharp looking people. I actually felt really really good about a few interviews I had out here but believe that my belly might have been a major factor in not getting the job over another.

-------

The longer this has gone on the more discouraged and confused I have been. I have applied to finance jobs such as junior analyst, entry level book keeper, entry level accounts payable/receivable and even bank teller and personal banker jobs at branches (no interviews).

I have always wanted to work in the film industry, especially out here and have a little experience in it from my work in Houston and have applied to assistant roles, intern roles, finance roles, and everything under the sun out here and have only gotten one interview for an internship at an actually prominent producers desk but I didn't get the job.

I have also dabbled in getting into web development since I have done things like HTML, CSS, etc.. before and worked with my start-up a little bit in web dev, however, deciding to take that path would be a serious commitment and would 99% mean going back to school such as a coding bootcamp and spending another large sum of money on education. There are a lot of jobs here for web dev and coders in general but sometimes I feel like it's just another avenue and another thing on my resume that makes me even more diverse and not directed at a specific goal, puts me in more debt, and no guarantee i'll be great at it or get a job.

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, what I want to do, or what I will be good at doing anything. I received so much rejection and still trying to keep my head up high. I don't want to move back to Texas (ever) and I don't want to give up. I came here to succeed and make it, be successful and finally get stable.

Any help, advice, encouragement or anything would be useful... I need inspiration to get motivated again... I want to make it"

I'm left with the chores and the work needed to pick up the slack because they're too busy focusing on their golden child.

Despite all this, I'm actually on good terms with my brother. Growing up together, we were good friends and even though age and distance has caused us to drift apart, we still get along pretty well. So I tolerate this special treatment most times he's back in town.

This time, though... This time, it's been really rough on me. My anxiety got even worse than usual and I went from daily panic attacks to panic attacks once every ~6 hours.

I am studying in the UK and I would really want to get an internship in the US, but increasing the likelihood of getting accepted is more important for me. Obviously they will say that they have the same standards for everything, but I feel that there should usually be more applicants for the main office in US which in turn means more competition. Also when it comes to hiring interns that aren't US nationals the companies have to go through the hassle of setting up a visa for you, which means that your competitiveness should (although they probably won't admit it openly) decrease if you're European.

What are your thoughts on the matter? And what would you advise me - apply to US office or the UK (or some other European) office? I'm a European citizen, but not from the UK if that matters."

I am working as an IT intern for the summer at a hedge fund, and they are having me redesign their Outlook Calendar functionality. Right now, we use a private website for our calendar events, but it's functionality is limited so we want to move to Outlook permanently. There are a few things that I need to set up for everyone in the office:

* When planning a meeting, be able to select which conference room you want to have it in.
* Be able to see which times are available for a specific room (e.g. I need to have my meeting in Conference Room A, which times work?)
* Be able to see which rooms are available for a specific time (e.g. I need to have a meeting at 1pm, which rooms are available?)
* Be unable to schedule a meeting if the room and time selected are already booked (right now I have it where you get an alert that your time conflicts but you are still allowed to book the meeting. I need it to reject the meeting so people don't get confused and think their meeting time will work)
* Be able to add different needs for each specific meeting (e.g. ""Expecting a guest?"" w/check box, or ""Does guest need key fob?"" w/check box)
* Be able to specify a dial-in number if it's a conference call.
* Be able to show which location the meeting room is at (we have two office locations, and want to show the meeting on only one of the office's calendar, not both).

The office runs Windows 7 professional, and most of the employees use IE9 because it's the only browser that works with our website. I am relatively new to IT and brand new to Outlook so if you guys could help me out, I would really appreciate it! As of now, all I have done is made a Room Mailbox in Active Directory for each conference room in one of the offices. Thanks!"
3azgt4,7,2015-06-24,Graduate degree,NW_Ecophilosopher,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3azgt4/graduate_degree/,"So I'm currently going into senior year as a chemical engineer with a 4.0, about two years of research work, and one internship at a large company in a energetic chemistry focused role.

So I've never really been a fan of chemical engineering undergraduate opportunities or even the major, but that's on me for not recognising it earlier and getting a better understanding of what it entails. However, I've always planned on going for a doctorate.

Thus, the question: should I continue on in chemical engineering with the understanding that i can focus in on energetic materials and chemistry as part of the research without going for a chemistry or materials science phd (depends on the program and the professor, but might be doable). Or should i attempt to go for a chemistry or materials science phd perhaps for a better fit (problems with going for a non-chemical engineering degree)? Confounding this is that the company i currently intern at is definitely a great company to be at that seems to offer a lot of learning opportunities that may end up being more relevant than my degree anyways. And maybe i would enjoy going the engineer to manager route, but that is something i probably have to figure out myself. 

Anyways, i just want to know what thoughts you have and any suggestions or personal experiences that might help."

I am rising senior that's ranked 1st or 2nd in a class of 562 students, with a W GPA of 5.08 and a UW GPA of 3.96. I attend as many voluntary/extracurricular activities as possible with a part-time job during school and a full-time job in the summer. My class history is made up with 1 AP course, 7 IB courses, and 11 Honors courses. This senior year will consist of 1 more AP course plus another 7 more IB courses. And, this summer I will be working as an intern at the RTP Cisco for the month of July in the Data Lab Center. 

But, here is the catch, my SAT and ACT test scores are *waa-aay* below expectations. And, they are so disappointing to look at because I know these are not the standards of the admissions of the schools  that I really want to go to, most notably Duke. 

SAT: 1600 (R 500; M 640; W 460)

ACT: 25 (E 22; M 26; R 27; S 25; Writing 8/12)

I know my biggest problem with both tests was preparation because I took both tests without looking at a single practice test and with a total of ~4 hours of ""studying"".

Since I earned a higher score on the ACT, I decided my sole focus would be to only study for it with hopes that I can go beyond a 30 on the ACT before I apply for ED at Duke. 

I got the second edition official prep book and read through the chapters to the best of my ability. Yesterday, I decided to take my first ACT practice test and split the four parts of the multiple choice between two days. And, I earned a 23 on the English and a 27 on the Math with a whopping +1 improvement on both. This of course made me realize that I was still stuck after doing the most studying I have ever done in my short life. 

Today, I have decided to study the ACT subject by subject, starting with English. So far, I have watched and re-watched some of the ACT English tips on YouTube and completed sample questions on the ACT website. And, I plan to take only the English portion of a PT tomorrow. 

But truly, my biggest problem of all right now is constant anxiousness about my future with school. So, I call onto the elders! Do you have any words of wisdom for a teenager with such temporary worries?    

Thank you for taking your time to read this, and hopefully the answers that some of you will give will be helpful to many others. 

**TL; DR :** Good student does not reach standardized test goals during the previous school year and wishes for motivation and encouragement. "

So I am graduating this September from a top British university. The only problem is I used to think I could get a job and settle down in the UK someday when I first came here. 


I did an internship at a software startup in the past and have worked in the largest robotics lab in Europe for my third year thesis. 

You might think given those credential it shouldn't be hard to get a job ? especially since I am just 21. 

I went to an interview with an prospective company and they were really excited, everything went fine. However when I told them that I was bangladeshi they were taken aback. 

They told me that its difficult for them to hire a foreigner. 

I looked at the laws and It sort of made sense, 

Basically if you are a company and want to hire an foreigner. 

# You need to pay an extra licencing fee. 

# You cannot pay the person lower salary than the market rate ( means they cannot compensate for the additional cost , lawyers are not cheap) 

# You need to prove that there are no other native eligible candidate. ( I am sure there are many since the job market is fairly saturated but maybe I seemed like the best fit ? who the fuck knows) 

Anyway I have been upset for a few days over this, not because of any other reason but because I was unable to get a job due to a reason that was out of my control ( place of birth ) . Ofcourse there are valid reasons for such treatment. The British govt belongs to the British people. 

But emotionally I am really upset. 

My friend in canada told me how great is it there. 

And have been thinking of applying to Canadian universities for masters. 

I am still young and I might have to do some courses I already did but I am concerned about my future prospect. 

What path do you take after you do a masters in canada to get permanent residence ? 

Thanks a lot for your listening ! "

3azq4f,2,2015-06-24,Best way to start career and repay $24k student loans?,moldy912,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3azq4f/best_way_to_start_career_and_repay_24k_student/,"This August I will be starting a new job that pays quite well, so I am considering tackling my debt quickly. I have a few questions such as prioritizing student loans and retirement investments, is it best to pay it off fast, and general advice. I do not have a lot of details on my expenditures because my parents still pay for most of it until I move out in August. I am 22 years old and male.

Income:

 * $64,000 as Software Developer starting in August
 * $4,000+ bonus at end of year
 * $2,000+$1,000 signing and relocation bonus
 * $6,300 in savings (1% I think) + checking accounts

Expected Monthly Expenses:

 * $700 rent, includes utilities, internet, tv, etc.
 * $200 food
 * ~$100 eating out
 * $60 Cell Phone
 * $60? gas, live close to work, so it shouldn't be much
 * no idea about anything else, including insurance, health, gym, etc.

Debts:

 * Perkins Loan $6,600 5.000%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $3,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.860%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $5,298.41 4.660%
 * Grace period ends in November this year
 * I have $50 autopay for Stafford on 10th of each month just for the summer

Other:

 * I have a car that is worth ~$18k. Parents are planning on giving payment responsibility to me, so I'm thinking of trading for a far cheaper car
 * I have no idea how much of the car is paid off
 * Employer offers 4% 401k match graduated, fully vested after 5 years.
 * Personal retirement account as well, which I don't really understand
 * Otherwise decent employment benefits
 * Current girlfriend and I are considering moving in together once she graduates and gets employed so I can pay off loans instead of rent. She has absolutely no debt, $7k in savings, summer internship, but moving out to low rent apartment soon.
 * Long term, I'm definitely thinking of marriage and getting a home, so I am thinking getting rid of debt soon is key, right?

With about $4k post tax monthly income, I was thinking anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 monthly loan payments, which should get me out of debt in a year and a half (ignoring car). Is this the right way to go about it? I know it is best to put money towards highest interest rates, so Perkins will be first. Is it better to pay off Perkins completely and minimum on Stafford? Would it be better to pay less in total and put difference toward retirement? 

My benefits package for the 401k says ""The Company provides a contribution to match your eligible before-tax and/or after-tax contributions of up to 4% of eligible pay."" Does that mean they give me 4% of 18,000 or 64,000?

Also, can someone explain the point of an emergency fund when I just got hired? I don't see the point when I am in a 20 week training program at my employer's brand new location with over 1000 new hires. I just don't really see myself needing it until after at least a year.

Thanks, and I hope it's not too many questions!"
3azryv,2,2015-06-24,I'm not to sure who I am without alcohol,Throwaway1122345678,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3azryv/im_not_to_sure_who_i_am_without_alcohol/,"So I haven't had a drink in what feels like a long time, it's the summer, its no longer a daily battle for me and in all honesty I haven't thought about drinking in a month or more. 

The problem is I'm becoming so restless. I don't think I fully realised how much of my life revolved around drinking and now that I don't do that any more I kinda feel like my life is pretty empty. 

I'm exercising more, I read more, I landed a great internship for the summer but thats it. That is the extent of my life, that is all I do. I go to work (I'm the youngest there by about 15 years), I exercise, I read, I draw sometimes, I watch TV. Thats my whole life. 

All my friends were drinking buddies, we socialised by getting messily drunk, drinking in bars, drinking in clubs, barbecues, getting drunk in the cinema, going for brunch and cocktails literally everything we did revolved around getting drunk. The difference was they weren't doing it to the level I was or with anything like the same frequency.

When I stopped drinking I kind of realised I no longer had anything in common with the people I counted as friends, and to be honest they didnt really want me around. I don't blame them, I wouldn't have wanted a sober person there either when I was drinking. 

I feel like I'm completely alone. I'm also incredibly socially anxious and find it difficult to talk to people. I've pretty much spent my whole adult life drunk. I dont know if Ive ever kissed a guy when I was sober, certainly I've never been on a date. I feel a bit like I have the social development of a young teenager but I'm in my mid 20s. I don't know how to make friends, I don't know how to have a relationship, I can barely talk to a guy without feeling my face flush and panicking, where as three months ago I'd approach anyone with a bottle of wine in my hand. I had new friends every night, I had no problem talking to men, I'd go home with pretty much whoever I wanted provided they were drunk enough. 

I just feel so lost and so ashamed that I've made it to this point of my life with no friends and no outlets. Its like I've lost 6 years of my life and I dunno how to catch up or get them back. My anxiety and shyness is paralyzing me.

I just don't know where to go from here, I'm happier than I was when I was drinking but I dont feel like I have a life any more. I just exist. I just count the days. Has anyone else been through this? How do you rebuild something like a normal life?

3azw2p,2,2015-06-24,"Going on 13 months of unemployment. I could use some uplift, some tips (that I haven't already done yet).",thefinestsomething,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3azw2p/going_on_13_months_of_unemployment_i_could_use/,"I read some old posts here by people who seemed to have been unemployed for ages and have had some troubles similar to mine. I've been unemployed for 13 months now after graduating college last year. A few of those months I was casually applying because I had a sibling diagnosed with an illness who I had to care for. Right now, however, I am rigorously applying and worn out and tired from this process. 

I graduated from a health professional program-one of those accelerated, straight-after-high-school things where you skip ahead to the professional degree. This wasn't quite my preference upon entering university because while my field is considered good and reputable, there's a very narrow scope of what you can do with my major and I wasn't ready to commit to something so specific as a freshman. But seeing where the job market was going when I started and realizing that some of my ""dreams"" to study what I loved could be misguided, I decided to go along with my major.

Problems started for me as soon as my first year in my program. We were highly recommended to work or get an internship as a student intern or ancillary personnel in the setting of my field. I did exactly what my classmates did and applied, went in person to these settings, asked people who were in somewhat related fields, etc. I contacted my professor and supervisors I worked with in regards to getting a job. Many told me that there was an increasing amount of students having trouble (I would later learn this was because as I was in the middle of school, the balance of supply of students was starting to exceeded the demand for jobs in my field) so my best bet would be to go to job fairs and meet the managers in person. I did that as well, e-mailed managers, called people up. I did this constantly for 3 years. During my second to last year in the program, the places I called said ""we're hiring younger students at this point"", yet there were still students in my year getting jobs at these places. And I cannot emphasize, I wasn't doing anything ""less"" than they were as far as grades, resume or interviews went. I practiced my interview with a speech professional. 

In the meantime I wasn't getting jobs, I was very involved. I joined many organizations on campus, volunteered over 400 hours of experience for a campus facility, had a work-study job at an on-campus center, was partaking in at least 3-4 organizations, one which I had a very active role as a VP. Some of these did not have direct association with my major, but they were within the broad scope of my field. I also have a short-term research experience and practical experience required as a part of my major (1500 hours in six different locations).

After I graduated, I have applied to maybe 80-90 jobs all over the country, majority somewhat near locations I am familiar with however. I know this may not be a lot, but with the circumstances I was in, I didn't have time to apply to a tons more. I can only average 4-6 apps a day-all of my applications ask me to put a resume, cover letter, then input individual work experience/contact information. I've done job apps for my mom who works in accounting and they took much less time than mine. I live close to an ivy league university and about 1 hour 15 mins away from a major city, and sometimes (more so during the semester) they have talks/lectures of interest to me, so I go check it out and make it a point to network. Some of the events I end up go to has undergrads more so than professionals, so it turns out to be kind of pointless.

I updated my LinkedIn (possibly need a better, more professional picture) but add a lot of people, including random people, have gotten in touch with a few people by phone just to get an idea of what their field is like. I contacted old supervisors to let them know I'm on the lookout for a job. I've had my resume/cover letter reviewed and update/clean it up at least monthly. I created an online website/portfolio of my presentations, skills and even put my hobbies up on there.  I am applying to jobs in my field but also some places outside of it, justifying in my cover letter why I could qualify for such position. I'm doing some extra online skill building courses, although (not going to lie) it's tough to motivate myself some days without knowing what direction I am really going in.

The only other thing is that, after contacting maybe 50 people to ask them to assist with research or some kind of role like that, I finally got a voluntary position at a clinic. This is my first time getting experience after 13 months and I may be averaging about 20-25 hours monthly.

This is definitely becoming demoralizing, depressing and making me lose a sense of confidence. I've had issues sleeping at night, difficulty motivating myself to exercise (while averaging 1-1.5 hours of daily exercise before), losing my organizational skills and my ability to think clearly. I have little to no friends, never get texts or calls from old classmates who always used to otherwise ask me for notes all the time. Some days I can convince myself it's all a part of the learning process but other days I regret and kind of keep wishing I went along with what I wanted to study instead of the major I picked. I really am ready to do anything and that means even outside of my major and considering the possibility of going back to grad school. I sometimes read in my free time or keep a blog, but it's not easy to do so many things at once, especially with this depression weighing on me. I think moreover, I really need some uplift or advice from people who've been here before."

I recently had a phone screening with CompanyA and passed it. Also an online Test and passed that as well. I have an upcoming interview with CompanyA next week. On the phone screening they mentioned how much salary am I expecting. I stated $47000 - $49000. They offered me $40000 as starting for an entry level.  

I have an interview with SAP for an intern position. I am not sure if they will ask how much I am expecting for salary, but I would most likely range $44000 - $46000 because the position is an intern. Also because it is an intern position they might offer closer to $40000 as well.

If both company offer me the same salary similar benefit how can i mention to the interviewer that i will have to take some time to decide?"

I've only been sticking people there for about 4 days now and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it but I always feels just awful when I'm coming home. I hate being the worst at something, I hate being the weak leak in our ""team."" I'm definitely the type of person to be really hard on myself if I'm not one of the best so this is really starting to get to me. 

To make things worse the hospital is extremely understaffed which means most of the time now it's just me in the room alone with the patient (normally not bad if they are relatively healthy but most patients we see are very sickly and have small or used up veins) and that I feel like they are expecting me to preform as well as the other employees since we keep getting backed up and they desperately need help keeping the wait time down. I was told this was supposed to be a learning experience and this was the time to learn and improve my technique, but I feel like I'm not getting enough feedback and instruction on my actual sticking, but maybe that's just a normal feeling. 

Is it normal to feel this way? How long did it take yall to get comfortable sticking most patients? I really want to do a great job and make my bosses proud but I feel like I'm just letting people down (I know they same I'm doing well or fine and a lot of the time I get compliments from patients but when they are a hard stick I just feel defeated.) I'm getting most of my sticks but if they are very very old or sick I probably have a 50_75% chance at getting blood and that just kills me. Also any advice that you have would be more than appreciated."

I am graduating in 3 weeks and have no jobs lined up. I have a decent amount of experience: 2 internships and a couple projects on my GitHub. I have been getting lots of interviews, but lots of denials as well. 

I am thinking about booking a one way flight to San Francisco in hopes of finding a development job. If I do this, I could live 3-4 months without a job. Maybe longer. 

It seems like I could go to developer meetups and possibly meet and ask around to try to get into a development job. I have been blindly applying online to a bunch of companies and it has not been working for me.

My questions: How risky is this? Would this be worth it to try and land a job in SF? I have been applying to Dice,Indeed, Hacker News, et cetera. and none of it has worked so far. If I do this, what would be the best way to land a job? Development meetups?"

So, there is this guy in my masters program, we're both assigned to a field research and end up working together and that went on well.
When the research was done we went our separate ways (no friends in common), some days later he texted me just asking how I was doing and from that point forward we started exchanging lots of texts.
One day he invites me to this party with a bunch of his friends that I never talked to, so I declined (I'm very shy and always think that everyone will just dislike me) but invited him for a coffee some other day. 
We went for the coffee and hangout a few other times (movies and lunches together). And he always texted a lot. But each time we went out it was never actually a date neither he ever made a move, which got me thinking he just wants to be friends. 
Eventually I had to go do my internship in another state, 10+ hours away, but we kept in touch, he would send me texts and photos of the city asking if I missed it and when I would visit, and I always gave friendly answers because I thought that's all he wanted.
Anyways this situation goes on for a while and I mentioned I wanted to go to this music festival and he asked when was it, I answered and asked if he would like to go with me (I kinda was thinking he would say no because we have a completely different taste in music and the festival was in another state) and surprisingly he said yes, that he would love to go.
And so we went and spent a really good time, but still no moves and I'm really shy so I couldn't make any move on him either.
Later on we had both to leave for our states and at this point I am really sad because I really like him and am well aware that we won't be seeing each other any time soon.
And so he texted saying he really enjoyed seeing me again and that the festival wasn't as bad as he thought it would. And I answered that his company was great and I was happy to know he liked it.
Now, after a few more texts it all just kinda fade away and I don't know what to think. Was he ever interested? If yes, why has he faded away now? Should I invest in him knowing that I still have two more months of internship and so we won't be able to see each other during this period? Or am I just imagining things and he only sees me as a friend? Should I let things stay as they are and lose touch? 
I really like him."

5-6 people in the office will be making changes to the data, the rest will just read it. She also wants saved queries that will get info, like the total of a specific column or somethin. My question is what is the best way to structure this? Using Microsoft SQL server?

3b0g76,253,2015-06-24,Because money isn't everything folks.,vedun23,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3b0g76/because_money_isnt_everything_folks/,"About 3 years ago I was an intern at a major telecommunications company. Intern being a loose term as I was the only qualified db admin/sys admin/system architect in my division. It was quite bad to the point where I had two people working for me, as an intern. 

The job was rough,  the pay was shit,  the hours long and the management was hellish. I was making about 44k/yr working 60 hour weeks while working on an engineering degree full time. This went on for two years,  at which point I graduated and was set to convert to full time. 

Except,  as I found out,  I wouldn't be converted to full time. My manager made me the following offer. 40k/yr as an intern for one more year. And they'd be so kind to settle all of the paperwork to make this happen(against the company by laws. Interns had to be active college students) . 

So,  I took another offer at a different company and told them that I would be leaving. 

And this is where my petty revenge begins. See,  as I found out,  my manager was not in power to make me that offer. Moreover,  the department was not in a position where they could afford to loose me. So,  once they realized what has been done they freaked out and started making me new,  better offers. 

Anything I asked, I would have approved in two hours. By my manager,  director of engineering and recruiting. 5k sign on? Sure. 75k/yr?sure. Better benefits coverage? Great..  5 year tenure? You got it. Two extra weeks of pto for the first five years? Yes sir. 

I made the department head,  the manager,  the director of engineering and the vp of engineering spend roughly 40 hours on the phone discussing and approving all of my demand. 
And when they had crafted a deal so great I'd be crazy to turn down... I turned it down. It was the best deal offered to an intern in the 90 year history of the company,  and I turned it down. At which point a new round of calls began by HR trying to figure out why it was turned out,  what the problem was and who the culprits were at failing to keep me at work. From what I understand,  it was hell for all involved but me. 

Oh and to add the cherry on top,  I wore the shirt of my new employer to my exit interview,  revealing it mid interview. Just to achieve the maximum pettiness.

3b0h0j,1,2015-06-24,At a Crossroad,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3b0h0j/at_a_crossroad/,"As the title says, I have come to a crossroad.  

First some background on me.  I am a 36 year with a wife and a child and 1 on the way.  I just recently got into the accounting profession and only have 4 years of experience.  I decided that it was time that I took my career to a new level so I recently started studying for my CPA.  If all goes well, I should be CPA certified by December.  

My current pay is 55k and I work at a not for profit.  Due to the nature of the business, I don't see many opportunities for promotions or raises in the future and at my age I don't want to wait around. I believe that in December, after I finish my CPA and we introduce the new member to our family, it is time for me to start looking for a new job with a higher salary.

My questions are as follows:

Are there going to be positions available for me in Public accounting firms that won't require intense busy seasons?  I have heard stories of CPAs working 55 hours max during busy season and I don't want to spend all my time at work when I have 2 young children at home.  Also, can I land a job for about 65k a year in a Public Accounting Firm, I'm in New York, with my 4 years experience and a CPA license?

Secondly, if I decide to stay away from Public Accounting, how much weight will my CPA certification hold when I have no Public Accounting experience other than a 6 month internship?  

Thanks in advance!

3b0ilr,1,2015-06-24,"How do I [23 F] deal with my verbally abusive mother [44 F], it's getting absolutely unbearable?",smxckmybxtchup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3b0ilr/how_do_i_23_f_deal_with_my_verbally_abusive/,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has been extremely aggressive and verbally abusive. She wants to control everything and everyone around her, even when it comes to the smallest, pettiest things. But it's always been bearable. Sort of. I often doubt myself and am a chronic pessimist thanks to her. And now you ask me ""Why do you let it get to you?"". Just keep reading, you'll find out.


Anyway... recently, a series of negative events in my education (not my fault, I ripped myself a new asshole studying and the professor is an extremely immature 40 years old man, so he fucks us all over on purpose) have been accumulating and have placed an even bigger strain on our relationship. 


Whenever money is involved, my mother gets very, very serious. To the point of pettiness. 


I'm an immigrant in a very shitty southern European country (my parents and I are from an equally shitty Eastern European country) and students here pay mad money for education. If you fail a class, you pay double. Fail it again, you pay triple. And so on and on... it can go up to a 1000 euros per class (and yes, this is a public university I'm talking about). This is where our problems come from.


The unemployment rate among young people here is ridiculously high. But I still keep trying to find a job because I believe that you can find anything if you look hard enough. I'm at a point where I need to look for an internship already... I get called for interviews, they hear my accent (which gets worse when I'm nervous but is still perfectly understandable) and never call me again even though they initially seemed very interested in my skills and languages, especially since people here do not tend to even learn English properly. But maybe they didn't like something else in me or my behaviour, those are just the observations I gathered. 


Why am I telling you this? Well, no job = no money. The government does not help students and universities (public or private) try their best to fuck their students over in order to obtain more income. I have been failed for absolutely no reason at all, even though my exam was impeccable. Just fml. But Eastern European parents are very similar to the stereotypical Asian parents. It's ALWAYS your fault, no matter what, never the professor's.


Again, I'm trailing off... So, it's come to a point in which I get daily verbal abuse and I can't do anything to prevent it. She would attack me a few times a day after work. I can't ignore her, pretend to listen or calmly agree with a smile on my face like my friends have suggested. I have tried it all. 


She would not leave me alone until she has me screaming back at her. She would follow me around the whole flat trying to antagonise me. She admitted to liking it; she likes making me feel like shit because she thinks I deserve it. I get insulted, blamed, attacked and from time to time, she would even hit me/slap me. 


I am trying my hardest to find a job to get out of this situation. But it's really hard. No kind of job without any experience can even pay rent here. And I can't go to another country where I know my skills would be better appreciated (I applied for internships and positions in northern countries and I even got the job in a few occasions, just to see if maybe I seemed like a really shitty person, thus my trouble finding employment here) because I have no money. I fully depend on my parents financially and they do not ever put more than a hundred euros in my account because they truly believe I will run away. 


The abuse is daily and now has turned nightly. If I go out all day and come home late at night in order to avoid it all, she will get out of bed specifically to attack me again for whatever the hell I did.


I got nowhere else to go (most people are just forced to live with their parents here as jobs don't pay much), I got two semesters left to graduate (which seems like a shit ton of time under all this pressure) and I feel like I'm going to die. What do I do? Help me. Help. I can't handle this. My mental health is strongly deteriorating. It's really bad. And I have really bad thoughts, like it's never going to get better for me because of the shit luck I've had in life so far.

And yes, I have tried sitting her down and reasoning with her. No, it does not work. I got attacked again.
   

**tl;dr**: Mother won't stop verbally and sometimes physically abusing me because of a class I failed no matter what technique I apply to avoid the confrontation. Won't stop until I'm crying or screaming."
3b0iq8,3,2015-06-24,[Non-traditional Engineering Student] Why am I not getting calls for interviews?,-Tom-,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/3b0iq8/nontraditional_engineering_student_why_am_i_not/,"Ok, so I'm a non-traditional mechanical engineering student (30 years old) who has had trouble even getting interviews with companies for internships. 

After my 2nd year I arranged my own internship outside of the schools career fair with a small business I knew the owner of (motorsport suspension stuff) but it ended up not being the learning opportunity I hoped for as the owner didnt want to teach me anything or give up design controls. 

After my 3rd year I helped a fellow student (PhD student) and former masters student in town get a brewery up and going for the summer, working with them as they needed me, learning about that business and how engineering applies to brewing. (mechanical systems, fluid flow, thermodynamics, heat transfer, biological engineering, etc) It was a pretty neat summer and I learned a lot. 

My 4th year I became the VP of the campus Fermentation Club and we did a few activities as a group through out the year as well as individual things, like brewing my own beer. At the fall career fair I decided I would finally go see what the companies that came to the school had to offer. I brought my professional resume from before college and added a few more things like what school I go to. Well the 3M guy laughed out loud at my resume and demanded an academic resume with some other information on there, I still went around to some other companies and tried though. No calls for interviews.

A couple days after the fall career fair I went to the professional development center at my school and sat down with the head guy and we went over my resume, pruned some stuff, reorganized, and added some other things. He was confident I now had a great resume for showing to potential employers for internships and full time jobs for a recent graduate. He also really liked my attitude, said I was a confident speaker, and I had great experience that employers should love.

Fast forward to the spring career fair, I get two interviews, one of which was to a company my friends father in law owns/is the CEO of. With in a minute of talking to the HR manager for that company she offers me an interview and sounds really excited. 

I get to the interview and it all seems to go really well except one part. The position is a field engineer which would involve a lot of being on the road and on remote job sites for a majority of the summer, which isnt a problem for me. What I mentioned was that as a mechanically inclined person, it is not above me to get in there, get my hands dirty, and do something if it needs to be done. The guy in the interview (not the head of HR who offered me the interview and was also there) seemed to take offense to this, to the point where he border line lectured me saying ""Its not your job to do that. You make sure your guys know what to do and you let them do it, no matter what."" Ok, fine. I used to work as a service adviser at a car dealership, I know I cant just go back in the shop and fix a customers car. I get it, thanks for letting me know. 

The interview with the other company I feel went well, both people interviewing me seemed to really like my answers and said that my experience was pretty impressive for the positions they were looking to fill.  

Both companies sent me a rejection letter/email saying they were considering other candidates. 

Now I've applied to 50+ other internships across the country, primarily focusing on MN (where I'm from), SD (where I'm at), CO (where I WANT to be), and AZ (where I would also like to be but have family).  I'm just not getting ANY calls for an interview. Its pretty frustrating as unfortunately you dont really get feedback from these companies when you just dont hear from them. The only kind of feedback I've gotten is a LOT of companies say they want a 3.0 minimum GPA (I have a 2.92) but it isnt required yet I get an email back hours later saying ""Sorry, unfortunately you dont meet the minimum requirements."" Even if it was a minimum requirement I still apply because what if nobody else does? 

At this point in the summer I have given up on finding an internship and I'm about ready to go work fast food as I want to save up some money for a big camping trip I have planned for CO at the end of the summer just before school starts. 

The only exception to that is that on Friday afternoon the career development head emailed me and said there was a company looking for someone URGENTLY. Apparently they had an intern bail out for a better offer after a couple weeks. I applied Friday evening by about 5:30PM and havent heard anything, 5 days later. 

This is just very frustrating as I was told by a lot of people that non-trad students are usually very desirable because they have real world experience, are more mature than ""kids"", and they know how to actually work, yet here I am with no calls and no job. 

After none of the engineering internships panned out I even went around town to all the machine shops and metal fabrication shops hoping to get even a part time job where I could learn something practical that would help me be a better engineer, not even any of them were interested, not even one that I offered to work for free for because they seemed like the best place to learn! 

I'm well groomed, I dress well for any professional interactions I have, I believe I'm well spoken, and I have a well of experience to draw from and nobody is interested. 

I guess why I'm here, more than to vent, is to ask for help. Would you HR professionals be willing to look over my resume? Would you be willing to do a mock interview for me and maybe let me know what my shortcomings are? I feel like with out help from people who make these decisions on a daily basis I'm not going to get anywhere or improve my odds. 

Thank you very much for your time reading this and I'm sorry about the wall of text!

I was born and raised in Thorntown, and like many Frettonese youngsters I sometimes wished to see the world. Most of us outgrow this, but I didn't. When I was 22, I got my chance, receiving a rare internship at the Tiritole Group's American headquarters.

It was there that I met the love of my life. For more than a decade, we lived as blissful a life as one can off of Fretton, and she gave me five wonderful children. Unfortunately, she fell ill. My beloved fought the illness for years, but eventually succumbed. 

After her death, there was nothing left for me in America, so I packed my kids up and came back home. Well, Conville, anyways. My kids aren't quite ready for Thorntown.

Err, anyways, I have been told that answering questions will help me readjust to being back in Fretton, so ask away!"
3b0n4h,32,2015-06-24,I'm doing it. I'm really fucking do it.,sofakingdone,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3b0n4h/im_doing_it_im_really_fucking_do_it/,"September of 2013 I was starting my senior year at my third college and beginning to realize just how far behind the curve I was in planning my future.  Planning my future at the time meant stocking up the fridge with enough booze saturday because the liquor stores would be closed sunday and I didn't have the funds to afford drinking at a bar for a night.  I hadn't taken the advice that everyone was telling me to get an internship because thats the way to get a job.  I started to panic as I sat in my apartment realizing that come may I would have to move back home because I hadn't looked for a job at all and had no qualifications other than a diploma I wasn't so sure that I was going to receive.

A woman came into one of my night classes and talked to us seniors saying that her company was hiring and anyone with any interest should come speak with her after class.  I jotted down her name and company to find her email address later.  I was wasted and couldn't have my first impression be liquor breath and inability to form a complete sentence. I'd email her tomorrow. Totally. Definitely. Absolutely. I had no choice.

Three weeks later I mustered up the courage to send her a short email, and she immediately set up an interview for the next week. Awesome, here's some hope.  I missed the interview because it was at 9am and I had passed out around 4am and wasn't conscious until about 9.  Shit, guess thats over. Fuck it, it was a pipedream anyways.

Then a series of events transpired unrelated to this and I became sober. 

I still moved back home, but was taking any advice I could get to heart.  I made a rockstar resume.  I applied to roughly 100 positions a week.  I was networking with my friends' parents and getting business cards.  I wasn't drinking. I was focused and determined when everything seemed to be falling apart.

Then I got a fucking job. I got a legit, college-kid, job.  Full time, 8-5, benefits.  It took a year after graduating to finally nail it down but I fucking nailed it.

I started that job a month ago.  I moved to a place 400 miles away from home by myself where I knew nobody and had no connections.  I've been going to meetings regularly and have started to make some connections with individuals.  I'm eating healthy, kicking ass at work, and excited about my future.

September 2013 me didn't know what a future was.  I was terrified of everything and numbed myself every night hoping tomorrow wouldn't come.  Every morning I'd wake up and my first thought would be ""fuck, not this again"".  It seems like so long ago but I remember exactly how terrifying and hopeless life was.  Things didn't come easy. They didn't change quickly. I had to put in alot of work when I thought the work was hopeless and stay true to what I believed.  

I can say that I'm happy today.  Truly honestly happy and content with the person I've started to turn into.  I'm excited for my future.  Its fucking surreal at times, and I still have wicked lows but I know how to deal with them and they are always followed by some awesome highs from life.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But I'm fucking doing it the right way now."
3b0quw,2,2015-06-24,"Gf [20F] broke up with me [20M] of two years, three weeks ago and I can't give up.",ijusttriedworkingout,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3b0quw/gf_20f_broke_up_with_me_20m_of_two_years_three/,"   Hello and thanks for reading!:)

   I had been friends with her since freshman year of high school and she was one of the first girls I could be open and say whatever I wanted to say with. Since day one of meeting her I thought she was very pretty (I don't think I look that attractive, not big or anything but I do do a college sport now), so I knew I couldn't really have a chance with her. I went throughout all of high school without having a girlfriend while she went through quite a few boyfriends. I was perfectly fine going without a high school relationship because to me they always seemed so dumb.

   The summer before our freshman year of college, her then boyfriend broke up with her. I only realized this because one day in July she texted me asking if I had a hot tub (I do and just got one) and wanted to hang out in my later that day in it. I was really shocked and thinking to myself ""wtf there is no way this is happening"" So then I asked her I our mutual friend should come too and she said no. So at this point I'm living an unreal day and I haven't even seen her. We had dinner and when we got back to my house she asked me if I had a girlfriend and I told her no so then she asked if I wanted to make out because she said she always thought I was hot and always wanted to. 

  The rest of the summer we hung out maybe like every other day or so and went on dates but I made it clear to her that I intended to stay single going into college. One day near the end of the summer, we were hanging out and she told me that one of her other guy friends asked her out and she told him she would think about it. Really she just told me that if I don't ask her out then she will take this other guy up on his offer. So then I thought of what the heck, I'll give it a shot and we started dating. We had sex a few times and it was really good, like insanely amazing.

   I went away to college, about an hour away from us, and she stayed home and went to a local university. The first week I wasn't really talking to her as much as I should have so she called me and told me she doesn't think it will work out and I told her that I'd talk to her more and this time I'd try to make it work. We agreed to stay together. That night while I was in bed I was trying to think if I really made the right decision. After literal hours of thinking about her I realized that she's perfect in every way for me and that's all I wanted. I started writing to her in the mail and she loved it. I didn't know how I got so lucky.

  She drove up almost every weekend to see me for my first two years of college. Her coming up with literally the best part of the week. For the first few months she didn't tell her parents we were dating because she wanted to sleep over at my place (she told them she was sleeping at a friends house). I didn't think that she did anything wrong for doing this but it still made me feel kinda bad. 
   The first time I ever was upset at her (freshman year October) was when her and her long time guy friend got tickets to a show that I really wanted to go to. I felt hurt that she didn't invite me but I didn't want to have a fight so I just brushed it aside.

  The next few months were really good until February. We were driving somewhere in the car and a band came on and she said ""Me and Dan are going to see them next month!"" She said that he bought the tickets and she was really excited. I was pretty upset but I thought that well hey it's just one night so I won't make it into an ordeal. Dan, fake name, was her boss who I think is two years older than us. I didn't like him from the first time I heard about him because our first summer together she told me how he would try scooting closer to her at dinner when they went out with friends or even putting his arm around her which she would brush him off. I had and still do have a hard time believing that Dan didn't want to get with her. I may be wrong but I'm not willing to drop $45 on a friend to go to a concert with me unless I wanted something. Also, on facebook this dude literally liked every single one of her posts and even the articles that she liked, if it popped up on her homepage he would hit the like button.
   
 Anyway, after the concert she knew something was up with me so I told her how uncomfortable I was with him and wanted to meet him. She agreed that it was fair for me to meet him and told me if he ever wanted to hang out she'd be sure to bring me. I was cool after knowing I would meet him soon.
  
   I spent six weeks of the summer away on an internship while she had an internship at home. We talked non stop and missed each other so bad. We decided that the next summer neither of us would apply to anything far away. 
   
  One night the next fall semester, she was sleeping with me in my bunk and I had to get up and go to the bathroom (the dorm I lived in had community bathrooms so I had to put sandals on before going in there.) I couldn't find my sandals and my phone with the flashlight app was up on top of my bunk. I grabbed her phone and used it. I was walking to the bathroom and noticed that Dan had texted her past midnight (it was on the unlock screen). This was messed up to me because before we went to sleep that night I asked if he said anything to her recently and she told me that she hasn't heard from him in weeks. Knowing this I went through the texts with him and almost every night he texted her goodnight. Also, the week before, she drove me to my roommates house where he then would drive me back. I told her to tell me when she got back home and she said she would. It turned out that she went out to dinner with Dan and when she got there she told me she was home. I confronted her as soon as I got back and neither of us could sleep the rest of the night.
    
 The next morning she asked if I still wanted her and I told her I did but she couldn't lie to me anymore and she agreed. I had to do something with my club the next day (she was going to drive me home) and when I saw her around noon she was yelling at me telling me I'm so insecure. She flipped it around on me so fast. I told her I never intended to go through her phone but that the text was on the lock screen, but I ended up agreeing with her and told her I wouldn't do that again.
     
 I even went to my schools free therapy to try to get better and not worry so much about things she does with guys like Dan. I told her I was going and she was very supportive of me.
     
Everything was then great again for a while but one night when cramming for a test I went on facebook and saw Dan was still liking all of her statuses. We Skyped the next day and I told her how weird I thought he was for still doing that. She kinda laughed and told me how she heard through Dan and her's mutual friend that Dan threw a New Year's party and everyone else wanted my girlfriend to go but Dan said ""no because she'll probably want to bring her boyfriend."" I blew a fuse at this because I still had not been introduced to him and she was letting this other guy, in my eyes, hit on her. I told her that she needed to tell him to back off or else maybe we shouldn't be together.
    
She was devastated that I gave her an ultimatum and within the next day or so, I felt terrible because I didn't want to ever lose her. I apologized and told her I would never do it again. She agreed to make sure that I actually meet him this time.
    
 At the end of our sophomore spring semester (this past April), I told her how I probably wouldn't be able to see her that much because I needed to study for my dental school exam. She understood and I made time for her every night all of May. I don't want to say that I felt something was off but I was feeling a little unsettled about our relationship because I knew I wasn't giving her 100%, but instead I was so focused and stressed about my upcoming test. I joked with her about how she was going to break up with me after I failed the test.
    
  I took the test on the last day of May and did great! She and her family were very excited for me. The very next day she told me that she didn't feel too good about the relationship because of our last fight and how I was acting the whole last month. I told her that I was still so sorry for the fight and would never give her an ultimatum again and that I was so stressed and didn't think so clearly during the last month so I was sure I wasn't all there after studying. 
    
 First week of June rolls around and I change to always want to see her and do things with her. She did hang out with me but would tell me while we were hanging out that she made plans later in the night (which she never used to do). I told her it was ok because I had been neglecting my high school friends for quite a while especially while studying. 
   
 She wanted me to come to her friends little sister's family party so I went and for about three hours I said five sentences to the group of her friends (5 girls). I would try to chime in where I could and ask her friends what they were doing for the summer but I only got like minimal responses from them and all they talked about was people that I didn't know from their old school. I didn't mind this because I usually already don't talk to them too much. They all had a sleepover that night so I left the party and went and hung out with my friends.
    
 The next morning she tells me we need to talk. Then she comes over and says ""I think we should break up, I don't know, maybe a break, I'm not sure."" She said she didn't love me like she used to. But to me that's only because of how stressed I have become. I was completely in shock and was feeling so sick in my stomach. I told her that I always wanted her to be happy and if she wanted to leave then she could. She left and we didn't work out if we were on a break or just done so I asked her the next day and she told me she didn't know. I asked if she wanted to go out to lunch or dinner in a few weeks and she said yes. I didn't talk to her for two weeks when last week I asked if she wanted to go out to dinner still and she told me she didn't think it was a good idea anymore. My heart dropped and I felt so bad for about the next hour, then she texts me and asks how my new job is. I tell her about it and she responds with a few pages of texts. She was on vacation with her family but was texting me for a large portion of it. We were talking about funny things that were happening and about things in our past. We still text every day but it is me that initiates the conversations.
   
  I have been reading this part of reddit a lot and everyone says no contact to get over her but trust me when I say that it won't work for me. My job entails a 8 to 4 job where I have to get up early and commute, ALL of my friends work jobs that they start around 5 and go all night (restaurants). Every day I am exhausted when I get home and none of my friends are open so it's not like I can do things to take my mind off her. I also work out every day but I don't feel better.
   
 Someone already gave me the advice to look at it from a third person's perspective and I did and I would want someone who truly loves another to not stop unless they were either given a second chance or told to not contact them again. She truly is the person I want to be with for the rest of my life. 

  I just want to get people's opinions on the whole relationship and if anyone has suggestions for me to do. We had a very loving relationship and always talked about getting married and going on vacations and spending time together. It was perfect.
 
  What makes things worse for me is that THREE of my friends have been through the same thing in the last few months and they all got back together with their girlfriends. Maybe it's something in the water here. Right now I'm taking it slow because I want to try to re-date her, and get a trial relationship in. I want to know that if I really don't make her happy then I'd stop and find someone else, but right now I can't.

**tl;dr**: After a few fights over the same guy I gave my ex an ultimatum and she told me she never quite recovered from it. I was withdrawn the last month of our relationship due to a test I had to take and she ended it with me because she said she didn't love me like she used to. "

[What has been your favorite part of book writing process. Before it's release and now after?  I've seen you mentioned a publisher telling you this book wouldn't sell, was there ever a moment where you questioned yourself and what the success of it would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshowix?context=5)|My process was unique because most of the writing wasn't written with ""a book"" in mind. i wrote for 10 years and then some of that was collected and turned into a book (along with some brand new writing). My favorite part was once i connected with an agent because suddenly it became real and there was a goal, a finish line, to get a deal, and finally have a book out. It was a lot of work but it all feels worth it now. The book tour was my favorite part, and just being able to read so many comments and tweets from people sharing what the book means to them. 
[Hey, Jamie! I met you a few years ago when you came to my university; you gave an incredible talk, and you were so nice. Thanks for that. :\)  My question is, TWLOHA has obviously grown enormously well-known and successful over the years, so how do you balance the business side with the heart side?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshooep?context=5)|Good question. The events are a big part of that balance. Because i get to meet so many people and those people remind me of the heart of the matter. There's a business (element) that comes with keeping TWLOHA going - today we were looking at office space for example - that's just a reality of being part of an organization. But i'm thankful for the moments that remind me why we do what we do. i just finished two weeks on the road for a book tour. i met so many people and heard so many stories, every single night. 
[Hi Jamie, I have always considered working for a non profit and seeing as yours is one I feel so strongly about, my question is: can being an intern for TWLOHA have the possibility of a future job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshr79v?context=5)|Our team (staff) definitely includes some former interns, so it's a possibility. We always encourage people not to assume or bank on that, because a bunch of factors go into that. Our team is smaller than people think so it's rare we have an opening to hire someone. But we love our interns and we are super grateful for what they give and add, and we love catching up with them after their time with us in Florida. 
[Jamie, how do you keep your head up when faced with stories of pain every single day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshp022?context=5)|I get asked this a lot. My own pain tends to weigh heavier on me than the collective stories i encounter. i've learned boundaries and limitations, that it's not about me (it's impossible) being the hero in every story. After an event or time on the road, i've learned to rest and unplug, and to share what i'm feeling or dealing with a few people around me. 
[Dear Jamie,  I came along your foundation quite by accident and has helped me get past self harm depression and suicidal thoughts. My question is, what would you advise me to say to people whose harmful words about my scars (which come from my very religious family members and my ex-husband\) and past struggles, cause me to want to hide in shame?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpmdt?context=5)|Boundaries are important. People's words can certainly hurt and i'm sorry you've felt it from people who meant a lot to you. A few things come to mind: Boundaries, meaning you don't have to be close to the people you were once close to, and they can't say whatever they want whenever they want... And the good news is: Other people exist! So find some good ones who do get it and don't cause you to want to hide. And talk to a counselor, because that can definitely help : ) 
[Thank you for all that you have done and are doing Jamie. I know that it's not easy to be raw and open, but these conversations are where healing begins and people can really start to help each other. Can I ask: 1\) what has been the hardest step in this process of helping others? 2\) how does your faith play out in what you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshq3ue?context=5)|The hardest step is that sometimes people want more than i can give. So learning how to let people down has been, and is at times, hard. We all have a worldview, we all place our faith in places, and for a lot of us it's a journey and it changes over time... And for all of us, how we live, what we do and what we run after, that indicates what we truly believe. i believe in a God who loves me and made me to be loved and known : ) 
[Hi there, I was wondering what I can do to help my less sensitive, less emotional family members to understand me when I'm having a rough patch? They look down on me for being sad. Help! I don't want to shut them out but they hurt my feelings when they mock me for feeling to much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshp1xo?context=5)|You can only be honest. If they don't understand, it sucks but you can't make them, you can't force it. But the good news is there's a lot of people on this planet and so i would encourage you to fight to find some folks who do get it, people who do want to listen and to know you. And the biggest thing: Know that it's okay to go to counseling. They will listen. They will get it. They can help lead you to change. Peace to you. 
[Hello Jamie! How has your life changed since your book If You Feel Too Much came out? Also, do you have a mailing address or email address where I could send you a letter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshot5a?context=5)|My life hasn't really changed much, except i got to go on a book tour for two weeks after the book came out, which was amazing. 12 cities all across America. And i got some nice texts and tweets when the book ended up on the NY Times Bestseller list. But now i'm home and things look pretty much the same as they did before : ) 
[Was there a single biggest turning point in your life that made you realize you wanted to devote yourself to the issues of self-harm, depression, and addiction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshodri?context=5)|I suppose it would have to be when i wrote the TWLOHA story in 2006. When that ""went viral,"" that was the turning point. That story basically took on a life of its own and i got to decide if i was willing to take a risk and leave the job i was doing in order to pursue TWLOHA full-time. i'm certainly glad i took that risk. 
[What advice to you have for someone making the first step to finding help? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshop2k?context=5)|Be honest with someone. Tell someone the truth. So that you're not alone with your pain. Beyond that, i absolutely believe in professional help, and that it's perfectly okay and normal to ask for help. This is a great place to start: [Link to twloha.com](http://twloha.com/find-help/local-resources/)
[What advice would you give to other writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpq9l?context=5)|Write. Start there. Be honest. We don't have much control over who reads it or if it ends up in a book or if someone wants to turn it into a movie. But we are made to tell stories and to be known. So start there. And read too. They go together : ) 
[Hey Jamie! I love the book and TWLOHA. I've never felt so close to an organization before and what you have done has impacted a lot of people.  My question is where do you see TWLOHA headed in the next 5 to 10 years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpdv0?context=5)|Not sure!!! My year has been all about the movie and then the book. i need to take some time to think about the future. i know i want us to keep being creative in bringing a message of hope and help to folks all over. i want us to keep doing different things, and i want that personally. Today we talked about me going to Iraq!
[What are some of the highlights of how your faith or religious sentiment changed over the years? Where are you on that journey now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpn3l?context=5)|I have more questions these days. i say ""i don't know"" more. i don't want to tell people how to live or think or vote. i want people to feel like their questions matter and that life is worth living, and that they deserve to be loved. 
[Are there any places you would like to visit that you have not yet had the chance to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshqdtt?context=5)|Ireland and Italy come to mind.

And hopefully you can build on it so that you feel like you have a solid support group, and a solid group of friends, over time.

I wouldn't say I'm an extrovert, but I'm fine with talking and socializing, but this is my first job and I'm kinda nervous.

3b1amp,6,2015-06-25,I was told my case was appropriate for this subreddit... May I present you... my controlling mother!,smxckmybxtchup,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3b1amp/i_was_told_my_case_was_appropriate_for_this/,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has been extremely aggressive and verbally abusive. She wants to control everything and everyone around her, even when it comes to the smallest, pettiest things. But it's always been bearable. Sort of. I often doubt myself and am a chronic pessimist thanks to her. And now you ask me ""Why do you let it get to you?"". Just keep reading, you'll find out.


Anyway... recently, a series of negative events in my education (not my fault, I ripped myself a new asshole studying and the professor is an extremely immature 40 years old man, so he fucks us all over on purpose) have been accumulating and have placed an even bigger strain on our relationship.


Whenever money is involved, my mother gets very, very serious. To the point of pettiness.


I'm an immigrant in a very shitty southern European country (my parents and I are from an equally shitty Eastern European country) and students here pay mad money for education. If you fail a class, you pay double. Fail it again, you pay triple. And so on and on... it can go up to a 1000 euros per class (and yes, this is a public university I'm talking about). This is where our problems come from.


The unemployment rate among young people here is ridiculously high. But I still keep trying to find a job because I believe that you can find anything if you look hard enough. I'm at a point where I need to look for an internship already... I get called for interviews, they hear my accent (which gets worse when I'm nervous but is still perfectly understandable) and never call me again even though they initially seemed very interested in my skills and languages, especially since people here do not tend to even learn English properly. But maybe they didn't like something else in me or my behaviour, those are just the observations I gathered.


Why am I telling you this? Well, no job = no money. The government does not help students and universities (public or private) try their best to fuck their students over in order to obtain more income. I have been failed for absolutely no reason at all, even though my exam was impeccable. Just fml. But Eastern European parents are very similar to the stereotypical Asian parents. It's ALWAYS your fault, no matter what, never the professor's.


Again, I'm trailing off... So, it's come to a point in which I get daily verbal abuse and I can't do anything to prevent it. She would attack me a few times a day after work. I can't ignore her, pretend to listen or calmly agree with a smile on my face like my friends have suggested. I have tried it all.


She would not leave me alone until she has me screaming back at her. She would follow me around the whole flat trying to antagonise me. She admitted to liking it; she likes making me feel like shit because she thinks I deserve it. I get insulted, blamed, attacked and from time to time, she would even hit me/slap me.


I am trying my hardest to find a job to get out of this situation. But it's really hard. No kind of job without any experience can even pay rent here. And I can't go to another country where I know my skills would be better appreciated (I applied for internships and positions in northern countries and I even got the job in a few occasions, just to see if maybe I seemed like a really shitty person, thus my trouble finding employment here) because I have no money. I fully depend on my parents financially and they do not ever put more than a hundred euros in my account because they truly believe I will run away.


The abuse is daily and now has turned nightly. If I go out all day and come home late at night in order to avoid it all, she will get out of bed specifically to attack me again for whatever the hell I did.


I got nowhere else to go (most people are just forced to live with their parents here as jobs don't pay much), I got two semesters left to graduate (which seems like a shit ton of time under all this pressure) and I feel like I'm going to die. What do I do? Help me. Help. I can't handle this. My mental health is strongly deteriorating. It's really bad. And I have really bad thoughts, like it's never going to get better for me because of the shit luck I've had in life so far.


And yes, I have tried sitting her down and reasoning with her. No, it does not work. I got attacked again.


**tl;dr:** Mother won't stop verbally and sometimes physically abusing me because of a class I failed no matter what technique I apply to avoid the confrontation. Won't stop until I'm crying or screaming."

I have a one year old son and a wife, so safety is more important than anything else. We are looking to rent, probably maximum of $1400 per month for at least a 2 bed 1 bath, but preferably 3/2 if possible. I would also prefer a maximum of 30m commute, but will extend it if necessary.

Thanks for any help!

EDITS: If it helps, here is some extra info about my situation. Dog friendly is a must, as we have a Miniature German Shepherd we can not part with. Family friendly is #1 on my list. In a town with some parks or places to walk our dog would be welcome, but not essential to start off my life in MD. If you happen to know, Daycare friendly. My wife runs a daycare, so it would be awesome for her to start it in MD. Finally, Corvias sadly isn't an option as they told me they don't have openings for interns."

I'm at a homeless shelter for my practicum. My PI -- a QLCSW -- is nice and kind and caring but over-worked. He's got about 50 people under him so my day to day is spent answering to someone else. We shall call him the SwoleBeast, since he's often getting prison swole and juicing.  

Dude is a rough operator in recovery without even an AA. (How he runs a program at one of only two homeless shelters in the city, I don't know...) I guess he used to wash toilets at the shelter before being in charge of the lives of vulnerable people. Nothing wrong with any of those things, but worth mentioning for background. He's been in the position for about three years. The person before him was an MSW and left under odd circumstances. He was living with her while washing toilets at the shelter and suddenly a lot of her money went missing and she resigned. These are known facts all the staff at the shelter *I have spoken to about him* acknowledges. 

Now here is my quandary. About a month ago, a huge hideous painting in an office went missing for about five minutes. Turns out he got it from an ex-girlfriend and he views it as a symbol of his sobriety. 
It was moved by my PI who enjoys playing games. I guess his first degree in rec therapy predisposes him to hijinx. Anyway, the SwoleBeast thought it was me and he's been treating me
Like rubbish ever since. A week earlier in a meeting about a client I insisted that no matter what he wants, a client's responsible desires supersede his own. All the staff there agreed, including our boss, Loki, QLCSW. 
 I ignored the glares and disdain. I ignored him inviting everyone else out to lunch or calling people to offer to bring them something back. I chalk it up to my status as an intern, because the other people in the office are BSWs who got hired. 
And frankly, I don't mind much. Haters gonna hate. Except that my clients are suffering. I need to find them transitional housing or job training or whatever, and he doesn't cooperate. For example, phone messages won't be delivered; faxes will be thrown away; forms don't get filled out on time.
So now I can't do my job, and a client who should have been housed a month ago is only now leaving the shelter.
So, what do I do? "
3b1ot5,348,2015-06-25,How to be the most hated intern of all time,antonhansel,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3b1ot5/how_to_be_the_most_hated_intern_of_all_time/,"Gather around fellow IT guys,

This is the tale of my first internship, after only a few months of school.

I was working in a 4500+ employees company operating all around Europe. Their IT service was really understaffed, located in a small city in the countryside. I was employed in a big city where my supervisor, Mr.P was the only IT guy and had to deal with about 300~ employees. 
The IT service was treated so bad that EVERYONE quit at the same time a few months later. But this is a story for next time.

On the friday morning of my first week of internship everything was going fine, Mr.P brought me a NAS in raid1 and told me to erase it, switch it in raid0 and to put it into the server room. He told me that server was named ""NAS-City"".

I looked for the IP using WireShark and found a NAS called ""NASCity"" under some IP. ""NAS-City"" was nowhere to be found, Mr.P was gone until the next monday, I didn't want to appear lazy, I just thought he misspelled the name. I connected to the NAS, the credentials are accepted, I click on ""switch to raid0"".

I shit you not, less than 5 seconds after I clicked someone called the IT office complaining his files were gone. The phone was blinking, mails started to flood the IT service mailbox, shit hit the fan really hard.

Turns out I erased a year worth of work of the service in charge of making the 600 pages catalog for the company products. These guys were all working on files on the NAS, they had no local copy.


The credentials worked because this company is using the exact same credentials for every NAS (400~) they have. ಠ_ಠ

There were about 50 people involved in the making of the catalog and they take their vacation in August, when the catalog goes to printing to be distributed in September.

Well, this year, they all had to cancel their vacations and worked from 7:30AM to 11PM during June, July and August to build back what was deleted. They even had to re-hire models and photographs to take pictures of the products.



The best part? About a month before I arrived in the company, my supervisor sent a mail to this particular service informing them that they should NOT consider this storage safe, that hard drive failure was possible, that there were absolutely no backups.


Needless to say these guys hated me, good times, good times.

I have posted here before on another account.


I am a hardcore gamer, as in I used to play way too much I still do play but not as much. In December 2013 at 04:00am in the morning I was playing Minecraft online and I met this girl. Now often you will meet really young girls on minecraft so it wasn’t like I was instantly flirting, plus I am not that kind of guy. I have always seen myself as a respectful person especially towards  females.

So This girl and I start talking over Minecraft and I enjoy her company, she then told me that she is a similar age to me. I am 18 she is 16 almost 17. She told me her real name and I find her on facebook and we started talking. Not a lot, only about once or twice a week. We had a lot in common so we got along very well. 

After a month or so we started talking more and more to the point that we would talk from the time she was awake to the point I had to go to sleep. Keep in mind that there is a 8 hour time difference. She lives somewhere in America and I live somewhere in Africa. So we could only really talk from 03:00pm to 12:00am, and that is what we did every day for about a month. 
I realised that I liked her, and I know she liked me. I was really uncomfortable with the idea of a long distance relationship. Keep in mind I was still in school at the time with no job and I wouldn’t ( still haven’t) have been able to go see her due to a lack of funds. I tried to avoid getting into a relationship with her   but we obviously liked each other too much. In May 2014 we realised that we both loved each other very much. We would spend upto 8 hours on skype playing minecraft together and just chatting about what ever.

She told me that I was the first guy that she had ever met that hadn’t asked her to send nude pics within the first 10 mins. Knowing this girl for 4 months I had never asked or hinted for nude pics (apparently that she found that attractive) well it seemed all was going to be perfect, I would arrange to see her the next year (2015) and we could be in a relationship. Stupid me thinking the world is so simple. 

One night we were talking over whatsapp and our conversations were getting pretty sexy, lets just say nude pics were shared. A month later her mom found them, took her phone and laptop away and I couldn’t speak to her again. Another month down the line (july 2014) She got her phone and laptop back. Obviously we continued talking, behind her parents backs. In November (2014) we’re caught exchanging nude pics again and her phone was taken away again. Her parents had the phone camera disabled, but she still wasn’t allowed to talk to me. Well... she continued talking to me in January this year. 

I often was scared that our relationship was only sexual, but I realised that I enjoyed talking to this girl even though I have not received a nude pic in 6 months. I know now that I really do love her and I love spending time with her. 

I had sent multiple letters to her parents but her parents just seem to think that if they ignore me that I will disappear from the face of the earth and stop talking to their daughter. I feel really bad for being so devious and going behind their backs like this. 

Now you’re probably wondering why I still haven’t gone to see her this year, as was the plan last year. Well since I have just finished high school I am not exactly rolling in cash, I couldn’t find a decent job in the small town I live in. I did however find a really cool internship opportunity at a school. Yes a school.(I enjoy working with children) This school is really small and emphasizes a small student to teacher ratio. I teach computers and coach various physical activities. Being an internship i don’t get paid much but I have gained lots of valuable experience. And with that experience I hope to land my self a job in an American summer camp next year. The ball is rolling and it seems I will have a job in the same state as my girlfriend. 

Today I wrote her parents an email explaining everything, apologizing and trying to arrange a meeting over skype to apologize face to face. I just hope they don’t ignore me again. 

Many times I thought I would never hear from her again, but I did. Often I thought about giving up because it felt like every force in the world was against me being with this girl that I love so much. 


I am sorry this is so long, I just thought I would share. In my opinion, if you really love someone, you won’t ever give up on them. 

Lastly I want anyone that happens to read this that is thinking of going into a LDR to know; it's not easy and there is a high level of trust required for it to work.

3b20cu,0,2015-06-25,Volunteer writers needed for a new type of men's magazine,RussRamster,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/3b20cu/volunteer_writers_needed_for_a_new_type_of_mens/,"Hello journalists and journalism enthusiasts. 

Roughly 6 months ago I had the idea to create a new type of magazine directed at men.


Lad magazines focus on tits and giggles, while men’s magazines focus on expensive watches, suits and cars. So basically what they provide is superficial filth or in the best case scenario, quasi-intellectualism. 


The world is fighting for equality on a lot of fronts, and I wish to fight for gender equality. My magazine will be directed towards young men, ages 15-30. The main focus will be gender-equality from a male’s perspective. Other subjects will be your usual light subjects that most men care about, such as technology or sports. The magazine will also have a fashion section. So that’s going to be a-ma-zing!


My struggle is finding some writers. You don’t have to be an experienced journalist. You can be a student in any field, or maybe you had a blog, or just a passion for reading and writing. I’d also like to find some people with an entrepreneurial mindset, so that maybe one day, this online magazine could become a proper publication. 


So, if you enjoy writing, tell me. If you are passionate about politics, psychology, medicine, science, social issues, music, sports or fashion, tell me. Male or female, everyone is welcome. The only thing you must have is an open mind. I am also looking for some photographers. You will have full creative power over your own work.


About myself: 23 year old marketing student, both parents are journalists at a small town newspaper, I had a small period when I wrote for a newspaper myself. I like sunshine, rainbows and fairness. High standards are a priority when it comes to journalism.


Feel free to ask questions. 


EDIT: I am not doing this for money. In fact, you might understand the concept better as a collective of bloggers. I don't expect many people to understand, but I believe in this cause and don't want to just write alone. I know I am a douche for even mentioning free writing, especially when I know how bad it was for myself to do it as a full-time intern, and how bad it was for my parents when the newspaper was struggling to pay employees.

Eventually this cuased everyone to call me lazy and me believing it

so far i got  Ritalin and aderal but niether did something for me on the ADD problems (being Forgetfull, no focus, way too much thoughts all the time, you guys prob know the problems)
Aderal did help me with getting trough the morning though (gotta love speed, not being tired the entire morning(dexamphetamine))

These are the problems im dealing with :

I lay awake untill a hour of 2-3 and my thoughts go on a crazy thinking spree untill that time (i'm off the pc a hour before i go to bed)
And in the morning it feels almost impossible to sit up, or to even move. I can fall back asleep while im sitting straight up in bed trying to wake up a bit, i often cant even rember being waked up by people earlier that morning (someone saying they woke me up for the 3e time, but i cant recall the first two times)

i life in a house where you must clean everything up after yourself and i do tend to forget quite some things 
Incuding chores in house, getting some grocerys, cooking dinner ect., this afcourse resluting in pissed parents, eventhough i dont forget it intentionally(they also need to get used to that i have ADD)

i eat very unhealthy (not sure if related though) i eat 1 slice of bread at breakfast with a glass of milk, at lunch i eat nothing or 1-2 slices of bread
and dinner, and some water during the day

i also get hungery at weird times (again, not sure if related) normally i eat about 1/5th of a plate at dinner, but eat 2-3 more plates around 8-9 in the evening

on school i'm always strugelling to pay attention.
if i find the subject intresting i start to go off topic with it and start thinking about other possibilitys, and when im not intrested i normally fall asleep
Also during my internship i forgot i had test at school i had to take cuasing me to have half a year delay now

when i start gaming i lose my sense of time, and if im alone i can play easily 12-15 hours without realising i have been playing for that long
(p.s. does anyone else start sweating quite a bit when they game and get into a hyperfocus?)

i often go somewhere and forgetting something that i need at that place (Example:go to the gym and forget my bag, clothes)

being distracted while talking to people, your trying your best to focus on them talking but somehow your thoughts are louder and you simply cant understand him, this happens to me; face to face, telephone, and skype

when i'm in groups and more then one person talk at the same time, then i slowly get a headace developing into a panic attack if i do nothing about it ofcourse the bigger the group the faster the development (this is almost reduced to zero when im high or quite drunk)

Becuase of a lot of these things i also dont really hang out with people, since i sleep till late in the weekends, and when i start gaming that day is basically over, also i dont hear what they say 75% of the time forget i would meet them ect.
so i keep it with friends just to talking over chat

and if i find something intresting to do, i can completely obsess about it and waste way too much time on it to perfect it and add things that arent that neccery

Also i wanted to learn to learn to programm, however i have massive trouble to start with this

When i talk (or type) my brain thinks faster then i talk(type) sometimes cuasing me to leave one to a few words or even complete sentences

3b2jko,3,2015-06-25,The Interest Inflation,cnokha,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/3b2jko/the_interest_inflation/,"I'll begin by stating that will probably be in the wrong sub-reddit but also relate to social anxiety or mild cases of depression.

So I've got this pattern I've started to notice ever more strongly after starting my therapy sessions, and I've always kind of noticed this feeling being with me wherever I go or whatever I do. The feeling of impulses, stronger at the beginning but after the initial pulse it fades very quickly.

Let me elaborate. Ever since from my childhood I've never had a 'thing of my own', I'd follow the booming trends in hopes of finding something special, something for me, something I would love to do. I've had my part of searching through hobbies, only to find nothing to fully satisfy my hunger, nothing to keep me interested long enough, no real drive for things.

And it hasn't been limited to just hobbies. I've never really had a life goal to pursue, more like aimlessly drifting through life and now here I am, 25 years old and at complete lack of drive. There is however, one thing that I've managed to kept close to my interests and that is video gaming. Nearly 20 years now but it's still the only thing constant in my life and the only thing I fall back to. But even that is beginning to change and I've recently started feeling this void building up inside of me, slowly eating me from inside out. And now I'm afraid I'll never find anything to fill the void again. Video gaming has been in my life so long I don't think I could live entirely without it, but there isn't anything to really replace or support my interests.

The way I feel this fits in social anxiety is in reality I think this feeling, the void inside, is what keeps me from fully getting into new experiences as a part of me feels the initial feeling will not last for too long and I'll just eventually grow numb or bored of it. Same thing applies to supported internships I've been attending to recently. After the initial feeling of being part of something, doing something useful, it quickly fades into nothingness.

While all this sounds more like depression than social anxiety, I don't relate myself to the descriptions. I do, however, recognize some characteristics of hypomania or the milder form hypermania in myself.

If nothing else, I'd like to know if anyone else has these kind of feelings, and how they deal with them?

P.S. Sorry for a rambly train-of-thoughts post, can't quite think straight right now"
3b2klp,2,2015-06-25,What kind of jobs can I get with an associate's?,HumanMilkshake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b2klp/what_kind_of_jobs_can_i_get_with_an_associates/,"Like it says in the title, what kind of jobs could I reasonably get with an associate's, and what would they involve? 

I'm look at going back to college soonish, and I'm thinking it might be more in my interest to get an associates first, get a job in CS, and go for a bachelor's part time, but I'd like to know what kind of jobs I could get with an associates and what the work environment would be like, especially compared to if I had a bachelor's.

The reason for this is that from previous coursework, I should be able to get enrolled at the local community college and get an associate's in CS in a year. Getting a bachelor's would take *at least* 3 years for the courses, and probably another year to get enrolled. Difference of 3 years stuck at a job I hate.

Also, if it wouldn't be too much to ask, could I get some input on which of these two associates are better for me? 

* [Programming for Database/Web](http://mccneb.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/Course-Catalog/Programs-of-Study/Information-Technology-and-E-Learning/Information-Technology/Information-Technology-Degree-Options/Information-Technology-Programming-for-DatabaseWeb-ITDWO) which includes coursework in C++, but seems to have less web-specific courses and has no internship requirement. That makes it seem like it would be more difficult for me to find a job, but C++ is what the bachelor's program is built around

* [Web Development](http://mccneb.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/Course-Catalog/Programs-of-Study/Information-Technology-and-E-Learning/Information-Technology/Information-Technology-Degree-Options/Information-Technology-Web-Development-ITWDO), which has a lot of front-end and design coursework and an internship requirement, but less of the classes will transfer to the four year college and it's built more around web design then web development.

Little backround, I am (22M) Living in kansas city, Been here 6 months. Since coming here to support my girlfriend, I have went into a super depressive state. I have gained 40lbs (after losing 100 over the past year from being overweight now im overweight again) and found i was getting anxiety just walking out the door again. I made strides to improve myself and not get in a rut by going to the library for a hour every other day. So i can learn and not feel as if I am having a hard time with living on my own. This month of June I was told by my parents who were lending a hand to our rent that they would be stopping at this month and I would be taking care of July rent. Which meant one thing JOB! Now I have been battling a work trigger/anxiety for 6 years now (which actually made me have good cry over it last night because i cant believe ive struggled this long without being able to support myself) The anxiety lies at the base when i was working a bussing shift at the age of 16 (working 35 hours plus highschool) I broke out in my first panic attack. Depersonalization, crying, thought loops the whole nine yards. The reason i found for that was, I had just gotten in for my shift, the previous person left two large parties I had to clean and i had a million other things on my mind. I forgot to mention i was fighting a possession charge over 2oz of Cannabis I had picked up for a friend because it was his birthday 
WRONG PLACE WRONG TIME SITUATION. (That i was sure i was going to jail, but luckily did not)  I ended up having a breakdown before work the next day, and having a noshow nocall because i was deathly afraid of the repercussion from this, I mean 8 months i was fine never experienced anything like this. And then a bomb went off and everything in me came down and ive been picking it up randomly ever since. I went to speak with my supervisor the next day, and to my best efforts to explain to her she fired me. Now this isnt some job i just randomly walked into and got, THIS is the job my father worked and was working still for 19years. A busser at this establishment for 19years. And because i had ONE panic attack that i left them hanging on this lady decided to fire me. Now my father of course had to keep working and said he was sorry that happened, and he couldnt do anything about it. From that day forward my life changed, Everytime i would look for a job or get a job I would seize up from the minute i got there. My head racing, wondering about all the things that could go wrong. I ended up leaving 9 jobs on the first week in my first 3 years of trying. Then i gave up because i just didnt know how to break this barrier. I was exhausted at trying to work at these stores then freaking out, and having a trigger in place then if i went back. It made me avoid things while driving in my home town to not even buying groceries because i had walked out of the job i had there. I get so embarrassed that my actions do this and i freak out with no clear way of helping it and leave. I have been to 8 therapists/psychologists before i was 21, They taught me CBT, and calming down techniques but never helped me get to the root of this thing. All made bad efforts at helping in the end. And with not having a income all these years I have not been able to afford anything for myself. I have not gotten any assistance other then my parents (who are both under 40K salaries) which makes them hurt even more because they cant support a 22 year old man anymore.  This year has been my one year ive bucked up and moved to a whole new city, cut back extensively on my pot use(Still a user 4-5times a week. I have been Addicted to that shit since i was 12) AND found myself 3 jobs all while here. I am making super progress on some of my anxieties! As per usual though i have left those jobs from day one to three. I reverted back to having panic about being physically drained, and not knowing anyone to being uncomfortable in a work environment. Now i am left with one week to come up with 500$, and no where to turn. I guess I come to you guys to rant that little thing off my chest because i just have been not able to deal with it. I have to take my girlfriend to her internship now (no paid) she works part time at a nursery 300$ a month maybe on a good month. So I must cut this short, And excuse me for being such a scatter brain! I ask for advice, help, anything you can throw at me to maybe help me see a better light! 

PS&gt;I have a consular that is really bad right now and i have not got the balls yet to say i need another person to guide me. But all in all I am learning DBT there and trying to apply those skills as well. "

Then need to find a job that pays okay in the mean time. Also, currently on indefinite leave from college (final year) since stuff happened, and this happened, and I've got no money to pay tuition... anyways, not too sure about things as I've NEVER held a job (just an internship) here in the Philippines so not sure so sure about requirements. Probably prefer something that will allow me to get some units for college at the same time (only a few more units till graduation, but yeah, need to earn money first). If I go get an NBI Clearance, SSS number, and a TIN number by myself (registering as a ""Professional""), will that speed up the hiring process? Or should I rely on the company for these things? As far as I know, a nightshift call center job would be ideal for my needs, but I'm not so sure... Advice? Requirement? Referrals?

I am currently a Sophomore going into my Junior year working on a BS in CS and I'm hoping to get more into security and penetration testing but I am currently at a loss for where to go to learn more.



I have gotten an internship at a fairly large retail company in their IT security team but this has not really helped me learn anything more about the field or how to prepare myself, I have simply been doing tickets and working on a project to teach end users more about security and the ""human firewall"". Outside of work, however, I have been doing my best to scour the internet to learn what I can. I have been doing work with webgoat, kali (and most of the top tools included in it), tweeter (sql injection), and a few other tools. I've spent some time learning python, ruby and objective-c in an attempt to gain some deeper knowledge. I've also watched quite a few videos from security conferences (shout out to irongeek.com for hosting all of these!) but this does not really give me any sort of hands on experience. I just found out about overthewire and I will be starting on some of the levels whenever time permits. I've done work with Vbox and setting up some labs and I have managed to break metasploitable and parts of DVL. Last but not least, I've tried to get into ctf365 but I just am not at the level where anything that I can do is good enough. Which brings me to my next part.



I guess from this point on I am a bit lost as to where to move to next. I have been looking into GPEN and the PWK course in an attempt to learn more as my university does not provide any good security courses. Are those beneficial for someone like me? I have tried to learn more about protocols but all the books that I have tried to read are just so damn dry. I have some connections into a large security company that I can talk to if that would be beneficial. 



What do you guys think? I'm really open to most anything as I am just at a loss on how to really learn more. I feel like right now I am at a point where everything that I am doing is just learning HOW to do these things, not really learning the WHY or gaining any useful knowledge.



Thanks!

*  HTML &amp; CSS (I know the very basics but it's still new to me)
* Javascript &amp; JQuery (Know very basics)
* Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails (Haven't Even Touched it Yet)

	I am writing this for two purposes: one is to thank this sub and its great members, the other is to share my story of success from what I thought was the end. 

Background: I am a 19 year old boy from the United States who suffers from a rare heart disorder known as Congenital Heart Block or CHB. CHB occurs in one in every 22000 newborns and has a higher risk of affecting kids of mothers who suffer from Lupus. My disorder causes me to require a pacemaker, throughout my life this never caused me any issues.. until recently. 

Situation: On black Friday 2014 I began to feel not entirely healthy and my heart began to falter. I contacted the hospital and discovered my pacemaker had been in ERI (Electric Replacement Index) mode for a couple weeks. I was hospitalized within a week and was set to receive heart surgery to replace the generator and add a new lead to my heart. This was all going on while I was in my first semester of my freshman year and was working 10-25 hours a week at an internship (the people at my company were great at understanding my medical issues and gave me all the freedom I needed). Needless to say my surgery delayed my schooling, more importantly my finals, until the beginning of 2015 and the start of the spring semester. The notion that preparing for 5 finals, taking 6 classes while also juggling an internship and attempting to please my girlfriend of a year and half would tear me apart never occurred to me. I blindly went into my spring semester with a “I got this” mentality. I prepared for my finals adequately but neglected to pay attention to my spring semester classes and eventually got wrapped up in the pressure from all of my obligations and began to fall off the wagon. I became addicted to drugs and at one point sold my xbox one I got from my parents as a Christmas gift to help fuel my drug addiction. I would snake money into my pocket anyway I could, stealing, lying, selling belongings, making false promises. I have since estimated in a 5 month period I spent 1200$ dollars on drugs. I was a suicidal mess that couldn’t get up in the morning without getting high. I lied to my girlfriend through all of this and claimed I was fine in fear of her leaving me. It wasn’t until one morning when I had just came down from an acid trip that I realized my life was falling apart rapidly and I was going to lose everything if I didn’t act. I called my parents and came clean regarding my lying and drug habits. I told my girlfriend what I had done and explained how I let it get so bad. She was understanding but didn’t think us staying together was a great idea, to which I agreed for pretty good reasons. I was alone to fight my struggles and anxiety for the last month or so of schooling. I was put on a 30mg dosage of celexa that ultimately ended up making me more suicidal and depressed, eventually I stopped taking it. 

Post-realization: I managed to, with the help of this subreddit and close friends, pull together my life and pass all 6 classes! My GPA was not as good as I had hoped but it was enough to keep my financial aid. I have since fixed things with my girlfriend and have worked 40 hours a week throughout the summer so far. I have been seeing a therapist regularly and have started taking propranolol to help stop my anxiety and tremor problems that I developed during the course of the past 6 months or so. Oh, and I also bought a new xbox . 

I am here to say thank you to all the great people who contribute to this great subreddit and, in turn, have helped thousands upon thousands of people with their everyday lives! Live long and prosper my friends.

3b3vp0,1,2015-06-25,Resources for a future CS intern (Team Treehouse?) xpost from /r/ComputerScience,Th3HoopMan,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3b3vp0/resources_for_a_future_cs_intern_team_treehouse/,"Hey guys, I just recently switched to majoring in CS and after my first full semester i'm preparing to look for internships for the upcoming spring. There's a lot of skills companies look for (I'm pursuing a career in android development and or front-end software and web-development) that I just won't be able to learn in class by the time interview season rolls around. This summer I have essentially a month left where I can grind 6-7 hours most days just studying essential skills such as knowledge of:

*  Android Dev (I'm very comfortable With Java)
*  HTML &amp; CSS (I know the very basics but it's still new to me)
* Javascript &amp; JQuery (Know very basics)
* Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails (Haven't Even Touched it Yet)

I've been going through and taking notes on the courses (which I plan to complete within the next couple days) on codecademy which are neat but I recognize they aren't everything I need. I was wondering if anyone can testify to how well a resource like Team Treehouse would prepare me for a standard CS internship. It's $25 a month and that's kind of a commitment seeing i'm already in debt from being enrolled in college already. If anybody has advice on what I need to do to prepare that'll be immensely helpful.

3b3wtz,2,2015-06-25,[VA] Landlord lying about cost of repairs and demanding I pay difference.,ThanklessPanda,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3b3wtz/va_landlord_lying_about_cost_of_repairs_and/,"Hi.

M/21 college student moved from my parents house April 15th of this year to a place I found on Craigslist. Guy (let's call him Andy) who lived here seemed really nice, 22 years old, his parents owned the place but lived overseas. We hit it off pretty well, for the first week we have nice conversations over dinner and go through 3-4 bottles of (my) wine. He left ten days after I moved in, as he had to go work an internship in LA, and I've since been here on my own. He mentioned in conversation that the AC doesn't work very well on the hotter days and some days he sleeps in the basement. Something else to consider, to make myself seem a good candidate as a roommate, I informed him of my finances. I'm not affluent by any means, but while attending community college, I've waited tables full-time since I was 18 and saved (and invested) the majority of the money I've made, so I do have more of a cushion than most people my age.

June 9th the AC broke, so I ask Andy what he wants to do about it- He says he's having a stressful week, but will look into it when he has time. June 18th (after the hottest week so far this year, RIP) he arranges to have a family friend (heretofore referred to as Michael) come over and look at it. Michael is great, and by the 19th he's replaced the motor and the AC is working fine. 

Throughout all of this, the subject of payment comes up, and Andy and I have been texting back and forth trying to determine who is responsible for paying for the repair of the AC. The relevant part of the contract states 

&gt; &gt;  RESIDENT acknowledges that he has examined the premises and that said premises, all furnishings, fixtures, furniture, plumbing, heating, electrical facilities, all items listed on the attached property condition checklist, if any, and/or all other items provided by OWNER all are clean, and in good satisfactory condition except as may be indicated elsewhere in this Agreement. RESIDENT agrees to keep premises and all items in good order and good condition and to immediately pay for costs t o repair and/or replace any portion of the above damaged by RESIDENT, his guests and/or invitees, except as provided by law. At the termination of this Agreement, all of above items in this provision shall be returned to OWNER in clean and good condition except for reasonable wear and tear and the premises shall be free of all personal property and trash not belonging to OWNER. It is agreed that all dirt, holes, tears, burns, and stains of any size or amount in the carpets, drapes, walls, fixtures, and/or any other part of the premises, do not constitute reasonable wear and tear.

Reasonable wear and tear being key here.

Speaking with Michael, he's told me that the filter in the fan has likely never been replaced since the house was built in 1982. He also said that the AC was the original unit that came with the house, and that he'd have replaced the entire unit instead of just the motor had Andy not told him to try and keep the fix as cheap as possible. Upon inquiring, Michael told me that the motor for a unit such as this typically costs about $300.

Over text, my landlord asks me if I'll take the bill so long as the cost is under $900. $900?! For a $300 motor and a few hours of labor. No. After more conflict, he finally agrees to paying 50% of the cost of repair. I offer to take 60% of the burden so long as he takes it 'as a gesture of gratitude, not one of guilt.' Then the next day he finally hits saying that 'theoretical roof' of $900 is the actual bill. I knew something was up, so the next day I spoke with Michael, and he told me he charged Andy $380 TOTAL. Upon hearing this, I wanted to make it very clear that I was no longer grateful, and the next day I deposited a check of $190 into Andy's bank account. 50% of $380. I don't hear anything from him for the next two days, until I receive via email an invoice demanding I pay $540 (60% of $900), or he will remove it from the safety deposit I paid him upon moving in. 

Please send help.

I'm trying to upload all of the texts between both myself and my landlord / myself and Michael. Imgur doesn't like my jpg's for some reason though. Have a Doctor's appointment to go to, but I'll try and upload pictures when I get back.

tl;dr I feel like I shouldn't be paying anything, I offered to pay 60% of what I expected to be a reasonable bill, I'm demanded to pay 60% of what is ~2.5x the actual bill. "

3b40or,5,2015-06-25,Can junior developers and startups mix well?,ccricers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b40or/can_junior_developers_and_startups_mix_well/,"I've been thinking about this more and more as I've read stories on here about very new startups hiring people right out of college, and inadequately preparing them for the professional world. Or offering them laughably low wages. Or even stories like being a sophomore intern having the most technical experience out of anyone in the company. Yikes! I too have been burned out by startups in the past, namely that they didn't want to take a big risk on me by deciding to hire me (and a few other people) as a 1099 instead of a W2 but I still have to show up at the office and work certain hours.

To this I ask, are many startups doing more harm than good by hiring inexperienced developers? Working for one is almost like gambling and I believe that's better suited for people who can afford to lose what they put in. Most junior employees aren't ready for that. A lot of them are still paying off college debt. And they would need all the financial stability they could get. 

Sometimes I wish managers and business owners in more startups would hire only senior-level employees first. When a business is financially uncertain and looking for a direction, it doesn't make sense to hire developers that are in a similar state of mind."

I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:

I do not require any pay at all

I have free time

I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*

I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software

I have satisfactory grades: 
near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL)
40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)

I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.

I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so.
I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day. 

PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.

*I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay."

Hello! In honor of the second premiere day, I thought I'd create a long form narrative post to provide an example of what the experience of becoming a Big Brother HG might be like, as well as provide some strategic discussion on how to have the 'perfect' first day in the house. Of course, after reading the long-form, if you have any opinions, corrections, suggestions, or any thoughts for that matter, I'd love to hear them either via PM or as a reply, as I'm always excited to hear new information on the process, or any sort of strategic insights that might provide some insights on Big Brother strategy. 

I hope you enjoy!


###**A Narrative of the Casting Process**

&gt; You’ve planned, filmed, and submitted your audition video on the CBS casting website, and for some strange reason a casting intern (who was paid to skim through hundreds of casting submissions) actually liked you!
You had an intense call-back via Skype or phone line service with some underling production person(s), and you didn’t make a complete idiot of yourself – that, or you *did* but they still liked you any ways! 

&gt; Wow, these past few weeks have been a whirlwind – you’ve flown in to sit through countless face-to-face interviews ranging in size and importance, sometimes just with a single producer, and sometimes with fifteen suit-wearing executives whom you assumed own half of California. Why the hell are you still here? America is huge, surely there’s better people to cast than yourself?

&gt; Holy !@#$, &lt;insert producer whom you now know on a first name basis&gt; just called and said you’ve made it! OMG. You can’t tell anyone that this is actually happening, but you still have to make vague arrangements with your school/work/life-partner/dentist to allow for a summer off – good luck with that. 

&gt; Alright, today was your last day of freedom. Production flew out to your hometown and told you to do a scripted packing scenario in your bedroom, then explained you after filming the scene to actually pack up as much clothing as possible (i.e. not just the little bit of clothing that is shown in your suitcase when you did your fake packing). They then drove you out to a location shot that recalls one of your personality/lifestyle gimmicks, whether that be your profession (hospital, police station, garbage truck driver), your hobby (horseback riding, rock climbing, chess player), your lifestyle (church, bar, family get together), or your schooling (chemistry lab, server room, auditorium), and asked you once again to say some scripted stuff. Wow those lines they wrote for you to say were cheesy.

&gt; At the end of a long day (or potentially the next morning), you were shuttled on to a flight alongside your personal wrangler and were flown all the way to the show’s designated sequester hotel. At that hotel, you were kept in a room essentially 24/7 for the next week and a half, with the only interruptions being the occasional meeting with a producer, psychological examinations, questionnaire fill-outs, one hour of gym access per day, press interviews, and a scheduled wrangler discussion time to keep you from complete isolation. When these special events weren’t happening, all you could do was repeatedly have showers at varying temperatures and watch DVDs of season 2, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 16 on the room’s TV, as those were the only seasons they made available. 

&gt; Wow, it’s the day. A producer came in to explain the day’s process, and you’ve said your goodbyes to your wrangler. They’ve given you your premiere wardrobe, and while it’s not exactly what you’d normally wear, you can get used to it. You’ve been placed all alone in a small white dressing room that has a mirror, table, and chair, with the only interruption for the next two hours being a snack drop off and the occasional washroom break. 

&gt; Alright, a wrangler has given you a blind fold, and you have been led to what you guess is side-stage. You bet that all the other blindfolded HGs are all sitting beside you. You are told to get up and are led to a standing location. A voice instructs that when your blindfolds are removed, you are not to walk together to the marked location in center-stage, stand evenly spaced with the tall people in the back and shorter people in the front, to wait for Julie to instruct your next steps, and to not speak until you’ve entered the interior of the house stage. Your blindfold is taken off, and you stand there in line with 6-15 other people (whom could only be the other HGs). After the last HG’s blindfold is removed and a producer gives the final word, someone instructs the group to walk into the stage area, and stop as a group at the marked location. 

&gt; Over the sound system Julie tells the group the usual Big Brother premiere speech, and then begins to call out the HGs names to enter the house.

###**Rules To Having the Perfect First Day in the Big Brother House**

##*Timespan: From entering the house to heading to the bedroom area:*

1.	***Scenario 1: You are called into the house in the first group.*** Try to be the second or third person through the doors, or if there’s no other option, last. Because of the “ladies first” tradition, if you are a woman, try and be 2nd in, and if you are a guy, try to be the first guy, and thus 3rd in (Girl, girl, guy, guy). Being the first person in is cool and all, but there’s a huge expectation for the first person to do a crazy scream jump, and to turn around and hug the second person. The second person in is usually the receiver of the first person’s hug, and is often the person (alongside the third person in) who leads the charge to the bedrooms. The fourth person is usually the person who follows wherever the first HGs go, or often is the person who comes in to replace the second person as the receiver of the overexcited first person. The reason why this ordering matters is because true game/strategist players will look to gather any means of judging opposing HGs aptitudes for the game and see how much people know about the game/show, and the best way to do this is by observing HGs first impressions in the house. If someone comes in and instantly runs in the direction of the beds (without any instruction from another HG), you know that they have watched enough of the show to memorize exactly what the house layout is. Most recruits and ‘show only’ fans surprisingly don’t know the house layout, and thus if the person runs towards the kitchen/washroom, you know they are either not a gameplay, or they are trying to meta-game you (use future knowledge to determine which is the case). Speaking of meta-gaming, this is why it’s best to come in 2nd or 3rd – if you are in that position, you are able to initially ‘lead the charge’ to the bedrooms, and thus if you are confident enough you can ‘fake’ not knowing where the rooms are by heading the wrong way and throw any strategics off your trail. Once you appropriately correct your ‘charge’ (either from another HG saying “I think it’s this other way”, or you pretending you saw that there were no beds that way), head to the bedrooms.

2.	***Scenario 2: You are called into the house in a later group, or a part of a full on ‘second HG phase’, a. l. a. BB16 and now BB17*** Enter the house at any position, making sure that when you enter the house you do not run past everyone in an attempt to get a good bed. Stop and hug the people already in the house (whom are probably waiting in the hallway), and make them aware that you care about them more than a bed, both to put your face forward as a ‘good person’, but also to suggest that you aren’t aware of the lack of quality bed situations, and thus that you might not be a super-fan (even though you are). The already-in HG who yells out unprovoked “Go get your beds, there’s not a lot left!” is probably not a strategist, but is someone who will be able to get a handle on the game soon, and thus a potential game threat. This insight is brought to light because a strategist would avoid associating themselves as a stressful voice in other HGs first experiences in the house, but that HG can be assessed as a potential ‘learn on the fly’ game threat because they were able to quickly understand the mechanic of ‘lack of beds = bad’. After a quick hug-fest in the halls, head to the bedrooms.

##*Timespan: From entering the bedroom area to all HGs have picked a bed.*

1.	***Scenario 1: You were in the first group*** Do not get a bed in the hallway bed space. It’s the worst location for sleep quality (sound proofing, light pollution, hallway activity), and it provides no privacy for potential gameplay talk. Ideally grab a bed in the doored square room, which was the ‘Fire room’ in BB16 for those who watched – for the same reasons stated prior. After grabbing one of those beds, head to the hallway to properly greeting the HGs whom entered with you, give some first greetings, then prepare for the second batch of HGs. Try and amp up the “First X”-ness of the situation, where X is the number of HGs who entered with you, as any additional alliance-like unity will help you in the early game. Don’t be the one to say “Let’s make a first X alliance.” If it happens, following along with it, and never say no to an alliance offer. Don’t be the one who yells out “Get your beds quick!” when the next group comes in.

2.	***Scenario 2: You were in a later group, either directly after the first group, or a part of a full on ‘second HG phase’, a. l. a. BB16 and now BB17*** Try and get a bed in the doored square room, but anything is fine. If you are not in the first group of HGs, then the bed selection is less about comfort and more about strategic blocking/placement. If there’s a room with a bed open that seems to be owned by all the ‘opposite’ gender from yourself, grab it quick. You want to avoid allowing a gender to own a room, which will eventually result in an early gender alliance. If you are a guy, then you’ll already be able to get in with the other guys, regardless of where you sleep, but if you can room with girls, then they’ll be forced to interact with you in a more personal setting, and thus will give you an ‘in’ for friendship/alliances. The inverse is true if you are a woman – avoid being an all-girl room, as you’ll be able to socialize with them anyways, but you’ll be able to get into an alliance with guys sooner when you room with them. If you are of a unique situation (i.e. you are LGBT, etc.) you’ll have to make a judgement call on first impressions and your personal comfort level. Quickly throw your stuff on the bed and instantly go back to the group and begin socializing, it is important to make yourself a part of the ‘whole’ as soon as possible to avoid the first group from feeling ‘separate’ from the rest of the house, and thus avoid any sort of BBCAN2 F5 alliances.

##*Timespan: Socializing and introductions.*

When the house is in that ‘pre-introduction’ cheering stage, be positive, smile, and introduce yourself to everyone. Make an attempt to move through every single person, and while you want to make everyone be aware of you, don’t be “too” out there, as you want to avoid singling yourself from the group (Watch the BB15 premiere to see some examples of how *not* to act at this stage of the day, especially Gina Marie). Probably telling people your name, getting their name, and saying some off the cuff comment about how exciting this all is should be enough. Do your best to memorize people’s names, but don’t be the person who instantly knows and says everyone’s names as much as possible, almost to an annoying point.

Don’t go out of your way to be the person to start the sit-down introductions, but definitely encourage the transition once the idea starts bubbling through the room. When someone else says to gather in the seating area for introduction, be quick to acknowledge the idea and get a seat. At this point everyone is itching to express themselves, and nobody likes the person who takes too long to sit down. Accept the offer of a drink, even if you don’t particularly like to drink alcohol, because you once again don’t want to single yourself out. It’s a good point to note that you should also be responsible on the first night, and not to over-drink, as you want to be in control of yourself as the night progresses. There’s no real rhyme or reason to what order you should give your introduction, however don’t fight to be first or last, but if you end up being first or last, play the role appropriately. This means that if you are first, make sure to act up the “Well forgive me if I say something wrong, because I’m first!” goofiness, and if you are last, make sure to end your introduction on a high note. Be honest in your introduction, and avoid lying about your life if at all possible. I guess there could be some reasons why it would be okay to lie about certain things, but you sure as hell need to make sure that you can sell that story for a whole season, otherwise it will eventually bite you in the ass. It is always better to drop a bomb early and suffer a little bit of consequences than to hold off with a lie, as the damage will always be far worse in the end. When listening to other introductions, don’t be the person who gives their two cents after every single person says a word (a.l.a. BB2’s Nicole, Gina Marie, etc.) because that is completely grating for everyone. That being said, it is okay to be an encouraging and supporting voice for others, as long as you remain passive and neutral. It is always good to follow up after the introductions and ask HGs to tell you more about their specific story, as it shows that you remembered their story, you are interested in them personally, and allows you an opportunity to double check their story to see if there might be holes, and thus see if anyone is lying. Continue to develop connections with as many people as possible over the next 20-30 minutes as the group waits for Julie to provide further instructions.

##*Timespan: Julie appears and introduces the season twists and HoH challenge.*

Get to the seats as soon as possible, but relax if other HGs take longer to get there – there’s no need to get angry/annoyed if someone isn’t respecting Julie’s time. Participate in the ‘Ooo-ing’ and ‘Aww-ing’ of the Julie experience, but don’t be the person to try and guess what she’s about to say when she’s talking – it’s annoying to listen to for both the audience as well as the other HGs, and it reveals to the other HGs that you know the game enough to be confident about your answer. It’s okay to act surprised when Julie reveals the twist, but don’t try to make a huge fuss about it and make yourself stand out. After this, Julie will tell the group to prepare for the HoH challenge. Sometimes, like in the case of BB17, Julie will tell the group that X number of people will need to sit out of the challenge. Never be the one to sit out of a challenge. This is the easiest way to single yourself out, and even the act of offer to sit out is equivalent to BB suicide. Don’t do it. Don’t even think about it. Let someone else offer, and let them suffer the consequences.
 
##*Timespan: HoH Challenge.*

It is okay (and almost preferred) to throw the challenge, however never make a thrown challenge obvious, and always wait until 4-5 HGs have already exited the challenge. You want to be perceived as an ‘average’ competitor – not too good to be a game threat, not too bad to be a perfect pawn, but just right to be a dependable potential alliance member. The other reason why you should wait until a handful of HGs have already dropped out of the challenge is because it allows you to avoid a situation where the eventual HoH attempts to “keep the blood off their hands” by nominating the first X number of HGs who dropped out of the challenge first (a.l.a. BBCAN3 Bobby’s nominations), and allows you to still be in the game in the case of some endurance ending agreements (a.l.a. BBCAN2’s Paul deal). When you drop out of the game, make an appropriate “I’m out!” comment, and then quickly get out of the game area. Say some encouraging words to those still in the challenge, but make sure to remain neutral and supportive in your commentary. Use this time to build your relationships with those already eliminated, as for the first few weeks it will be very hard to be alone with such a small group of HGs. Once the challenge is over, make sure to congratulate all the remaining players, including the losers, for a job well done and make sure to avoid being too ‘bro-y’ if you are a guy and the winner is the guy or to ‘girl-y’ if the winner is a woman and you are a woman, as the last thing you want is to perpetuate any notion of gender-based alliances. 

##*Timespan: Post-HoH socializing time to a first night’s sleep:*

1. ***Scenario 1: Post-HoH Twist stuff, such as instant nominations*** Simply act normal, and don’t avoid eye contact with the HoH in situations where they are nominating face-to-face. Nothing can be done at this point; all the work building connections throughout the day should be able to get you through this point – and if it doesn’t, don’t overreact and be respectful as the HG that overreacts is the one that goes home the first week (chill the rest of the day, and use the following week to build trust and respect with the other HGs, and you should be fine).

2. ***Scenario 2: No twists, just socializing time until sleep*** Continue to build relationships with the other HGs by getting to know them, talking openly about yourself, and finding any way to support other HGs with their transition into the game. Act calm and prepared, however join in on the experience, and share your excitement and feelings. Make sure to balance your time to talk and your time to listen, as you probably want to be listening at least three times as much as you want to be talking. Take in as much as you possibly can, so that once the second day rolls around, you will be able to instantly continue on in any discussions from the prior night, and allow for continued connection building. Don’t be the person who was all talkative and relatable on the first day, but then ignored half the house on the second day because you didn’t like those set of people. Everyone is your best friend, whether you liked them or not. When people are in the backyard, go into the backyard. When they are brushing their teeth, brush your teeth, when they are going to bed, go to bed. Most of all – don’t talk in or near the bedrooms at night, and if you are a snorer, you might as well keep your bags packed because you are getting evicted as soon as humanly possible. 

###**This is how you have the perfect first day in the Big Brother house.**

Once again, I look forward you any responses that you might have, and I hoped you enjoyed the long form! Thanks.

3b466o,34,2015-06-25,"RE: DeMarcus Cousins Trade Proposals - A Look at Expected Value in the NBA Lottery, 2001-2010",[deleted],nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3b466o/re_demarcus_cousins_trade_proposals_a_look_at/,"In light of the recent pre-draft [trade hubbub](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings-talking-to-lakers-about-demarcus-cousins-trade--fielding-offers-from-other-teams-030157845.html) surrounding the Sacramento Kings' DeMarcus Cousins, I had the intern do some digging... 

  In this little post, we look at two things: 1) the likelihood of drafting an **all-star** in the lottery, and 2) the likelihood of drafting **superstar** in the lottery.

  This is not a statistically rigorous analysis. It also does not take into consideration numerous other factors, including, but not limited to: salary cap flexibility, a proposed increase in team salary cap, team chemistry, off-court drama, etc. 

  Below, we look at: 

  - Players drafted in high-to-mid lottery (picks 2-10) 
  - From 2001 to 2010 (10 years) 
  - How many of these players became ""all-stars"": self-explanatory; all-star at least once in career
  - How many of these players became ""superstars"" or ""franchise players"", i.e. equal or better players to Demarcus Cousins: arbitrary; we went with a combo of PER and PPG 

  [2001 - 2010: Lottery Drafted vs. All Stars](http://i.imgur.com/rJhp84M.png)

  [2001 - 2010: All Stars vs. Superstars](http://i.imgur.com/y6sm8F1.png) 

**Key Takeaways**

  - From 2001 to 2010, **~31%** (28 of 90) players drafted in the high- to mid-lottery (picks 2-10) became All-Stars  
  - Excluding Cousins, of the players that became All-Stars, only **~48%** (13 of 27), or **~1 in 2**, were identified as ""superstars"" or ""franchise players"" 
  - Excluding Cousins, 13 franchise players were drafted over a period of 10 years, i.e. ~1.3 franchise players are drafted, on average, every year, or a ~15% hit rate (~1 in 7) of drafting a franchise player. Or put another way, the **""expected value"" (EV) of a pick in this range is equal to ~0.15 superstars** or ~0.3 All-Stars or ""~X units of arbitrary production"".  
  - In the past 10 years, the only other lottery F/C picks that have panned out at Cousins' level are Amare Stoudemire and Chris Bosh. Or, in other words, **you can expect to be able to draft a superstar big man in the lottery roughly once every 5 years.** 

  -----------------------------------------------------

Which brings us to the meat-and-potatoes of the proposed Kings-Lakers trade... 

**Kings**
  
  - DeMarcus Cousins 

**Lakers**
  
  - \#2 pick
  
  - Julius Randle (#7 pick)
  
  - Jordan Clarkson 

  Ignoring Clarkson's value for now, we can look at the expected value and the likelihood of a range of scenarios in which the Kings or Lakers would profit from such a trade.

Consider: 
  
  - Combined EV of #2 pick and Randle (#7) is ~0.3 superstars, meaning trade, as-is, carries a premium of ~**3.3x**, i.e. on a purely arithmetic basis, the trade assumes #2 pick and Randle are 3.3x more-likely-than-expected to become superstars. Whether or not this optimism is warranted is another question. However, it is important to note the limitations of this statement - it does not properly assign value to the pick or Randle if they become valuable role players or even All-Stars. 
 
With simple binomial probabilities, we can also estimate:
 
  - The likelihood of BOTH the #2 pick AND Randle becoming superstars: **~2%**
  - The likelihood that AT LEAST one of them (#2 and/or Randle) will pan out as a superstar: **~25-30%**  

Take this for what you will. If anything, it simply emphasizes the difficulty of acquiring a superstar in the draft."
3b49gg,2,2015-06-25,Take a job of convenience or hold out for greener pastures?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3b49gg/take_a_job_of_convenience_or_hold_out_for_greener/,"Hi everyone, 
I am one year out of my undergraduate studies and 3 semesters into my Masters of Library and Information Science program, where I am specializing in archives management. I am completing my program online. I have archives, museum, and library experience, but they are all entry level or internship type experiences. I have a total of about 2 years professional experience in my field from these jobs. 

I recently moved for my fiance's career advancement, leaving a job that was great experience but paid very little (21,000.) I have had two in person interviews at libraries, and have another 2 interviews pending in the next two weeks. I just applied for a job as a Museum Educator that is perfect for me, and I have already heard back from the institution they will begin interviewing in a few weeks. It is a small museum, and a position that was not well-advertised, so I think I have a decent chance. 

I am asking for advice because yesterday I had a phone interview for a job that isn't technically in my field, but could lead to advancement. I was given the impression that the manager wanted to hire me on the spot, but needed to go through the standard process. It is a temporary clerical position in the registrar’s office of a university, but the work is all remote and I already go to school online. It pays much more than I’ve ever made (30,000) but I have my doubts about coping with so much computer screen time and so little human interaction. It also isn’t in my field, but the manager said it was typical for temps to be hired in other departments when their terms were up. It could be a way to get into the library department, but nothing is certain. 


I have been burned in the job search before because my expectations often surpass reality. I don’t think I’m crazy for thinking this temporary clerical position is within my grasp, but I don’t want to accept a job offer if there’s potential to work in my field immediately, instead of potentially, maybe, a year from now. My fiancé is temporarily supporting me, and feels no qualms about me finding the “right” position, but I feel a lot of pride in being financially independent and want to avoid not working for much longer. I’m a relatively marketable candidate because I am competent, educated, and willing to accept not a whole lot of money, because I’m entry level. What would you do in my situation?

TL;DR: Should I wait for the right opportunity, or take an opportunity that isn’t perfect but could make good connections?

3b4bx8,3,2015-06-25,I really hate being disabled.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3b4bx8/i_really_hate_being_disabled/,"Yes, I understand it is probably necessary to talk to a therapist, but I guess I wanted some advice.

I lost my hearing completely at the age of 15 during high school and was implanted with a cochlear implant. I was bullied a lot when I first lost my hearing, but then people just started to ignore me and not include me in anything. This led me to not eating food and losing a lot of weight (5'11'' at 100 pounds). I was feeling ugly and incredibly insecure about myself.

Fast forward to first year of college, due to not eating, it somehow led me to getting Crohn's disease. As a result, I was not able to focus on my classes, due to constantly having to poop every 5 minutes. It sucked bad, couldn't do things that people in college do, and went home every weekend, because I couldn't handle the stress.

Junior year of college, a friend introduced me to weightlifting, and this helped me pack on some more muscle (after I started taking medication which put my Crohn's in place). I was feeling more confident in myself, and girls even said I was cute! I was feeling good about myself, and despite everything that happened previously, I felt I could finally stand up in this world.

Last summer, the summer before graduate school, I then developed a vicious stye in my left upper eyelid, which to this day, has not completely gone. Even after numerous trips to the doctor and 3 surgeries on my eye to reduce the swelling/pus, it never went away and has disfigured my eyelid, to the point where it is now droopy and uneven with my other eye. I have become incredibly self conscious about this, and coupled with the stress of graduate school and TA duties, I was and still am having a hard time coping. My doctor even said to not be vain and that girl's don't care about ""silly stuff"", and my parents tell me to stop complaining as well...

I know the stye doesn't really count as a disability, but all of this packaged together is making me upset. It is summer now, and when I am not in my internship, I just sleep the day away. I don't even go to the gym anymore, even tho I used to be incredibly diligent about lifting weights and making progress -- mostly because I don't see the point anymore.

I know people have it worse out there than me, and my parents constantly tell me this, but I'm having a really hard time handling all this...

Thanks for listening."

Mahoney was a former White House intern during the Clinton administration who at the time of her death was working as a manager at a Starbucks in a low crime area of D.C., a Starbucks supposedly frequented by George Stephanopoulos, Chelsea Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Mahoney, a lesbian and gay rights activist and founder of the group Baltimore Lesbian Avengers, had been by some reports something of a mother figure/confidant to other interns who might have complained to her about sexual harassment by the President (unconfirmed). In July 1997—a time when we know the scandal was in the air as Matt Drudge had leaked Michael Isikoff's report on Clinton’s sexcapades and Lewinsky was then already gossiping about her affair to Linda Tripp—Mary Caitrin Mahoney and 2 other co-workers were gunned down in the Starbucks after hours. While the other employees were shot once, Mahoney was shot numerous times, leading some to see her as a target of assassination. No shots were heard in the neighborhood, causing speculation that silencers might have been used.  Eventually, based on an anonymous tip to America’s Most Wanted, police focused on [Carl Derek Havord Cooper](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/march99/cooper18.htm), whom they eventually prosecuted and convicted. According to police, this was a robbery, but nothing was taken. Their scenario and Cooper’s confession explain this by stating that the robbery attempt was botched (Mahoney resisted, thus her numerous gunshot wounds) and Cooper fled after firing his weapon for fear that the shots had been heard. Believable enough, until you consider reports that the store was locked from the outside, meaning the murderer(s) must have taken the time to lock up behind them. Also sketchy is the fact that [police elicited Cooper’s confession after a 54-hour interrogation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/03/05/lawyers-assail-lengthy-interrogation/2b5b1e77-6a5f-409d-b0be-f9b50ffc5328/), and he afterward recanted.  

So what do you think… is Cooper guilty? Is it reasonable to connect this death to the Clintons? Are there any other deaths linked to the Clintons that you are unwilling to explain away as coincidental? Or do you think all presidential body count lists are examples of confirmation bias run amok? …Also, do you like Hillary for 2016? :)"

So My question is when would it be appropriate to ask if there is or will be a full time offer?

My manager has spoken very positively of me, impressed by how quickly I've been moving the project that has been assigned to me and how quickly I've integrated into system (had to learn a new language and SQL) and said this when introducing me to another manager ""This is /u/eastcoastblaze, he is a brilliant kid and has a job here when he's done if he wants it, but he probably wants to go work at microsoft or ibm doing more complicated stuff"""

I just finished my freshman year. I'm interning at a rather small company. It's pretty boring. There's only 2 full time software engineers and they often leave for several days and otherwise are very busy because there's a lot of things to do for just two engineers. I'm one of four interns. It's excruciating because I often need guidance even to get things going and the full-timers can't provide it because they're busy. Often I end up with quite literally nothing to do for hours on end. On top of that the work is often just busy-work and grunt-work and intellectually uninteresting. This internship has essentially made me despise programming and software engineering for the time being. I'm not even sure if I want to major in computer science anymore. I'm more unhappy now than I have ever been in my entire life. I really hate going to bed every night because it means I have to wake up and go to work. I'm making a reasonable amount of money, and money is meaningful to me, but not essential. I could leave now and be financially ok.. as long as they don't take away the money I've already made (it's in my bank account: could they ask for it back?), because then I would have lost a lot of money for housing. I'm paid weekly so it wouldn't be that immoral... or would it? What should I do? I feel like I'm wasting a few of the best months of my life for absolutely no benefit...

3b4x9x,0,2015-06-25,An anthropological reason why WWE isn't as good as it use to be,[deleted],WWE,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/3b4x9x/an_anthropological_reason_why_wwe_isnt_as_good_as/,"[Skip to site] (http://everythinggeekdom.blogspot.com/2015/06/wwe-is-not-in-21st-century-and-here-is.html)

We all have said it to ourselves, “Vince McMahon is out of touch” or “They need to bring back the Attitude Era”. It is obvious that wrestling or rasslin is not as good as it once was. As a child of the 90’s, one of my fondest memories was watching Monday Night Raw late at night watching Stone Cold defend his title against the Undertaker or watching The Rock trash talking The Corporation, or even witnessing Crash Holly hilariously defend his Hardcore Championship during the infamous 24/7 rule.  What can I say? Good times. It was awesome to be a 90’s kid. Now with that said, what is wrestling like today? Let me start off by saying that over the past year, I found myself getting back into wrestling. Now I don’t watch Raw or Smackdown but I do keep in touch on the roster and familiarize myself with what is going on in the story line. Although it is better than it was say 5 or 6 years ago, I still cannot honestly say wrestling is watchable. Not watchable in the sense that I want to change the channel the second it comes on, but in the sense that I cannot get invested in something that will not turn out the way I want it to. As a fan of the sport myself, it’s almost heart breaking to see what it has become. I mean for God’s sake, Kane is corporate! WHAT!? That dude used to scare the crap out of me when he spoke thorough his voice box. And not THIS?! Although Kane maybe long and gone, the talent is probably some of the best the company has ever had. Although nobody can cut a promo like The Rock or Stone Cold, they all have something to offer and have amazing in-ring ability. They each have their own personality and can create a legacy that could rival Macho Man, Flair, Hogan, Taker, Hart and so on. So what is going on and how did it go south?


Well to start things off, I do not necessary believe it is because it is PG. Hell, NXT is PG and it is amazing! As many problems as I have with WWE, I adore NXT. I watch every episode and pay-per-view every chance I get. To see stars like Kevin Owens get a push on the main pay-per-view and beat Cena, CLEAN, is awesome (although he lost the second time but we all saw that coming).  But the bigger question is, what does NXT have that the WWE doesn't? Well NXT is pure wrestling. Yes, the wrestlers are more colorful (physically and personality wise), but everything is to the point. The shows are only an hour long, matches are shorter, promos are MUCH shorter allowing the talent to get to the point and establish their narrative. The “divas” are treated as real wrestlers and do way more than the divas past and present. The arenas are smaller, the lighting and color scheme is more vibrant yet comforting, allowing a more intimate setting giving the audience a real polished indie atmosphere. The reason why NXT works the way it does is because it is smaller. It is developmental. Everyone is hungry and is willing to show off what they have in the ring. Everything else is secondary. You are here to watch the future establish themselves and move on up. You root for these athletes. You see the future and it looks promising, almost like seeing your friends and classmates during college graduation. Everyone is excited ready to embrace the challenges ahead. However, reality kicks in and you soon realize real life is like the WWE in 2015. A lot of promise but no real satisfaction.


Now here, in my humble, anthropological, opinion on why the WWE is not in touch with the 21st century. To understand why the WWE worked when it did we have to look through the company’s history. Back in the 80’s, when it began to grain popularity, you had wrestlers who resembled Saturday morning characters. Big Boss Man was a cop, Jake “The Snake” Roberts carried… a snake, Iron Sheik was the Iranian everyone loved to hate and Hulk Hogan was the all American boy fighting for the rights of everyman. Oh, how American. These wrestlers were a reflection of what would now be considered a simpler time, before internet, smartphones and 10 year olds navigating through electronics better than anyone over the age of 40. It was easier to buy into these characters and root for the personality you liked. In the case of Hulk Hogan, America and Russia were at each other’s throats for decades. Hulk Hogan represented the best in what America saw in itself. He was charismatic, entertaining and most of all unbeatable. We rooted for him because we rooted for America. We were damned if an American lost to a commie, in the ring or in the global political climate. When the USSR fell, and Cold War became a memory and society changed. No longer did we want to see these cut out characters have cartoony characteristics. We wanted ATTITUDE!


Ah, the Attitude era. Without a doubt, the most beloved era in wrestling (well at least for anyone under the age of 50 or so). Wrestlers cursed (“SUCK IT!”), threw tables and chairs at one another, Undertaker made human sacrifices and Triple H drugged Stephanie before her wedding to Test and took her to Vegas to have her become his wife…? Yeah, good luck doing that in today’s Rape Culture society. Point is wrestling was “trashy”. Truth is, the 90’s were “trashy”. Cable TV was pushing every boundary imaginable. Jerry Springer and his white trash, neo nazi, baby daddies were running amuck, South Park and the Simpsons were changing the rules for who can watch animation and the president of the United States telling everyone that he did not sleep with his intern. Our conservative Regan era had come to a close and America was number one. The economy was doing great, we all had jobs and technology was beginning to advance like never before. It was time to have fun, exploit, and see how far we can push our boundaries. There was no worry insight so why be cautious?


One of my most predominate memories of the 90’s was everyone having this “Fuck work” mentality. Having a job was modern day slavery. Everyone had this Utopian idea that we need to move beyond that and redefine happiness in our  post-Cold War capitalistic society. Now, as a 9 year old, I couldn't really comprehend any of that. I just assumed most people got a job they hated because they wanted to buy nice things. One superstar that rose above and connected with the audience was Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stone Cold was at his core a beer drink, loud mouth, crazy redneck son of a bitch who did not give a fuck about what his boss or anyone thought of him. Stone Cold was the physical embodiment of what people liked/ wanted to be in the 90’s. He was trashy and said what he wanted to say and was hated by his boss, not for being a bad employee, but for not wanting to give into his stupid demands. If Vince told Austin to do something, he would get the finger, get “stunned” and have beer poured all over him. Something all adults working their dead end jobs wanted to do at some point. Sure you had people like The Rock and Mankind make their way on up and get praise, but Stone Cold was different. While The Rock was entertaining to listen to, Stone Cold was an icon. Not only was he great in the ring, but we all wanted to be him in one way or another. To be a superstar, you gotta be the complete package. You need to be great on the mic, great in the ring and have a character that you can sell and a character people can cheer or boo for at a moment’s notice. You have to own that persona. You have to be that persona.


By 2003 Stone Cold’s time in the top came to an end. The Rock became bigger and bigger and was so charismatic, he reached the point where he was able to become the only wrestler with a real acting career. With Stone Cold and The Rock gone, who do we have? “You can’t see me”! Yeah, I know… John Cena is an interesting case. When he first popped onto the scene, I though “Who is this white boy trying to rap?” By this point I stopped watching wrestling all together. I actually stopped before ""The Invasion"" story line. I would watch some videos and promos here and there just to see who was going on. I noticed Cena and thought, “Well, rap is big right now, so I guess this makes sense?” Okay, I can see this character being in the roster but this is usually for someone who is a throw away mid-card who will eventually get a new persona. To my and I’m sure the many fans dismay, this Marky Mark wannabe would grow in popularity and be pushed like no one before him. Over time the character changed from Marky Mark to Nickelodeon. His fans grew younger and younger and soccer moms finally found someone acceptable for their kids to look up to. Sure he was upbeat and had a good message for the young ones, but he had no edge. Cena, for those who can remember, had his moments where he was threatening. He actually had some good heel moments (watch the championship match with him and Rob Van Dam). However, the company had by this point become PG. Vince’s wife was running for office and WWE would start focusing on merchandise. Cena was popular among the kids and needed to remain popular to hold onto their new business strategy, toys. Believe it or not, toy sales is what makes the company real money. Look at Marvel and Disney. Yes their movies make billions, but the toys buy them the platinum toilet seat with baby skin Dalmatian toilet paper. Just look it up.


2008 was a troubling time. The economy went south, America was in 2 wars that didn't seem to end anytime soon and everyone was just uncertain. We all wanted a job and wanted to work like never before. Nobody knew for sure if this was temporary or if it was the new norm for the country. Meanwhile, the WWE was going through an identity crisis of its own trying to appeal to a broad audience of fans and non-fans alike while being safe for the whole family to watch. Diehard fans saw through this and switched over to TNA or just gave up all together. Sure, the WWE dominated, hell they are wrestling at this point. Nobody can give them a run for their money. Yet people just didn't like or trust the product. A sport geared towards men, watched by boys with or without their parents’ permission, now had guest hosts like Pee Wee Herman and Grumpy Cat. Now I love Pee Wee, but come on! You come to the realization that the face, the number one guy is… a mid-card wrestler making Subway commercials and dressing like a 10 year old boy in a K Swiss commercial.


In 2015, things look ahead but we are far away from where we want to be. The dollar is growing strong, interest rates are down and there are foreseeable plans to end to wars. Now if you really believe this or not, it’s up to you. By now millennials are dictating what is cool and what is popular. What are millennials doing now a days? Well we binge watch TV shows on Netflix and go to every Marvel superhero movie that gets released. Why is this? Well we millennials had a great childhood. We grew up in a time when we thought he US was indestructible. Our understanding of tough economic conditions were testimonies we read in history class. We were promised so much and witnessed it all crashing down from 9/11 to the financial and housing crash in 08. We are a generation that loves nostalgia and escapism. We look to the past in hopes our future will resemble that. Now what does this have to do with the WWE? Well, let’s look at it like this; who are the three biggest superstars everyone wants to be pushed? The triple D’s. Dean Ambrose, Dolph Zigglar and Daniel Bryan.


Anyone who has seen the past two pay-per-views would know that JBL, now a promising commentator, is comparing Ambrose to Austin. He is a lunatic that seems to be against The Authority. Bryan is the ultimate underdog story and is the closest wrestler to resemble a cartoon or comic book hero. Zigglar is a throwback to the 80’s. Let’s break these down. Many in the US don’t care for authority. Now this is nothing new, but this is something that has been more apparent now and is growing among all groups of people. Conservatives hate big government more than ever, Liberals are protesting Wall Street and minorities and youth are calling out the police for their overaggressive use of force. Ambrose is hated by the Authority. Ambrose hates the Authority. They have broken up the foundation he stood for and are now out to get him.


Daniel Bryan on the other hand is the classic underdog story who is technically gifted in the ring. He is seen as a push over due to his size yet overcomes adversity. He is the Steve Rogers of the WWE Universe. However, unlike Steve, Bryan has had no outside assistance, He did it all himself. He is the bridge between the fictional heroes we see on the big screen to the real life heroes you read about in the paper. And of course a hell of an in-ring wrestler.


Finally there is Zigglar. Well, like I said, Zigglar is a throwback. He is a devilishly handsome ladies man, with slicked back bleach bond hair, wearing a sleeveless denim jacket, a neon pink shirt and happens to be an awesome wrestler to boot. Anyone who notices fashion trends will notice a comeback in these styles. Fashion is notorious for having trends go in and out of style. Music is sampling more 80’s beats, movies like Drive are embracing the color and noir feel to it, with denim and larger frame sunglasses coming back into style. Is much of this due to people remember what they though was cool when they were a kid and trying to bring it back when they are older? Yeah, most likely, especially in the case of Zigglar. As stated before, millennial s love nostalgia.


Now with all three guys having so much promise, is there a chance that one can get pushed and be THE FACE of the company? Sure. As a betting man, I would go with Dean Ambrose. He is younger, has more time to develop and has yet to have his best days arrive (sorry Bryan). Now is there a way to combine all 3 into one? Well, I think so. Which one is it? Well, how about… Finn Balor. Yeah the guy from NXT with the entrance we all love. Let’s think about it. Like Zigglar he is good looking and definitely has the charismatic persona (at least in the entrance), has the in-ring athleticism like Bryan and mad man persona like Ambrose. If built him correctly (maybe as a giant killer or career ending superstar) he could be the big push the company needs. Plus with the make-up and overall physical appearance, imagine how many toys he can sell!

3b4xxs,2,2015-06-25,How to Build Wealth While You're Young,AmberModernAdvisor,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/3b4xxs/how_to_build_wealth_while_youre_young/,"I see a lot of people asking how to build wealth while they're young, so I wanted to share my thoughts on some basic principles.

First of all, the secret to building wealth depends on your ability to: 

1. Build good habits.
2. Maintain a frugal lifestyle for a number of years.
3. Make your money work for you.

The younger you are, the better chance you have of building up a large sum of money for retirement, since you have one huge advantage over the older generation: time.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some ways to implement the principles: 

&amp;nbsp;

***If you're still in school:*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Got student loans? You can still build assets!**
Don’t put 100% of your funds into paying off debt, stash some of it away – even a small portion, every single month and put it in a tax-free savings account such as a TFSA.

**Secure internships during summer**
Typically, internships pay quite well and will allow you to put away several thousand if you are able to keep your living expenses low – perhaps living with Mom and Dad isn’t so bad after all?

**Work part-time during term time**
This will allow you greater networking opportunities for when you do graduate and prepare you in advance for paying off your student loans. As a consequence you could end up increasing your earning potential and reducing your debt!

**Look for student grants**
Grants are a huge opportunity to get some free money that you don’t have to pay back. Only in school part-time? There are grants for you, too! Find out more about how you can apply on the canlearn website.  

&amp;nbsp;


***If you're employed full time, not in school:*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Maintain a frugal lifestyle**
If it saves you money, perhaps consider sharing with roommates to split the utility bills and monthly payments.

Despite popular opinion by Generation X, renting is not throwing away money if it allows you to put the money you would otherwise spent on substantial purchase and maintenance costs into well-planned investments.

**Learn to love minimalism**
Find something that you love to do. Try and take up something which produces more than it consumes – like a competing in a sport, playing an instrument or learning to code.

Find an inner-strength that allows you to create – we naturally become better at things we practice and we tend to practice things that we love. Once we are able to produce something better than someone can do for themselves, we are able make money from it.

This may very well end up being a source of income for you in the future and it provides you (and possibly others) with entertainment at the same time.

**Take advantage of RRSP contribution matching.**
Does your employer match your savings in an RRSP? If so – there aren’t many other places you’ll get free money. Max this out at your first opportunity!

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote a full blog post about the topic. You can take a look at it [here](http://blog.modernadvisor.ca/build-wealth-while-youre-young/)."
3b54ux,4,2015-06-25,Looking for possible internships on west coast,michael1026,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b54ux/looking_for_possible_internships_on_west_coast/,"I want to do an internship next summer, after completing my sophomore year doing software engineering and cyber security, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be applying for internships. I know one that I want to apply for is NASA JPL. I'd absolutely love to work there, even if it's only for a few months. I know I probably won't actually get it, but I want to at least apply. I'm wondering what other internships are worth applying to. Oregon is preferred, but not needed."

I just finished up my third year of a Computer Science degree. I've never had an internship before, and I am nervous. I do not have much coding experience besides class projects, and I'm unfamiliar with the field the internship is in (DevOps). 

My boss, as far as I can tell, is incredibly understanding and impressed with me so far. I am nervous that he'll see I'm not the best coder, possibly slower to learn/catch on than he anticipated, and overall not meeting expectations.

I want to be a great intern, and hopefully get a job offer after I graduate next year. I've started to learn the basics of the language I'll be using this summer as well as review some of the tools that have been mentioned to me, but I feel a little overwhelmed.

Any tips of how to be a great intern, exceed my bosses expectations, and be programming daily at a job for the first time would be greatly appreciated."
3b5d8g,1,2015-06-25,Should I go back to school?,ProtoJazz,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/3b5d8g/should_i_go_back_to_school/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'm feeling kind of lost today and not sure what to do. 

I was in university for about 2 years working on a bachlor of applied computer science. Over one summer I got an internship at a company I really liked, and at the end they offered me a full time job. (It was a small mobile games company) I worked there for 2 years, and then unfortunately had to be laid off due to a big downsize at the company. 

Since then I've been doing freelance work,  at much better pay, and overall I'm pretty happy at the moment. 

One of the freelance gigs I picked up was teaching a class on game development through a local university continuing education program. One important distinction I was not the person who created the course, or was listed as an instructor by the school. I was contracted by the instructor, paid by him, and was also the instructor listed on the end of class reviews. I did however come up with the content of each class, and Mark it all, with approval of the instructor, and did all instruction on my own. 

Since these classes were wrapping up for the summer, I inquired with the school about doing my own classes through the same continuing education program. And they have said they wouldn't allow it since I did not have a degree. Apparently 3 months of teaching a course in the same field, and excellent student reviews don't count. They told me I should go back to school, and contact them when I graduate. 

I'm currently making about $20/$30 (Canadian) an hour doing part time and freelance work, wich still leaves some time for my personal projects, and I like that. 

I've had a few prospective employers tell me I should go back to school, most just based on the fact I have no degree. Should I listen to them? One of the reasons I chose not to go back is I was having difficulty passing 1 of the 2 math requirement. 

Would I be making more money? Would it be worth the time and money to go back? Or should I just seek out other employment, or other schools to teach through? 

Edit : replace companies I applied to, with interviewed with. I have no idea what the people that never contacted my thought. "

Primary usage will be gaming, probably with video settings turned up high, as I'm quite tired of setting everything to rock bottom just to make games run.  I've done what I think is a decent amount of research, and I am a CS major, so I'm not totally clueless when it comes to computers.

3b5mcb,31,2015-06-26,Am I [23 M] a selfish a**hole for leaving my girlfriend [25 F] of three years for a two months vacation?,beachversusgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3b5mcb/am_i_23_m_a_selfish_ahole_for_leaving_my/,"First post, so please forgive any mistakes. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. 


I currently work part-time making just enough to pay the bills. I have a well-paying long-term job lined up that is set to begin in the fall. At that point I will make the transition from working part-time with flexibility to working a full-time corporate job.


My girlfriend works full-time and we have been living together since last fall.


I am blessed in that my family vacations at the beach, 6 hours from my hometown, for the whole summer. We've been going since I was a kid. 


The last three years I haven't gone as a result of school internships and being with my current gf. The first year I had a summer internship, the second year she didn't want me to leave, and the third year I stayed in my hometown partially thinking I would get a full-time job sooner than I did and partially to be with her.


This year, with my job not starting until the fall, I have decided to go to the beach with my family for the summer. I would work part-time down there and continue to pay my half of the rent/bills at home.


My reasoning is that it's the last time in the foreseeable future that I will be able to do this and I need to take advantage of this opportunity before grinding away for years in an office. It's something I really feel I need to do, and think I will heavily regret if I don't go. Even more, I worry that not going will cause me to resent my girlfriend for keeping me from something I truly love (the beach/ocean).


My girlfriend does not think it's acceptable for someone to leave their SO for that long of a time, 8 weeks. She says that if it were an internship, or something related to a job it would be different, or if we were in school, or more recently out of school. She was hurt that I didn't bring it up for her input until I had decided it was something I felt like I needed to do. She says that she has never lived alone, and has never wanted to, and that she didn't sign up for this, and that I have obligations to her both by living with her and by our relationship.


Normally, I would have brought up any major decision like this and discussed it with her, but a previous summer I had done that before I decided on going to the beach, and she told me I should have waited until I had decided because going back and forth strung her emotions/hopes along. She argues that the rules changed when we signed a lease together.


Is it wrong to want to spend my last free summer vacationing with my family, leaving my girlfriend at home (only because she can't get the time off)?


Is she right that this is not something normal people do, or should do while in a relationship?


It doesn't help that everyone she has talked to, her friends, coworkers, all side with her. Everyone I've talked to about it has said I should go.

   

**tl;dr**: Last free summer before job starts, want to spend the time vacationing at the beach with family, girlfriend is not happy

**EDIT: - I didn't tell her earlier because it was a relatively last minute decision. My job start date was changed from early summer to the fall, which is when I began thinking about it. 

- At her workplace, her yearly vacation is determined in the very beginning of the year for some reason. I expected to be working full-time during the summer and didn't expect to have time off so soon, so I told her to schedule her vacation without me.

- I will certainly try to visit her during the summer, and may even cut my vacation short if I feel it's the right thing for me. However, the logistics of me working at the beach and being able to make enough money make things difficult.

- I don't think she's being unreasonable for wanting me to stay, nor do I blame her. It doesn't help that I absolutely screwed up talking to her about it first. I care very much about her feelings. I would not be leaving if I did not feel like this was important for me to do. "
3b5pra,23,2015-06-26,On the lighter side of the latest tainted meat crisis - this time last year....,Smirth,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3b5pra/on_the_lighter_side_of_the_latest_tainted_meat/,"So this year we have 40 year old frozen meat being served up in hotpot and chuanr, probably that cheap one you go to all the time.

Some of you are new here so many not remember that 12 months ago we had a similar crisis at KFC and McDonalds.  And those of you who are not new will almost certainly have drunk away all the horrible horrible memories - like that month [trigger warning] when McDonalds could only serve you a hot apple pie and orange juice.

[ Not to mention in 2013 when 16,000 dead diseased pigs floated down the Huangpu river through Shanghai ]

To jog your memory and put 40 years of frozen meat into perspective, I got permission from this articles author, Roger Whiteface, to re-print his in-depth report from last year.

**KFC nuggets expire while customers are ordering**

In yet another food scandal rocking China, KFC (Haochiirrrr Foods) has released startling news that even more customers may have been exposed to expired food, due to the incredibly long time it takes Chinese consumers to order at the counter.

Manager Mai JiRou had this to say when interviewed by our unpaid intern who doesn't speak Chinese ""Foreign country customer order mashang. Customer is 2 minute order, 1 minute maidan, 1 minute give food, rest of day is regretting! Haha kaiwanxiao only hah. I give you joking. We also say laowai may have big order but quick to finish! Hahahaha. It is the joking.""

""But China culture very different. Customer is thirty minute queuing, using phone, talking loudly, maybe change lanes and push a few times. We make menu very big. But customer cannot read menu from queue.""

""So we print menu very big too, put in plastic, front of counter. We make taocan. You know taocan. Like phone plan. Taocan. Like buy shouji get screen protector, extra stuff all included. Taocan. Get shower, massage, fly aeroplane. Taocan. So we make taocan very big, just say yi er san si shenmede.""

""In Foreign customer just order taocan, pay, go. But China customer needs more question --- Give me nugget big one. This one got rice? Why not so much liangcai? No liangcai feel bushufu. Not so much tang. No zhou is not tang. Tang is tang. Can get jidan. Which one got jidan. Feel not so like jidan, huan yige. Why is different price? Give me this one. No change it I like that one. My wife wants this one. No she wants the other one. Bring two. Wait no bring one but I want the jidan now. Nugget already ready? Don't want big one, give small one. I don't care put old one back, you really need me tell you how to do your job?""

Mai JiRou paused for breath and continued ""So that is China customer ordering, first minute. You should hear when the find out no watermelon juice!"".

According to KFC Operations Manager Rou GuoQi, this is an industry wide concern, although KFC may suffer more than others ""Average time to use ATM in China is 34 minutes. Average time to order in Starbucks is 17 minutes, however, 28 in summer because the bingkafei is very confusing whether healthy or not, very delishurs but bing de."".

But average time to order in KFC is 44 minutes, which leads to health problems. Freshly prepared food can go stale and develop high bacteria loads during the waiting time sitting under a warmer. If the food is packed early the customer may change their mind and workers need to put it back, possibly doubling the time it waits.

Worse still, if a customer discovers they forgot to get money out of the ATM, and decides to pick up a frappacino on their way back from the ATM, the additional waiting time can mean rats have already eaten the food while it is waiting on the counter - leading to an additional queuing and re-order cycle, plus need to issue a refund, which may need the managers key, which may be with the manager who is on smoke break in the toilets, incurring additional waiting time depending on how many cigarettes the manager has.

""One time we had customer forget ATM card at home, also ask for fapiao and he was here for 2 days."" shared Mi XiangFen, staff member responsible for on floor cleanup, and putting fries into smaller and smaller containers as customers eat them.

But not all employees believe the waiting time causes health problems. Mi XangFen shared ""Food stay out no problem, eat that, nobody die. But western food, too many hamburg, make you get fat. Bad for your healthy. Make the heart attack and the cancer.""
But Ms Mi admitted that proper health inspections may have been thwarted. ""Our PR manager say if health inspector comes, nobody touch the blue bags. She will take care of the blue bags. She can empty the blue bags and afterwards inspector will finish inspection go home very tired.""

So I asked for an interview with this PR manager too, in order to get the official story. That evening, KFC PR manager and ex-ChongQing car model, Bi Liuxue shared more with me over a bucket of chicken in a private interview. ""No food problem handsurm, only 44 minutes ordering time very inauspicious. China people very traditinur, believe in fate. Do you know? Are you interested Chinese culture? Is this why come from foreign? Do you like the China girl?"", while extending a thigh to me said ""Maybe you can have a try?"".

After a careful inspection of both thigh and breast, Miss Bi taught me the Chinese art of delaying placing your order, supposedly good for maximum qi flow. Following a checkup from a medical professional, I am pleased to report that there appear to be no health issues.

And that would wind up our safety meeting, and conclude my orientation at Power Systems Inc. I walked into the sales office and sat down in my cubicle. I worked a full day and went home, as I went throught the shop to clock out, I noticed a door in an unusual place. The shop was over 2 stories tall, on the 2nd level there was a door that had no platform or ladder or anything to access it, and as far as I knew it didn't lead to any place I could access it. One of the techs walked up to me, ""Hey buddy, name's Freddy. How was your first day?"" I told him it went well. He smiled. ""Glad to hear it. I love this company. I never want to leave. I hope you stay too"".

The next day I came in, and didn't see Freddy. I asked another tech if he had seen him. The tech said he didn't know who I was referring to, but admitted he was new and told me he'd let me know if he met anyone like that. 

While I was eating lunch in the break room, I saw Freddy walk in. ""Hey boss, Alex said you were looking for me."" I answered back casually, ""Yeah, you've been here a while, right. So I'm curious, what's up with that door, the one that's just kind of floating there I guess? I can't find where it connects to, so yeah, just curious.""

""Oh I wouldn't worry about that, Brian. It's probably nothing, but don't try to go in, it's dangerous."" 

Freddy left, and Alex came over, he'd been sitting at the other table. ""I didn't say shit to that guy, this is the first I've seen him. There's no Freddy working in the shop either"" 

Alex went to go tell security. I was standing at the door of the break room looking at the floating door, wondering what could be in there, and who Freddy was, and why he didn't want me to look in that room. I had to find out. I found a ladder, and moved it over to the door. ""Hey, don't do that"" - It was Freddy. ""There's nothing important up there. We don't need anything in there. It's a waste of time okay?"" Footsteps and voices drew closer, and I ran over to them.

""Did you see this Freddy guy?"" Said security. I told him I had, I then described him. I was interrupted by a man named Jake from sales. ""That sounds like Freddy James. He used to work here."" The security guard said, ""Did he have a grudge against the company?"" The salesman replied, ""Well the kid I'm referring to is actually dead unfortunately, he died 3 years ago in an arc flash."" 

I told them that the guy didn't want me to go into the room behind the floating door, and maybe he was up to something in there. We took a scissorlift up there and walked in. The room was full of Arc Flash Suits and other protective gear. But there was something else, a burning smell. We heard footsteps ahead and turned on the lights. In front of us stood a horribly mangled man, his skin was charred black and red. Clear and yellow fluid ozzed down his face and arms. His left eye was missing, his right eye was  glazed over. Patches of flesh were missing and the blackened bone was visible underneath. He wore a badly burned jumpsuit. I couldn't make out the name on it but I knew who it was. 

""Guys, we don't need these suits! They're hot, and uncomfortable and you can't see shit in them. Nothing bad is going to happen! Nothing bad is going to happen""

He began to walk towards us. We ran out and closed the door. 

The next day, we had the suits moved. The entrance was sealed to the door on the second floor. There were also rumors that a priest came in on the weekend. Everyone had heard about our encounter with Arc Flash Freddy, but no one ever saw him again, until yesterday. An intern walked into my cubicle and told me Freddy wanted to see me......"
3b5z0i,1,2015-06-26,Trouble trying to learn any language. Seeking advice,OfficerPickles,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3b5z0i/trouble_trying_to_learn_any_language_seeking/,"tldr; What can I do to focus more and not get distracted and/or stay interested? 

I've been trying to learn to code, for the better part of a decade, and I'm not having much luck. I'm easily distracted when I try to code. I took a few programming classes at a community college and a concepts class when I worked on my BS. My ASS is science - web dev and the BS is CIS with a focus on systems and network administration. I didnt have a problem with them. My work experience is primarily application and system support. I did intern for a few years as a developer primarily working on BEA aqualogic and sharepoint, which is when I found out that I'm driven more by the system/network field. 

I feel I'm limiting myself by not learning to properly code. My current job doesnt require much, just a simple script here and there. I do not want to keep going and be in the same spot that I'm in now a few years down the road.

I started trying to learn programming with books, because thats what I did in school. I start off strong but it seems each day I become less and less interested. I then tried creating projects for myself and diving in, looking up everything needed to complete the project. By the time I'd get done with it, I no longer had interest in it. The solution the project was supposed to remedy was no longer necessary or something else caught my eye and I worked on that instead. From there, I tried things like codecademy. It seemed to monotonous and I'd lose interest, sometimes within 10-15 minutes. So, I'm back to projects at the moment. 

Its like I come across a small hurdle and go off to tackle it then get side tracked by something new and shiny and lose interest in what I was doing. For example, this current project I'm working on I figured I'd get an IDE or simple text editor with highlighting. Took me two days (went with atom btw). Then I selected the OS... linux. Installed that. Then I thought, well if I'm going to do this right and make it functional, I probably need a test environment that covers everything. So now I'm sitting here with a apache on ubuntu, msyql on freebsd, a windows 2008 as a dc/dns , a freebsd fileserver, a squid box, and 1 windows / 1 nix desktop to confirm... with everything behind a freebsd firewall. So now I'm ready to dive in, but the problem is that I KNOW that I'm going about this all wrong. 

I just cant push myself to concentrate on just one thing and its like a small form of torture when I can see that the reason I'm failing is because of these faults. 

I even went out and bought a chromebook, because I thought I'd just sit there in an environment with nothing else to do but code in an online IDE. Then I came across something that I couldnt do in chrome so now I'm running Crouton and I'm back to square one. Today I was on craigslit looking for a rack server so I can move all those vms onto it esxi and manage it through that. This is the same shit that happens every time I try to learn. 

I dont know, I guess I'm just frustrated and ranting. Anyone have any suggestions? Anyone go through something similar and find a solution? What can I do to stay focused and not lose interest?

My husband and I have been together for 2 years, and we planned to start trying for a baby when I was done with residency. I start my first year of a 3 year residency next week. So needless to say, the timing is terrible! 

He's in school and feels that he'd have to drop out to work so we could save money to prepare, then he would be a stay at home dad (him being the stay at home parent was our original plan for the kid we were planning several years from now). We have absolutely nothing saved and have lots of debt that needs to be paid off, which we had a plan for to get done in a time frame we felt was reasonable. I'll be making about $50,000 a year after taxes. We can reasonably live on about $30,000 (that was our plan to get debts paid down asap). I'm worried about how this will mess with my schedule for residency. I know I wouldn't be the first pregnant chick to show up intern year, but do I really want to be that girl? Technically either way I'd have to be, since the abortion is scheduled for mid July, as that was the earliest they had. But I digress...

I have an appointment today at Planned Parenthood for the info session, since he and I had decided long ago that an abortion was the best option for us if we got pregnant this early in my career and his education. Within a half hour of the positive test I was on the phone setting up appointments. I was determined to follow through with the plan. He will support any decision I make (he wants the abortion), but I'm terribly undecided now that it's actually happened. It was so easy to say I'd definitely get an abortion when I wasn't pregnant, but this is hitting me harder than I expected. 

Any others in here who have faced a similar situation? How do/did you decide if you should derail career/education/plans to travel the world together without a care, or get the abortion and go about life mostly according to the original plan? I fear I'll regret any decision. I don't think I'll ever want to have biological kids if I go through with the abortion, but I don't want to screw us financially forever because I just had to have a kid we couldn't afford.

Thanks for reading. I always lurk and never thought I'd come out of hiding for something like this, but I'm looking forward to the support I've learned to expect from here.

UPDATE: So we went to the info session at PP, and when we left I felt at peace with getting the abortion. I know it's the right thing to do. I don't want to, but I think it's best for everyone. Unfortunately I don't know if our marriage can survive this, since we got into a huge argument over it, since he feels like I'm not caring about his feelings in all this. I keep going back and forth. He knows I'd rather keep it, but I don't feel that's responsible. Neither of us are ready to raise a child right now. He's willing to do whatever it takes to keep me sane, keep me mentally and emotionally the woman he married, which he thinks is us keeping the baby. I feel like I'll go insane either way. I'll try to respond to everyone individually later. Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it."

Unde gasesc inchirieri auto Bucuresti ieftine fara garantie?

Cand calatorim in afara tarii sau chiar in orase mai indepartate din tara noastra, de multe ori suntem in dubii daca sa inchiriem sau nu o masina. Sunt foarte multi factori care trebuiesc luati in considerare cand luam aceasta decizie. Costuri, confort, destinatie, toate aceste aspecte trebuiesc luate in considerare, iar un plan bine pus la punct si putina cercetare te vor ajuta sa iei decizia corecta. In orasele mari este destul de usor sa calatoresti cu metroul, autobuzul sau chiar cu tramvaiul. Multe orase mari au linii speciale pentru autobuze astfel incat sa treaca pe la principalele atractii turistice, iar intr-o astfel de situatie, inchirierea unui autovehicul nu este cea mai buna solutie. Insa nu in toate orasele vei dispune de linii de transport in comun catre principalele atractii turistice, iar inchirierea unei masini ramane singura solutie eficienta.

I'll be starting my final year at University in 3 months. Until then I have an offer as a Machine Learning Assistant at my University. At this point, I am unsure as to what I want my future career plans to be. I am, however, interested in being a software developer / product manager in the big 4 or preferably in the game development industry over the next years to come. Its not set in stone, but I find the prospect exciting. But I've been trying to get internships and the like with little luck. This offer is the only thing that I have for now.

As much as I'd like to work at the big 4, or in the game development industry, I know that I will have to complete a Masters in CS at the very least and I'd want to stand a good chance at being accepted at a Top 25. I have the grades for it, but that's all I have. (I'm at a top 75 right now)

All things considered, would it be a good choice to go forward with this position? I have strong skills in Python and have taken Coursera's Machine Learning course prior to it?

Would machine learning be a good field to go into? At the moment I find it interesting, but I don't know if I'd be a good fit given that I prefer creative things like games.

All in all. My concern is, should I accept this position and will it help me in my goals for the future (University, Job) or should I work on my development portfolio in the free time that I have and pick up other skills?

**49,002 subscribers for 4 years!**

So we are reaching the end of my programming themed days.. But what better way to end it than jumping into the most important part of all! JOB! CAREER! QUESTIONS!

Computer science is a very famous field of work today. People get paid a lot, there is always demand, innovation everywhere.. Truly one of the flagships of today's information age. But this leaves people with lots of questions regarding jobs, cost of study, internship questions, culture questions and many many more.

I dont think any field is easy. If you do well, you will get to eat the fruit. But to get to the fruit a solid path is needed. r/cscareerquestions helps you solve atleast some part of that path. They have a lot of questions answered and I would really suggest everyone to use the search bar! (I know reddit search sucks but hey u could still use some keywords! :D) 



I always suggest to **do your homework and read the FAQ/wiki before asking**. It helps you get better answers and lets people know that you are asking a genuine question and they will be more enthusiastic to answer it! :)



Career building is a long process which takes tons of time and work. its not easy. But its not impossible either. Gather information from forums, talk to people, build the knowledge base and move on. 

Keep calm and raise the sails!

Here is a small interview with the mods! :)






&gt;#1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** I like being part of that community, helping other people and contributing to the sub. Since I'm here often I might as well help with modding.

&gt;#2. How would you suggest people getting into computer science to go forward ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Only get in the field if you're passionate, going in for money is a pretty risky move. It's not a 9-5 career, you're strongly encouraged to learn in your free time as well to progress in your career. Easy comfy jobs exist too, but they put you at risk of becoming obsolete. Also, the first job out of school is hard to get, so make sure you have a top-notch profile at that point (do NOT avoid internships), once you're already in the field with some experience, it gets easier to find jobs.



&gt;#3. What would you say is the biggest mistake people do when researching questions ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** A lot of ""bad"" questions are due to the fact that people don't know what they don't know, which isn't always their fault. But generally, try to have a global understanding of the problem and project, if you're too close to the code (this line doesn't work), you'll be missing out on a lot of things that could help you elsewhere.

&gt;#4. Anything you would like to say to your present and future subscribers ? 

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Try not to ask questions that have been answered 100 times already, use the search. Also, don't just post a question, read the answers and leave. Participate with the community and especially in a thread you've created. Don't post a question if you'll be AFK for the next 24h.





Have an awesome week everyone!

I'm going to be taking out ~$207,000 in student loans (two Direct Plus loans and two Direct Unsubsidized loans) for the entire program.  I'm expecting to make about $20,000 in a summer internship, and graduating with a starting all-in compensation of about $200,000.  I also am planning on doing fellowship work on campus for tuition remission but am not including that in here for the sake of conservatism.

I'm planning on taking the longest possible repayment terms for the loans (25 years) so that my required monthly minimum payments are the lowest, and then making a payment to have them paid off much faster (this set up just gives me some hedge against downside risk).  At the 25 year term, my total monthly payments would be $1,569.23.

A portion of my compensation will be bonus; I'm assuming about 1/4 of it or $50,000.  I'd like to put this towards a down payment on a house.

I'm hoping to buy a house within a couple years of graduating.  I'll likely be working in NYC and so would be looking for houses in New Jersey, upstate New York or Connecticut that are on a train line.  Obviously housing prices are pretty steep for a nice house with a yard that are close to the train stations and so I'm trying to figure out how much house I can reasonably expect to afford.

If I'm two years in, I'd have $100,000 in bonuses saved towards a down payment (gross).  My loan principal would be down to $221,000 at that point (assuming I make the minimum payments).

How are student loans factored into your debt load when mortgage lenders view your debt:income ratio?  Is it simply based on monthly payments or do they also look at outstanding principal balances?  If I'm making $200,000 and have $100,000 saved up for a down payment how much house can I afford?"

I should have waited a bit longer--I bought the 980 HOF (probably a terrible decision anyways, but that white cooler/PCB would've looked pretty sweet) a week before the 980 Ti was released, but I managed to return the HOF so it worked out.

Getting the SSD bracket onto the PSU cover was a bit tricky. The metal wasn't thick enough to thread if I just drilled a plain old hole, so I had to drill smaller holes, then use a punch to make them wider and 'deeper,' and then thread them. Then I just took the SSD mounting bits from the back side of the case and threw 'em on.

I'll go into a little bit more detail about the selection process and reaction for some of the parts:

**Monitor:** I'm loving the 1440p IPS Dell monitor--25"" is the perfect size, too. Has plenty of real estate and looks incredible. I might add a second 1080p (maybe 1440p) 144hz monitor in the future, but not for a while at least. 

**Case:** I was thinking about getting the Corsair 600T case originally, but when I saw the Enthoo Luxe, I knew I had found what I wanted. Cable management was a breeze (see photos) and the build couldn't have gone more smoothly. Currently set up for positive pressure with 5 intake fans and 1 exhaust, in combination with the dust filters it should be a while before I have to clean out the insides. 

**GPU:** This thing is a monster. Overclocked to ~1450 MHz, it gets 60-100 fps on Crysis 3 on very high at 1440p, and more importantly over 600 on League of Legends. I'm installing some more games and will test the waters on Witcher 3 soon. *Note: I read that I should be able to get over 1500 Mhz on the card but can't seem to push it any higher than it is already. Any advice would be appreciated.* 

Most other part selection choices were fairly straightforward for me after deciding to go with X99 for workstation/CAD/rendering etc. 

Hope you guys enjoyed checking out my build! I learned a ton from browsing this subreddit for the last few months, and couldn't have done it without you guys. I'm hoping it'll stay strong for a long time, and I can't wait to build another PC!

*P.S. Anyone know how to make those GPU cables straight and nice and tidy?? I have cable combs but they still kind of look like crap :/*

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the positive responses and feedback! As I said above, this build wouldn't have been possible without /r/buildapc. Thanks again!"
3b7uf4,0,2015-06-26,What is the best way to look for housing in Sydney from abroad?,Yesheddit,sydney,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/3b7uf4/what_is_the_best_way_to_look_for_housing_in/,"Hey,

From September on a friend and I will be working Sydney for an internship for half a year.

There are many ways to find some suitable housing but my general conclusion so far is that it's more expensive than I thought. No problem of course, we did our fair bit planning ahead and are able to pay for it.

But I wouldn't be a cheap Dutch guy if I didn't try and look for the best ways to find cheap housing.

Does one of you have recommendations regarding looking for housing?

Some info on what we're looking for:




Key | What
---|---
Type of housing| 2 bedrooms apartment (probably not very feasible) or shared housing with 2 seperate bedrooms
Prefered location|Brookvale (My company), Manly, Seaforth, Mosman, The Rocks (Company location of friend)|
Budget|Not more than 400 AUD / week|

Should we consider options like Airbnb? What is the best way to arrange something from abroad?

Thanks in advance!

Yesh"

No angular or bootstrap however.

My dilemma is this:

I've been searching for job for like forever now. I have been doing small annoying wordpress work. But Now finally i have gotten a job  offer with company which i am very sure is going to hire me, since we had multiple interviews and programming related test. They have over 50 employees. And are not just a startup.

They told me they will train me a bit for a month or so.

Now I had already applied to Bootcamp called falrtrion school fellowship is being sponsored by nyc govt. They will teach me for 6 months. This is so amazing free coding teaching. I applied last year didnt' get accepted, i applied this year and got accepted. I studied hard for it, and did well on their interview tests too. I was excited to finally start.

However NOW I stand at crossroads where i need to make decision. Possible scenarios:

1. I start going to bootcamp, graduate and start making 65k.

2. I start a job and start making 55k and let go bootcamp.

3. i start a job and tell bootcamp that even though i was accepted i want to start from next semester. (im sure they will say no).

4. i start bootcamp gets graduated dont get hired. Back to square 2 if not 1 after six months of no money.

5. i start a job leave bootcamp, job fires me in a month. (can they fire you so fast? IMPORTANT!!). No money, no bootcamp, and unlikely to get hired again anytime soon. 

6. i start bootcamp since it starts early, wait for job offer and then leave bootcamp if i get accepted. 

at job ill be doing front end stuff..at bootcamp i'll learn backend and mix of frontend. Ill get internships with good companies too.

However point of bootcamp is to get a job. A year of experience in job is better than year in bootcamp?

I'm so lost and confused help me please..

Personally i want to start a job, i can learn the few things that bootcamp teaches and i dont know myself. But i'd have loved to get mentors and good internships. 

Right now my mind is set to go for the job, seems logical choice. Half year of unpaid, vs paid actual experince.

But one thing is stomping me...if they fire me say after 2 months. It'd be lose lose situation and the bootcamp would never talk to me again, probably.

3b7yak,21,2015-06-26,Basically Figuring out my life,nomnombre1,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3b7yak/basically_figuring_out_my_life/,"Alright Reddit, bear with me on this one. I’m 19 years old and have been scouring the internet for someone that shares my point of view for a good chunk of my recent life. It just occurred to me that it might be better to type out my thoughts, since every time I find someone saying something I agree with I feel like I learn more about myself, and it settles something inside of me that I didn’t even know was unsettled. So, you could say this is therapy for me (implying that I do probably need therapy).

I started doing drugs other than weed and alcohol about a year and a half ago. I started smoking and drinking 2 years ago. Before then, I was incredibly against any and all drugs, I was a huge nerd and a recluse. I only hung out with a friend one time my entire freshman year of high school. I was awkward as fuck and was unaware of my social anxiety, and also just in general unaware of how people perceived me. I used to be narcissistic as fuck, thought I was smarter than everybody and that people were retarded for doing drugs and destroying their precious brains. Now, I am ashamed/regret this part of my life, but not entirely. It led me to have some pretty severe social development problems (the anxiety), which I believe the root cause is that I just am so socially unexperienced that I dont know how to act normal or “cool”. This is much less true now than it was a couple years ago.

Being the obsessive person that I am, I decided I wanted friends, and I wanted fun. The deciding factor for me came during my Junior year of high school when I started feeling slightly depressed due to an unhealthy relationship and realizing that being socially unhealthy affects my wellbeing. I researched depression and I researched weed and alcohol, and determined that any damage to my brain I make from sparingly smoking and drinking would be quantitatively less than the damage I was doing to my brain by staying friendless and depressed. My lunch table acquaintances soon became my bros, and we would smoke on the weekends and drink if we were lucky enough to be invited to a party. This period of my life was the funnest and most exciting time in all my 19 years. I was loving it, especially because having been a reclusive nerd put me at number 3 in my graduating class and I was getting accepted to great colleges and getting lucrative scholarships. I felt like I had the most well-balanced life, and at the time that may have been true. Also, without a girlfriend, I started learning how to talk to girls I didn’t know, and started hooking up with girls I used to fantasize about. 

My senior year of high school was when I was cashing in on having been a nerd, and I started smoking weed nearly every day and thinking my shit was sweet. I thought I was so cool, but in reality I had such a one-track mind and was extremely complacent. I may have enjoyed this period of my life the most, but I definitely am not most proud of it.

Then it was summer before college, and I just thought I was the shit and smoked my entire summer job’s pay (around 3200 dollars) away by the time I was a week into my first semester of college. I was not ready for college.

Cue college, I joined a fraternity, went out literally every single night, and started doing poorly in classes. A couple weeks into school I thought I was about to take acid for the first time, and it turned out to be a research chemical. Cue the worst 4 hours of my life, where I realized how anxious I got in social situations in the worst way possible, in a room full of my new “brothers” that I barely knew. Only me and one of my other brothers were tripping (he had a shit time too, he’s one of my best friends now though and I love him to death). Anyway, this trip gave me full blown anxiety attacks. Thought people were always looking at me, became aware of my facial expressions like never before. It’s almost a year later and still sometimes I’ll revert to that scared mindset and if I feel like someone is looking at me (usually they are but that shouldn’t matter, people look at people all the time) I’ll lose control of my facial expression and just look really anxious. As a side note and not trying to brag just trying to be as real as possible with myself in this post, I’m pretty attractive so people will look/stare at me more than most and I fucking hate it. I enjoy being attractive but I fucking hate the feeling of being watched. One last note about the trip, afterwards I stopped going out every night and got my school shit together.

This last year at college has been crazy for my development. I started getting real acid and taking it, as well as molly (the molly was stupid, didn’t help me much and I should've saved it for a better occasion). I started learning a lot about myself from both the drugs and from just experiencing life in college. I could write a book about everything I learned. Anyway, I became very good socially, stemming from having awareness of myself, of others, of body language, and trying to be empathetic and less selfish.

The second semester though I began to abuse adderall, way too much. Every day for a couple weeks at some points, some days taking 100mg IR. My social anxiety heightened, and also a more generalized anxiety surfaced. I didn’t realize it till I became a huge hypochondriac. Last week I was convinced I have fucking aspergers or some shit. Which has always been a weird worry for me, but I always shrugged it off with confidence. When I first started having friends in high school my friends would make fun of me and say that I have the bergs because I just was socially retarded. I know that’s terrible of them and this issue probably has something to do with emotional scars but that’s irrelevant; the drugs sparked the flame. I probably spent 5 hours total researching aspergers in an attempt to self-diagnose, and it took till I found an article about how people with aspergers avoid social situations or something like that to convince myself that I’m normal and maybe just a little crazy.

Anyway, here I am with an anxiety issue, standing at the edge of a well with depression at the bottom. I got into drugs with the idea that they would help me, and now here I am. I am both helped and hurt. I will say, being socially capable is doing wonders for my life situation, even if I still feel like shit. Professors like me, friends like me, strangers like me, the only problem is that I don’t completely like myself. 

There’s also one aspect of my personality that I’m very aware of but have difficulty working on, and I don’t like it. I’m very in my head sometimes, and I will be unaware of my surroundings if I don’t concentrate on them. As a result, I will sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves like 4 times. Also, sometimes I say insensitive things just because I won’t be thinking at all, but I don’t do this too much anymore and mostly just cringe at past fuckups (which I know is pointless and doesn’t help me, but bleh).


From an outside perspective, I seem like the happiest and most worry-free individual. I have a very high GPA in a hard major at a hard school, I have what is now my third internship, I’m attractive and likeable, and just seem very well put together. Really, the only things holding me back from loving the fuck out of life are my addictions and anxiety.

Something recently happened that gave me a glimmer of hope. I went to a music festival, and while I was rolling I introspected hardcore. I’m not going to drink as much anymore, I’m not going to smoke as much, minimal adderall, I’m dropping xanax and blow is only on special occasions. I don't need to prove anything to anybody. The excitement of smoking a blunt is all but lost. I don't have any more good reason to keep destroying my body. Unlike during high school, I would be happier being sober. Which is crazy to realize, but I need to be receptive of my true feelings, or else my internal conflict would snowballed and I probably would become a huge drug addict. The ending to that story is very predictable.

Everybody should watch the video I watched yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVOOwFNp5U. This really hit home. And now I want to change more than ever, and feel like there is somebody else out there that understands why I wouldn't wanna keep living the life I'm living. Luckily, some of my fraternity brothers have more depth to them than the people Hopsin flames in that video, so I don’t feel a need to completely drop the life I have. I just need to be a leader and put a stand against our addictions. I’m confident that if I change my ways, at least some of my brothers will follow. 

I used to be scared of this change. I had one candy flip that was weird at the beginning of May that wasn’t even enjoyable, because I looked around, saw all the frat bros, and realized that I definitely do not belong. It’s just not me to waste my life away. I came out of that candy flip telling myself that college is only four years and that I can deal with it till I graduate, but that it’ll probably cause depression because I’m so conflicted by that lifestyle.

I forgot to mention I abused xanax and cocaine all last year too. I also get pretty bad anxiety about the drugs I do, I constantly am googling information about the effects of different levels of drug use, especially as I started increasing use. However, while rolling at this festival, I realized that I need to be my own person and that changing my habits is definitely something I can do while still in college. So that’s what I’m going to do.

Now, I feel like I’ve gone on a wild ride this last year. I am such a different man. But I am a man, and I know exactly who I am and what my goals are. I feel like I finally found the last piece to my puzzle. I have a strong feeling that my life is about to drastically improve. Since the festival, it already has. Even though Ive been dealing with a pretty big built-up molly hangover recently, I’ve been feeling better about myself. 

All in all, I may have been narcissistic as fuck in the past but I wasn’t stupid for rejecting drugs. Now I know why people say drugs are bad. They’re also fun as fuck. But, I’ve lived both lives now. I have experience, and know exactly what in life I love. So I’m going to make smart decisions and love life. I'm going to have the future that I already put in so much work towards. Maybe if I didn't have anything at stake I wouldn't have this stance, but I'm too proud to allow the fruits of my labor to rot. I want to be the best person I can possibly be, to myself, to my friends, my family, strangers, animals, and the world.

If you read all of this, wow, congratulations, and a huge fucking thank you. It’s probably pretty disorganized but fuck it. Edit: Just cleaned it up so hopefully it makes more sense. I’m on adderall so this took me about 45 minutes to write. Hopefully some of you can relate to my story. Please let me know if you think my stance on anything is skewed or if there’s anything I haven’t considered that would change my perspective. I love thinking about things critically, so have at me.

Forgot to mention, but I’m a huge nerd about everything I do so I know a ridiculous amount about drugs from doing research. I tested all my drugs with a test kit (besides that first tab of acid).

Aside from all my problems, I actually have a lot of interests including guitar and music in general. I listen to music from when I wake up to when I go to sleep. I love listening to new artists and discovering stuff, and recently I decided to put together playlists and share them with friends and now it's all we listen to and it makes me so happy the people in my life enjoy my passion.

One love."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[In counter-intelligience, how often does someone actually experience a car chase, spy vs spy duel, or other such movie antics? Is it mostly just gathering enough evidence until you can book someone no problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh77v?context=5)|So counter-intelligence ops against diplomats are not law enforcement activities, you are not really building a case against somebody to bring to trial. This means that sometimes what you can and can't do is a little different :)
 |I did get to drive super fast a few times (I had a Corvette at the time), but I didn't want to have to explain to the police why I was going 100mph with military manuals in the car (and I'm pretty sure the FBI didn't want to explain that either)!
 |There is definitely aggressive maneuvering to shake surveillance and to employ counter-surveillance. But generally it is first and foremost mental combat -- think of it as chess on steroids (i'm not sure if that makes it lame or not)!
[Have spy movies like the 007 series been ruined?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjiesy?context=5)|I love spy movies!! As has been mentioned my story is in the process of becoming a movie over at 20th Century Fox. It will be directed by Marc Webb (Spiderman series) and the screen writer is Mark Heyman (the Wrestler and Black Swan). I am so excited to see what they do with this! I hope my story can be added to the spy movie genre as well!
[I hope you know that I will brag to all my friends that I talked you when the movie comes out.  And I will check out the book soon. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjisqu?context=5)|TY!
[How did you relay information to the FBI during your time as double agent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh62a?context=5)|Everything was done in-person, both with the Russians and FBI. As has been reported by the press was the Russian penchant for meeting at Hooters: [Link to www.washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/11/how-an-american-slacker-caught-a-russian-spy-at-a-new-jersey-hooters/)
[Were you monitored often by Russian intelligence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh62a?context=5)|I'm sure the Russians monitored me and used surveillance and counter-surveillance, but I never knew definitively. A man coming into the bathroom right after me when I was meeting with my Russian case agent, could've just had to pee -- or he could've been making sure I wasn't calling the FBI! You never really know!
[What did your handler offer you in exchange for your service? Money, sanctuary, drugs, prostitutes, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjiute?context=5)|Because a human being can offer context on the information she/he is delivering. Case in point, every job I ever started the orientation included where the bathroom was, how to use the shared drive, etc, etc. Without the orientation, it would be pretty hard working there.  If somebody in China is sifting through raw data, good luck trying to understand the context and nuances of what they are looking for. It's always easier to have somebody explaining what things means. Plus it's cheaper and harder to detect.
[How does the Russian government recruit spies in the US?  How successful have they been with infiltrating the US?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjggr0?context=5)|Recruiting assets is an art more then it is a science. It should be noted that the most damaging spies that worked for the USSR and Russia were not recruited, rather, they were volunteers. They made contact with the Russians and offered to help them of their own free will! Sadly, that will continue to happen.
[What's the deal with numbers stations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhdok?context=5)|People think that the Russian use of low tech tools is because they are incompetent or lack sophistication. That is not true. They know our cyber capabilities and know that using technology can be easily monitored. As such, in person meetings and one way communications (even low-tech methods) are the most secure.
[What are your thoughts on Dmitri Polyakov, aka TopHat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhdok?context=5)|As I said before, spies who have worked against us not only damage our national security but they result in the death of people. Polyakov is a sad example of that.
[How would you compare the Russian agency vs an American agency? What is the biggest difference? Strength weakness etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgir5?context=5)|The Russians are very professional and capable. For an Intelligence Officer (IO) to be posted in somewhere like NYC, they have to be very good at what they do. Coming to the states is not an IOs first posting, it's where seasoned officers come. My time in this op was spent in NYC, so the lead agency in my case was the FBI. My FBI handlers were professional and extremely competent. They also had a healthy professional respect for the Russians. 
[Have Russian agents ever illegally crossing the border or do they  arrive legally as diplomats, tourists, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgsu4?context=5)|There are generally two kinds of spies: diplomats and those who assume non-official cover (noc). It should be noted that ""spies"" don't actually spy, rather, they recruit indigenous people to spy for them. So the more appropriate title would be case agent or spy handler.
[What was motivation for the recruited assets who worked for Russia/USSR? Were they cash-strapped or ideologically communist, Marxist, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgsu4?context=5)|There are many reasons that people spy, but primarily it is a combination of ego and money. This is something I talk a lot about in my book -- [Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/How-Catch-Russian-Spy-American/dp/1476788820)
[Spy Game is a pretty good movie too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjrerj?context=5)|My favorite spy movie is without a doubt Spy Game. Robert Redford is fantastic in this movie (as is Brad Pitt). The scenes with Redford meeting with other Agency types as looking at papers in mirrors, is very much how we conducted business!
 |I'm going to have watch that movie again tonight! So good!
[Do you worry about your safety at all, after having been a double agent? And have you made any changes in your day-to-day life to ensure your continued safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjg1x6?context=5)|No. Russian military intelligence is a professional organization. They follow the unwritten rules -- plus they would have nothing to gain by harming me. I'm more worried about sharks and bears (not the Russian kind).
 |I would add that I do get semi-trolled online, and my book has not received favorable reviews from pro-Putin outlets. But then again I got a great blurb from the creator of Archer -- so it's all good!

The cool parts of meeting with the Russians was outnumbered by long meetings to plan and game out things. Not to mention the powerpoint presentations I did (yuck!). So it was 25/75 cool vs not cool.

I think at this point he is a propaganda tool used by the Russians as part of a very successful information warfare campaign. I think most people who understand who he is and what he did have a real strong dislike for him. He started off as self-serving person who will end his days as a puppet of the Russian state. I bet he regrets his decision to do what he did.

3b81cj,3,2015-06-26,Degree and Five Years Experience - Where to now?,WilliamMelvinHicks,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3b81cj/degree_and_five_years_experience_where_to_now/,"I graduated in Info Systems Tech in 2009 and was offered a job where I was an intern at the time; the offer was $30k, which I felt was low, but being in a rural southern small town coupled with the fact that the economy had just collapsed and no one was hiring, I reluctantly accepted the position (IT Specialist). They told me I would be at about 40k after five years, which again is low but in this area it's enough to live comfortably.

It is a healthcare nonprofit with about 400 employees and I was the second IT person they had ever hired aside from my boss. We had a fairly complex network setup consisting of fiber connections between 13 sites, Cisco VPN/firewall/web filters/VOIP, however all of that was setup and configured and to a large extent managed by consultants. 

For the first couple years most of my time was spent responding to help desk tickets, but I did get to lead the project of migrating about 250 workstations onto the domain. My boss had very little knowledge or experience with AD, so I setup their file shares and group policies. 

During years 3-5 we hired a part time intern so I could focus more on higher level projects rather than help desk, and we received a large grant to virtualize our servers and VDI. We still relied heavily on consultants and they designed and setup all of our VMWare infrastructure, once it was ready to go I was in charge of doing P2V server conversions, cloning our server template when we needed a new server, and setting up desktop VMs for our VDI users.

Unfortunately due to financial struggles, the company either freeze salaries or only gave 2% each year so after 5 years I was still only making $33k. I had been doing affiliate marketing on the side and reached a point where I was actually making more from that, so I quit to pursue that full time a year ago. Now I'm at a point where I miss working in IT and the affiliate income has been very unsteady, so I'm looking for an IT position.

I'm not really sure what type of position I should be pursuing at this point; I feel overqualified for help desk but I'm not sure if I'm ready for Sys Admin because of how reliant we were upon consultants at my old job. I worked with Active Directory for several years, but our environment was not very complex to say the least, so I'm afraid if I'm really pressed on technical questions in an interview I won't be able to answer them.

I'm thinking that my best bet at this point is to go for MCSA or MCSE (suggestions welcome!) and possibly VMware after that to refresh and update my knowledge and look for Sys Admin positions. Any insights or suggestions are appreciated.

I already analysis statically the database to generated some graphics like Randal Olson and show relation between elo rating and numbers of plys, demonstrate first move advantage etc.

We will use a cluster with thousands of computers to get score &amp; evaluation's FEN with a uci engine (stockfish for now).

Then, we will have the score of all moves already played. 
We can calculate intrinsic rating depending on score average and not only result game.

Are you interested by our approach ? Do you have questions ?

Do you have some ideas what we can search in the database ?
Which player has the lowest average of blunders ? Who is the best player depending on intrinsic force ?"

Throwaway, because she reddits.

I'm out of state for work, and my girlfriend and I decided that it'd be a good idea for her to come with me. I rented a house cheap, and we figured that cohabitation for the 2 months or so I'd be working would be good for us. Currently, we're about 4 weeks into it. 

We fight about twice a week and it's driving me crazy. She gets agitated by the smallest things. I think part of it is that she's struggled in finding short-term employment, so she's stuck in a house alone for 11-13 hours a day while I'm working and maybe longer if I'm out with other interns, or staying late for OT. 

Despite this knowledge, I feel like I'm going mad. She gets on my case for insignificant things, like unplugging charging cords because it wastes electricity, even though she'll leave the air conditioning blasting in rooms she's not in. 

On days when we're super affectionate, or have sex, things are great. Otherwise we fluctuate wildly between ""normal"", ""tolerable"". Otherwise we're arguing. Furthermore, her emotions seem to be front and center in our interactions. I try to be empathetic, but honestly, I feel like some of the things that she gets hurt about are petty at best and her working herself into a mood at worst. 

Yesterday, before bed [NSFW incoming] I felt a bit horny. She'd been sick all day, so instead of asking for help from her, I went to the second bathroom downstairs, so she wouldn't have to hear my porn. I come upstairs afterwards, and she's waiting, asking why I was downstairs for so long. After I tell her, she immediately gets quiet and storms out, to sit on the stairs and cry. 

I get up to comfort her, (mind you it's already late) and ask her what's wrong. All she could say is that she's feeling ""something"" but doesn't know what. She starts to analyze why I went downstairs instead of asking her, and I tell her it's just because she was sick and I felt like going downstairs. No huge rhyme or reason to it. Thinking it's settled, I head to bed. 

Cue her waking me out of my bed several times, calling me an asshole, or saying how I should just go sleep on the couch if I want peace and quiet so I can sleep (mind you, I'm the only one paying rent atm). I ask groggily and nicely repeatedly, turning off the lights only to have them turned on again, until I snap out of my sleep for the 4th time and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone. 

She breaks down, and the last thought I have before drifting off is that I could care less at this point. Flash to today, I left her sleeping. She hasn't texted and I don't want to go home to her yet. I actually want overtime so I can avoid it. I hate that I screamed at her, but her grievances have gotten so petty and her emotions so sensitive, that I can't seem to care. 

I need help. I have 6 more weeks of this and I'm finding it harder to genuinely care about her concerns. Am I an asshole? What do we/I do?

2. I unfortunately have zero job experience when in comes to enterprise networking. I always see experience required 2-5 years and 5-7 for job postings online. Now granted until I achieve my CCNA cert, I have no means by which to indicate to an employer that I have the knowledge or skillset to fit the job of network administrator/engineer. Now, while this isnt a huge issue in the immediate future as I am continuing my collegiate studies for another 2 - 3 years and wouldn't be able to work full time anyways . I find the old catch 22, need experience to get experience, a problem. Is my best bet internships? 

3. If I want to be placed directly into a network engineering/administration position, is this possible to do without first going through the grueling task of being help desk? I just really want to be payed well and address issues that are dealing directly with the network. Not where is the power button on my pc and how do I login to the machine.

I started my first job as an intern and I'm a little confused about how many allowances I should be claiming. I'm making $18.41 an hour for about 11 weeks, $2000 relocation, and $600 airfare. It adds up to around $11,000. I'm single and a dependent. No children. This will be my only income for the year. I forgot my W4 for my first paycheck and had $167 taken out from my paycheck I get every two weeks. I then used the IRS calculator and it told me 8 allowances, which sounds a bit high? I hear most people only filing for 1. When I got my second paycheck I had an even bigger withholding of $749, but that paycheck included my $2000 relocation + $949 tax assistance. I overall received $50 less that paycheck even though I had 8 allowances claimed vs not claiming and 8 hours more worked that period. The calculator now says to file for 13 allowances, which sounds aburdly high. I'm pretty sure I'm fucking something up. Any advice?

Also, do I need to file state W4s I'm working in Florida but a resident of California. Is there a calculator for it?

Thanks."
3b8k8p,1,2015-06-26,Had to deal with my first suicide. (Trigger Warning),SomeThingsICantStand,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3b8k8p/had_to_deal_with_my_first_suicide_trigger_warning/,"So I've been in school to become a funeral director for a while now. In the fall I will be starting my Junior year of a BA program for Funeral Services. This summer I am doing a clinical practicum. For those that may not know what that means, it's like an internship but more hands off because you haven't learned a lot of what your doing yet, but they want you to take a step into the waters to get a feel for it before you start doing the harder things in classes.

I live in a remote town, and really not a lot goes on. I've been doing my clinical for about six weeks now and 99% of the people I have seen come into the funeral home have been older people. People everyone expects to die because they are getting to the end of their lives.

Yesterday I got called to do a removal at about 7:30pm. The funeral director told me to get ready and meet him, like I normally do, to go do the removal. I figured it was just a normal go to a hospital or nursing home. While we were in the car he said it was a hunting accident. So I got prepared for that mentally.

On the way he got a phone call from the sheriff that was one site to let him know the coroner was already there, and that it was ruled as a suicide. I had no idea what to expect. I started telling myself it was okay if I needed to step away, it was alright if I felt faint. I just had to let Brian know if I couldn't do it.

We drove down into a little area in the woods, that lead to a sandpit. The officers were parked a little ways away, and the coroner was there as well. I was looking around through the car window to see the body and there wasn't one. Apparently he was around another corner and we had to pull around to the other side of the pit, behind a large mound that had been over grown with grass.

I could see the tail end of a green pickup truck. I was telling myself this was it, don't panic if you feel faint let someone know. I got out of the hearse and went around to the back to help unload the stretcher. When I turned around I could see the truck.

The windows of the back of that cab were washed with fluids, they had been there awhile so it was obvious they had mostly run off and down into the inside of the cab. This truck didn't have a back seat so there was some matter stuck behind the passenger seat between the window.

The officers and the coroner had walked down from their vehicles. The coroner had already laid a blue body bag out next to the truck. I stood next to the bag, at first all I could see was what was in the door mirror, it was just some of his eye brown and I couldn't make out the rest. So I knew for the moment I was fine.

The officers asked us to step around the front of the vehicle after the coroner opened the door. She threw a little bit of a skull fragment into the body bag. Before moving and the three of us stood at the front while the officers removed the gun from the mans hand. As they took the gun out and pointed it to the ground blood poured from the barrels. (This was a double barrel shotgun) and they opened it and removed the unused round.

The whole time they were doing this I could see through the front windshield. This man didn't have a face at all, there was nothing but an empty cavity where his face used to be.

This is the part that bothers me. It didn't bother me in the slightest. It was like it was nothing. There was no emotion at all, like it was just another removal, there was no sense of numbness, or anxiety. Hell not even a morbid curiosity to want to get closer. It was just like, ""Huh, okay."" And back to work I went.

We pulled what was left of his brains out of his lap tossed them into a baggy and the coroner and the funeral director lifted him out of the vehicle, and I grabbed his legs as they pulled him out so we wouldn't touch the ground. Like it was no big fucking deal.

The thing that sticks with me though was his set up. He had the forethought to plug in his phone, set it neatly on the seat, his keys his hat and other things arranged neatly on the passenger seat. A photo set of his wife and kids were sitting on the dash.

The only things that made me feel angry or sad was the coroner and how insensitive she was. ""Why do they have to do it in a car or in a house? They could at least do it in the woods and think about the people that have to clean it up!""

This burned me a bit, because I was almost where that man was a few years ago. I know what its like to be in that mind set and the last thing you think of it how messy its going to be. Your too preoccupied with controlling what you can, and trying to scratch your way to the surface but your constantly falling down. So you put a gun in your mouth because its the last possible option because in your mind you've exhausted everything else.

I don't like telling people that so I politely said, ""I think that's why he's here."" she said ""What?"" and I responded, ""Thinking. He wasn't thinking of that, that's why he's here."" And she gave a small head tilt as to say ""Yeah I can see that."" I would have gave her a whole speech about suicide and what its like from the inside but what good does it really do? I know it does do some good, but in the same token on the job and standing around talking about my own sob story instead of getting this poor guy all bagged wasn't worth the breath and time it would have taken to explain it all. Plus how would I have looked to my ""co-workers"" if I was like ""Yeah I tried to off myself a few years ago, no biggie."" It makes people look at you different, like they can't trust you alone, or like they don't want to be around you. You're immediately transformed into a person who is uncomfortable to be around. So I kept my mouth shut.

The officers were bagging all his belongings, and they kept looking at me. I must have been so stone faced, they kept having the same reaction of... how do you even explain it... because it's not disgust and its not fear, but more of a unease and here I was nearly half there age and already standing there (a blonde, short, girl) without losing my cookies in the tree line like I was a hardened vet. or something; while, them, grown men muddled around not wanting to touch the bloody evidence.

Through all of that, I finished up my night, brought the body to the funeral home for storage and went home. I got home and I still wasn't feeling anything. I looked and my SO and said can we go somewhere. I don't want to sit here and think. He looked back at me and I said ""I just went to a suicide call."" He immediately got dressed, and asked me where I wanted to go. I didn't know so we just drove for a while before making a pit stop to grab ice cream before Dairy Queen closed.

The whole time I kept telling him I don't feel anything. It bothers me that I don't feel anything. I feel like I should be feeling something.

He said they need people like me doing that kind of work, if the world was full of people like him they be closing their eyes and rolling the dead into a ditch some place so they wouldn't have to deal with it.

It still really bothers me. Like I'm broken. I mentioned it to the funeral director and he looked at me really surprised. He's been doing this for years and in that look I knew that it still bothered him; which didn't help.

I had posted about it on FB:

""Did a removal (technically yesterday) and I think what bothers me is that what I saw didn't bother me. I'm not allowed to talk about it for privacy of the family, but I think what I saw would make most people reel but for me there was nothing... it was like it was normal, liked I'd seen it a million times. No pit in my stomach, no nausea, no anxiety. Just normalcy. Like it was just another day.

Its eating at me, like I'm broken. Keep thinking my response isn't normal. Maybe my threshold is higher... I don't know.""

I couldn't tell anyone I went to go pick up a guy who blasted his face off so every probably figured it was just another case of an old person.

""Not broken sweetheart.... You finally found what you're good at.... Not everyone can do it!!!""

"" I agree...found your calling! Death is a part of life right? I would call your ability to be ok with it as the normal that everyone should have...it's all part of life.""

This doesn't feel normal to me. Maybe its because I tried to end my own life and I can see it clearly from his point of view as to why he did it. Maybe it is normal. Maybe I'm desensitized from all the nasty shit on the internet. I'm definitely talking to my therapist about it but that's a few weeks out so I needed some place to decompress.

Maybe even get some input on if it's normal or not. Not that I really want to hear that I'm not, but it might shed some light even if its a painful truth."

Sure it's easy for me to sit here and just spout off, but I'm generally curious if I'm alone in some of these. None of my friends are hardcore fans so I want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to add those I miss or disagree. That's what Reddit is for!
(I can't get the formatting right - Sorry desktop folks...)

Works:

* Anything involving the back office: Sure people have been bitching/moaning/conspiracy-theorizing about if people were fired, or not being included as much, etc. I feel like so much of the back office (Will and Jason come to mind immediately for me) is criminally under utilized. Not just Sal and Richard gay stunts, but everyone. When they are used, it's radio gold.

* Introduction of new ""Wack Packers"": When Eric died (RIP) there was a (Paris Hilton voice) huuuuuuuge vacuum left. I feel like Hanzi, Monotone Matt (or whatever his name is) and Mick the Nerd have been used well to help fill the void.

* Three words: Sour-motherfuckin'-Shoes. No explanation needed.

* Howard talking about 'Nam: Generally speaking this is probably one of the more outrageous things he still does. Sometimes slightly cringe-y, but always very funny.

* Benjy/Elisa drama or anything with Benjy: I'm POSITIVE I'm in the minority here, but I loved that whole thing. I know she's a star-fucker but there was just something about Benjy's steadfast loyalty and her song about Gonzo that just made it riveting. I just love the discord he brings to just the show in general.

* The Top 5: It was fine before, but bringing in Wack Packers to sing it was a funny twist.

Not working:
* Howard writing musicals - It's not fun or funny. It's never been fun or funny. It never will be fun or funny.

* Howard doing math: I could see it being an in the moment quick joke, but he keeps doing it over and over and over.

* The ""Celebrities"" that call in: Most of the time they are just plain not funny and go for the easy, lazy jokes. I know people are theorizing that some of them are tape and that would be eve more disappointing.

* Complaining about the Khaleesi not getting naked: Now, I love boobs as much as the next guy, but a conversation about GoT can't happen without Howard talking about that for 5 minutes. Yes, Howard, let's hear your theory about why she's not topless as much and what you would tell her if she gave a shit. There's much more nudity out there. Plus it's not like she hasn't been nude before! Frustrating.

* General lack of games: I'm not looking for Intern Beauty pageants or Lord of the Anal Rings, just something, anything, that makes listening a little more active. I miss Win Fred's Money.

* Big time interviews: OK, this one is complicated. I guess, I just don't see him as the amazing interviewer people think he is. Do you have to ask every person about ""orgying"" or all the ass someone got when they were younger. I guess, I just want to know more about them as a person and less about their sex life and their net worth (one thing Howard refuses to talk about ironically enough.) But stupid questions like, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" ""Did you get a boner?"" just rub me the wrong way. I dunno, maybe I'm just being too sensitive about it.

* His hatred of podcasts: Illogical. I know he is old but saying you want to do a radio show is like saying ""I want to write for a newspaper."" I know ""everyone"" has a podcast these days but I believe it comes from a place of jealousy. He had to work so hard to get to where he is and now these people can say whatever they want into a microphone and maybe get an audience. Radio stations are being closed, reformatted and using mostly syndicated content (something he is familiar with). Podcasts allow people to produce the exact content they want with little or no restrictions. For some people they can make a living on them. For others it's just a hobby, or just for fun, or just a creative outlet. They don't want to be a ""broadcaster."" It just comes off stodgy and bad.

* The general lack of communication: We know very little about a show thats on the air 4 hours at a time, not to mention 2 stations running 24 hours a day. It took me a while to find out HTV died, and that certain people were let go (Tracy, Lisa G, etc) Not that we need to know everything (people should be allowed to have a little privacy), but when people like that go, it'd be nice to at least put out something about it? I dunno, again, I might be tantruming.

I know I'm missing things for both lists. I still love the show and won't stop listening, but it felt good to write these out at least. "

Throwaway, because she reddits.


I'm out of state for work, and my girlfriend and I decided that it'd be a good idea for her to come with me. I rented a house cheap, and we figured that cohabitation for the 2 months or so I'd be working would be good for us. Currently, we're about 4 weeks into it.


We fight about twice a week and it's driving me crazy. She gets agitated by the smallest things. I think part of it is that she's struggled in finding short-term employment, so she's stuck in a house alone for 11-13 hours a day while I'm working and maybe longer if I'm out with other interns, or staying late for OT.
Despite this knowledge, I feel like I'm going mad. She gets on my case for insignificant things, like unplugging charging cords because it wastes electricity, even though she'll leave the air conditioning blasting in rooms she's not in.


On days when we're super affectionate, or have sex, things are great. Otherwise we fluctuate wildly between ""normal"", ""tolerable"". Otherwise we're arguing. Furthermore, her emotions seem to be front and center in our interactions. I try to be empathetic, but honestly, I feel like some of the things that she gets hurt about are petty at best and her working herself into a mood at worst.
Yesterday, before bed [NSFW incoming] I felt a bit horny. She'd been sick all day, so instead of asking for help from her, I went to the second bathroom downstairs, so she wouldn't have to hear my porn. I come upstairs afterwards, and she's waiting, asking why I was downstairs for so long. After I tell her, she immediately gets quiet and storms out, to sit on the stairs and cry.


I get up to comfort her, (mind you it's already late) and ask her what's wrong. All she could say is that she's feeling ""something"" but doesn't know what. She starts to analyze why I went downstairs instead of asking her, and I tell her it's just because she was sick and I felt like going downstairs. No huge rhyme or reason to it. Thinking it's settled, I head to bed.


Cue her waking me out of my bed several times, calling me an asshole, or saying how I should just go sleep on the couch if I want peace and quiet so I can sleep (mind you, I'm the only one paying rent atm). I ask groggily and nicely repeatedly, turning off the lights only to have them turned on again, until I snap out of my sleep for the 4th time and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone.


She breaks down, and the last thought I have before drifting off is that I could care less at this point. Flash to today, I left her sleeping. She hasn't texted and I don't want to go home to her yet. I actually want overtime so I can avoid it. I hate that I screamed at her, but her grievances have gotten so petty and her emotions so sensitive, that I can't seem to care.


I need help. I have 6 more weeks of this and I'm finding it harder to genuinely care about her concerns. I have empathy for her, because I love her, and yet the more we argue and the more her feelings get hurt, the less I seem to care. Am I an asshole? What should I do?

3b8wee,21,2015-06-26,How to handle a shopping trip while anticipating minor weight loss?,weirdonerdfreak,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3b8wee/how_to_handle_a_shopping_trip_while_anticipating/,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I don't know where else to post this. 

I'm a cash-strapped college kid who doesn't shop much because I can't afford it. I have a summer internship and not many professional clothes. My dad has taken pity on me and is taking me shopping to fix this. 

Only thing is, I'm planning on losing 10-15ish pounds starting on July 1st. Currently I am ~140-145ish depending on the day. 5'9, 36-29-38. After the weight loss I assume I will probably return to pre-weight gain measurements, 36-25-37.  

So obviously, the ideal solution would be to wait until after I've finished losing the weight to go shopping. However, I need clothes right now for my internship, and I'm also afraid that backing out of this particular shopping trip will result in no trip happening at all, especially with how ambiguous the ""end"" of weight loss is. My dad is well off and can afford to/is willing to buy me everything I'm currently lacking in my business dress, so I really don't wanna miss a golden opportunity. With the way our schedules match up, it's very realistic that we wouldn't be able to reschedule this trip until possibly next summer... and I do not want to spend another year without any professional clothes, it's always really stressful for me to try and cobble together a professional outfit from casual clothes.  

So what do I do? Is it realistic to hope that I can buy clothes that flatter me now and tailor them later? Is tailoring expensive? Will the clothes still look good if I tailor them? Should I buy clothes that I can grow into (or shrink into, I guess)? Is it possible to buy clothes at my current measurements that will still fit well at my new measurements? Should I take the risk and push the trip back? 

Also, before anyone suggests it, it's not an option for him to give me the money to go shopping by myself when I lose the weight either.  

Anyways, any advice on how to approach this would be much appreciated. I would hate to buy a bunch of beautiful clothes only to have them fit poorly a few months later, but I would hate even more to buy a bunch of beautiful, too-small clothes now that never fit because I maybe don't get around to losing weight after all. 

Thanks in advance for any help!  "

So far I've clicked a few data points in Auto-CAD and entered some numbers in a database, not counting shoveling dirt in the heat most of the time. 

Anyway, I'm really considering the BA because they offer GIS programming/automation classes with python, and a wealth of database and workshop classes. I am currently finishing the Python course at CodeAcademy and will be taking some SQL/web development classes at a community college in the meantime. I will have to apply to the BA as post-bacc given that I already have a degree.

Basically I'm itching to go back to school. I want to switch from Geology completely and pursue GIS/programming exclusively to work near my home city (Seattle). Is it worth going for another Bachelors and minor in computer science on top of my B.S.?

The place is all right, there are many other interns my age, mostly girls (they are on different floor though).

I am just that one IT intern guy.   
  
I am just mad at myself for wasting my youth away playing games for the last 3 years.

I had a job interview today for an entry-level job in my field. I'd say it went pretty well. I did a lot better in the interview overall thanks to the advice you guys and my therapist gave me.

The manager said she's not sure if she wants to hire two part-timers (I want to work part-time because of school) or one full-timer, and that I'll hear back from her next week. Don't know if that excuse is bullshit or not. **(Do they ever just hire you on the spot? Why is it always a ""I'll let you know""??)**

If I don't get the job, I just look at it as job interview practice. I got an offer for an interview for another job (not in my field but that's okay) and I just have to call the manager and follow up on it.

On another note, I just cut ties with my (hopefully) last N (possibly flea-ed) friend/ex due to typical n-manipulation things that were going on. Honestly, I think I was just putting up with it for so long because I have no other friends at the moment, but yeah, that's basically been friendships my whole life: End up with friends with n-like behaviors such as, but not limited to, verbal abuse, violation of boundaries, no regard for my feelings about anything, and I just put up with it because I'm so fucking out of my mind from living at home that I just want an outlet or an escape. Not a really healthy way to have friendships or relationships.

And on top of finding a job, I have to get an internship for school secured in less than a month or else I can't even attend school in the fall! But I'm a little more confident that I can accomplish that now.

It just feels like a lot, but although I'm doing it alone, I have my cats who help me so much. I'm looking forward to just having a job and being able to have money to buy things. I have odd sleep patterns and bouts of time when I'm too depressed to get out of bed, so that makes me nervous about having a job with set hours, but I'm getting better at handling that, and it's becoming a rarer and rarer occurrence. I'm just going to take it as it comes.

I just graduated in May, passed my boards, and have been scheduled to work my first shift ever as a solo pharmacist overnight (10pm-8am) at one of the big chain stores tomorrow night. I have been an intern at this chain for about 6 months while on rotations and there is no extra training because I was already an intern. I have also searched SDN and this subreddit for advice but have not found anything comprehensive enough to keep my nervousness at bay.

My question is what should I expect and be expected to accomplish in the overnight shift/first ever shift as a pharmacist? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks and Be Well.

EDIT: Thanks for the great advice, I'll be sure to update after my shift!

POST SHIFT EDIT: So things went fairly well last night although I'm unsure if I gave a bunch of people rhabdo or not. 

Being sole in charge wasn't too bad. At some points i the night it was dead and I kept busy with refills, delete lists, restocking OTC, robots, etc... I did not have a single Norco script overnight which seemed different from what I was expecting. The morning rush started at about 5:30 when a bunch of DURs/scripts came up in the system at once and continued until the end of my shift at 8 am. The problems that were coming up, I was able to handle and all of the overnight pharmacists were a great help when I needed them. It felt weird to verify after typing the script because I KNEW I picked the right things but I was not necessarily looking at it with a fresh pair of eyes. Thank you to the reddit community for helping prepare me for my first shift, I definitely utilized your advice.

A couple of notes: got a MAJOR DUR for Keflex (allergy) and Tessalon pearls? Tons of DURs for some combination of gemfibrozil/fenofibrate and statins that I had to use the patient's profile to override but the risk of rhabdo still scares me. Also citalopram DURs: is there any reason someone would be on citalopram and venlafaxine at the same time?"

YOu talk on the phone all the time, skype and he tries to come down every month or so. Sure there's tons of guys giving you attention, and sure you definitely miss the sex. But once Spring Break comes, you'll be able to party together! Or so you thought. A few days before Spring Break Scott calls and tells you that he's stuck at his internship and won't be able to come down for your Spring Break trip to the beach.

Now that you've already got a hotel room booked down by the beach you figure you might as well use it. Have a few drinks, wear that hot bikini you just bought.

Hey hey! Looking for someone to play a college aged female for some wild Spring Break fucking! 

To get a little bit more specific maybe you meet a guy at a wild hotel room party while you're trying coke for the first time...

Maybe you're on the boat on the lake getting wild with the girls when 

Really love to work cheating, booze and drugplay into scenes. Also love dirty talk, and this particular scene will probably have a bit of a cuckhold vibe for poor Scott :(  Not into noncon, pain, bathroom stuff or gore.

 I like to use pics to sort of set the mood during scenes, so hopefully you're into that! Open to playing through messages or chatzy or however else works for ya.

So if you're ready to make your boyfriend all kinds of nervous hit me up!

#/r/cscareerquestions 

**49,002 subscribers for 4 years!**

So we are reaching the end of my programming themed days.. But what better way to end it than jumping into the most important part of all! JOB! CAREER! QUESTIONS!

Computer science is a very famous field of work today. People get paid a lot, there is always demand, innovation everywhere.. Truly one of the flagships of today's information age. But this leaves people with lots of questions regarding jobs, cost of study, internship questions, culture questions and many many more.

I dont think any field is easy. If you do well, you will get to eat the fruit. But to get to the fruit a solid path is needed. r/cscareerquestions helps you solve atleast some part of that path. They have a lot of questions answered and I would really suggest everyone to use the search bar! (I know reddit search sucks but hey u could still use some keywords! :D) 



I always suggest to **do your homework and read the FAQ/wiki before asking**. It helps you get better answers and lets people know that you are asking a genuine question and they will be more enthusiastic to answer it! :)



Career building is a long process which takes tons of time and work. its not easy. But its not impossible either. Gather information from forums, talk to people, build the knowledge base and move on. 

Keep calm and raise the sails!

Here is a small interview with the mods! :)






&gt;#1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** I like being part of that community, helping other people and contributing to the sub. Since I'm here often I might as well help with modding.

&gt;#2. How would you suggest people getting into computer science to go forward ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Only get in the field if you're passionate, going in for money is a pretty risky move. It's not a 9-5 career, you're strongly encouraged to learn in your free time as well to progress in your career. Easy comfy jobs exist too, but they put you at risk of becoming obsolete. Also, the first job out of school is hard to get, so make sure you have a top-notch profile at that point (do NOT avoid internships), once you're already in the field with some experience, it gets easier to find jobs.



&gt;#3. What would you say is the biggest mistake people do when researching questions ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** A lot of ""bad"" questions are due to the fact that people don't know what they don't know, which isn't always their fault. But generally, try to have a global understanding of the problem and project, if you're too close to the code (this line doesn't work), you'll be missing out on a lot of things that could help you elsewhere.

&gt;#4. Anything you would like to say to your present and future subscribers ? 

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Try not to ask questions that have been answered 100 times already, use the search. Also, don't just post a question, read the answers and leave. Participate with the community and especially in a thread you've created. Don't post a question if you'll be AFK for the next 24h.

3ba14k,3,2015-06-27,[For Hire] Recent Accounting Grad (Masters)/CPA Candidate North DFW,misoranomegami,DFWJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DFWJobs/comments/3ba14k/for_hire_recent_accounting_grad_masterscpa/,"I just finished my masters in accounting (I also have a BS in economics), am qualified to sit the CPA exam and am looking for a place to get the working hours required by the TSBPA. I would prefer to avoid the Big Four at this time since I expect the exam to be taking up a fair bit of my life for the next year and would make working 80+ hour weeks impractical. 

If anybody knows any small to medium sized firms around or public companies looking for accounting/audit help please let me know. I'm in the Plano/Allen/Richardson area but not opposed to going as far north as McKinney or down into Dallas. I prefer external audit though I have volunteer tax experience. I've done a 3 month GAGAS audit internship. I'm also familiar with Excel, SAP, Hummingbird DM. Work would need to be under a licensed CPA to qualify for the board! Thank you!"
3ba7wi,0,2015-06-27,"[Colorado Springs, CO] Need Help Becoming Fully Independent As I Finish College",StarshadesJack,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3ba7wi/colorado_springs_co_need_help_becoming_fully/,"I was a bit hesitant posting here but I thought I may as well explore all possible options. Sorry ahead of time for the wall of text.

Currently, I am a super-super-junior trying to finally get through college in the next 2-2.5 years (graduate with a BS in computer science). Unfortunately, the situation is kind of precarious.

Foremost, I am currently unemployed. I used to work full time and then part-time as a paid intern in the DoD-contracted sector; however, I've had to step down because I can't feasibly take a full college load (12-15 credit hours) *and* be able to work the minimum part-time hours (~16/wk).

I cannot reduce my college load because I *need* to graduate in 2-2.5 years. I'm almost 24 years old and I'm type-1 diabetic. When I hit 26, I will no longer be insurable under family insurance and it does not look like I could easily afford useful insurance on my savings for very long. Ergo, I can't really take my sweet time.

So, here's the problem: At the moment, my family is paying my rent, food, and internet bills while I personally put myself through college by taking out a *lot* of federal tuition loans. Unfortunately, this is hardly a gesture of good will on their part. The relationship between myself and my family is extremely stressful and (to me) borderline abusive. I can't count the number of times I've broken down crying or stressed myself ill over the constant threats and blackmail thrown at me under penalty of complete withdrawal of support. While it has been all bark and no bite so far, I don't want to assume this is set in stone. I'm falling more and more out of favor with my family and I'm dreading that the bite will eventually become reality.

Simply put, I'm asking for help in affording the $600/mo (about $15,000 overall for the next ~2 years) it'd take to pay rent/food/internet ($485/mo for rent, $60-90/mo per internet [depends on how well I haggle XFinity's baloney], and the rest for food) so I can break free from them and maybe not be a crippling mass of anxiety and depression and fear. And, of course, no longer have to worry about potentially becoming homeless or screwing myself long term with the insurance problem.

**I'm not asking for just blind charity, though.** For a while now, I've been spending whatever free time I have and/or can allocate drawing webcomics and recently started up a Patreon for it (though I'm only making $22/mo; I'm no Jeph Jacques). In essence, I'm asking for help becoming independent and, in return, offering stupid comics that maybe might entertain some people.
Here's the link: https://www.patreon.com/IdiotNonoriri

I'm sorry if it sounds like pandering or asking for pity money or whatever. I'm just getting close to wit's end, honestly. I just want to be done with college and get a real job and not have to worry.

Also, I guess a few more general points I feel I should elaborate on:

* I can't use tuition loans to pay for anything other than tuition. I don't physically handle it. It just goes from the loan people to the uni directly.
* I cannot empirically confirm it but I'm fairly certain I couldn't take out a loan from anywhere else for this because I have *no credit* whatsoever. I can't even get a *credit card*.
* $485/mo renting a room in a house is a LOT cheaper than trying to live on campus. By a long shot.
* I generally aim to draw one comic strip per week, an effort that takes anywhere from 3-8 hours and is something I can flex across a whole week (or longer if necessary). Also, I can easily relegate drawing to weekends. I don't have this kind of flexibility working a ""real"" job and I definitely couldn't work weekends at my prior employment.
* I can't deny that I'm just not... ""good enough"". There are plenty of people who have done the full time college plus work thing. Sadly, I'm just not one of them. So I guess it wouldn't be fair to say this isn't at least partly my fault.
* I only have about $10k in savings as I had only worked for about a year.
* So far, it seems likely that my family not having to pay these bills doesn't also mean them taking me off insurance. They are apparently sensible enough in that regard. It's always an incomprehensible mess of bipolar *what-is-even-going-on-here* but suffice it to say that's a gift horse I *won't* look in the mouth....

Again, sorry if this doesn't really belong here. And thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice or help that anyone can pass along. If there's anything else I should elaborate on, please let me know."

---------------------------------------
Hey

I grew up in NZ as a kid, and would like to move back. 
I'm currently finishing up my Marketing and IT degree from a fairly well ranked university in Hong Kong (HKUST). I have a few questions about moving back though:

How well recognized are international qualifications in the NZ Job Market? Will it be a huge problem that all my work experience (internships, etc.) comes from countries in SEA rather than in NZ?

Everything I've tried to find through the search and FAQ sidebar tells me about Visa stuff which I already have sorted, rather than about the job market, so I could use some help.

Cheers!"

I ended up only paying $1620 for it, after stacking a few coupons.

Best Buy has a sale on Macs right now. Pretty much all models are on sale. The 15"" unit usually goes for $2000 but it was listed at $1900 since it is $100 off until next week. If you have a .edu e-mail address you get an additional $100 off. Also, I recently moved in with my parents for the summer due to an internship and the post office gave me some coupons for 10% off at Best Buy. Turns out you can get the coupon online as well if you register to change your address: https://moversguide.usps.com/icoa/home/icoa-main-flow.do?execution=e1s1&amp;_flowId=icoa-main-flow&amp;

So, turns out the guys at the computer section of the store wouldn't let me use both coupons. I ended up telling them I would be more comfortable taking the laptop up front to check out, and they let me. I guess they thought I would try and steal the computer though as two guys were following me all the way to the front check out counters, eyeing me the entire time I was there. The check out guy was chill and didn't know anything about coupon stacking so he just scanned them both and they went through. Final price was $1619.

So yeah, if you are looking to buy a Mac now is a good time!"
3barm6,3,2015-06-27,want to quit first job after only a few months,Wanttogoelsewhere,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/3barm6/want_to_quit_first_job_after_only_a_few_months/,"Hi there,
I try to be as precise and as vague about the situation as possible as I know a coworker is on reddit. If knew how to make this more incognito...

Alright, I graduated last year (2014) in July, had a promissing job in sight till I got turned down in November, friend set me up with a great opportunity instead, got the job, things went a little to smooth maybe. Had to wait for months to get a visa, company probably sunk quite some money into it. 
I started in April.
Now the probation period of three months will be over next week, I will get a huge cashback, which I would also need to leave the country.

About the job. It isn't what I studied for but it was supposed to be a managing position paired with concept design, I do understand that I need to learn first about managing, which is why I came here.
But more important, there should be a creative part in this job, I am a designer and the lack of complex problems is not only mindnumbing but also hurting my selfesteem. To make it worse the solutions my company offers are nothing I can stand for with a clean consciousness. The people are super nice, but it also feels incredibly fake at times. I started, as an experiment, to spend my days not even studying on the job and still they hardly care. 
Also we are only about ten people with 2 bosses. So far I saw 3 coworkers leave in 3 months and I don't know if the first 2 were laid of.
Plus, I am aware the market doesn't look so well for my company and it seem to do fine because of the niche we are in (no competition).

It felt like a great jumpstart for my career before I came here, my gut feeling was a bit of, sure, but I didn't want to regret not going my whole life. The good points are though:
-so far i learned quite a lot about a different trade in only three months and it sparked a lot of ideas for more projects in my life
- i became aware of what kind of environment i need for life

The salary is good, in comparison to my coworkers, which makes me feel terrible.
I am here for two years on the paper, that is the deal with my girlfriend, this isn't /r/relationships though. I need to take her in cosideration as she might get an internship in a neighboring country later this year.

To make things worse, this job made me realise I want to learn and do something else, which I might have never realized otherwise, professionwise and in private . Also I can't have either the way I want, if I stay here.
I am cosidering an internship in my field of design, still abroad, but back in Europe, as I have bought health insurrance for two years.

My idea is to talk this over with my girlfriend when we are on holidays and then start looking for an internship and quit after 6 months here.
I know this might leave a big ugly spot on my resume, but that is not my purpose in life. Besides it could still look good depending on how I phrase it.

It is terrible to admit it that I am unhappy with this, as I wanted it (the country mostly) so bad and told many people that this would be the thing for me. Turns out it isn't.

Any advice, do you think I missed something in my plans?
If you want to fix the job situation consider this:
I talked about my boredom and concerns with my boss but he didn't take it seriously.

tl;dr: want to quit first job (great position in foreign country) after only a few months, spent my own time and money as well as companies for ""almost nothing"" but can't go on with this.

Thanks!"

I'm doing an internship at a mining company at the moment, and I can't help but feel pigeonholed. After almost two months here i'm already sick of the corporate bull-shit and the amount of grunt work involved in this job. So far I've clicked a few data points in Auto-CAD and entered some numbers in a database, not counting shoveling dirt in the heat most of the time.

Anyway, I'm really considering the BA because they offer GIS programming/automation classes with python, and a wealth of database and workshop classes. Even so, most, if not all entry level jobs in my area require a degree in Geography, Environmental Science/Comp. Science at the very least. I feel like if I apply anyway, I won't have the leverage like others because I've only taken two GIS classes in my undergrad.I am currently finishing the Python course at CodeAcademy and will be taking some SQL/web development classes at a community college in the meantime. I will have to apply to the BA as post-bacc given that I already have a degree. 

I'm 22 years old, no loans, money saved up from my current job, and only 55 credits left to complete the BA so I can knock that out in a year. So, why not?

Basically I'm itching to go back to school. I want to switch from Geology completely and pursue GIS/programming exclusively to work near my home city (Seattle). Is it worth going for another Bachelors and minor in computer science on top of my B.S.?"

3bbef0,333,2015-06-27,Swedish Mombie tries to get me to overlook policy by talking about her baby,alcoholic_dinosaur,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3bbef0/swedish_mombie_tries_to_get_me_to_overlook_policy/,"A little background on this so that it makes more sense: I currently do customer service for Airbnb. I have a situation where a young adult, 18-20 I would imagine, booked a room with a host in Sweden where he is doing a 2 month long internship. When he arrived, he was placed into a room that was different than the one he booked, although in the same building. The only thing is that this room is above a hot yoga studio and has no windows for fresh air.

Airbnb policy states that if the host doesn't put the guest in the room that the guest actually booked, it's considered misclassified and the guest is entitled to a full refund. The guest tried to stick it out for a few nights but had to find another place to stay because it was ridiculously hot. I don't blame him at all! He was even willing to pay for an entire week even though he didn't stay there for a week after all.

When I tried to talk to the host about it she was pretty adamantly against refunding them anything at all. After a few emails that I sent to her reiterating that she broke policy, she breaks out her 'ace in the hole' saying that she doesn't ""have much time 
to write right now"" and that I will have to wait until Monday for her response...while proceeding to write several paragraphs about how she won't refund her guest and that her guests we lying to me. She goes on to talk about how she has a baby in one arm and is typing with the other and how she needs to stop replying so that she put her baby to sleep and get some sleep herself because she is just SO exhausted and can't possibly say anything else.

I responded saying that she confirmed she put them in a different room, it's against policy point blank, and I'm refunding her guest everything but the cost of a week's stay as the guest offered to pay it.

Poor girl, no sympathy for mombies from me."

Looking for some advice on what laptop you think would be a good choice for a future in the actuarial field. My current one is about to die out on me, and I think there are certainly better options than a mac for any statistical analysis I may be required to run in the future. I'm am very new to all of this (actuarial stuff) - and know nothing about computers. I just had my first internship working as a data analyst and have only passed exam P, studying for FM. I want something strong enough to deal with larger data sets for the future, but nothing too crazy - as I don't think I'll be taking full advantage of something more advanced for a while. For now, I am just trying to learn excel and some VBA programming and finding it annoying to deal with the differences on my mac vs. a PC. Advice please! Budget ~ $1200. Thanks in advance!"
3bbime,1,2015-06-27,need help with getting healthcare. 18 male.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bbime/need_help_with_getting_healthcare_18_male/,"hello friends.

I'm 18 years old, unemployed, living with my parents (attending college).

My dad makes 25,000 a year. My mother is unemployed. My sister is attending a liberal arts college (5 grand a year). I'm attending community college to save money. 

Basically, I've been getting this weird feeling that someone in my family is going to be sick. I know, it's weird, but my intuition is telling me that I need to get my parents and everyone else checked out as soon as possible. No one is symptomatic, but my gut is telling me that health insurance should be our main priority right now.

My family was in around 70,000 debt. Over the course of high school, I hustled and worked my ass off to pay this off (I tutored, sold drugs, sold game entertainment systems, did other people's homework, wrote college essays [not proud of this one], worked three jobs, etc). Basically, I was able to cut the debt in half, and my sister, mom and father covered the other half. 

So now, for the first time in 20 years my parents are debt free and we feel fucking amazing. It's like we've emerged from the depths of some horrifyingly tumultuous ocean and breathed fresh air for the first time in eons. The only thing we need to pay off is my sister's car, but that's not going to be a problem.

My mom is trying to find work, and my sister got a sweet internship that will pay 4k over 10 weeks. I can't work right now, because I'm hauling ass with school (I took 24 units in the spring, 13 in the summer, and I'm going to be taking another 26 units in the fall). I tried to work in the spring while attending school and I barely pulled off working 15 hours a week while taking 24 units and getting straight A's. I cannot feasibly do this again in the fall for the sake of my own mental stability. 

But back to the main issue. I haven't had a doctor's check up in 5 years. I've found a fuckton of moles on my body (I'm low key paranoid that I have skin cancer). I want to see a doctor asap, but since I'm under Medi-cal I haven't found a primary care physician that is willing to see me (in the local area). 

I'm lost, I really am. I have no idea how to handle health insurance. While I'm the ""man"" of the family and the general caretaker (I've been in charge of all finances for a while, and most ""managerial"" decisions due to my father's absence), I'm totally oblivious in this area of life. I really wish high school prepared you better for these kinds of things.

I'm focusing on the positives right now. We're debt free, we have food and a stable place to live. I'm thinking about getting food stamps to help out more. We're not on ANY form of public assistance or welfare other than medical (that I'm aware of). My parents aren't US citizens, and they don't have social security. 

I would like for some advice on how to proceed. If you've made it this far, I'd like to express my gratitude for your time and consideration. Have a great day!  "

I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me out here with these Battlelog issues. 

Firstly, when accessing the Battlelog function in-game on the PS4 I'm met with a bunch of broken images (boxed question marks) instead of whatever emblems or icons are supposed to be there. Sure, it's a relatively inconsequential issue, but broken images aren't the kind of thing one would expect in to find in a best-selling AAA title from a group like DICE, like they hosted their images on a Photobucket account that's now expired because the intern forgot to renew the membership.  It's like if you walked in on your grandparents making out on the couch; at the end of the day it's really not a big deal, but it's super awkward and embarrassing to see, and I'd rather not have to look at it given the choice. Is this a known issue with a fix? 

Secondly, and more importantly, I'm unable to access the Battlescreen feature of the Battlelog app on either my Android phone or tablet.  I've followed the instructions and tried different methods, tried joining a match on my PS4 and then going to the app, tried joining a match through the app first, etc. It's not that it won't load or connect, but that the option to use the feature never even comes up for me on either device. The little Battlescreen button that's supposed to pop up on the blue bar at the bottom just doesn't appear, and nothing I've tried so far will cause it to show up. The rest of the app appears to be working just fine. The Battlescreen seems like a really nice tool that I'd love to try, but it's as if the feature itself doesn't even exist as far as my Battlelog app is concerned. Has anyone else had this issue recently and been able to find a fix for it? I know people were having some trouble with it when it first launched but from what I've been able to find it seems as though that was addressed long ago and I haven't found any useful information on this from within the past year. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated!"

Unfortunately, I feel like it's better if the company hired a person who was genuinely interested in these things and I feel a bit of a survivor's guilt in which another job applicant who was really interested in these things got killed while I survived, when what I am more interested in is more system-level programming. 

As such, I am that much more thankful I got this internship, but I am concerned about my upcoming junior year, where I'll have to perform well in technical interviews to get into firms I want to work for (As an intern) then work it into graduation. As many of you know, web design doesn't require great algorithmic knowledge while technical interviews do, so I've been reviewing and studying my data structures and algorithms course I took last spring, hoping to not bomb those interviews that I had before I took that course. Problem is that I don't have the same accountability that I had last semester with grades, so I inevitably as a human being am not working as much as I should.

I worked 80 hour work weeks during university, yet with only 40 hours per week in an internship I can't even get myself to study more than 10 hours a week on algorithms and practice problems. How do you guys make yourselves accountable for studying? Thanks."

This community has been a helpful bunch and I hope that somebody could clarify this!

Currently I'm finishing army and I'm applying for part time SIM GE course in Bachelor of Information Technology (Computing) in the Uni of Wollongong and I was looking at the exemption for advance standing (skip year) and my course wasn't in it. 

Backstory: I took Dip in Information Technology (Game Dev) and didn't do very well because I didn't really like the course and was in the rebellious stage of  adolescence, motorbiking and part-time job this and that. I woke up my idea and has been working hard towards becoming a web developer. Taking up internships before NS and a little freelancing around and still learning at every chance i get. My GPA was very ""un-colorful"" so other universities isn't much an option and I would prefer part-time to look for a job and pursue my career!

I don't consider my programming skills to be up there but I feel confident and thinking of appealing for advance standing, I wouldn't mind the interview process. But I'm not even sure if it's possible to appeal for adv-standing and hoping to lighten my load for my parents who are going to pay for it.

Hopefully somebody has gone through this process or has information. It would be really helpful! I might call up but it's the Sunday!

**TLDR;** Poly course not eligible to skip uni years, hopeful to appeal for it."

I'm doing an internship at a mining company at the moment, and I can't help but feel pigeonholed. After almost two months here i'm already sick of the corporate bull-shit and the amount of mindless grunt work involved in this job. So far I've clicked a few data points in AutoCAD and entered some numbers in a database, not counting shoveling dirt in the heat most of the time.

Anyway, I'm really considering the BA in Geog because it offer GIS programming/automation classes with python, and a wealth of database and workshop classes. Even so, most, if not all entry level jobs in my area require a degree in Geography, Environmental Science/Comp. Science at the very least. I feel like if I apply anyway, I won't have the leverage like others because I've only taken two GIS classes in my undergrad. I am currently finishing the Python course at CodeAcademy and will be taking some SQL/web development classes at a community college in the meantime. I will have to apply to the BA as post-bacc given that I already have a degree.

I'm 22 years old, no loans, money saved up from my current job, and only 55 credits left to complete the BA so I can knock that out in a year. So, why not?

Basically I'm itching to go back to school. I want to switch from Geology completely and pursue GIS/programming exclusively to work near my home city (Seattle). Is it worth going for another Bachelors and minor in computer science on top of my B.S.?"

3bclwq,86,2015-06-27,[Month of Legends] Ruud Van Nistelrooij,PM_Me_Your_StarBurns,reddevils,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/3bclwq/month_of_legends_ruud_van_nistelrooij/,"Hello and welcome to day 28 - Ruud Van Nistelrooy


**-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-**


Ruud van Nistelrooy is a Dutch footballer born on July 1, 1976 in Oss, North Brabant. Ruud is a nickname, and his full name is Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooij. He played his first professional season in 1993-94 for Den Bosch and retired with Málaga after the 2011-12 season at the age of 35. Ruud’s 19-season career was very productive and included numerous accolades.



Ruud finished his career with 249 goals scored professionally and 35 goals scored for the Netherlands national team. He is the second-highest goal scorer in Champions League history and led the league in goals during three separate seasons. He was also a top scorer in a season for three different European domestic leagues.


.


**Start of his career:**



Ruud began his career in the Dutch leagues. He started with Den Bosch at age 17 in 1993 and played for the club for four years scoring 17 goals. He then moved to Heerenveen where he scored 13 goals in just one season. At this point, Ruud was maturing physically and as a student of the game, and he transferred to Philips Sport Vereniging (PSV). He played three seasons at PSV Eindhoven, scoring 62 goals overall and building a name that would attract the attention of Manchester United.


.


**Manchester United:**



A deal with Manchester was initially in place in 2000 but prevented by injuries that Ruud had sustained while the negotiations were ongoing. The teams eventually finalized the deal in 2001, and after clearing a medical, Ruud signed a five-year contract worth £19 million, which, at the time, was a British record. With that contract came a great deal of pressure, but Ruud’s first season was a rousing success. He scored 23 goals in 32 games and earned Player of the Year honors. 



Ruud netted 36 goals in his debut season, a frightening achievement that was incredibly eclipsed in the 2002/03 season as he scored 44 times to inspire United to the Premiership title. Another 30 goals followed in his third season. Meaning Ruud had scored 100 goals in his first 3 seasons, an incredble amount.


Injury ruined his 2004/05 campaign, although he still scored 16 goals in 27 appearances and finished top scorer in the Champions League with eight goals. Compare this to our highest goalscorer of last season (14/15), Rooney who only managed 14 the whole full season, this alone is pretty incredible.



2005/06 campaign was tempered with disappointment and upset. Ten goals in 12 games saw Ruud get off to a flyer. But by December he had 17 goals from 26 starts. But the return to form and fitness of Louis Saha saw van Nistelrooy edged out of the side. He was an unused substitute in the Carling Cup final win and wasn’t included in the squad to face Charlton on the final day of the season, with Sir Alex citing issues around “the spirit of the club” as the reason for Ruud’s exclusion.The Dutch striker left Old Trafford in the summer of 2006 and headed to Spain to join Real Madrid.During five seasons at Old Trafford, Ruud compiled 95 goals in 150 appearances and became the club’s all-time European goal scorer.


.


**Controversy:**


*The dutch man was subject to many controversies, such as:*


[Being pinnacle in the famous ""Battle of Old Trafford"":](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1dfphE6jOs)

In the 0–0 draw on 21 September 2003, later dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford, Van Nistelrooy was at the centre of one of the most infamous incidents of the Arsenal–Manchester United rivalry. After missing a last-minute penalty that would have won the game for United, Van Nistelrooy was attacked by Martin Keown, prompting a melee involving several players from both sides; five Arsenal players including Keown received various bans and fines, while the club itself received a record fine of £175,000. Earlier in the game, he had been fouled by Patrick Vieira, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Vieira and his manager Arsène Wenger both accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating and stamping on Vieira, prompting a vociferous defence by Alex Ferguson.



[Ruffling many feathers by attacking ex-United wonderkid, the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo:](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/21/ruud-van-nistelrooy-apologises-ferguson-united)

On 9 May 2006, Setanta Sports reported that Van Nistelrooy's exclusion from the squad was due to a training session fight between him and team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. Van Nistelrooy allegedly criticised Ronaldo's tendency to hold onto the ball instead of passing to his team-mates, which sparked the fight, after which Van Nistelrooy remarked, ""Go crying to your daddy."" The article claimed that this was not a reference to Ronaldo's father (who had died earlier in the season), but to United's Portuguese assistant coach, Carlos Queiroz.



[Or finally, going full black face:](http://www.itv.com/news/2013-01-07/ruud-van-nistelrooy-sparks-controversy-after-blacking-up/)

This one doesn't need explaining I think.


.


**Post United:**



After the 2005-06 season, Van Nistelrooy left Manchester United and signed a three-year contract with Real Madrid at age 30. In his first season with Real, Ruud scored a hat trick in his second game, earned the league’s Pichichi honor with 25 goals scored and helped the team win the La Liga title. Ruud played three more seasons with Real, extending his initial contract by a year, and scored 46 goals overall.


Ruud then played a season with Hamburger SV in 2010-11, scoring 12 goals, and with Málaga in 2011-12, scoring four goals. After the 2011-12 season, with age and injuries catching up with him, Ruud announced retirement. Van Nistelrooy focuses on his children, daughter Moa Annette and son Liam, and his charity organization, SOS Children’s Villages.


In June 2013, Van Nistelrooy joined PSV as a coaching intern working with the under-17s. And then in March 2014 it was announced that Van Nistelrooy will be assisting Guus Hiddink in his duty as manager of the Netherlands national team.


.


**International:**



Van Nistelrooy made his Netherlands debut in 1998 and went on to score 33 goals in 64 internationals for them, leaving him joint third all-time top scorer for his country. He announced his retirement from international football in 2007, before being persuaded to play again, but announced his retirement again in 2008 after the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. Van Nistelrooy came out of international retirement again in September 2010,when he was selected by coach Bert van Marwijk to replace the injured Robin van Persie for two qualification matches in the group of the Netherlands for EURO 2012 against San Marino and Finland.



.


**Quote:**



“It was a dream come true – I signed for Manchester United,”


“I only wanted to play for United, although Real Madrid came in for me. Manchester United were always on my mind first. Finally the deal is done – one year after. It is incredible a club like Manchester United can wait for a player for so long. It gives me such a warm feeling. This is a dream come true. One year ago my life was going down. Now it’s going up. This Friday, I will go to Manchester and meet the fans. I am confident we can build something beautiful at United.”


""Once you have played for United, the rest don’t count anymore. All I want to do is spend as much time of my career at United as possible before I eventually return home and bring the curtain down on my career at PSV.""


""Losing is not in my vocabulary.""


“When we played the final in the Carling Cup, that’s when I started to feel unhappy. My relationship with Ferguson had ended which was very painful. He did a lot for me, waiting for me while I was injured then giving me the chance to play and giving me confidence. But what happened, happened. A good relationship ended. It was very disappointing for me.”


""It pains me that I have to leave this fantastic club, and I will be 


moving on to a new club, but Manchester United will always have a place in my heart""


""Two or three times every year I would think to myself what a shame it was that it had ended like it did with Ferguson.""

Born and raised by a loving family that had scraped their way to a small house, and a good education for their son.  Like many of my friends, being educated in the city and having found the language of math compelling, the siren's call of high finance rang in my ears.  On paper, my knowledge of statistics, of arcane computer languages, and the way I quickly and decisively took opportunities made me the model candidate for any of the largest investment banks.  But, as an intern, I found myself repulsed.  I was overworked, hazed, and would listen to the kind of opinions that, if acted on, would deny even my hardworking parents of their retirement and well-being.

Graduating just as the latest house of cards, of bets against bets, of risk-hedging in the darkest of markets.  Shadow banks and immaterial holdings.  Liquidity in name only.  I saw what had become of my parents' savings.  The way land was grabbed by the richest just as millions were underwater on their homes.

I chose a different path.  The Securities and Exchange Commission seemed ideal, the perfect career of someone whose heart bled for those that suffered and burned for those who caused this catastrophe.  I was embedded within one of the larger firms, still picking up its pieces with the help of Uncle Sam's loans and the watchful eye of in-house observers like myself.  It wasn't hard to find problems.  Poor accounting practices.  Small cases of insider trading.  Drug use.  That was the most prevalent.  High-grade drugs to keep bankers working their 120 hour weeks when they needed to meet monthly numbers.

I saw it all, reported it all, and heard nothing.  My superious enjoyed their two martini lunches with vice presidents, their flutes of Cristal and late nights downtown.  They liked having friends in high places, higher than some lowly government title within a vast machine, an edifice left to rot.  

There were no flutes of Cristal for me.  Not when I was reporting each and every irregularity, causing trouble for my superiors.  ""PIssing in the well"" they would tell me.  I stood out like a sore thumb, even the most well-tailored 400 dollar suit looks conspicuous next to men in 2000 dollar suits.  You start to feel isolated.  Work purposefully obscured from me, socially ostracized even when I treated everyone with respect.

But then I saw you again.  The same discerning smile, the same gaze piercing straight through me.  Making your way up, working late every night, fending off the advances of your peers.  FIghting for your own slice of the pie.  

I remember our nights so many years ago, laying on the hood of that wreck of a car I drove, gazing up at the night sky and asking each other what our hopes were for the future.  There were those late nights in my dorm where I saw your skin silhouetted by the glow of the city for the first time, unblemished and pure.  The way you'd hold me tightly before an important day.  

The way we kissed when it felt our lives were diverging.  Our bodies so reluctant to part even then.  It wasn't a distance of miles, but a distance of minds.  Something hardened me in college, my passions intensified but my emotions were a cold fire, one that lost what it meant to make one person happy.  

Here you were, back again in my life, five years later just as beautiful as I had left you.  There had been women after you but never women like you.  You had haunted me as an idea and now here you were, haunting me once more as flesh and blood.  I had never expected a call from you at one in the morning, woken from a restless sleep in my tiny studio by the buzz of my phone....

So, something a bit different for you all.  I've found myself restless, especially over the past few weeks and had a lot on my mind so I write these for the hell of it.  Who you are and what you've become is up to you.  Have you fallen into the debauched, money and pleasure-chasing culture of finance, or are you a whistleblower in need of a friendly face to help?  You can take a look at my post history for more information about myself but really, this is open-ended so I am curious to see what comes of this."
3bcqfu,24,2015-06-27,Advice to myself about breaking up...,dem_cakes,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3bcqfu/advice_to_myself_about_breaking_up/,"We were together since Jan 2014, and we went long distance in September of that year. We ended up breaking up in April this year; I had seen him once after he moved away. 

A few things I would tell myself if I was in that situation again: 

* It's not always bad because of the distance. I've seen on this subreddit, and from people I know in real life, that you **can** make it work. 

In my relationship I attributed a lot of things to because of the distance. If it wasn't the distance, it was the 3-hour time difference. If he slept in super late until noon his time everyday, it was because I was three hours ahead that we'd only start talking when my day is half over. Oh, he's not super communicative and doesn't ask me any questions? It'll definitely get better in person because it was so good before! It's because he's experiencing all this new stuff far away. 

* People change and that's alright. 

He made new friends in LA and his lifestyle changed, and I started a new internship where I was meeting a bunch of people as well. I think I just always held in my mind that he's still the same person he was when he left, and when we hung out every single day when that wasn't the case for either of us. 

* When you try and communicate about what you want without it going anywhere... it's not always best to just ""wait until we're together in person"". 

Sometimes if nothing gets resolved even after you've brought it up multiple times, if it's important to you, it's going to stay important to you. I posted about what happened on this subreddit once, and literally ALL the comments were telling me to break up with him. But I was still like no no, maybe if we speak about this in person, maybe if he sees me again, we'll go back to before when it was awesome! This was a terrible thought process for me because I just got extremely resentful towards him. 


* After you're together for a while, you learn more about them, or you learn more about yourself, about what you want and can give and vice versa. Sometimes this is a deal-breaker, and it's OK to have those! Standards are not bad. 

Since we only spent 8 months together before he left, it's possible we were still in the Honeymoon stage. I was deeply in love with him and had all the thoughts of ""wow it can't get better than this!"", ""wow I will never again meet someone like this"", ""he makes me so comfortable to be myself"". After he left though, I got more time to assess what I wanted (for example having my hand held in public, or given a kiss occasionally at a music event) and what he couldn't offer. It's the same on his side too, he wanted someone who wasn't super keen on being affectionate, and I realized that wasn't something I could do for him. 


* If you're searching on r/longdistance about breakups hoping to find one saying it's ok to break up, you're probably going to want to break up. 

Because most of the results I read said, ""talk to your SO, you can do it!"", I really took it to heart about not giving up. But I think personally, I took it too far. I talked to him, and when that didn't work, I still held on to the whole don't give up part, which I shouldn't have done. I ended up breaking up with him during exams, just because the pressure got so much and I knew I was in a bad relationship. I had been in it unhappily since February, but nothing could be done. In my case, our relationship couldn't be mended because our priorities just didn't match and no amount of talking could convince us otherwise. It was a very civil breakup though, and he's still my friend and I talk to him daily; I harbor no bad feelings towards him. 

* You're not abandoning the relationship/giving up. 

I gave it my all in talking to him about what was making me unhappy, what we could do together to fix it, etc. It didn't end up helping, but oh well! Just like I have a list of what I want in a relationship, he has one too, and that's totally fine to not change. It's not abandoning something if you've tried super hard to make it better, but it just won't. 

* You can be happy again. 

Whether it's someone nearby that you meet in person, or someone who's far from you. Life continues. For me, I had clearly left a relationship I wasn't happy in, and as soon as it was done and I told him I couldn't be with him anymore, i felt **so much lighter**. I did extremely well on my exams and landed an awesome new internship! There's been bad times of course, like recently when I scrolled through my phone pictures and found one of him with my stuffed animals, but there's so much good too. I've met someone (on Tinder no less), who is also quite awesome and is much closer to my desired SO in personality. But I would never have known what I wanted had I not been with my ex. And this will continue to change and change and change. 

~~~

I'm sure that was super repetitive at parts, but this is what I wish I could have read when I searched in this sub for breakup advice. I posted an ""Advice Needed"" post on a throwaway, but thanks all for responding to that. You probably don't know what post I'm referring to, but it really really helped me in realizing I deserve to be in a happy relationship - regardless of distance. 

Best of luck everyone!"
3bd2ec,43,2015-06-27,Don't Obsesses About It,[deleted],AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/3bd2ec/dont_obsesses_about_it/,"I've realized how destructive it is to have constant negative thoughts swirling in your head all the time. It's really bad for your mental health, and this negativity impacts every aspect of your life.

While it is extremely important to realize that us Asians are living in a world where we're fighting an uphill battle due to the system, it's still extremely important to have positive thoughts. 

I'm concerned for some brothers in here who take this ""we are oppressed!"" mentality way too far. I don't want to see fellow Asian males live depressed and constantly angry. Yes, there are elements of culture and society out there that inconvenience our lives in many ways. HOWEVER, you can't let negative thoughts and feelings of anger and hopelessness corrode your mind and soul.

As bad as things are, in reality, it's not AS bad as we think everything is. There are many horrible things in the world out there, and EVERY single race has their own unique share of problems. Don't think that the disadvantageous situation is is the END OF THE WORLD. Cause it's FAR from it. Some of the posts on this subreddit exaggerate our problems to a certain extent. Some of these posts make an unnecessarily big deal about things that HONESTLY aren't that bad. 

Yes we will deal with racism, an unfair dating market in the anglosphere due to a skewed media representation of us, and problems with the bamboo ceiling.

HOWEVER. IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. There are people facing extremely horrible problems such as poverty, war, etc. that are FAR worse than the problems we have. I'm not discounting our problems AT ALL. They are serious issues that have to be tackled. Yet if some Asian male clouds his thoughts with negativity, thinking that his WHOLE life is fucked up because of this relatively stupid aspect of life, then THAT's a problem. 

I have a white friend who is tall, charismatic, and who girls say is good looking. He has many things going for him, yet he ALWAYS complains and gripes to me about how he's angry about black males having sex with white women, and that it hurts his chances of getting with more girls. He's constantly bitter about things, and blames a lot of things on his RACE believe it or not! He got rejected from an internship and complained to me that he suspected that it's cause he's WHITE. I read over his resume and cover letter and realized that it was horribly formatted and filled with mistakes. 

What I'm trying to illustrate is that some people can let bitterness (especially towards racial issues) engulf them and lead to a much lower quality of life. You think white guys have it easy? You think only us Asian guys have it that bad? The reality is much different from our perception. Think about how bitter Social Justice Warriors are all the time. Think about how bitter White Nationalists are all the time. Think about how bitter people who think of life through a racial angle are all the time.

It's definitely important to be in tune with reality and how the world really works. However, DON'T LET BITTERNESS ENGULF YOU. There's a quote: ""The best revenge is success."" LIVE A GOOD AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE. You can't live a good and successful life being bitter all the time.

**DO** support your fellow Asian brothers.
**DO** work hard in your life to help our cause in any capacity
**DO** realize the reality of the system
**DO** stand up for yourself and live a happy and successful life
~~
**DON'T** be obsessed about 'how oppressed you are' 
**DON'T** let negativity ruin the quality of your life
**DON'T** think that issues facing Asian American males are the 'end of the world' cause it's FAAAR from it. 

The world is our oyster Asian man. The 21st century is the Asian century. Our race is the most numerous race in the world. We have economic power and rising soft power. Most importantly, we have ""home bases"" in that of our mother countries in Asia that are well-developed and filled to the brim with opportunities. The 'whites' that some of you hate so much don't really have this unique opportunity that so many of us have. 

I'm optimistic about the future. Asians Americans for the most part are just starting out in America. We're JUST starting to establish ourselves in business, media, government, etc. Along with the rising wealth, development, and power in our mother countries as well as the growing power the Asian American community will have, the future will definitely not be as bad as the present. 

LIVE A HAPPY LIFE. DON'T THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THINGS AND TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY.

I kinda let it slip that a few companies reach out to schedule interview for full time position during my company happy hour. The CTO is pressuring me to stay with company when I graduate. How can I deal with this situation to avoid possible hostile environment for rest of my internship. 
3bd58e,3,2015-06-27,What am i doing wrong in looking for a job?,doughyes,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3bd58e/what_am_i_doing_wrong_in_looking_for_a_job/,"I'm sitting here on a Saturday night filling out job applications instead of going out with friends. I'll be doing that tomorrow...and everyday next week too.

I'm waiting for the rejection email to come on monday, letting me know that the media finance job I interviewed for last Thursday went to another candidate, after the recruiter informed me I would be getting a decision the same day/Friday and after confirming salary range, start date, and work authorization, and even taking me on tour of the office  and where I would be sitting. Radio silence on Friday after I sent an email asking for updates; I know the recruiter opened the email but didn't respond from email-tracking software.

This is the 6th rejection after a final round interview in the past month alone. I recently stopped freelancing, and am living off my savings now. I'll be okay for another 2 months, but with all of my freelance work dropped, I don't have anything once my savings run out. I don't have parents I can rely on for help, or any relatives/friends willing to help me financially.

About me: I dropped out of a top-10 ivy undergrad 2 years ago because I couldn't pay tuition for my last semester. I paid for my entire degree to date through freelance work/internships/workstudy and have a 3.7 GPA. My SAT scores are 2300+. I have only 12 credits left, which I plan to finish in 2015-2016 through transfer and research credits from a public school.

My parents are food service workers with no college education, and I'm estranged from them (due to me wanting to go to a school beyond what they could afford).  I took up freelance work to pay for my remaining credits, and also stay in my current city(so I could land a full-time job soon). My degree is in comp sci and econ, and I  have substantial internship experience in accounting,web design+dev, and account management (1.5-3 years for each field). I started freelancing full-time a year ago to make more money for school, but I hated it--I never felt that I belonged to the company culture at any particular client and was working 80 hour weeks regularly to keep up with client demands. I let go of all of my clients a month ago, letting them know I was going to transition into a full time job elsewhere (a mistake in retrospect).

I've interviewed at mostly large digital agencies/media companies and the biggest tech offices on the East Coast(Google, Microsoft, NBC, Etsy,etc.) for entry-level tech, consulting, and finance roles (0-1 year experience). I send thoughtful thank you emails an hour after each interview, and check if my interviewers opened the emails. I even research the Linkedin profiles of the job I interviewed for--almost all are filled by people with less experience and lower academic credentials.  I've always made it to the final round interview, being told I was the top candidate, only to be rejected a few days later. I went into this latest interview expecting the same thing, but the salary and start date chat, along with the hiring managers being OK with my soon-to-be-complete degree, got my hopes up against my better judgement. 

I feel really tired and I want to give up. I lost touch with a lot of my friends from school who have graduated and now have the jobs in tech and finance I thought I would have in 4-5 years ago. I've been sleeping 10-12 hours a day, only getting out of the house for interviews. I keep thinking about how much time I wasted daydreaming about working at all of the places I was rejected from. Most of all, I regret spending tens of thousands of dollars for a degree that hasn't gotten me where I wanted, when I could have gone to a public school, graduated on time, and at least be employed full-time somewhere by now. I don't have a bf, or any close friends because I've been so busy working and worrying about my near future.

What am I doing wrong? Is it my gender (f), ethnicity(Asian), lack of complete degree? Am I too ugly for the jobs I'm applying for? Do I come across as too poor and desperate, and not a good ""cultural fit""? Am I not interesting enough (because I spent all my time working to make ends meet so I couldn't spend time on vogue hobbies like travel)?

And what can I do better? Take the GRE/GMAT? Take more programming/finance classes? Lose weight? Dress better?

Sorry for the long post, I had a lot more to vent about than I thought. Any advice appreciated.

Hugs,

3bdgfn,2,2015-06-28,How can I communicate that I feel as though a coworker is not the best fit for the job?,jobnewby,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3bdgfn/how_can_i_communicate_that_i_feel_as_though_a/,"At my office, we are hiring a person for a high-level management role that would supervise &amp; work with myself + a few other team members of mine.

My boss has narrowed down the candidate pool to 5 people, and at this point I'm being included in the job interviews.

After the interviews, I am supposed to fill out a form rating &amp; commenting on each candidate- on things like how well I'd feel they'd fit in with the team, how experienced they are, etc.

We've got some really strong candidates, but one of them is a coworker of mine, who I strongly feel is not the best fit for this role.

His biggest ""pro"" would be that he has worked closely with our company for the last 2 years, and we fill a very specific niche within our industry. Most people that start here spend a good bit of time learning everything about us, our industry, our competitors, clients, etc. So I can see why my superiors are considering him. Plus, he is a good fit ""culturally"", and on very good terms with the majority of our employees (which is important to a young startup).

However, he is extremely unprofessional. I'm trying to leave my personal dislike for him out of this, but over the last 2 years I've worked with him, he's done and said some pretty shitty things, such as:

1. Come to work high, and then act super out of it and giggly and weird. He has done this more than once.
2. He once hired a female intern who was extremely pretty, and wore very revealing clothes to work (shorts, and tops that showed off a good bit of cleavage). A month after she had left, her name briefly came up in conversation, and he overheard, and said ""YEAH! I HIRED HER. YOU'RE WELCOME."" .....He was talking about her looks, not her skills or anything she had done for the company. He has made a few other sexist comments like this before. Nothing too horrendous, but sometimes it didn't sit right with me. (ie; calling women in general 'catty' and being 100% seroius about not wanting to have more women on our team :( )
3. He is disorganized and has piss-poor time management skills. In the past, there have been so many times that he waited until the last minute on projects, and then put things on my plate and expected me to stay til 6/7/8pm to get things done...
4. He's kind of a dick when he has to work under pressure. Especially as my superior, there have been times where he has been unjustifiably douchey. Combine this with his poor time management skills and lack of planning, and it's just super shitty to have to work on projects with him.

So, knowing all this, I feel like he's not really the best fit for this position that would include managing and supervising the majority of my team.

My question is: How can I (diplomatically) state this on the form when I fill it out? I'm going to leave out the parts where he's come to work high and said sexist things multiple times in the past. But is it okay to just be honest?

I don't like throwing my team mates under the bus, even if they are sexist douchebags. In situations where he's fucked up because of his piss poor management skills, I'd step up and take the blame. I've even gone to my boss to ask how to make things better and also to ask how I can better keep track of our timelines on these projects that he puts on my plate at the last minute. Thankfully, my boss is smart and awesome and realized pretty quickly that this guy was putting me in a lot of tough positions. *But I shouldn't have even had to do that, if this guy actually was management material.*

Sorry that this was so long and rant-y. I just feel like I've gotten to know this guy really well over the last 2 years (unfortunately) and, putting my personal dislike aside, I really do feel as though he is not the best fit for the job, especially compared to the other candidates.

It's frustrating though because I feel like this guy gets away with murder sometimes, just because he's charismatic and also very funny.

I want to be honest, because my input on each candidate will factor into their final decision. At the same time, I want to stay professional and diplomatic, and try to leave my emotion and personal bias out of it.

Any thoughts, ideas, or stories would be much appreciated."
3bdlvm,7,2015-06-28,I'm [22 F] not sure if my friend of 12 years [22 F] is a good friend,noxmi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bdlvm/im_22_f_not_sure_if_my_friend_of_12_years_22_f_is/,"I have been friends with Kim since I was in the 5th grade. We are in our senior year of college and been friends for 12 years. I'm not sure if our relationship is a good one.

Kim definitely came from a dysfunctional family. Her dad left the family when she was in middle school. Her mom remarried. She didn't have a lot of money, in her family. During middle school, we would have sleepovers. My family would give her food and clothes.

In 9th grade, she was doing independent study. On the weekend, I would come visit her as much as I can. In 10th grade, she went to the same high school as me. I could tell she was getting depressed and told her to look up the symptoms of depression and get help. One day, her mom texted me that Kim was in the hospital because she tried to overdose on pills. After that, I tried to support Kim as much as I could. I would hang out with her, even if we didn't talk while hanging out.

Through 12th grade, she went through therapy and medication. Her family was a main reason of her depression. They didn't understand why she got depressed and blamed her. We went to community college together and took classes together. Sometimes I would get her cakes or little random things.

 In our 2nd year of college, she met her 3rd boyfriend Andy. Soon, they became close enough that they ended up moving in together. Kim told me that her boyfriend didn't think I was a good friend because I was blunt. One time, we got into an argument because she said that no one wanted to pick her up and her boyfriend alway picks her up. I told her he's your boyfriend, so he's required to do that. Recently, we got into an argument about girl's movie night. She said I didn't like her boyfriend and accused me that was why I didn't want him at movie night.

Kim follows me on tumblr and I asked her what she thought about me. She listed me as very quiet person, introverted, finicky, gossips, judgmental, and a very dry sense of humor. I was blown away by what she said. That was how she thought of me?

They also don't like my current boyfriend. They were hoping that we would break up with each other so they could set me up with a friend. I transferred over to a school that's 6 hours away from our home. We didn't talk as much because it was hard to keep in touch.

On my birthday this year, I received an email that I didn't get the internship I wanted. I told her that I cried about it and was upset. She told me that sucks and went on to talk about how Andy is going through a process of interviews for a job... I was kind of annoyed because I didn't think she was being considerate. I told her how I was tired of doing things for people who didn't care. She told me that Andy is always the friend who initiates things. I'm just sick of her always talking about Andy.

Recently, she was diagnosed with bipolar depression. She told me she doesn't like to initiate conversations and she's been feeling down. I texted her and visited her with one of our other friends. I told her I was going to deactivate my facebook because I've been feeling down about or friends. I told her that I don't know if our friendship is going to last because our lives are so different now.  She said that's fine and she enjoys talking to me, even though we're not as close as before. Kim said she was sorry if she doesn't respond. I told her that I'm here for her and it's ok.

Today, I was hanging out with a group of friends. One friend Brandy said that Kim texted her that she was coming to the event but 15 minutes later said she couldn't make it. Kim had texted Brandy that she and Andy were thinking of getting a dog. I just thought to myself that hurts...

**tl;dr**: I have been friends with Kim for 12 years. She's had a troubled life, but I have always been there for her. Recently, we're not as close. I'm not sure if I should break the friendship off."

I am your normal guy you could say, working on my resume for medical school and pushing myself every inch closer to get my credits and extra curricular activities for improving my chances into become my dream job, an anesthesiologist, I know weird but not the point of this post. My friend who was in wilderness with me got sent to a boarding school right after I was sent to boarding school which was called shortridge academy which thankfully I convinced my father to pull me out of it because of the drug and homosexual abuse that was present there after 2 months of being there and made to feel that you were sick and fucked up. My past involved weed and smoking and selling it but it never was to the point of severity i would consider unhealthy for myself or others around me, just me doing it because I felt the need to protect my future because my father left me and my mother and sister for a younger women had a kid and is unwilling to provide me with any education other than the therapy he bought for me... Anyways My friend just finished High School at Carlbrook academy which I first off was very happy to realize by the fact it was June and he finally accepted my friend request on facebook last night. I do not approve of sending him there but this is what really ticks me off about his situation, he was sent to wilderness because he got one c on his report card and he went out on weekends to drink and smoke weed with his friends and he was sent there and to Carlbrook because of that one C and his brainwashed parents. The issue of this which it really hurts me is that the school did let him on the computer to go onto facebook which I originally thought it was him alone finally back at home where he deserves to be after a year being in these useless programs which you learn nothing but to think of yourself as dirt and have low moral but this is where it pushed me over the edge, I kept on typing to him about asking him if he was happy he was finally out and he said he wasnt... Then he said he has to be there for another year. ONE WHOLE YEAR of this newly 18 year old's life being wasted after he did what his parents wanted which was graduate high school in their suited environment and he played by their rules and the schools. His birthday was June 23 and yes you could argue he could just sign out but what would he have, the cloths on his back and a broken and emotionally damaged brain from being at this program for an entire year at which first he was told was only going to be four weeks. No it gets worse, the year is spent preparing him for college. You might say oh well this is good and I might agree its good to take a gap year, go on a trip, discover a passion, learn to speak another language but he is stuck in the brick and mortar of his child prison called CarlBrook until ANOTHER YEAR has ended and he is free from wasting his life and destroying his emotions from this place. Back to my life after I left Shortridge I gained my current girlfriend who I have been with for almost 7 months now who I adore and love to death, I graduated highschool with flying colors which before my motivation was driven towards making short term profit off weed was now investing in knowledge and my education to better myself and my family for the future, taking courses at my local community college and loving every second of it, finished an internship at my local pharmacy and now I am a nursing assistant at my local hospital which gives meaning to my life knowing I help people every day feel better mentally and physically about themselves and my life is on the up and up. You could say wilderness taught me a lesson, dont take the easy way out or do it right or dont do it at all which is true for the most part but I found all I really desired and needed to be sucessful is by having a better and understanding relationship with my father which I do now and I fully understand why he acted the way he did before and now we are fully understanding of each other. The cost of being mentally and emotionally tortured being told I was fucked up there is no way out and that I was basically a slave to the will of the advisors of the treatment staff gave me a mentality that everyone is out to get me and hurt me which is untrue but scares me to death that I know that people like my friend are still suffering in places like this while their parents write checks instead of writing letters to emotionally ""heal"" their child. The ironic part of this all is that his mother is a child and family therapist and cannot even handle her own family yet gives advice to others about how to heal their own making more flawed and broken people because of misinformation. The main reason I posted this is because after looking for hours upon hours I have found his mothers email address and phone number and thought I could talk to her about my experience and give her resources to show her how messed up this form of therapy is while not criticizing her parenting and showing how much she fucked up. I need help and I don't want to make his situation worse but it kills me inside knowing that he is still in there and he has no other choice but to play their game. I know this was a rant but I really care about my group from wilderness, I made sure each one of them is emotionally stable and happy with their lives and with the two people who are now also free with me they are finally happy being done with these programs and can actually thrive in life rather than just surviving the next onslaught of painful weeks and months to come. 

To Long to Read? - My friend is done with high school at Carlbrook academy but his mother and father want him to stay another year to prepare for college and I know that emotionally he probably wants to kill himself because he was already starting to act like that when I last saw him.

Also If anyone has questions about my experience in these programs and how I got out feel free to inbox me or if you guys really want I could do an AMA because I am very open about this subject because I find that not enough people know how mentally and physically harming it can be to teens who have gone through these programs. Thank you again for reading and Have a nice day!"
3beekv,5,2015-06-28,The Bully of the Church,pastorthrowitaway,apologizeplease,https://www.reddit.com/r/apologizeplease/comments/3beekv/the_bully_of_the_church/,"I came in as your ministerial intern, at your request.

You loved my creativity, my self-assuredness, my compassion, my cheerfulness, my intelligence. 

I arrived, and you - the president of the congregation - helped me get moved in. And then I started work, and you took off for a month.

And when I started doing what was required - preparing services, proposing an outreach program to the board (at your request), making friends - including the senior minister, you began to bully me and target me via email and triangulation.

Two weeks into my year here at this congregation, you had COMPLETELY undermined me. You instantly put me on the defensive, and the cowards on the board - who had already been bullied into submission by you - never called you on it; instead, they believed you and not me.

And when the senior minister dared to stand up for me, you bullied him. And when he stood up for himself, you threw a hissy, quit the board, and made sure the new president did your bidding. Yes - you made sure she put you on the finance committee, and the fellowship committee, and the nominating committee - you're not the president anymore, but you sure do hold the power, don't you.

You know it's true - you managed to make the family who bothered you resign their memberships. You managed to turn away the music director who could have made a difference (who's now working at another church that is growing). There is a list of people I've spoken to in town who would come back if you were gone. 

Now, as I'm heading into my last month in this hell of a congregation, you decide that the gift made to ensure I could get here early is money owed and you're suggesting - illegally - that you withhold my pay for July. And despite all of the law around it, you will not let up and are SURE I'm stealing from this congregation. 

And the chicken shit board won't listen to the other side. (Except for one - who feels like the lone voice of reason there.)

You are about to lose the voice of reason on the board - the one person, by the way, who holds together much of the activity of this place. You are also about to lose the senior minister, because there is no way, he says, he can continue to be associated with people who would pull such underhanded awfulness.

And your reputation in our denomination is shot. Think ministers don't talk? Hah. No one will come here after they hear how you treated me and our senior minister. You think the denomination doesn't do much for you now? Wait until you have been blacklisted for being so horrible. 

You want your little social club? You got it. You, Madame, have managed to bully away EVERY SINGLE PERSON who doesn't fit into your narcissistic picture of perfection. 

It'll be you and five sycophants by the end of the year.

Hope you enjoy it. 

And yes, you owe me - and the senior minister - and the board member - and the congregation - a HUGE apology. You won't give it, because you are so dead fucking certain you're doing the right thing. But you owe them real contrition.

Our religion is love - but you don't practice it, and you've convinced others here not to practice it. I can't be a minister in a place that doesn't practice my religion.

We don't talk a lot but sometimes we do and we would joke around a bit but lately he keeps calling me cripple and making fun of how I walk. I'm currently disabled from an injury and so it's hard for me to walk normally and I have a huge brace that I'm extremely self conscious about. I usually wouldn't care if it was a close friend or a family member but it's really starting to get to me and I don't want to make a big deal out of noting, so what would you guys do? I am already uncomfortable being the only girl and being disabled on top of that makes it harder I guess. I can usually take jokes but I really hate being called a cripple, it's really hurtful and unnecessary. has anyone dealt with asshole coworkers like this? what did you do?

edit: this is my first internship and I don't want to mess it up either. 

edit 2: Thank you everyone for the good advice. I guess I already had a feeling of what I had to do before I made the post, just needed some encouragement I guess..will post an update later"

And I'm doing an internship in the summer for a bitcoin business, and they want me and my brother to make a game for them.

Although they said it either needs to be HTML5, or if we can get it working really well, we can use XNA.

However, it NEEDS to run on iOS, Android and web. So would we be best learning HTML5, or are there ways of putting XNA games on to other platforms? And if so, is it a clean process, or does it involve lots of tweaking and experience?

(We have about 4 weeks until the internship starts, and as it is a learning experience we are allowed to use a week or two to learn HTML5 if we need).

Thank you :)"
3beie6,2,2015-06-28,"Marketing agency for new startups? - feedback wanted from founders, sales guys, web designers",jsherloc,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3beie6/marketing_agency_for_new_startups_feedback_wanted/,"Recently I've been using AngelList to check out different start up job opportunities involving digital marketing and I've had positive networking experiences using AngelList. However browsing through the site daily and talking to others using the site who have discussed their experiences I think I've noticed a lot of opportunities to grow these newer startups and potentially build a business out of growing these newer startups.

I want to get a discussion going to see if others agree there is a real opportunity here. This is a serious wall of text so hopefully some folks are bored enough on a Sunday to read through it. I'm just putting down some basic thoughts/observations I've had on this topic as I've been browsing AL and speaking to founders on there recently. I know /r/startups always has great feedback and discussions on stuff like this. I'm kind of rambling/thinking out loud on this stuff hoping for a good discussion. 

I'm aware that there are already lots of ""marketing agencies for startups"" and lots of ""startup accelerators"" popping up every month, so I'm trying to discuss different unique approaches and solutions that might work well for new startups.

Thoughts:

* A marketing agency that targets new startups with little money but they have **SOME** money that they want use to grow NOW.

* Eventually may accept equity only with certain projects - we build organic and/or paid traffic ""exposure engines/leadgen platforms"" for equity or even CPL rather than payment upfront/leadgen), 

* Target startups looking to hire contract/fulltime marketing position on angellist. proposition is solid because they are going to have to pay fulltime/contract around ~20k at least right? 

* Some startups advertising what seem to be paid salary positions and paid contract positions, but if/when actually speaking to founders they don't currently have any money to spend on marketing. i'm aware you can sort by ""funding options"" but that seems to eliminate 90% of startups, so is that 90% of startups really have zero money to spend on marketing? yet they're all over AL advertising for positions? some founders i've spoken to wanted to setup commission/affiliate platforms/lead generation because of the lack of funds.

* Seems like some startups advertising writing/content marketing-related positions with good salaries, but then I read further into details and looks like a lot of startups are just looking to pay freelance writers on a per project/per article basis. I don't see how paying a writer on a per article basis would equate to the salary numbers being advertised? 

* Seems like so many startups are trying to get months of free work by going the internship route too. College Interns accepting this kind of arrangement probably pretty inexperienced = wasted time on communicating marketing tasks that drive targeted traffic/revenue = wasted money. when what these startups need is traction/traffic/new active users/sales/app store downloads/revenue NOW. just posting on social media and doing some data entry is not going to initiate the kind of growth some founders seem to expect?

* Startups are likely going to be WAY easier to get in touch with and stay in touch with consistently versus Joe from Joe Doe's Auto Repair. 

* questions - thousands of startups, how many can spend 5,000-15,000 right now? 5,000 on a launchpad package? 5,000-10,000 launchpad package? If you're a founder with a marketing budget, initial funding, what amount can you spend on marketing/growth?

* What if a marketing package covers 3 months/90days. This avoids a lot of ""contract anxiety"" and allows us to see if we are a good fit/how much we can actually help this startup. win win for startup, costs WAY less than trying to hire someone when launching, we are results-based and don't need handholding like interns. at the very least i feel there is no way a startup would not get value out of that kind of pricepoint, account setups and targeted traffic. we can't make sale for them or make their startup idea work necessarily. 

* make services = product packages. also offer custom solutions.

* need to figure out if something like this would work? i know startup accelerators a lot have in-house marketing/biz dev guys that assist their portfolios of startups. i feel like these accelerators are growing in number but still can only service a certain percentage of startups. 

* would the much larger volume of clients we can potentially attract/handle at initial lower price-point ""launch"" package (5,000-10,000) be more profitable than going after only a few bigger deals from the marketing agency perspective? 

* I feel like there is a lot of opportunity when these startups receive some initial traction, investments, funding and need to grow, but can't afford to get someone talented fulltime, or they don't really know what to do, try doing things themselves with mixed results and a lot of time dedicated?

* I've noticed a lot of products services are coming out to kind of bridge the gap between agency and cheaper DIY marketing for startups, pressfriendly comes to mind. Would a ""lean"" marketing agency potentially deliver more exposure/targeted traffic/sales over a few months than using some of these various ""cheaper than using an agency"" PR services targeted at startups?

* There are 2673 startups on AL looking for marketing positions right now. Of these, how many have $5,000+ marketing budget and need to grow today?

If you're a new founder I would love to hear your thoughts on how you're handling your digital marketing or how you plan on handling it. Experiences with using free interns, hiring marketing/sales/web development using AL? How much money will be devoted to marketing? Better to hire and train someone in-house in most cases? How much money do agencies want minimum from startups these days?

If you're a business development/sales person or a web designer that would be interested in discussing this more in a chat and potentially forming a partnership, skype, slack etc let me know too. I think the right small team comprised of a marketer, sales, and web designer could really fill a huge need here and become very profitable, so I'm curious to read relevant/related experiences."

I met my SO this January as a coworker at our coffee shop and we hit it off really well. When she couldn't work our shift any more due to a internship we continued to hang out outside of work and began dating in early april. Every thing was moving at a great pace until the summer came around and I had to go back home. We agreed to not make it official and play it by ear, out of fear the distance would be too challenging, but agreed to remain faithful to each other and text/skype often. 

This went well for the first month or so until, in the last couple of weeks, it felt as if we were moving too quickly. It seemed our emotional intimacy (telling each other secrets of our pasts, insecurities, and pledging our deep support of one another) was far ahead of our physical intimacy, due to the fact we couldn't hang out, study together, go on dates, cook together, and generally have experiences together as we could before.

This began to concern me, considering we still aren't labeling each other BF and GF, so I brought this up to her. I didn't phrase it well and it lead to a little bit of a panicky, emotional discussion. Later she texted me that she agrees she was taking it too quickly (even though I am as much at fault) and agreed to slow it down a bit. She stated she really cared about me (as I do for her!) and didn't want to risk pushing me too quickly.  

This seemed fine until now, for the last couple of days, she doesn't seem herself over texts. She is not responding very quickly, won't say *anything* intimate, and when I complimented her on a snap and said ""I wish I was there babe :)"", she just responded with ""Thanks :)"" instead of our usual flirting.

I don't want her to feel like she can't say *anything* intimate and definitely don't want her overanalyzing every message to me :/ I just don't know how to bring this up to her since I was the one who asked her if we could slow down a little. 

I'm visiting her for the first time since school ended next week and want to get this all straightened out before then. Perhaps a call or Skype? Or just continue to build up her confidence? Thanks guys!! :)"

I actually relocated to be in a better job market but still cannot find work and it's very frustrating.  My work history is as an Executive Assistant, and it seems that people just don't value work history with the position as much as they do youth.  

While I've been out of work, I've been doing Javascript and jQuery tutorials online and brushing up on my HTML and CSS.

I have a friend who will let me live with her for a few months while I work on small projects for a portfolio and thereby build more and more skills.

Is it reasonable to think that this is a viable way to pivot my career?

3bf0me,3,2015-06-28,"Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [19 M] 4 months, how/should we break-up",collegeflings,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bf0me/me_19_f_with_my_boyfriend_19_m_4_months_howshould/,"So my boyfriend and I have been going out for about 4 months, let's call him Alex. About three weeks into our relationship, we had sex with each other–it was our first time. Our relationship was pretty physical.

Alex and I lived in the same dorm, which is how we met. We constantly saw each other, slept together, and were basically best of friends as well. We did homework together–even though I was a bit ahead in terms of the classes I took. What he was currently taking, I would have already taken the quarter before. So I would find myself helping him out a lot–going actually really far to help him out despite having a very full workload myself. I remember always feeling emotionally unsatisfied throughout last quarter, because I felt like what I put into the relationship, I would never get back. He never said things like ""I love you"", or even give me gifts. He would only buy me food and spend a lot of time with me–though that might be because he didn't have many other people to spend his time with. I felt like I was putting a lot of effort in (giving him gifts, helping him out as much as possible, sexual favors), and that just wasn't reciprocated. 

Anyway, I let that go as we entered summer break. Currently, due to my internship, we live six minutes apart by drive. He can't drive due to medical reasons though, so his mom has to drive him to places. Lo and behold, his mom suddenly decides that she doesn't want him dating me anymore (he's Korean, I'm not. boo interracial relationships). So he starts dating me in secret, but he has little to no way of communicating with me–he spends almost all of his time with his family and gets very little alone time. Even texting is apparently hard, and calling/facetiming is out of the question. 

We were able to meet for the first time this summer yesterday. He was originally going to come to my apartment but his mom pulled a 180 and said we could only go to a restaurant and maybe walk around a little bit (she thinks we're just friends right now...). He tried fighting her on this, but she wouldn't budge. The date was weird. I felt awful during it and it felt wrong. He wouldn't even touch me. It felt like I was just hanging out with a friend, not a boyfriend. He wouldn't even hold my hand. But he said he couldn't wait till next Fall because sex basically. It kinda hit me there that he was just into the physical side of the relationship, and the fact that he was going to get help with his classes. I didn't feel loved.

I guess I want out. I've been trying to distance myself from him these past few days (not really replying to his texts). I feel bad though. Maybe he really does like me and care for me, and since this is his first relationship, he doesn't know how to properly explain it.

The worst part is that I'm going to be living in the same floor as him next year and that he's in my friend circle. =/ I don't know what I'm going to do.

I guess I need some reassurance that I should be breaking up with him. I also need to know how I should do it (phrasing, etc.) and it looks like the only option is text right now since he can't even call me. I also need some help figuring out how to deal with the fact that he's going to be living so close to me next year and also how to fight feeling bad because I feel like I'm abandoning him.

Sigh... thanks.

tl;dr My boyfriend just doesn't satisfy me emotionally and can't talk to me cause of his crazy mom. I want out cause I feel used. Don't know how to bring it up or how to deal with it next year because he's going to be living on the same floor as me."

The roommate told the guy he should come back - I don't know why - the roommate doesn't drink and knows my boyfriend and I are in a committed relationship.

We were just putting together details for a vacation abroad in August. He's never cheated on me before, or anyone else for that matter.
     
 
I don't know what to do. I'm just shocked at the moment and hurt. He's coming into town next weekend, so I know I have to figure out something, but I feel heavy and can't think. Does anyone have any advice? I know this happens to a lot of people all the time, but does anyone had a similar relationship where this has happened?

Hopefully someone can look over my current plans and help me feel like I've thought of everything reasonably.

**Goals:**

The purpose of this trip was to finally accomplish something on my own. I bought the plane tickets in December almost on a whim (I even bought the departure ticket before I could afford the return, just so I couldn't back out). My idea is that I wanted to get out and have an adventure of my own before I get caught up in internships, jobs, relationships, etc. That being said, my only *plans* are that I have a flight into Frankfurt on July 11th, a mountain I want to hike in Switzerland, and a flight out of Milan on July 30th. Other than that, I plan on going to wherever calls me while I'm there.

**Timeline/Travel:**

* Frankfurt, Germany (7/12 ~ 7/16): an old friend of mine will pick me up from the airport and house me for a few days to catch up
* Munich, Germany (7/17 ~ 7/19): another friend lives in the suburbs of Munich, and will house me for a few days there as well
* Freiburg/Schwarzwald, Germany (7/20 ~ 7/22): spend a day in the city (probably a hostel or CouchSurfing for sleep) and a day hiking the forest
* Bern, Switzerland (7/23 ~ 7/24): not sure where I'd stay here, but it's a good location to stop for a day and explore before my mountain hike - if anyone living here feels like hosting me, hit me up :D
* Gruben, Switzerland (7/25 ~ 7/28): *see Mountain Hike*
* Milan, Italy (7/29 ~ 7/30): From Gruben, I will somehow figure out a way to Milan before my 6:00 AM flight back home on the 30th. This part is a little nerve-wracking.... I think there's a combination of buses, trains, and lifts that will get me to Milan, but I haven't confirmed this yet. Here's what google tells me about getting there: http://docdro.id/14yij
* Back Home: hopefully I will return safely with a lot of stories to tell

**Mountain Hike:**

The mountain I'm planning to hike is [Barrhorn](http://www.summitpost.org/barrhorn/429662), and my plan is to follow the directions on that site (train from Bern to Kandersteg, train from Kandersteg to Visp, train from Visp to Turtmann, bus from Turtmann to Gruben). Once at Gruben, it's a relatively short hike to the [Turtmann Hut](http://www.turtmannhuette.ch/) where I'll stay the night, hike up and down the mountain the next day, and stay the night again on the way back down.

**Equipment:**

Here's another source of anxiety for me. I've looked a lot into ""what to bring"" and I think I have it down, but there are still a few details I'm missing (and I always will assume that I've forgotten to consider something). Here's a list of what I'm planning to bring so far:

* Backpack: [Deuter ""50+10"" Internal Frame](http://www.deuter.com/DE/en/lightweight/act-lite-50-plus-10-3340315-34.html)
* Daypack: I'm planning on buying this [20L Pack](http://amzn.com/B0092ECRLA) by Outlander for my hiking adventures
* Clothes: One pair of convertible hiking shorts/pants, one pair of athletic leggings, 6 pairs of Merino Wool Socks, 3 pairs of boxers + 3 pairs of briefs + 2 pairs of running briefs/tights, 1 long-sleeve + 3 short-sleeve shirts, one hoodie, [buff](http://www.buffusa.com/sports/collections/original-buff-reg/styles/original-buff-celtiknot)
* Money: I just signed up for a Charles Schwab Checking account, with unlimited world-wide atm fee refunds, so I'll bring that card and about €100 to start (this is a complete guess, please recommend a better value if applicable)
* Identification: Passport (obviously) and State Drivers License (do I need anything else?)
* Phone: Thanks to suggestions by /u/aubrill and /u/c_more, I'll be using my phone entirely with WiFi. I'll bring an external charging battery so I don't have to worry about wasting battery on music, and I've downloaded maps.me to use it as a GPS while offline.
* Paperback Book, just in case
* All my normal medications, glasses, contact stuff, sunglasses, watch, etc.

Well, if you've made it this far, I **commend and thank you** so much! I love this entire community, and I really hope to get some great advice or at least just reassurance... or perhaps a healthy dose of reality. Whatever advice or comments you have for me, please share! I will eagerly read and respond to everything I can.

This trip is incredibly exciting for me, and I really want to get the most out of it that I can, so I really appreciate the fact that I can come here for help and interaction!

**Edit1**: using my phone for more stuff

**Edit2**: give myself some more time to appreciate each stop"
3bfdbo,2,2015-06-28,SSI w/ permanent disability status+disabled dependent status...SNAP and insurance questions,DecentStudent237,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/3bfdbo/ssi_w_permanent_disability_statusdisabled/,"Hello all,

I have a complicated simple question!

I'm a university student in a private college. I recently moved into on-campus apartments due to an untenable home situation that was exacerbating chronic illness.

I'm classified disabled-dependent and use that dependent status to access my parents' health insurance - which pays for treatment for my chronic illness and keeps me in school. My parents are unable to assist with my apartment bills, but Vocational Rehabilitation Services is paying for the rent bill during the semester.

They don't pay for the electric bill, so I'm taking that out on loans.

My problem right now is food and living expenses. I'm using a PASS plan to pay $300/month to medical bills despite having two insurance plans covering me. My grocery bill (toiletries and medications included) is around $300/mo with about $120/mo of that being medication.

Being classified as disabled-dependent gives me about $500/mo to work with. My PASS plan is for temporary summer research internships. My PASS account is going to run out well before next summer and roll those expenses into my SSI account.

I've been told that if I have a disabled-independent classification (where I'm paying for food, rent, etc) that I may lose access to my parents' health insurance, which would make my $300/mo doctors' expenses and my $120/mo medication expenses balloon up.

But I'm looking at my PASS account depleting at a rate that tells me I need to apply for increased benefits - SNAP would go a long way toward helping me get my PASS account to last me until next summer, when I'll have a better research internship.


So. Uh. I need help navigating this. Any assistance?"
3bfewg,4,2015-06-28,Graduating early - what do?,brex2599,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3bfewg/graduating_early_what_do/,"Hi all, I will earn my undergraduate degree in accounting this December, and I am unsure what to do. I have two basic options:  

1. Do a winter internship from Jan 2016 to ~April 2016, then begin working on my MAcc full-time in fall 2016, completing it May 2017.
2. Begin working on my MAcc in January 2016 and do an internship in the summer of 2016, completing my MAcc December 2016.

The major pro of choosing option 1 is that I could choose any school I want for the MAcc program. If I chose option 2, I would probably have to stay at the same school I am attending now. I don't really mind the school that I am attending now, but it would be nice to have options. Also, a winter internship would allow me to get a better sense of busy season and make sweet overtime $$. Also, this might just be in my head, but it might be easier to get a winter internship since the supply for accountants is lower and the demand is higher.

The major pro of option 2 is that I would finish my master's degree with greater haste. I would probably enjoy doing a summer internship more than doing a winter internship (Less work, more time to get to know associates within the firm and get to be part of a larger starting class).

Obviously the choice between the two options I mentioned is highly subjective, but I would still appreciate opinions and justification for why you would choose a certain option. Also feel free to enlighten me with other ramifications that I may have failed to consider.

Thanks!"

I broke up with him several times but we always ended up back together within a few days. It's been about 6 months since our last break up but we did rekindle things for a few days here and there. If we were not rekindling things, then things were mostly very hostile between us. I recently stopped talking to him again, hopefully for good this time.

I always knew he wasn't the guy for me, but I wanted him anyway. Our relationship was troubled and borderline abusive but he had these certain qualities I've never seen in anyone else and I was really mesmerized by him. However, I could never truly be myself around him, for many reasons. I would say both of us were quite depressed during most of our time together, especially at the very beginning, when we met. 

I find myself compulsively looking at his social media sites everyday. I'm no longer in love with him, and I don't want to get back with him, ever. We caused each other a lot of pain and had a very volatile and somewhat violent relationship. My life has become a lot more peaceful and I no longer feel depressed, but I still can't let him go. I don't miss him or his company (because I never enjoyed talking to him very much) but I still don't feel like I've made peace with whatever happened. I've been told I'm ""rolling in the mud"" of our past whenever I talk to him, talk about him, or try to see what he's up to on the internet. 

Anyway, I am not super familiar with Buddhism but I studied it a bit in college classes. I realized recently that I am not so good at accepting when I've been wronged, or letting go, or forgiving. I have a tendency to be quite vengeful, although I rarely act on it. That's why I came to this subreddit, because I have tried to ask myself why I can't let go yet, when it was my choice to leave. I know I hold some resentment against him, and I want to let go of that. But I don't know how to forgive. I used to feel very very guilty about ending the relationship but I've been burned by him after our break up and I no longer feel such guilt. But I still hope he suffers. I get a sick kick (ego boost?) whenever he would tell me he misses me, or that no other girl has been like me etc. It's so vain of me to feel like that, and it made me crave more contact from him... for such an awful reason too, since I have not wanted to reconcile. I hate that I feel that way about a man I used to love.... 


I feel like romantically, I am over him. I have moved on with my life, have a good internship, become more emotionally stable, made some important educational decisions, and have dated a couple new guys (I was a big college dropout mess when I met him and I hadn't dated anyone before). But I wish that I could ""wish him the best"" and mean it. We were very love/hate during our relationship, but now that it is over I want to get off that rollercoaster. Usually when some sort of relationship ends, I can very easily let go and rarely think of them after a little while. But since he was my first boyfriend, it hasn't been as easy this time. 

How can I forgive someone? Do I need to forgive myself as well? Do I need to figure out why I am so resentful of him first, before I can forgive? Rationally, I know why it didn't work out but I'm still stuck here rolling in the mud.... 6 months later.

3bfv8p,1,2015-06-28,[Non-Romantic] How to navigate a tricky situation with my ex and visitation with our daughter.,throwaway-poptart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bfv8p/nonromantic_how_to_navigate_a_tricky_situation/,"Main people involved:

Myself (31 F)
My ex (39 F)
My daughter (9 F)

My ex is my daughter's father, who is now transgendered and identifies as female. This was a hard change for both my daughter and I to come to terms with, but we are all pretty much used to it now.

Since our breakup I have moved with my daughter to another country and very recently was married to a wonderful man my daughter adores.

I do not have any surviving family on my side, but my daughter left two notable family members behind in the states. Her other parent, and her paternal grandmother. She *loves* her grandma, so very much.

When I left I swore I would do everything in my power to ensure that they have plenty of time with her, I did my best to uphold that promise, and still do today.

I paid $120 a month in gas so they could drive out and see her every other week (they could have come every week but I couldn't afford to pay that much in gas) in the neighboring town we had moved to, I paid for them to go out to eat and see movies and go to the zoo with her too, bought tickets for them to attend her dance recital, the works.

My ex has not worked in many many years, though she did recently take up a low paying internship. The grandmother cannot work either, and is often on welfare or other benefits to stay afloat.

I knew the onus would be on me to keep everyone together when I left. Having no family myself, this is very important to me.

This brings me to my situation.

My daughter and I have moved to another country, I have recently married, and we are all scrambling to begin a new life. The costs of immigration are astronomical, and though my husband is blessed with a decent job, it's not enough to afford everything we would like right now.

We promised when we moved here that we would get my daughter to see them at least once a year. That time is nearing, and while we have been saving, it isn't enough to pay $8k in airfare, plus rental car, accommodation, food, etc.

We did the math and we just can't swing it right now while paying off immigration and medical bills.

We told grandma and my ex this and let them know that we could instead pay for them to fly here, it would be less airfare and I could lend them my car to get around. I would also provide food for them, though I let them know they would need to pay for eating out and going places.

They agreed and I got them all the information about how to apply for a passport, and let them know it takes a while so to get on it.

Later, during my reading, I found out some distressing news. If you have unpaid child support they will not issue you a passport. My ex has another daughter in another state who accumulated close to $20k of unpaid child support over the years. I brought this up with my ex who said it wasn't a problem, that she paid it off... Somehow, without a proper job.

I was happy to hear that as it had always been a dark cloud over our heads, but suddenly she is dragging her feet on getting a passport. When I asked her about it during her last weekly skype call, she said she hadn't done anything, that she thought that wasn't happening and I had said we were going to to states.

I reiterated that we could *not* afford to go to the states right now, and that they would need to come here, she said she understood, no problem.

During our next weekly skype with grandma, grandma then asks me what I would do if my ex *couldn't* get a passport. Would I still be paying for grandma to come here alone?

Aaaand this is where I'm lost. I have no idea what the etiquette is for this sort of situation! What do I do if my ex cannot get a passport? I mean, visitation should primarily be about her and our daughter, right?

The way I see it we have only a few options:

1. We pay for grandma to come out here, put the airfare that would have been spent on ex into savings til we have enough to then go out to see her in the states. (Would take many more months of saving and would undoubtedly piss off the ex.)

2. We put all the money that would have been spent into savings and tell them they will both have to wait until we have saved enough to make a trip out. (Would no doubt piss *everyone* off.)

3. I have no idea.

How would you deal with this? How do you think the court would deal with this? We were never married, no one is on the birth certificate, and there are no custody or visitation orders. I have been doing my best to be fair, but I'm not sure what's right!

Thank you for reading, I appreciate it!

TL;DR Grandma wants to know if I will still pay to fly her out to see my daughter, even if my ex cannot get a passport to come as well. 

Edit: Do you think it would be damaging to ask a 9 year old what she wants to do? I try not to put this sort of pressure on her if I can avoid it."

3bfvpa,8,2015-06-28,I have a bucket load of questions for SCA :),Chmurka7,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3bfvpa/i_have_a_bucket_load_of_questions_for_sca/,"I have super sensitive skin and get huge hormonal pustules around my jawline. SCA has helped me sooo much over the past 5 months or so and I have a pretty solid routine. I still have a lot of questions however. Feel free to answer any that you might have some insight to. Thank you SCA :)

How does SCA feel about oatmeal for the face? I put some in a food processor and keep a jar of powdered oatmeal in the bathroom. Sometimes I mix it with my Cetaphil or sometimes I cleanse with it alone. I find it does well for my sensitive skin but then again I used to use lemons and baking soda to get rid of my 'blackheads' (sebaceous filaments). So I could very well be doing something very wrong. 

The same applies for Green Tea. I keep powdered green tea and occasionally mix it with Cetaphil as well. Is this okay or a big no?

I understand massaging and patting the skin is good for circulation and whatnot. Would vibrating the skin have similar or better results?
For example, if I bought a mini back massager and ran it across my face in the AM/PM. 

I have been wanting to add a vitamin C serum to my routine. I have heard, however, that the vitamin C doesn't last in a bottle and is useless within a few days (not actually sure how the science works or if this is true). I have been advised to make my own with Vitamin C crystals. I also have a container of vitamin C tablets, and would like to know if I crushed them and made a mask, would this be beneficial or not. 

I have been reading about at home micro needling. I read some previous discussion on here, some people rave about it being the best thing they ever tried. Others strongly advise against it. For 15$ on Amazon, it is very tempting to try. Have any of you guys tried it? How do you sanitize it? My mother just turned 40 and is not happy with her aging skin. I have been trying to suggest a good routine for her (ex. I ordered her some Vitamin C serum). Perhaps this would be a good for her? She works outside in the sun and used to tan all the time :( I am 22, would this be a good idea to start doing to prevent wrinkles or would it be sort of useless since I have not started to show signs of aging yet? Perhaps it would improve my complexion and help get rid of my acne scars? 

Speaking of scars, I have a long one across my eyebrow from stitches and eyebrow hair doesn't grow there. I have to trim my eyebrows a bit odd to make them even (luckily they are blonde and I have bangs so it goes mostly unnoticed). Still, is there anything I could do to my skin to help this? I also have two lines across my chin from stitches and a very prominent mark across my neck from stitches. Any advice for these scars?  

Lastly, I keep hearing that there is no correlation between what you eat and your skin, but this has to be false because there is a correlation between what you eat and your hormones. Hormones can affect your acne. When I eat peanut butter I break out like crazy and huge cysts on my face fill up (access Omegas perhaps?). I have also heard the people of Okinawa owe their amazing skin to a staple of sweet potato in their diet (large amounts of Beta Keratin?). When I was doing an internship in Tokyo, I couldn't help but be amazed at how great everyones skin looked, even the people who were smoking in the arcades. I am assuming it is a combination of good genes, healthy and active lifestyle, their skincare routines/makeup and of course the wonderful healthy foods. Skin is an organ so it seems right that a healthy diet and lifestyle would enhance it's appearance. However I have been eating healthy pretty much all my life (stopped eating meat at 6, loved raw vegetables as a kid and still eat them in abundance today). My skin still suffers despite this. Has anyone on here found foods or supplements that have really made a difference in their complexion? 


Sorry for the many questions and my ramblings. If anyone could answer some of these questions I would really appreciate it!!! 
Thanks so much :) 

Edit- Spelling and Grammar. I have a form of dyslexia, so sorry if there is any confusion while reading this! "
3bfw5e,0,2015-06-28,OK for me [25m] to ask for a promotion or raise?,Throwawayraisehunter,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bfw5e/ok_for_me_25m_to_ask_for_a_promotion_or_raise/,"Hello everyone.  I am using a throw away just in case any of my managers or coworkers are redditors too.  Anyway, I had a question about how I should approach asking for a raise.

I have been working as an entry level internal auditor 1 at my company, XYZ, for 2 years come September.  This is my first real job outside of internships and such out of college.  I accepted the job at around $45k per year.  Since then, I was given a 2% raise last fall.  The departments are only allowed to give a certain number of raises (the did not say how big each one was allowed to be), so I felt very fortunate.  

Recently though, I coincidentally discovered  through one of my audits (and out of curiosity), that I was hired very cheaply.  The data I saw was about the average low, medium, and high salaries for that position.  It showed that my salary was the lowest of the low on that low medium high scale.  Low = $45k Med = $62k and High = $71k.  I knew I was hired on the cheap because I just wanted a job, but I didnt know it was the lowest value for my position.  So coming up on my 2 year anniversary, I think that I deserve a raise to the Med pay level or a promotion.  I work some weekends to keep up with work and have also started studying for the CPA Exam which comes in 2 weeks.  I feel like my coworkers enjoy working with me and that I have improved my productivity, skills, and knowledge enough to warrant my request.  However, sometimes I feel that I am not as productive or as skilled as I need to be to meet some expectations.  

I am wondering if it is reasonable for me to ask for a raise from the low of $45k to the med of $62k if not a promotion to the next level (internal auditor 2).  If it is reasonable, how should I go about asking for it?  Thank you all for your help and I'll try to contribute more to this and other subreddits on my main account.

Database Administration &amp; Development

Network Design &amp; Administration

All of these areas of interest are offered at the local community college (CC), which I would prefer to attend for financial reasons, but I really don't want to waste anymore time or money if it's going to end up being another useless degree collecting dust on the wall.

I personally learn how to use an Arduino board, I play with a Rasberry but nothing else. I don't know if I have to start a personal project in this subject or pure learning.

&amp;nbsp;

My questions are :


- What have I to learn to join (in an internship) the firmware team and do you have any advice ?
- Can I learn, without being in an engineering school, topics like :

    * Using national instrument testing software (LabView, TestStand, VeriStand).
    * Designing and developing complex power electronics control systems including AC-DC and DC-DC converter topologies.
    * CAN system
    * Automotive ECU
    * Using FPGA/CPLD device
    * ...

&amp;nbsp;

Basically : Do you have more programer than engineer profile in your team ?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance !"

3bg4ls,2,2015-06-28,Numbness,Fapony,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3bg4ls/numbness/,"I started nofap because of PIED, for more information on that here is a link to my first post: [ED Since 17 Now 20](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3ajae4/ed_since_17_now_20/), but now I want to cure the fogginess in my head.

For at least half a decade nothing has really excited me. I feel so numb to everything and haven't had a good cry since I was like 11ish (and believe me I have tried). I am a generally reserved person and have had anxiety for a long time; I'm constantly over-analyzing everything and my hands are always sweaty. I'm trying to work on this by trying new things that are outside of my comfort zone, one of them being making an account on reddit and posting (I have been a lurker for quite a few years). 

However, a lot of these things would get me in trouble at home, as my mom (dad isn't in the picture) is very religious and might kick me out depending on the severity of said action. This makes me paranoid which doesn't really help with the over-analyzing/anxiety. With that being said I am a person who thinks highly of themselves (I don't think less of others, I used to but luckily I've grown out of that) and have enough willpower to override my fear. 

My latest adventure was trying weed out for the first time - it was fantastic. However, I recognize that weed is not a solution and will only use it recreationally, at max once a week (realistically once a month) and only with friends.

In addition to trying out new things here is what I do:

1. Work Out - this is a big part of my life. I lift 5 days a week (have been doing so since high school) and I believe this is why I have a lot of confidence in myself, even though I am paranoid.

2. NoFap - I have been trying to successfully complete the 90 day challenge for a while now. I usually fail because I tend to try to ""test"" myself and edge. No more of that. Period. This time I will make it to 90 and maybe even stop forever.

3. Cold showers - this is relatively new and was extremely hard for me to do (I love my hot showers! lol). It did increase my willpower and slightly decrease my anxiety, but so far I'm only a week in.

4. Open up - I told my best friend about my agnostic beliefs, which was something that was very hard to do. I also told him about how my dad ran out on us (he was a bad person and I am happy he is out of our lives) and how my family is financially not sound (me and my sibling are graduating college right after one another so this should soon be a lot less of an issue once we get jobs).

5. Talk to strangers - I try to introduce myself and be friendly with people. However, I am horrible at small talk and often draw blanks. Also, I have a very stoic face and have been told I look depressed or angry - which doesn't help when meeting new people (I do try to smile though, but it doesn't look genuine when it isn't).

Also, there is a girl at work (summer intern, like me) that I like. I think she likes me too and I want to ask her out. However, if we do go out we will have to keep it a secret because if my mom finds out my life would be over (my brother goes to the same school as me and he isn't on the same page, so there would be a decent chance of my mom finding out through him). I don't want to burden her like that, but I also can't spend the next 3 or so years repressing myself. I don't know what to do.

Do you guys have any advice on what to do in this situation? 
Also, is there anything else I should add to my list of self-improvement?

A little background about me to put this in perspective, I'm a senior at a large southern state school. Never had a girlfriend in college, but never really worried about it either. I'd say I'm mildly attractive, but not superman or anything and I consider myself a pretty good flirter (subjective of course.) I'm a big partier, and most of my experience with women has been one night stands. Most of the time I don't get attached or anything, but there have been two exceptions where I've gone head over heels for the girls and it didn't go well, I would think about them 24/7 and my schoolwork would suffer, and in both cases I felt way happier after we ended whatever small relationships we had.

Fast forward to last Friday night. I'm in Atlanta for an internship and I got totally tequila trashed celebrating gay marriage downtown, and this beautiful girl [F/24 - I'll call her A] walks in with her friend [call her B] and sit together at a booth. I feel like A is out of my league, but I'm even more confident drunk so I go sit down and talk to them. We ended up having a really great time all together. It wasn't all physical, I feel like we connected well all around. They weren't from Atlanta and they were staying with a guy B has a thing with. They invited me to join them, and A and I slept on the couch together. We fooled around a lot but she didn't want to have sex and kept dropping hints about ""the next time"" in a positive way. We cuddled all night and she drove me to my place the next morning. We got along very well and B privately told me that A really likes me. They live in Alabama but they want me to watch the USAvGermany game in Atlanta on Tuesday night. On one hand, I'm really happy. I like A a lot, we just click in a way I normally don't with girls. She's very caring and stunningly gorgeous. 

So that's the backstory, sounds really good but I'm worried I'm going down the same path again where I like her too much too fast and it's going to affect my internship work. On the other hand, this feels very real and I think there could be a future to look forward to. I'm obviously not making rational decisions, so hopefully I can get some good advice from fellow redditors. Any general advice would be great but these are some specific lines of thought I'm working through:

* She lives in Alabama and it seems like she visits Atlanta a lot. Am I just a quick escape for her or does she really like me like me?
* Should I even attempt to make this happen? Normally I would say yes and not worry but I don't want my work to suffer if I get myself in too deep (as I have before)?
* If it were all to work out for this summer, I still have a year left in school and am 3 years younger than her. I should have a good job if this summer works out, but idk if she would just be too mature for me?

I'm not going to try to get with her Tuesday night since I work Wednesday. I also can't bring her over for the night since I am staying at my dad's apartment for the summer. Part of me wonders if during their trips to Atlanta they have a plan for where to stay or if they just find random guys to stay with.

Anyway, I know there's a lot of this that can't be answered, just letting y'all into my thought process. Any and all help is very appreciated.

I'm a 21 year old male Computer Science student entering my 3rd year of college. My parents have been helping me pay for my college expenses, and have said that they will continue doing so. 

This summer, I picked up a paid internship at my father's workplace. By the time I leave for school, I will have earned approximately $3000 dollars. My question, is how do I go about handling this money? I'm not an extravagant spender. (I have a girlfriend and we try to split the costs of dating as evenly as possible)

I'm having difficulty deciding between sticking the majority of it into a Roth IRA to take advantage of time, or potentially saving it in the form of treasury bills, or even just sticking it in a savings account, and letting it sit.

The biggest part of this that weighs on my mind is that I have a unique opportunity (very few expenses, stability, time to mature) and that I'd like to help my parents retire earlier than expected (They're approximately 10 years from retirement.)

Thanks!


EDIT: tl;dr: I have $3000 dollars, and am assured that I have little to no expenses for the next 2 years. How do I get ""the most bang for my buck""?"

I lost my hearing completely at the age of 15 during high school and was implanted with a cochlear implant. I was bullied a lot when I first lost my hearing, but then people just started to ignore me and not include me in anything. This led me to not eating food and losing a lot of weight (5'11'' at 100 pounds). I was feeling ugly and incredibly insecure about myself.

Fast forward to first year of college, due to not eating, it somehow led me to getting Crohn's disease. As a result, I was not able to focus on my classes, due to constantly having to poop every 5 minutes. It sucked bad, couldn't do things that people in college do, and went home every weekend, because I couldn't handle the stress.

Junior year of college, a friend introduced me to weightlifting, and this helped me pack on some more muscle (after I started taking medication which put my Crohn's in place). I was feeling more confident in myself, and girls even said I was cute! I was feeling good about myself, and despite everything that happened previously, I felt I could finally stand up in this world.

Last summer, the summer before graduate school, I then developed a vicious stye in my left upper eyelid, which to this day, has not completely gone. Even after numerous trips to the doctor and 3 surgeries on my eye to reduce the swelling/pus, it never went away and has disfigured my eyelid, to the point where it is now droopy and uneven with my other eye. I have become incredibly self conscious about this, and coupled with the stress of graduate school and TA duties, I was and still am having a hard time coping. My doctor even said to not be vain and that girl's don't care about ""silly stuff"", and my parents tell me to stop complaining as well...

I know the stye doesn't really count as a disability, but all of this packaged together is making me upset. It is summer now, and when I am not in my internship, I just sleep the day away. I don't even go to the gym anymore, even tho I used to be incredibly diligent about lifting weights and making progress -- mostly because I don't see the point anymore.

I can't talk to my parents, because all they say is to stop letting your emotions control you. I'm terribly sorry I'm a disabled freak, I will try not to cry in front of you anymore.


Thanks for listening."

3bgues,1,2015-06-28,Short Term Loans for Student Rent?,Sneet1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bgues/short_term_loans_for_student_rent/,"So I'm in a bit of a situation. I am a US student who is currently working in London for the summer. Unfortunately I have three co-current loans running at the moment, from a student apartment for the year before, the next academic year, and one in London (I did an exchange term on a scholarship at a prestigious school and London has a plethora of job opportunities for someone in my position) so that I can work my internship. For context I am a high-need student with no financial reserves or extended family. 

I'm currently managing to find a subletter for both of my leases back home. The problem is I am short for simply this month in London, but it puts me in a bad position because I am already behind on bills. My school had changed the date of when my scholarship for the next year will come through (which I looked forward to as funds for my internship, which unfortunately for all intents and purposes in my background is a necessary educational step). 

While I have money guaranteed to come in from my old lease ending, by getting back my security deposit and last month via subletter, as well as my scholarship paying in full for the rent in August, I am stuck with a rent payment now that I must deal with 
ASAP. Going home isn't an option at this point because while I could fly out at an affordable price, I had already rebooked my flight for this internship so to ignore it and buy a new, cheap flight would waste the equivalent of the month of rent anyways in already paid money. 

The reason I post this here is because I unfortunately cannot seem to figure out the best option to go forward. I would like to take a small loan that I can absolutely repay in August, but as I have no co-signer nor collateral and a very short credit history no bank seems to be willing. I had also explored the possibility of a student loan via FASFA, however they are quite cryptic in how quickly you receive funds and whether you receive them directly or whether they are paid directly to your school.

I have thought about opening a credit card with a new bank (I have one for my current, Wells Fargo, but the credit limit if my balance was fully paid off would not even cover the rent). I have also looked into payday loans, however they seem to require the funds back quicker than the 1.5 month window I'm looking at it. "

However I'm not so sure I would be open to such a large relocation. I have a few questions for anyone established in the field as hopefully it will allow me to gain some direction 

1. Is there opportunity for employment on the west coast? Most of the people in D.C. have discouraged me from staying there but I love it back home. 

2. What sort of further degrees (masters, law) can help advance my career, increase my salary etc. I was originally looking at degrees in public policy or adminstration however someone informed me that IT and computer science related degress can go a long way in the field is this true?

We have just completed our 2nd (and my final) year of college and he has 1 semester and a 4 month internship left of college, all throughout my 2 years of college we lived together, the first was in a residence and the second was in a town-house that we payed for ourselves (Without our parents help) with 3 other roommates (rent was still $600 each person despite 5 people living there). As far as we go personally, I would say I am more mature than most of my 19-20 year old friends and that because of family issues I had to grow up and take responsibility a lot younger.

The other night he brought up to his parents that he is planning on proposing on our upcoming vacation in a month. When he brought it up their initial thought was that we're very young, which I do agree with.. where we live it is not the norm to get engaged this young, but just because we are getting engaged does not mean we will be married within the year... We intend on him finishing his school within the year and then we have plans to move in together into an apartment and starting a savings account to save money for the wedding which we intend to do for 3-4 years. They also agreed that my boyfriend and I are very mature for our age. 

Another concern is that because we're engaged we won't live up to our potentials and that being engaged may hold my boyfriend back... when my boyfriend was younger he used to not go to tryouts because he knew he wasn't going to make it and they felt like maybe if he was engaged he would say no to opportunities because he's engaged. Which personally I don't feel will happen, my boyfriend has done that with acting opportunities that have come up for him but I have encouraged him to do them and he ended up doing them. 

Another concern was what everyone else will think, especially because we're so young... personally I see getting married at a young age so taboo because it DOESN'T happen often and when it does it doesn't always work out... It's rare that you truly do meet the person you're supposed to spend your life with at 13 years old but we did. We both have grown a lot in the past 7 years, and intend on growing together and as individuals for the rest our lives. 
 
Another concern was that they never see any of his friends from high school and were like ""whose gonna be your best man?"" and my boyfriend doesn't talk to his friends from high school because he doesn't like any of them, all they want to do is go to clubs and party which isn't what either of us are interested in anymore (we both went through our ""drinking and partying"" phases when we were 13-16)

His parents said regardless of anything they will be happy for us and will support us through it and that they love me and would love me as a daughter in law (his mom has said that to me before). I just get the vibe that they aren't too thrilled and are slowly trying to convince him it's not the best idea... because his mom said to him that he could just get me a promise ring (which I already have) and he told her that I already have one and she was like oh well you could get her a nicer one with an actual diamond!

My boyfriends main concern is what my parents will say because i'm their ""little girl"", but I've had talks with both of my parents about it without telling them that it's going to happen, but they've said I'm too young, but they would be happy for us regardless. My parents had a child when she was 17 and my dad was 22, got married and had me when she was 20 and have been together for 20 years. so I don't think they would have too much of a problem with it considering we aren't getting married until we are 23-24. 

I just don't know how to feel about all of his parents concerns, I couldn't help but feel like they might think I'm going to hold him back from some opportunities and that he doesn't see his friends because of me.
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is planning on proposing within the next month or two after discussing it for over a year and a half. He told his parents he's going to propose and they were happy but had some concerns... not sure how to feel about their concerns. "
3bhl5g,3,2015-06-29,A question about age at applying/matriculating,MOIST_MAN,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/3bhl5g/a_question_about_age_at_applyingmatriculating/,"So I'll be graduating undergrad next spring at the green age of 20, and I know that most schools like at least 3-5 years of full time work experience before applying. What I'm wondering is should I aim to apply/matriculate earlier, say at 23, or hold off until 25, or even 27?  Ovbiously it depnds on a lot of factors, like how my job search post-college goes, how I perform at work (promotions, bla bla bla), who I work for etc, but as a rough estimate, should I aim for a specific age? Would it benefit me either way? 

Any advice would be appreciated.

If it matters, I'm studying Information Systems with a 4.0 from a large but not very well ranked state school. Also doing an IT internship for a medium sized company right now (summer).

Thanks for your help!"

I scored a 2 year contract with 35k€/year pay and 38h/week. My next contract is almost 100% guaranteed and is about 41k€/year.

My work is very stressless. I love it. My co-workers are all about 40y+ old so im the youngest one here, which is okay. There are other interns, which are about my age.

Im pretty scared/insecure about this. Prior to this i've never worked in my life. No one in my close field works in IT and can give me advice. I'll be getting some workshops/seminars paid by my employer, which is nice. But apart from that im not sure what to do. I'm not sure if i should use a major part of my free time to advance in my programming skills, or just do and learn what i do at work. Sure, i love programming, but i can imagine that 8h+ free time spending in programming can burn someone out. I don't want this passion to burn out. I chose this workfield because i like it, and i want to stay in it.

Can someone give me advice how a newcomer to this workfield should behave or act? Maybe some tips on next steps?"

**END OF EDIT**


After a 6 months internship that finishes tomorrow evening, it's time for me to part ways with Dontnod, at least for now.

This was my first experience in a video game company, and it's been absolutely great, thanks to them, but also to you guys !


When i started studying/working in the video game field, it was scary, because i thought that it might just have been a phase. But after interacting with some of you, and watching people have fun, laugh, cry and generally enjoy somthing i've been (a small) part of, feels incredible.


So i want to thank everyone on this sub, and more specifically /u/haXona , /u/kemando , /u/Hoonder for the fun discussions we've had, /u/DuckOfDuckness for keeping this boat afloat, and of course, /u/sashimi_taco for the awesome playthrough and theories that were followed here at Dontnod.


To celebrate all that, i'm running a small giveaway, where the first prize will be a custom T-Shirt selected together with the winner. And since i'm a fan of narration, the way to enter will be to describe the character you would be if you were in Life is Strange. You don't have to stick to the real details, but do as you please ! I'll be selecting a random winner when this post is 25 hours old, at 13:30 CEST (Paris TimeZone) tomorrow. 

Here's an example of an entry, but you don't have to follow the same pattern : 

**Age :** 19

**Gender :** Male

**Clothing :** Blue striped shorts and video-gamey shirt. 

**Personality :** Wants to be part of everything that's going on, always creating small projects (and never finishes them).

**3 People I'd hang out with :** Warren, Justin, Brooke.

There you go, feel free to create your own set of traits, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate !

3bhwi8,43,2015-06-29,TIFU by putting my wife and kid on the streets,DeadbeatDad91,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3bhwi8/tifu_by_putting_my_wife_and_kid_on_the_streets/,"Obviously this wasn't just today, it was actually over a period of time, but since this is the official rock bottom, and of course the usual ""throway account"" because as regretful as I am, I don't need anymore lashback than what is already happening so here goes.


A little background: I'm a 24 year old stay at home daddy (ex wife gets child support, IRS takes some money, and my student loan takes some money as well so we decided it best if I deal with the poopmeister, which I don't mind, he's my everything), my wife is 23 and our son is 3. Ever since I was 11 I was enchanted by the world of Internet Marketing. I saw a web page called the Rich Jerk and the video was so enticing I even let it load over dinner just so I could watch it, over and over again. Of course being so young I couldn't even dream of dropping money on things like that, but it never stopped me from searching and searching for the rest of my entire life. Went through my teens obsessing over things like Global Resorts Network, GDI, Big Ticket to Wealth, program after program, success story after success story. It became my dream, to make a living from this beautiful internet. 


Once an adult, I really started to research, and found that basically the things that I was looking at were short lived and only really made money for the first few people to participate, but no problem, I found a forum of REAL people making REAL money from REAL internet businesses (or so I thought).


This particular forum had a section FILLED with guides, mentors, coaches, videos, YOU NAME IT for anywhere from $1 to $47 to $497, to $4997+ (Internet marketers fucking LOVE their 4s 9s and 7s) so I just ate it up. I had a job at the time and 3/4 of my paycheck went to buying course after course, disappointment after disappointment. Coaches with promises like ""your business will succeed with my help or ILL PAY YOU!"".


Time and time again I was burned, and yet it only fuelled the addiction. Spent more and more and more. No, I didn't just collect courses, I TOOK ACTION. I did everything I was told, maybe a couple bucks would trickle in here and there, but it would all dry up eventually.


Fast forward to last year, my wife gets an AMAZING JOB!!! ($55k a year!!!) and suddenly we are LOADED. We rent a nice house, get a BRAND new 2015 car, we've got extra money up the asshole, put 20% away every paycheck and spend the rest on bills/entertainment/my stupid business attempts. At first it wasn't so bad. $200-300 a month maybe at first, but the next month, daddy needed backlinks, daddy needed SEO, daddy needed some content, daddy wanted an authority site. $800 $900 $1000 dollars every month, wasted. Nothing working.


But then I see it, this can't fail I tell myself, ""$5,000 SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY, DO NOT PAY FOR THIS COACHING IF YOU AREN'T SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS! I will hold your hand to success"". Yes sir I am! That is all my savings but this is a sure thing I convinced myself. So I paid...out of our DISNEY fund! Why not, we weren't going to Disney for at least 5 months, I'll have made my investment back by then. Was I ever wrong...


I put another $1,200 from the credit cards into that ""business"". After awhile the ""coach"" suddenly stopped logging into skype, the websites were garbage, no traffic, nothing.


I was defeated, heartbroken, guess what happens next? I SAW IT!! ""AMAZON BLAH BLAH"" the HOLY GRAIL! Success stories PLASTERED everywhere, not a single negative review ANYWHERE on the internet. Let's check the blackhat website for a [GET] no? That's right it's 1 on 1 actual coaching, and a GUARANTEE! A written guarantee that I'll be PAID by the coach if it fails! This is what I've always been waiting for. My wife works so hard, I'm picturing the moment when I tell her she doesn't have to work anymore, when our son can go to a nice private school when he's older, and everything will be alright! Such a happy day!


$5,000 right on the credit cards, but it's ok we have about $6,000 of CC balance left, no more savings but that doesn't matter we've got THIS now! I pay another few hundred for a couple wholesale memberships. I apply for a permit to sell goods (this guy is really making this seem legit, I gotta do OFFICIAL SHIT)


Seems like every day I made progress, and I felt it too, felt like I was working my ass off. Putting this here, putting that there, sending this email, outsourcing this, hiring for that, backlinks here, content there, copy here, page design there. Eating up this guy's bullshit with a spoon. 


Every day he looks at my progress and says YES we are gonna make some money! ""Your business will be great"" he says, encouragingly.


Few months ago, wife gets laid off from her job, game over for us right? Wrong, I've got profit right around the corner according to Coach Coacherson. We've got credit cards to fuel it too!


Well, last week he stopped contacting me, and shut off every hope of ever seeing him again. Still no money. Not a dime of ROI.


And today, our last $800 of credit, for 1 month at an extended stay for us because we needed the place to live. We ""move in"" next week, and in a few hours, I have to tell her what is happening, and why it's happening to us. Because I bought into a life that doesn't exist. Because I failed as a father.


TL;DR: Open a fucking sports bar, the internet is for Zuckerbergs and Swartzs


**UPDATE:** Going to talk to her now over breakfast to see what our plans are going to be. Parents aren't an option for either one of us, a lot of great suggestions coming from reddit. I have a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration on Marketing so it might help me in the job market but it never has before, hell even the company I did an internship with isn't willing to hire, but now is the time to try anything. I'm also going to call the credit cards today to see if there's anything to be done about getting straight up scammed."

3bid82,6,2015-06-29,"Me [22 F] with my bf [23 M] 6-8months, dysfunctional &amp; unable to communicate, broken up but I want to reconcile, help",rlnshpdrama4dayz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bid82/me_22_f_with_my_bf_23_m_68months_dysfunctional/,"So this relationship began with the cards stacked against it. He was my rebound from a serious 2-year relationship that was heading toward the alter until he pulled the plug. We started as FWB, and had this immediate emotional and intellectual attraction (the physical part came after I saw him with his shirt off. :P) I told him everything, and he helped me work through my breakup and other life-long psychological issues. We were FWB for a little over a month, with plenty of drama in between (Vegas and an ex-boyfriend was involved...) before we decided to be official. Since January we've pseudo-broken up at least three times, but we could never stay away from each other long. It's been a rough road. For as long as I remember, we've fought regularly. Like real, emotionally draining fights that end in sobbing on bathroom floors, storming out in the middle of the night, hopping out of moving cars, etc. for both parties.

But strangely... we're perfect for each other. We moved in at 3.5 months and lived together for 2 months with almost no cohabitation-related issues. His friends and family love me, and my mom highly approves. Neither of us violate each other's pet peeves, and our biological rhythms are clearly in sync. We have complimentary life goals, and similar perspectives when it comes to philosophy and politics, but can NEVER seem to see eye to eye when it comes to our relationship.  We both find each other's quirks and flaws endearing, yet we always seem to fight about the same bullshit. (I'm overbearing, hard to please, and too selfish to be empathetic; he's insensitive, stubborn, and ruthlessly vindictive.) All of our fights seem to boil down to a failure to communicate, which we acknowledge, yet nothing seems to work. We're a couple of paradoxes, I guess. We're both each other's biggest support but also harshest critic. He is amazingly insightful when it comes to other people but ridiculously stubborn and short-sighted when it comes to our relationship.

Anyway, I just left the country a week ago for a summer internship. The week before I left, we had a huge fight that ended up in a breakup... which turned into a break... The day before my flight we had a long phone conversation and talked things out (or so I thought), and the break turned from two weeks to a week to three days. Then this morning, a normal conversation turns sour, he accuses me of turning our relationship into a shitshow (the fight I thought we resolved), triggering a strong response from me (since one of my biggest grievances this entire relationship has been about him acting like things are resolved and that he understands my perspective when he actually doesn't, and brings supposedly resolved matters up in later fights.) This time, it was him who called it off. I was exhausted and instead of diffusing my anger like the thought of a breakup usually did, it only fueled it. It also felt much more real this time. I guess it's easier to walk away when we're thousands miles away already.

Then immediately after he breaks up with me OVER TEXT, he asks if we can be friends. I shoot him down pretty sternly... and we haven't communicated since. It's been 15 hours, and it feels like days has gone by.

I want him back, but I know things need to change and we need to figure out how to communicate. PLEASE give me advice on how to make this work? After all this, I still think he might be my soulmate... but I don't know if he thinks the same. My best friend thinks I was more into this relationship than he was... but I've seen him at his emotional lowest and I know he's just as invested as I am. He seriously had trouble eating and sleeping when I went abroad/no contact for a week in April. I find it hard to believe he can walk away, but he just might because we're both so worn out from our repeated battles.

So... how do I get him back. How long should I wait to talk to him, or should I just wait for him to text first? My friends think I should actively try to move on and even he's said repeatedly this relationship does more harm than good... but against my every better judgment I don't want to let go. I'm a mess without him, but I know better than to just text him and tell him I'm willing to keep trying like I always do. This breakup seriously hurts a million times more than the end of my two-year. Help, please.

TL;DR; On again, off again with boyfriend. We're perfect for each other: he's brought me the greatest physical, mental, and spiritual pleasures of my life, but our incessant emotionally charged fights have also brought me to crippling lows. I feel like he's my soulmate, but I don't know how to salvage this. I'm a mess, and need outside perspectives. How should I approach this breakup? How can I change his gut reaction to a bad fight from wanting to break up to wanting to work harder...? And from an outside perspective... is this more trouble than it's worth; am I blinded by love?"
3bif1p,0,2015-06-29,How to start freelancing?,Lukk1989,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/3bif1p/how_to_start_freelancing/,"Hi,

I'm a front-end dev with 2 years of experience (excluding internships, then it's about 3 years). Currently I am working for a digital agency but I sometimes I feel like a puppet. I'm just making websites for clients and my boss receives the money. I can do the same! :)

Reasons for changing to freelancing:

* Higher salary (current salary is low)
* Working from home
* I could choose which projects I accept or reject
* High demand in my area (europe)

How do I start freelancing? I can pretty much make any website with HTML/CSS/JS. But I guess people want to have a back-end too. Should I start learning PHP and then Wordpress so I can also make the back-end part? Or can I also land jobs just by doing the front-end?

Any advice is welcome!

Cheers"

So two summers ago I had been lucky enough to pick up a job as an intern for $EngineeringCompany ($EC) that had some serious networking/wifi/server issues. At the time I was only 16, and was/am currently planning on studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity at $University, so this seemed like a godsend at the perfect place. 

Nope. 

Imagine Godzilla trying to breed with a 3 legged mouse, and try to convert that circus into physical wires and cables and you'll get an idea of what the ""offices"" looked like. There were only three offices, and each office held 4 elongated tables, 5 people, and usually 2 monitors for each person, so about 10 monitors and 5 towers. The rooms were horrendous, Ethernet cables everywhere, power bricks in the middle of the room, monitor cables and everything everywhere, you get the jist. 

Anyways, the lady who hired me, wanted me to learn 2012 r2 from scratch, then learn 2008r2 (their current setup was the later) and how they're different and how to set them up because she didn't have the time, nor interest, in learning it and didn't want to pay someone to do it when she had a 16 yr old intern. 

Note: Prior to this internship, I had only very limited knowledge of computers in terms of networking, but a huge passion for learning, anyways. 

So that's how my summer went, reading upon reading and testing in a virtual environment on a less-than-legal ESXi that I somehow managed to load onto one of their raid drives since they never thought to have even one normal drive; until I felt like I learned what I could and my testing had gone well. 

I successfully implemented Group Policy for users, computers, mapped the drives, had network shares, basics of the server down pat. So Boss comes in one day before I start working and asks how I'm doing and I begin to show what I've done. 

I don't remember the exact conversation because I have had many senseless ones with the brainless ant I called my boss. But by the end she wanted me to not only show her what worked but the how and why of it to. She wanted me to do a full out tutorial and teach her everything. *facepalm* The only reason I was hired was because she didn't want to learn and she just wanted to have!

So she walks out of the room leaving me burning with the rage of Sparta as they had just lost their King; so, I begin to make a PowerPoint on what everything does, and why, and take notes, basically recreating the month and a half spent there learning with regurgitation. 

I go in not even an hour later asking a question on what's important to learn and what's not and she says that only things she thinks she'll understand easily are vital because she just got off the phone with a seller and she had just bought two windows server 2012r2's because she saw how cool they looked. 

TL;DR- Crazy boss decides to hire 16 year old uneducated intern to manage entire network of engineers, and then trusts him before even understanding his work.

This is probably my most ""bland"" story, but I'll be linking this from my future posts in this shitshow place and it would help to understand why and what's happening, right?

I'm an AE student at a top 5 university for AE. (Just started my Junior year, GPA 3.8). I have heard from a few individuals that having experience in Machine Shop work is extremely important. I have none, and it is starting to concern me. 

As far as my other employ-ability skills, I have stronger than average coding skills for my major (MatLab, Java, I am pursuing a CS Minor, emphasis in AI). I have experience with Inventor, Solidworks, and some NX. (Never used CATIA, although I have heard industry uses it heavily. ) I have one internship under my belt. It was at a paper product manufacturing facility. While it wasn't AE, I learned a lot in the process. I intend to have 1-2 more internships before I graduate, this time with an AE company. 

As far as personal projects go, I have been working on drones in my spare time, and have been doing Combustion research on campus. I feel like I am in a fairly strong position for job applications, but my lack of machine shop skills has me worried.

How important do you feel machine shops skills are for a new hire out of college? Are there any other skills that I should have that I haven't explicitly mentioned?

Thanks in advance!"

I fucking hate that I still have to use my dad's money to buy even the smallest of things. My 6.3 cgpa won't be worth shit during the  placements, and during this summer vacation I don't have an internship or summer training, just making some personal project and doing a java course which I hope will be enough to compensate for the internship.

I hate that I can't ever complain about anything at all to them, because whatever they're proving comes free for me. I very rarely complain about anything at all, but it would be nice to have the option open.

I don't know if I'll get a good job after college. I don't know if I'll have enough money to live independently after college, let alone have internet access.

On the outside I confidently tell everyone else that doing personal projects are more important than wasting time sitting in some office reading reddit doing an internship for internship's sake, but inside I'm more worried about it than everyone else.

3bj0h9,33,2015-06-29,Is it worth taking out student loans so I don't have to work part-time during school?,Yourenotthe1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bj0h9/is_it_worth_taking_out_student_loans_so_i_dont/,"I'm a CS student about to start my junior year. I'm in the middle of an internship that pays about 16k (after taxes) for the summer and I'm trying to decide if I want to take out student loans again.

Last year I took out 5k to pay for tuition for the year (my school is so cheap!) and didn't feel too bad doing that. Doing that for the next two years though is a little more stressful, especially when I probably could bunker down, keep working part-time while a student and pay tuition while in school. However, I really want to have more free time, go out to eat, go to concerts, and take advantage of my college years.

The absolute most debt I could graduate with is 15k, and after this internship I pretty much have a 100k job lined up after graduation. That doesn't sound too bad, but it is probably unnecessary. I see a lot of stress about student loans here in this sub, so I guess I'm looking for outside advice on whether what I'm doing is dumb."

The program I am trying to run is on this site

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I don't need to be explicitly given the answer, just pointed in the right directions as all the tutorials for the specific program seems to be written towards people who have experience with MATLAB."

I am currently going to school for neuroscience, and am incredibly close to graduating, and have realized that it just isn't for me. I went in to it at first planning to do premed before I really thought about how I don't wanna spend my life like that. I never chose comp sci as my major in freshman year because I felt like I would be so behind the curve since I had no programming experience, but now I'm seeing some of my friends who were less tech literate than me getting pretty good internships and I'm just now realizing that I would have been fine. Now if I want to switch it will take me probably a bit over a year past my expected grad next may just because a few of the classes have 2 semesters of prereqs that I would have to take, and I would no longer be on full ride scholarship after I finish this coming school year so I will have to take out a loan or something. I am just beating myself up for not doing this earlier, I could have done it debt free and be done quicker. Does anybody have any advice, especially from anyone who has done something similar even if not switching to computer science. Thank you for any help! 

Edit: And in regards to doing a minor, I would still have to do the 2 semesters of pre-reqs (comp sci 1 then comp sci 2) before taking a few of the classes, so it wouldn't really save me any time over just doing the major, or maybe double majoring since I am so close with this neuroscience stuff anyway.

Edit2: Thanks for all the great replies, sorry I haven't contributed much the the discussion I got crazy busy after submitting the post yesterday. I really appreciate it, trying to figure all this stuff out is really scary and confusing, especially as the clock counts down."
3bj8a2,6,2015-06-29,Can we discuss the Creatures as a whole and their projects.,Baggzio,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/3bj8a2/can_we_discuss_the_creatures_as_a_whole_and_their/,"Alright guys I've been thinking about this for the past couple of months and I think there's no time to have this kind of discussion like the present. I've been a fan for about 5 years maybe so I've seen the group change and grow a lot. In my opinion and I assume the opinion of others they seem like they're on a decline with regards their content and everything. I'll start with the group as a whole and then go onto their projects that they've promised. 


I don't really understand the guys and the whole group in the past couple of months. They've seemed to gotten kinda lazy with their gaming videos even on their own personal channels and the hub. This has all been discussed before so I'm not gonna go into it. As far as the members we all know Sp00n and Ze's situation and honestly I don't even think of them as Creatures. It's not that I don't like them or anything but they've literally not been associated in anyway in probably more than a year if I remember correctly. It's just pointless in my opinion of even talking about them because everyone already knows their story. But the big problem and has been for months is Seamus. Where's Seamus? That's the question that's going around and who can blame the people asking? He just went AWOL one day and hasn't even attempted to give an explanation to why. I mean we at least deserve a ""sorry I've been gone I have X problem"" but no nothing. How long before people ask ""Who's Seamus""? New fans will come in and don't know who he is as I'm sure many don't know Ze or Sp00n. I mean it even seems like the actual creatures don't even know Seamus' situation at times which isn't only worrying from a business standpoint but a friendship one too. We seen James say months ago when Dex came in that it was because they needed extra help so whys Seamus seemingly gone when they need the extra hand? It's not fair on the fans or the creatures by all accounts. That brings me to my next point. 


The people they've brought in. I like all the creatures they've brought in. I actually relate a lot more of Dex's humour than most because he simply doesn't give a fuck and says what he wants to be funny. That's something not a lot of the guys do anymore which tells me they're trying to tone down on their ""adult humour"". I don't know why they're doing this be it perhaps wanting a younger audience to be more attracted or to be more appealing to sponsors. Who knows? It's seems the guys curse less and all that and that's what I can gather. It seems only James Aleks and Dex are the only ones to still consistently swear and do shit like that. 


With regards to the group in general I get the feeling they're trying to pander to the younger crowd for views and such but I'm probably wrong. I just feel like some of the older viewers might be sacrificed to entice the younger crowd into overreacting in videos and just humour based on acting ""goofy"". I hope I wouldn't be considered an older viewer after all I'm only 18 but I feel like their humour a lot of the time is just stupid really. They're really losing Seamus' humour too because he had the sarcasm which took some intelligence and quick wit. As for the interns they're getting to be annoying in all honesty. I mean Spencer is in most of the content now. He's alright but not constantly video after video. Joe gets annoying because all he does he use the same jokes as shown by the recent creature talk. Aron just tries to be like James and Aleks because they're the two most popular but he's not charismatic or funny enough to pull it off so he just gets annoying and looks to try too hard as all of the interns do. I haven't seen enough of Stefani but she seems alright because she doesn't freak out like the other interns and is actually just chilled out. 


Now onto their projects and content. As I said their content hasn't been great in the past couple of months. The constant board games and minecraft just got annoying to the point where I wouldn't watch them because there's no point really. It seems the effort wasn't really being put into their games at all. It was literally just all party games. They never make coop series anymore when that'd really freshen things up. Maybe the get the idea that people mightn't like the series but I for one would rather a coop series than a board game. I'm not watching another board game game night again honestly they're just drained of all fun really. It always goes the same way. James vs Jordan. Jordan's winning.  Aleks tries to fuck over everyone for no reason. James or Jordan win. That's it. That's the basic formula. 


Their real life content has been improved in the past year but they really need to stop hyping things up. I mean the ""salad wars"" in the road trip wasn't that great in all honesty. The trips and such have been good but if it was kept really to just the actual creatures and maybe an intern for camera purposes itd be better. 


As for their ""upcoming"" projects this is where it annoys me and where the biggest problem lays. Almost everything they've ever promised hasn't come to fruition or has been a bust. I've just come to the point where I know Tr4pville isn't going to be made and if it is its not going to be very good. It's the Duke Nukem forever process. I mean since they've announced it they've had so many changes in the group that they couple possibly have finished it. I mean they lost a main character in Sly and could lose another in Seamus if he does actually quit. So everything they had done to that point had to be either rewritten or reanimated. It's always with false promises with them. It's annoying because whenever they announce something I'm just thinking it's not gonna come out or it's just gonna be meh. I mean I know all that takes time and everything but cmon its been years. I mean their 1 million sub special should be already out as should their creaturetopia special but they're not. I appreciate that it's hard to get everyone at the same time but you're telling me I'm assuming everyone is in the office 5 days a week at certain hours that you can't spare an hour or two for a video. Cmon that's just bullshit. I know everyone has their own channels and everything but in fairness you can pause a game or get an editor to edit for you. You're not as busy as you claim to be that's not possible in a job such as yours. Look I'm not telling them how to run their business but in fairness you guys have a duty to your fans so either stop lying by saying something's gonna be this or that or just work harder I guess which I know is a bad thing to say but if you can't meet a deadline you set you shouldn't make a deadline. I mean at least give some sort of update on the progress of projects. I don't care if it's ""spoiling"" it or whatever I just want to know if you guys are actually working on something like you said you are. Really it's just not good enough in all honesty. 



I know this post seemed a bit hateful and stuff but that's not its intent or purpose. The guys need to know what they're doing wrong and we as fans deserve the best content they can give us. We all know they intended to be a Rooster Teeth type of company but there's a reason why Rooster Teeth are so successful. It's because they're good with deadlines and creating good content. "
3bj94p,1,2015-06-29,I [25 M] have been dating a woman [25 F] for a month and I'm not sure if she's into it,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bj94p/i_25_m_have_been_dating_a_woman_25_f_for_a_month/,"Here's a not-so-interesting fence of text. I appreciate any input though!

I just moved to a new country to start a PhD program. I met an intern in the department who is leaving in two months from now. I'm a pretty outgoing person, whereas she's *extremely* shy. We communicate in my native language but her second language, although she's basically fluent. She's also probably one of the prettiest people I've ever seen in my life. (I'm no George Clooney but I'm not too bad looking)

After a department outing one night, she came over to my apartment for drinks and ended up staying til 4:30 am. We hung out on my bed, but she kept a pretty clear distance. We flirted a bit (tickling etc) but her body language told me she wasn't interested in being kissed, so I respected that. I walked her home, got her phone number, and pecked her on the cheek. 

We texted a bit and I asked her out to dinner. She came over to my apartment after dinner and this time I did try to kiss her, but she stopped me and said ""Don't you think it's a bit soon?"" She asked me what I wanted, I said that I liked her and just wanted to keep spending time with her. She said she didn't know what she wanted. I told her that I would stop putting moves on her and if she ever wanted to, then she could kiss me. She agreed to this arrangement. I walked her home again but this time didn't kiss her on the cheek. We hung out one more time and just walked around the city together at night, but again didn't kiss. 

We both went on vacation the next week and texted throughout the week. She sent lots of flirty messages with smilies and winky faces etc. We hung out the day we both got back in town. I told her that I like her and she said that she likes me too. She said that she wants to kiss me now but that she has a cold sore and so it would be unwise to do that. We cuddled a bit and I went home. We hung out again a few days later, she still had the cold sore so we didn't kiss again but she ended up sleeping over at my apartment (!). We cuddled all night, but the next day she complained about not getting enough sleep ;p

We met up a couple days later to see a concert together. After the concert she came over to my apartment. I told her that I noticed her cold sore was gone. She agreed but said she didn't know if she wanted to kiss me. She asked again what I wanted, I said that I'd like to be her boyfriend but I understand that she's leaving in two months, but regardless I'd like to spend this time together. She said that she finds it a bit strange to just date for a short while only to break up, and that she has only been in two serious relationships before but that it hurt them a lot when she broke up with them and she didn't want to hurt anyone again. I told her that if we know going into it that it'll end in two months then she doesn't have to worry about me getting hurt. She then asked, well what if she decides to kiss me and then later decides she doesn't like me? I told her again that it's fine if she changes her mind, kissing me doesn't bind her to anything. She continued like this for about two hours, saying that she enjoys spending time with me but she just isn't sure what she wants. I reassured her that if she isn't interested in me, that's totally fine, I won't be offended and I'll be happy to stay friends with her. 

So she finally says, how about a kiss goodnight? So I say ok, and go to walk her home. We both stand there awkwardly and nervously, and she says that we should take a walk. So we find someplace dark, she hugs onto me, and finally we kiss...for a good ten minutes. It was awesome. I walk her home and go to sleep. 

Two days later we meet at a mutual friend's house for dinner. We stay there super late and bike home together afterwards. I drop her off at her place and stand around awkwardly hoping for another kiss. I ask her if she wants to take another walk but she declines saying that it's too late. She gives me a kiss and I awkwardly tell her that she can sleep over again if she wants to. To my surprise, she says that she doesn't want to go to my place but that I can sleep at hers if I want to. So of course I agree. Since it's so late we both just passed out. In the morning I practiced her language a bit and asked for ""reward kisses"" for correct sentences, which she obliged. After a bit I went home. I saw her at the department lunch today but she didn't seem too interested in talking to me. I asked her if she wanted to hang out tonight but she said that she's too busy cleaning her apartment. 

Ok, so writing this all out I've made it sound like everything's hunky dory, but the thing is, the whole thing is pretty asymmetrical. I get really excited to see her, but she always seems pretty neutral. I always do the ""asking out"" and I'm not sure she would if I didn't. We eat lunch in a group with our department everyday and she's always very shy to say anything to me there. I think I just generally enjoy being around her more than she does me. The night when she was deciding whether she would kiss me, I was pretty damn convinced that she was just trying to work up the courage to tell me no. I thought it would get better once we kissed, but my uncertainty just keeps growing. 

So this situation is a bit strange to me. I've never really had any problems dating - I usually make my intentions clear, and either get a yes or a no, and that's fine. So I'm wondering if she's actually even interested, or if she's too shy to just tell me to go away. Should I approach the topic with her at this point? Or am I just overthinking this? 

**TLDR**: Been dating a woman for a month, she is leaving in two months, it took weeks of dating for her to agree to kiss me, I'm wondering if she's just being shy or if I should back off. "

First of all, this might be an unnecessary topic but this is kind of urgent. So I had to ask it to Reddit people. 
Let me introduce myself a little. I was recently graduated from indurstrial engineering department, and just became an indurstrial engineer. I heard that some universities give internship oppurtunuties for their non-graduates. I mean I can be an intern at X University even if I wasn't graduated from X University. Is there any known place you heard?

I wonder if it's possible or not. If it's possible, where can I find enough information for that? How can I be an intern at a university? Or any advice from experienced people on reddit? 

Thanks in advance. I'll be so glad for the helpful answers.

It was for an internship.  During this time, I accumulated roughly 27,000 in earnings.

I lived in North Carolina from August to years end for school.

When tax season rolled around, I filed for both states, marking myself as a part-time resident of each.  I used the H&amp;R Block software, which seemed to do everything correctly in my opinion.  Those 27,000 were marked as federal earnings, as well as Virginia.  North Carolina took that amount, subtracted the standard deduction, and multiplied it by some fixed number, .0107 or something, to end up with me owing around $200 in taxes to them.  I paid that to them.  

Yesterday I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe North Carolina 1.1k in taxes - 1.3k from the 27k earnings minus the 200 or so I already paid them.  Am I incorrect in assuming that they have their numbers wrong.  I shouldn't be liable for paying them taxes on that income if I was only a part time resident and earned the money while living in another state, right?

Can someone help me understand this?"

So, through a family friend I landed an internship at an SBDC as an intern. The family friend knows that I'll be majoring in CS in the fall, so he wanted this internship to act as an intro into programming in a business environment. Once I started, he pitched me an idea for a project: create an API that would connect two databases we use - Smartsheet and CenterIC (customer relationship system) - and do something with the information (still a little hazy on what).

He said something about JavaScript, so in my first week I started and finished Codecademy's JavaScript course and began learning Node.js from nodeschool.io. Now it's the Monday of my second week here and I want to make sure I know what I'm getting myself into.


So, /r/learnprogramming, my questions:

1. Am I learning the right language and technology for this project? Is there something else I should look into?

2. I've found a few guides on constructing RESTful APIs with Node.js, but are there any really good ones you guys know about?

3bjh2u,6,2015-06-29,I [25F] am suddenly having major insecurity issues about my relationship with my [26M] boyfriend and his 'friend'.,shnaz7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bjh2u/i_25f_am_suddenly_having_major_insecurity_issues/,"Hello good people of /r/relationships! 



I have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for over 2 years. 
The whole time I have known him, he has had this super hot, really funny and down-to-earth friend (female) who he considers one of his best friends. They talk about everything together and usually hangout one-on-one when they see each other. I never thought much about it and it never really bothered me. Our relationship was fun, exciting, I've never doubted his love for me and we've even discussed moving in together/marriage possibilities in the future. Basically, I love this man and I feel like he loves me. 




About a year into our relationship, I accepted an internship in a foreign country for 8 months. My boyfriend wanted to come with me, but due to sickness and not being able to find a job, left 2 months in to go back home. During our long distance, I would see facebook posts of the two of them hanging out together, going to dinner, museums and exercising. I heard from friends back home that their relationship was a bit flirty - but still, that's how my boyfriend is naturally, so I wasn't too bothered aside from the typical jealousy one gets when they can't hangout with their boyfriend. 




When I came back home after my internship, I found out that he used to have a HUGE crush on her for an entire year before we started dating. I asked him why they never got together and he said ""We were never single at the same time"", but assured me that since meeting me, he doesn't have feelings for her anymore. Then, a few months later, I accidentally discovered some messages between them from when we were both abroad, which were (to me) more than just a ""little flirty"". I got mad, we fought, but he still assured me that I'm still the one he loves. He even told me he would stop hanging out with her, because he doesn't want me to feel insecure about it. I told him I don't want to ruin any friendships and that he could still hangout, just don't be overly sexual with her anymore because it makes me uncomfortable. 




Yet, for some reason I'm still having a hard time getting over it. I look back and see so many signs - how he doesn't mind being late to visit all his other friends but CANNOT be late to hangout with her. Or how I've had the chance to meet all his other friends individually, but he always hangs out with her when I'm busy. It's gotten to the point where almost every week I'll have a dream about him sleeping with her and it makes me very scared and nervous. I always wake up and I'm super mad at him for no reason! 




Meanwhile, ever since our fight it seems like he's stopped trying in our relationship. We 'hangout' a lot, but its not particularly exciting.  He takes no initiative to plan any dates together, he also doesn't seem to show much enthusiasm for the dates I try to plan. (And I've been planning every single date for the past few months...) Last weekend we hungout at a party that she was also attending. The whole time I couldn't stop thinking how incredibly good looking she is, how funny and easy to get along with and fun she seems. My boyfriend called his last girlfriend fat and as he's a very attractive Male, so I know that looks seem to be a big deal for him. 




Despite my boyfriend's best efforts to assure me otherwise, I can't stop comparing myself to her and feeling like I always come up short. I love my boyfriend but my enthusiasm and trust in our relationship is taking a huge hit. Its starting to effect the way I talk to him and when I'm not physically with him, I find myself finding new ways to get mad at him over something. I never used to be this jealous or insecure - in fact I was usually quite the opposite!! What's happening to me? How can I get over my insecurities and jealousy issues? Is it possible for a guy with a huge crush on a girl, to just suddenly get over it - or do you think there could still be some residual feelings?



   
**tl;dr**: I can't help but feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for one of his closest female friends. While he tries to assure me otherwise, my insecurities and mistrust keep growing and its starting to effect my relationship. How do I get over jealousy issues and start just being happy and care-free again?

(X-Post from /r/Tax),AlwaysFixingStuff,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bji3a/north_carolina_attempting_to_collect_on_tax_that/,"Last year I worked in Virginia from January to August, living there, including submitting a change of address.  It was for an internship.  During this time, I accumulated roughly 27,000 in earnings.

I lived in North Carolina from August to years end for school.

When tax season rolled around, I filed for both states, marking myself as a part-time resident of each.  I used the H&amp;R Block software, which seemed to do everything correctly in my opinion.  Those 27,000 were marked as federal earnings, as well as Virginia.  North Carolina took that amount, subtracted the standard deduction, and multiplied it by some fixed number, .0107 or something, to end up with me owing around $200 in taxes to them.  I paid that to them.  

Yesterday I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe North Carolina 1.1k in taxes - 1.3k from the 27k earnings minus the 200 or so I already paid them.  Am I incorrect in assuming that they have their numbers wrong.  I shouldn't be liable for paying them taxes on that income if I was only a part time resident and earned the money while living in another state, right?

Can someone help me understand this?"

Hey /r/learnjavascript!

So, through a family friend I landed an internship at an SBDC as an intern. The family friend knows that I'll be majoring in CS in the fall, so he wanted this internship to act as an intro into programming in a business environment. Once I started, he pitched me an idea for a project: create an API that would connect two databases we use - Smartsheet and CenterIC (customer relationship system) - and do something with the information (still a little hazy on what).

He said something about JavaScript, so in my first week I started and finished Codecademy's JavaScript course and began learning Node.js from nodeschool.io. Now it's the Monday of my second week here and I want to make sure I know what I'm getting myself into.

So, /r/learnjavascript, my questions:

1. Am I learning the right language and technology for this project? Is there something else I should look into?

2. I've found a few guides on constructing RESTful APIs with Node.js, but are there any really good ones you guys know about?

3. Am I in over my head? Should I try a different project? (For reference, my background: Took and excelled in CS electives -- including AP CS w/ a 5 on the exam -- for first three years of high school but not senior year b/c there weren't any left to take. Other than JS, I have experience in Java and a little Python, and I created and published an Android app with a partner in my junior year.)

4. Is there a particular sub I should ask this? I'm just shooting in the dark here.

Thanks for all of your help, guys!"

First of all, this might be an unnecessary topic but this is kind of urgent. So I had to ask it to Reddit people. 
Let me introduce myself a little. I was recently graduated from indurstrial engineering department, and just became an indurstrial engineer. I heard that some universities give internship oppurtunuties for their non-graduates. I mean I can be an intern at X University even if I wasn't graduated from X University. Is there any known place you heard?

I wonder if it's possible or not. If it's possible, where can I find enough information for that? How can I be an intern at a university? Or any advice from experienced people on reddit? 

Thanks in advance. I'll be so glad for the helpful answers.

I'm a student at a college in the United States. Every year, we are supposed to go out into the world and have a full-time internship for seven weeks, from the start of January to mid-February. This year, I have made it my goal to come to Auckland. 

I really want to experience a different country, particularly one that seems to score highly in international civil liberties ratings. I'm studying politics, and I want to see what it's like advocating for civil liberties in a country that seems to do a better job protecting them than mine. 

To that end, I was wondering if any of you have recommendations about organizations that might accept interns in my situation. Ideally, it would be with some sort of civil liberties advocates, but I would accept any sort of policy advocacy if necessary.

When I was still a small boy my dad had loads of canary's and I always enjoyed feeding them etc. Now I've come to a point that I've bought my own house and felt the need of getting a pit. Maybe half a year back I told my niece that I may get a Cockatiel later since I just like the looks / sounds they make. (Since I was following yous on Reddit).

Last Friday suddenly my nice connected me saying that she has 2 young cockatiels for offering for only 45 euros at her internship! So I was oke... give me a day I need to think about this. So I did some thinking and not this Wednesday but upcoming Wednesday I will take my Cockatiel to my own home!!! 

Below you will find a picture of her. She is just 6 weeks old and has been hand fed from the beginning. She is already comfy around people and can be handled well. 

My nice has just taken her from the store and brought her to her home to learn her a few things and play a bit with her and one important thing to learn her to fly better since the flying that she does now is more of a nice way to fall softly to the ground :p

I've already given her a name too.... Lady will be her name. I have to say I can't wait till I can see her this weekend for the first time since I live 150 KM away from my niece and this weekend / upcoming days are extremely busy for me. 

I must say that I've been never so exited to have a pet that will hopefully be a very very nice companion to have around in the house! Planning to make her very loving since she already wants to sit on your lab all the time when she is out of the cage. 

Feel free to post any tips comments, below to chat around a bit :)

Thank you for reading!

Thought I would unleash the power of our community. Any Chicagoans out there who could offer some help would be appreciated. I am also sorry if I shouldn't post here and if this isn't kosher I can delete this post and post it back up to /r/Chicago or the like.  


Here goes... 
My girlfriend is a wonderful human being. She's been through a lot over the past year, including her mom suffering from a potentially dangerous health concern (fine now), two different internships, the death of her first dog, death of her grandma, and personally battling through depression all leading up to her being let go from her job (laid off with five others) that she had for three months.  


I can't say how much this girl means to me. She's a beautiful human being, often caring for others, like two-weeks ago where we stumbled on a girl on the street who herself was in very dark place. My girlfriend listened to her for hours helping this total stranger get back on her feet for the night. She's a strong listener and great communicator.
It just sucks, she's had some bad luck. Of course, these situations are great learning experiences and they help a person grow stronger. However, if any of you know of a great company to work for that's hiring, it would be much appreciated if you could send me your advice.  


I know she will be fine, I just thought it couldn't hurt if I asked around this wonderful community. As far as her job goes, she has a journalism degree, can do social media (though she wants to branch away), but overall has excellent communication skills and above all is a wonderful wonderful human being. She's smart with science, has confidence presenting to people, and a careful and hard worker. She's gone through the headhunter and temp job/contractor positions and is not interested in those again (those are rough with no medical benefits or career advancement).  


Thanks a lot, I appreciate your time.

**TL;DR:** journalism degree, social media experience, personable, excellent communication skills, don't want temp. (thanks a lot for TL;DR idea, /u/professorpan )"
3bjsq9,11,2015-06-29,"""Why would a guy suddenly stop talking to you?"" or ""I need to chill the crap out""",[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3bjsq9/why_would_a_guy_suddenly_stop_talking_to_you_or_i/,"I'll disclaimer this right now: despite being in my late 20's, I am extremely new to dating.  Long story.  And I feel like this may well be stuff I should've figured out in my teens if I had dated back then.

There's this guy I've been talking to since mid-March, met through an online dating site.  At the time, neither of us had much going on in our lives -- me on vacation, him sort of between things -- but it was also a time where we both needed someone to talk to.  We were countries apart, but I was due to move to the UK (where he was) about 6 weeks later.  So we chatted/Skyped a lot, literally every single day, hours at a time.  We got really close.

After I get to the UK, we eventually work out a date where I can go see him (we're in different cities).  It's two months now, and not a day has gone by where we don't talk/flirt/etc.  He's a fixture.  I wake up finding messages from him, and I get woken up just as I'm drifting to sleep at night by a notif from him.  I do the same.  On the agreed day, I go up and we meet and spend a really chill, lovely day playing games, walking about the city, me watching him bake.  That night, we sleep together, and it's -- how to say -- goodtimes?  Nuff said?  Nuff said.

That was also the day that he got offered a summer internship in a foreign country.  It was gold for his career; he knew it too, and I encouraged him.  He soon accepts.  The next day, I go home and we don't see each other for a couple of weeks.  The first few days after the visit, we're so cutesy it's almost sickening.

After that afterglow, I hear a lot less from him.  And I get it; he has to pack, move city, get his workface on.  But it's not just the frequency that changes -- the temperature does too.  He feels distant, even a bit cold, at least compared to how we usually are in text -- and especially how he was those first few days after the visit.  I ask him if I've done something wrong, and he assures me I haven't; it's just that he's moving and stressed.  I tend to be something of an inquisitor, preferring to ask more than talk about myself, so he then asks me to talk about myself for a while and then he'll catch up.

It's nearing 3 months now since the beginning, when we see each other again.  He's come down to my city, where he flies out from, and he carves out half a day just for us on the day before he leaves.  And we gallivant.  Again, it's another great time, for me and it seemed like for him too.  When the date ends, I wish him a safe flight and we part ways.  I message him the next day before he takes off, saying much the same and that he'll be missed.

A few days later, we have something of an odd exchange.  I'm on a tour with some friends, and I message the guy noting a couple I see (we both like to people-watch).  My exact phrase: ""Omg the cutest gay couple touring Harry Potter studios together"".  He responds to this with: ""no we're not"" and ""also, you're not cute, and we're not a couple, and F Harry Potter and his bleached [something-or-other]"".

It strikes me as a joke at first, so I respond to it like one.  It seemed clear to me I wasn't talking about us.  Only later I read it differently.  I think he might have misunderstood, and in case it really was the equivalent of someone throwing a hand in your face and saying ""back off"", I gave him some space.  I knew we weren't a couple; I wasn't saying we were.  I guess I hoped he'd realize that and it wouldn't be awkward.

For the three days after that, he doesn't message.  The Every Day Streak stops.  When I finally message him, he puts off the convo til the next day.  He had to sleep.  It wasn't about the odd exchange, but something else.  Then I later make an off-hand comment about another couple I saw during the tour, to clarify that I wasn't talking about us, albeit in a roundabout way.  He doesn't respond to that at all.

It's now been two weeks since then, and conversations have been short, and most initiated by me.  He just doesn't seem to want to talk anymore, and I don't get it because I thought we were really close and things were going really well.  In our early days, he made a point of saying that he tends to be direct with people and what his expectations are and being honest, even mentioning how his past SOs have let him down in that respect (growing distant, not talking).  And now it feels like he's doing what he said they did.  And it doesn't make sense.

My question is simply: what do I do?  I really like this guy, and I get that two dates don't make a relationship, but I just want to keep talking with him and continue this... 'courtship'?  Sure.

**TL;DR**  A guy I've really hit it off with, with 3 months of online chat and two IRL dates on the latter end, has grown distant, possibly due to an awkward misunderstanding.  Do I just take a hint, or ask him about why he's distant, or something else?  Do I just need to the chill TF out?"

However, I was recently placed in charge of ""Procedure X"" for 6 coworkers. If Procedure X doesn't get done, we are open to serious legal trouble (think lawsuits, patent claims, etc.), and I can get in trouble with my boss's boss. A branch department violated Procedure X recently and was involved in a huge scandal and multimillion dollar lawsuit (plus many firings...).

However, none of my coworkers take Procedure X very seriously. Every day I find that at least one of them has not gotten it done. The problem is, I have no power to enforce this. I cannot write up or fire anyone, I can only report them to our boss (on a business trip until August) or to HR's ""Procedure X"" division--the nuclear option.

I would really appreciate advice on how to deal with these particular coworkers and how to talk them into doing Procedure X without making them all hate me (and making my job miserable):

1) ""Jasper"" [20s M] is an asshole who doesn't care if we get sued. He's irreplaceable due to his technical knowledge and feels like he's too important to be bothered with rules.

2) ""Camilla"" [20s F] is super busy all the time and constantly forgets about Procedure X, if I ask her to do it she does, but when I'm out of the office it doesn't happen.

3) ""Jimmy"" and ""Albert"" [20s M] are scatterbrains who leave procedure X half-complete and cause a lot of hassles. They don't seem to understand that Procedure X is *really fucking important.*

4) ""Calvin"" and ""Cooper"" [30s M] are above me on the corporate ladder (title, paid more, etc.), if I ask them to do Procedure X they say they will, then never get around to it.

Should I just give up and threaten them with HR to get them to follow procedure? Is there anything I can do to make the fact that I'm ordering them around bother them less?

They knew that. This would be my first job and I barely had any experience. I passed the test at the interview and started on a 6-month internship. I may not have had the experience but I loved my work and finally found the field I wanted to continue in. I have had a passion for it from the beginning and had been teaching myself what I could, so I wasn't going in entirely blind. 

Our department consisted of EgoBoss, James (who hired me) and Nick, who I had to work with mostly. EgoBoss did his own thing and didn't pay much attention to me. James was chill and appreciated all help I could give. Nick, however, I came to learn had control issues and liked to micromanage a lot. It came heavily in the way of my learning. EgoBoss tended to go on power trips so I avoided him, plus some of his actions let me know that he would screw me over without remorse if he felt like it so I felt really insecure.

I eventually got hired full-time. I had gotten them a client, and worked on a big campaign with them too so things were not too bad.

However things started going downhill as work progressed. Nick wanted things to go one way and that was his way. I was slow and I tried to be faster. Nick understood because he started out like me and was incredibly slow himself. I tried to learn but they wouldn't include me in meetings but expected me to work on whatever they had discussed. I stayed late nights, made sure they knew that my time would always be available and learned whatever I could.

I started out with so many ideas but ended up executing Nick's ideas instead because he just couldn't have it any other way. I spoke to James about it and he knew it was a problem but didn't know what to do. The few times Nick was forced to let go, we worked great and I was very productive but those were far and few in between. I really felt as if my soul was being sucked out of me. 

I felt insecure in my job and James told me that my performance was not up to par. I really tried to improve but I had zero support. Nick was getting annoyed with me asking him for approvals (had to. It was part of my job. As a junior I couldn't give out anything without an approval) and they reduced me to doing all the things they did not want to do. My creativity was dwindling out and I was extremely frustrated and about to leave, when I got my letter of termination. They said that the agency was moving forward but I wasn't moving with them so they had to let me go. 

I blamed myself until one of the management (who seemed sick of the place undermining her, I learned) told me that it was not me, it was the agency. They had mis-hired me. This agency is struggling and they needed a senior who had years of experience to do the job on their own. They don't have time to look over a junior. I'm at the level I should be and need to be in a proper big agency where I will have a real chance to learn. This place is good only for those with experience, who can hold their own. 

James had been the only one fighting for me and was frustrated with Nick. He finally told me what had really happened. Nick and EgoBoss didn't want me around anymore and so EgoBoss upped his expectations of me without telling me. So when I failed to meet them they used it as a reason to fire me. And of course, EgoBoss waited till he was out of the country to send James to give the news. But I was grateful because James did it with tack and felt remorseful. 

So I'm now in limbo. I finally got my license after months of struggling and I go out every morning to practice driving. I've started going to the gym and am spring cleaning all the junk out of my room. I'm stuck though because my laptop's broken and I'm terrified that I will get it back forever broken. It's my life and it's bloody expensive.

My friends and family have told me that I can be very anxious and negative. That's true. Now I am trying to be more positive but it's a struggle. I feel like a failure and scared of what is ahead and if I'm going to get there. I'm going to be 26 and have nothing figured out. My parents have been amazing but I feel like a burden and I keep going over what happened and why it did. I'm the only one of my friends to lose a job and that stings too. The future is so uncertain and time seems to be flying by so fast, it's terrifying. 

I wish I could get over the fear and anxiety more than anything. It's suffocating. 

Thank you for reading. :)

I've been meaning to talk about this in length and glad there is a place where I could let all this out. "

Anyway, here it is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sqyEYBKc1wVm4xN0NvQlJlNWc/view?usp=sharing

What was your background?,DrainPour,TheBrewery,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrewery/comments/3bkaju/should_i_start_my_business_what_was_your/,"I feel like I'm ready to start testing the waters by contract brewing a few batches at my friends 7bbl facility. After introducing product to market and showing proof of concept I would begin the process of major fundraising with the goal being to open a 7-10bbl brewery. 

As expected I am starting to get nervous. Doubts about whether I am qualified or prepared. I reassure myself that many other breweries were started by less experienced people. My question is... What was your background when you started? Do you feel that business, marketing, and sales knowledge is as important as brewing knowledge? Any advice?  
  
Some background info on me:  

* Certified Cicerone  
* Certified BJCP Beer Judge  
* Completed 6 month production internship on 15bbl system  
* Attended intro to brewing weekend class at UC DAVIS  
* Attended sensory and beer style classes at Siebel (3-5 days each)  
* home brewer (off and on) since 2011  
* collaborated with 2 local breweries on taproom releases  
* formerly worked at taprooms and beer bars

**Edit/Update: Lots of good info thanks for the responses thus far. Most responses seem to be in response to my proposed method. I'd still like to hear about some of your backgrounds when you started your businesses.**"
3bkb0d,1,2015-06-29,Really interested in becoming a writer for a game studio...where do I start?,FickleWombats,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3bkb0d/really_interested_in_becoming_a_writer_for_a_game/,"After having just finished my freshman year at college, and tasting a bit of what it's like to be on my own and pursuing whatever is going to be the next step in my life, I realized something. All the things I love came together in one field, writing on a narrative or lore team for a game studio.

I've been an avid reader of fantasy for as long as I can remember and have loved all the classics of the genre. I have scoured fiction for my favorite authors, to name a few, Tolkein and Jordan to Sanderson, Rothfuss, and Martin. Science fiction too has been a great love of mine, with the words of Isaac Asimov and Kim Stanley Robinson sending my imagination far beyond the realms of fantasy.

But enough of inspirations, what makes me want to write for a video game the most is this: I love to write. I write for myself in the form of poetry and fiction that I create and I write for others in the form of journalism and active blogging. Writing does something special to me, it centers me a bit. To do it for a career (and not to mention doing it in the coolest way possible) would be a dream.

And to compliment my interest in writing and reading, I have a fascination with the early mythologies of cultures. Exploring their histories, and seeing the patterns that appear in folklore and myth throughout the world is something that really excites me. To help build or create a mythology, history, or legend for a video game would be a dream.

But the video games that inspired me to start thinking about all of this are probably the most important. Dark Souls was probably my single favorite game of all time, the experience of traveling through Lordran and attempting to piece together stories from the scattered NPCs and items in the world was intoxicating. The Dragon Age and Mass Effect series hooked me with their intense portrayals of single characters, delving deep into their personal histories. The ability to come away from a game understanding the personality and nuance of a character like Garrus Vakarian is pretty amazing.

So I just kind of threw a lot of information at you guys, but I figured that some game writers must be on /r/gaming sometimes. Or at least people that have been interns! I want to know how to get started, I've looked at some companies internship programs, but most just got interns at the beginning of the summer. 

In conclusion, to anyone who knows, what is the best way to begin the path to writing histories/lore/narrative for a video game? Any general tips for someone who is looking for a position like this? Useful items to build into a portfolio?

Thanks to anyone who responds :)"
3bkcrv,149,2015-06-29,"I tried hiring an MSP, here's how it went.",ThrowawayNetadmin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3bkcrv/i_tried_hiring_an_msp_heres_how_it_went/,"*I apologize for the wall of text. Some details have been changed but I've tried to keep the story accurate. The oil and gas community is small, the cross-section between O&amp;G and MSPs is smaller, and I want to be able to be frank without damaging my career.*

I work for an O&amp;G company. I'm a one man band, with an intern from 3 to 5 during school and from 12 to 5 during the summer. We manage roughly 7 offices and 250 users. The company has grown more in the past 3 years than it has in it's 35 years of operation and I'm starting to be barely able to keep up with the workload. I talked to my boss about it. He wanted to find an MSP to cover help desk and leave me time to work on automation and process improvements.I have a good relationship with him so I knew that my job was secure. I sent out 15 RFQs to see what was out there. Of that, five MSPs responded. Here's how that went:

**MSP 1: We just learned with Kaseya is**

The first MSP was the local incumbent for the region. Their president came in strong: Sharply dressed, nice binders full of colorful brochures and a good attitude. Pricing was great: $60 per managed computer. That was about as good as it got. Any time we brought up something that didn't fit within Kaseya natively, his ability to manage it fell apart.

""We can implement two factor authentication with AuthAnvil"", he said. 

""We already have RSA implemented"", I replied. 

""Well, we don't support that, we can implement enterprise-class mobility management!"", he tried.

""We already have Air Watch, what does this do that Air Watch doesn't?"". 

The silence was tangible, and then, ""Well, it doesn't integrate with our management tools"". 

They, in a serious tone, proposed that we drop all 20 of our Linux VMs for Windows because they couldn't manage them the same way. They wanted to replace our Juniper SRXs and EX switches with Meraki because ""it was better"". This included our newly bought EX6200.

The conversation ended shortly after.

**MSP 2: Someone let the accountants out**

The second MSP was from the next city over. They were small but growing and had the staff compliment to handle us. We would be their biggest client by a large margin, but I met the techs and felt confident in them.

Their rate was pretty much spot on for what we were looking for: $120 per managed user. Then they started tacking fees on for shit that didn't make sense. There were fees for everything: per call, per user, per device, per printer, per firewall, per on-site visit, per switch, per hour expected of response time, just short of giving me a fee for use of our facilities if one of their techs took a dump while on my site.

When we added everything up and costed it per user, it came into roughly $240 per user when we were done. No, thanks.

**MSP 3: Let's poke the bear**

A fairly large, national MSP was next. They were big enough to handle us, as they frequently reminded us. This was the topic of conversation every 5 minutes. We wanted to look at network automation? They had done that with *namedrop*! Improving our puppet and chef configs? Why, they had done that with *namedrop*. It was reassuring to start.

However, their downfall was hubris. The day 1 on boarding plan was nothing short of a take-over of the network. You don't rip out a CRM that's been developed over a decade and replace it overnight. They wanted to do upgrades of servers that had been running on older versions of Linux without asking *why* that server was on an older version to begin with. When we tried them, we gave them a demo environment of a single Windows DC. Without consulting anyone they installed two-factor auth and didn't give any local staff fobs or the app, and then proceeded to change information on service accounts that would have impacted backups.

I revoked their access and told them to take a hike.

This is where it got ugly.

Their CEO called our CEO, said that my intern and I were incompetent, we had exposed the network to serious flaws, and we were going to drive the business into the ground. He said that myself and the intern should be tossed out and they should get ""*real IT people*"" in.

You need to understand my CEO to understand why this got so ugly. When the company was formed in the late 70's, our CEO formed it because a consultant had come to his old company and advocated that they ditch all staff in the regional offices and consolidate it under a third party. That resulted in him getting kicked to the curb and it put his family under a lot of stress. He carries a deep, burning hatred for any consultant who advocates replacing local staff for third parties.

I've never heard someone called a cockgobbler in anger, but I think it was catharsis for bossman.

**MSP 4: We're not really an MSP**

Fourth on our list was confusing. They listed themselves on their website as an MSP. They listed everything we wanted: automation, management, help desk support, etc. However, they really only wanted copier and copier related accessories. Network automation? How about some nice toner! Datacenter? We've got datacenter grade multi-functions! I exaggerate a bit, but only a little. Now that being said - we've since contracted our two copiers from them and they're great at it.

**MSP 5: Cool neckbeards**

The last one was hard to turn down. Two guys showed up for the meeting. One had a beard that would make Gandalf jealous in a mustard stained Breaking Bad t-shirt. The other guy was a sharply dressed Finnish dude who spoke barely comprehsible broken English. Despite all of this, they were pretty cool: they only really wanted to handle the break/fix stuff and routine operations, and they were willing to let me work on the new development. This was exactly what I wanted. They were the most expensive per user, but they were reasonable about it.

The only problem they had was that they couldn't commit to holding up their end. If they had been a bit bigger, it probably would have worked out fairly well.

The short of the long of it: The biggest criticism I have of all of the MSPs, besides #5 was that they were inflexible. The tactics they pulled probably work for smaller companies, but it won't work at the scale I deal in. Keep in mind that at least $30,000 a month was on the line for most of them. Had they been willing to play ball just a little bit more, we would have tried to meet them halfway. But because they were so rigidly stuck in their platforms, they lost out. Except for the copier dudes - they got their copiers and they're happy as pigs in dung.

My intern is going to be getting an offer for full-time employment as a Junior Sysadmin next Monday, with the possibility for another intern or full-timer later in the year. I think this is the best possible outcome.

**Edit:** Just as an FYI, I am responding to your commentary. However, this account is under a day old and therefore is falling victim of the wrath of /u/automoderator. 

**Edit 2:** To answer a few common questions to get us through the night, since I want to keep this going and I appreciate both the feedback and grilling.

*Question: Why didn't you hire an employee?* That's what we're in the process of doing. The intern is being brought on full-time, and if that works out, we're looking at getting another intern/FTE later on. However, because of the real possibility that an MSP was a better solution, we needed to do due diligence and interview 
MSPs to fill that role.

*Statement: You're probably a non-ideal customer for an MSP.* This is probably a true statement. However, I didn't know that until I went out an got MSPs to provide proposals. If I wanted to be an asshole to myself, I'd say I just wrote a 10,000 word essay on ""look how these MSPs didn't fit my exact requirements""! I look at this more as, ""I went through this process, and this is what happened"".

*Statement: Your environment is to esoteric for an MSP to handle.* This is to address /u/brochacho6000. This is also probably a true statement. However, as I noted in one of my hopefully-to-appear-soon comments, I never faulted an MSP for not wanting to support something that wasn't their standard. I faulted them for wanting to implement their standards without consideration for what the speed, haphazardness or the actual implementation would do to the business. I take greater issue with the rip-and-replace methodology to implement the solution rather than the solution itself, except where the solution is obviously bonkers. I mean, come on, replacing an 8-blade chassis switch on a 4Tb backplane with a stack of 8 switches on 10Gb connections? Really?

In better terms, I wouldn't mind switching everything to Kaseya if the MSP is willing to take responsibility for getting us through that process. That was a hard pill for a lot of them to swallow.

*Statement: We're an MSP! Hire us!* The decision has been made for the foreseeable future. I'm not in the US either.

**Edit 3:** More comments are coming. Again, I'm just chilling with /u/automoderator.

**Edit 4:** I'm free of the tyranny of the /u/automoderator!"

During school, I went to the career center six times for events and advice. I had my resume looked at, 3 times. I also went there to ask for help finding experience. They never helped me. Then I went to my professors and asked them for help finding an internship, research, or anything. They never replied (I emailed at least 4). I was also kind of active, with me being an ACM officer, and attending many networking events and presentations.

Boom. I graduated now. I've been applying everywhere, and it's been a hellhole. I've been applying starting the year before graduation.

Now it's been really depressing. My body hurts. My mind hurts. I've been practicing my skills, every day. I volunteered to help someone with programming for an organization. 

Yesterday, I decided to email my CS department for advice. I got the reply today. Basically, they looked at my grades, and said paraphrased, ""you did really well in all these courses, so you should have no problem getting a job. You just lack confidence. We understand that everyone who graduated so far has had no problems finding a job."" 

Holy. Apparently I'm the only person without a job. Imagine someone telling you're the only one who can't get a job."

I lost 2 years by being on another course for 1 year before moving to Computer Engineering (was on Electrical Engineering (manly learned C, MAtLab, LaTeX and Electrical fundamentals)) and lost another one because I had one discipline left to do (Physics) and decided to do another curricular internship to improve my course average (which I'm finishing at this very moment).

I've been lurking this sub for a while and finally decided to post something as I've had a few ongoing struggles with motivation.

I've been producing music for a few years now and through thick and thin that has been the one thing in my life that has stayed consistent and I've really put lots of time and effort into. Music is my true love and I want to make a career out of it, hopefully a really successful one.

My struggles pretty much started after I graduated school. I moved to Atlanta for an internship because I thought it was what I wanted to do. I was an intern for a while and doing intern-y type stuff, but in the back of my head I saw the direction it was going (in my mind most interns at the studio were headed to be recording/mixing engineers, and while I respect that craft, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing) and I chose to opt out. Part of me regrets the decision because A. I could've built up great contacts and B. I could've done the recording/mixing work there but still work on my own craft in the meantime (which I didn't like the idea of doing) but what happened, happened, and I ended up leaving the studio and moving home.

It took some convincing from my parents as they were financially supporting me while I was there, but I convinced them and myself that I was going to move home to focus on my solo career, and give myself a year to get off the ground and 'build my buzz' so to speak. I was told I needed to get some sort of job to pay the bills and support myself, which I obviously agreed to and knew I needed to do.

So I moved home and thats where the problems have started. I basically have been home for 2 months now, and the first month was primarily me just working on music. I was couped up in the house a lot, and had no income. I wasn't even looking for a job. Month two rolls around and is coming to a close now, and I'm just noticing weird things about myself that are pretty uncharacteristic. For example, I had a job lined up as a dishwasher, and then had a friend tell me he could get me a job at the gas station he works at, so even though I had been hired at the dishwashing job, I told them I got another job and I couldn't work there due to schedule conflicts. So gas station job training starts, and I'm there for one day of training and decide to quit. It was my pride talking me out of it, saying that I would rather have 0 income and be able to work on music all day, then give up time (only during the weekends mind you) to work at a job that I despised. So now I'm back in the same situation as I was in when I first moved back: no job, no money, just the music.

But I think the ultimate problem lies in the fact that I'm never doing much to progress my musical career aside from the fact that I actually am making the music on my computer (im an electronic producer fwiw) - and what I mean by that is, I'm not going out networking, I'm not getting involved in the local scene which is Boston, and I feel like overall I'm having social anxiety issues like I've never had before, so that has been really hard as well. My parents look at me differently now, as I'm basically couped up all day at the house and when they come home it feels like I have nothing to tell them. I feel like a bum, and I'm sure they look at me in that way which is tough because two years ago when I went away to school I felt like the world was my oyster. I will say however, I have been applying to a lot of music related jobs in the city and so far no luck, I've probably sent out like 10-15 applications in the last few weeks.

I feel like I am pretty insightful as to my own problems, but whatever has gotten into me lately has just been filled with self-doubt, social anxiety, and a real defensive attitude towards any and everyone.

Sorry for the rant, I'm not even sure how one would answer this post, but I was just looking for some advice and comments from anybody who is willing to contribute."

For at least half a decade nothing has really excited me. I feel so numb to everything and haven't had a good cry since I was like 11ish (and believe me I have tried). I am a generally reserved person and have had anxiety for a long time; I'm constantly over-analyzing everything and my hands are always sweaty. I'm trying to work on this by trying new things that are outside of my comfort zone, one of them being making an account on reddit and posting (I have been a lurker for quite a few years).

However, a lot of these things would get me in trouble at home, as my mom (dad isn't in the picture) is very religious and might kick me out depending on the severity of said action. This makes me paranoid which doesn't really help with the over-analyzing/anxiety. With that being said I am a person who thinks highly of themselves (I don't think less of others, I used to but luckily I've grown out of that) and have enough willpower to override my fear.

My latest adventure was trying weed out for the first time - it was fantastic. However, I recognize that weed is not a solution and will only use it recreationally, at max once a week (realistically once a month) and only with friends.

In addition to trying out new things here is what I do:

1.Work Out - this is a big part of my life. I lift 5 days a week (have been doing so since high school) and I believe this is why I have a lot of confidence in myself, even though I am paranoid.

2. NoFap - I have been trying to successfully complete the 90 day challenge for a while now. I usually fail because I tend to try to ""test"" myself and edge. No more of that. Period. This time I will make it to 90 and maybe even stop forever.

3. Cold showers - this is relatively new and was extremely hard for me to do (I love my hot showers! lol). It did increase my willpower and slightly decrease my anxiety, but so far I'm only a week in.

4. Open up - I told my best friend about my agnostic beliefs, which was something that was very hard to do. I also told him about how my dad ran out on us (he was a bad person and I am happy he is out of our lives) and how my family is financially not sound (me and my sibling are graduating college right after one another so this should soon be a lot less of an issue once we get jobs).

5. Talk to strangers - I try to introduce myself and be friendly with people. However, I am horrible at small talk and often draw blanks. Also, I have a very stoic face and have been told I look depressed or angry - which doesn't help when meeting new people (I do try to smile though, but it doesn't look genuine when it isn't).

Also, there is a girl at work (summer intern, like me) that I like. I think she likes me too and I want to ask her out. However, if we do go out we will have to keep it a secret because if my mom finds out my life would be over (my brother goes to the same school as me and he isn't on the same page, so there would be a decent chance of my mom finding out through him). I don't want to burden her like that, but I also can't spend the next 3 or so years repressing myself. I don't know what to do.

Do you guys have any advice on what to do in this situation? Also, is there anything else I should add to my list of self-improvement?"

3bl5nh,1,2015-06-29,Should I take this internship?,castro524,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bl5nh/should_i_take_this_internship/,"Hello,

I don't know if this is the correct place to ask for advice, but it does relate to money. So, I applied for a summer internship through the MESA center at my community college and recently got word that I got it. Now I called and asked to confirm my spot, as the internship starts next and I had already believed I didn't receive it. They tell me I received the spot but that they had forgotten to send out the emails last week. The reason I mention this is because I work full time. I want to participate in the internship, but if I do I would have to quite short notice. I called my boss and asked her if I would be able to work weekends until it is over, which is at the end of July. She told me no and that if I did quit it was not going to be properly, basically telling me that if I wanted my job back or a job at the resort again I would not get it. This shocked me as she has always seemed supportive of my schooling. 

Anyways I need to decide if I am going to take the internship. I am leaning towards no, even though I believe it is best for me simply because I have a car payment. I live with my parents and pay for no rent or food. I do have 3 months worth of car payments and insurance covered as well as some money for gas. However like I said, I believe I should do this because it would give me more experience and an upper hand when applying for 4 year universities to transfer out to. The job I work at now has nothing to do with my degree, which is in aerospace engineering, and really wouldn't bother me if I left. The Internship would pay for all my housing and food while there and pay me $1000 for 3 weeks. Anyhow, I still think of the car payments and although I know I can get a job in the 2 months I would have afterwards I feel, i don't know, scared I guess that something might happen. 

Anyone out there that has had a decision like this to make before? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank You! I am sorry if this is long I just wanted to give out as much information as possible thanks!"

She (21F) and I have been living together for a little over two years now. About ago month we moved into a new apartment in a new town, but she hasn't stayed in our apartment at all because she accepted an internship position out of state.

Last week I received a text message from her saying that she could no longer afford to live with me and that she would be moving in with her grandparents. Her financial troubles come as no surprise to me, as I've lent her approximately $1,200 over the past year to help her get on her feet. She has made a few small payments to me, but still owes me over one grand.

Only my name is on the lease, so technically she can leave without any legal ramifications. I told her that she would need to bring me a cashier's check for what she still owes me before I would let her into my apartment to collect her things and officially move out. After I told her this, she completely stopped communicating with me. After not hearing from her for a couple of days, I told her that I would not be able to afford to live in the apartment on my own, and that if she didn't get me a check by July 15 that I would be selling her things so that I will be able to move. It's been over a week and she has since blocked my phone number (presumably), removed me from her facebook friends, and even blocked me from facebook. 

I don't want to sell her things, obviously. This is going to be a huge hassle for me, and I don't want to take all of her belongings away from her. I just am really at a loss for what to do, and any advice that you could give me would be much appreciated. We have several mutual friends that I suppose I could talk to, and I have her grandparents' phone number/address. I would really like to get in contact with her to sort this out, but I just don't know what route to take.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
3blcjz,3,2015-06-29,(21m) Falling in love with another intern at work. Has boyfriend.,Overth3re4,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3blcjz/21m_falling_in_love_with_another_intern_at_work/,"So I started this internship about 6 weeks ago. ""Falling in love"" may be an exaggeration, but she's pretty much all I can think about in and outside of work. It's driving me nuts. I've fallen for girls before, but it always ends up not working out and i'm really hoping this can be the one time that something good happens.

I'll try to make this short as possible. So, the interns are all in the same conference room for all 8 hours of the day, therefore I see her all the time. We don't sit at the same table, but she is always coming over to my desk and talking to me. I'm not the best at reading people, but I feel like she has some feelings for me that are more than are more than ""just friends"". She always singles me out when we're in a group conversation. And will e-mail me sometimes just to joke around. But I'm also really bad at reading people so I could be wrong. 

She is someone that makes coming to work enjoyable (which is very rare for me). The weird thing is that I didn't know she had a boyfriend until about 2 weeks after we really started to become good friends. I never asked her if she had one, but she never brought him up.

Basically, my question is...what do I do? We have about 6 more weeks of the internship. If I tell her how I feel then...

**#1** she has a boyfriend, and **#2**, if she doesn't feel the same way, then it will be incredibly awkward at work

Maybe I should stay friends and just wait until they break up?

Update: See comment about what I've decided"

Oklahoma City, OK",Llenylime,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3bldre/i_am_having_trouble_with_my_soontobeformer/,"My roommate and I live in an apartment together in Oklahoma City, OK. Due to some scheduling circumstances, only my name is on the lease. We moved in a little over a month ago, but she's accepted an internship position out of state so she hasn't been here at all, except to drop off her belongings. 

A little over a week ago she texted me saying that she would be moving out. Her name isn't on the lease so there's nothing I can do to stop her. Over the past couple of years, I've loaned her about $1,200, which she has neglected to pay me back. Now I am going to have to move again and pay a lease termination fee equal to one month's rent.

I asked her to split the termination fee with me, as well as pay me back in full by means of cashier's check before I let her into my apartment to collect her things. Since sending her this text she has ceased all communication with me and has ignored all of my attempts at communication.

I've given notice to my apartment that I'll be moving out, and I have a little under a month to have all of my belongings out of the apartment. If she doesn't contact me, what can I legally do with her things? I'm tempted to try to sell them to make up for what she owes me, but I don't want to get myself into any legal trouble over this.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

3blio2,1,2015-06-30,"Need some help and insight, I have a few questions (engineering)",RiverBiscuit,UNCCharlotte,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/3blio2/need_some_help_and_insight_i_have_a_few_questions/,"Hey everyone, 

I am a transfer student who is coming to UNCC's Mechanical Engineering program after leaving NCSU's Aerospace Engineering program, and I'm hoping that someone who is subscribed here can help me with something I've been debating about. 


First some background: 

I have always loved working on cars or anything mechanical, and ended up taking two years of automotive classes in high school. After that, I joined the Navy and worked on F/A-18's. I have always wanted to be an Engineer, and so after leaving the Navy, that's what I set out to do. 


I did my first 3 semesters at Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, and I did pretty well. I took care of Calc 1-3, Physics 1 &amp; 2, and a few other classes, and transferred to NCSU going into my Sophomore year. My last semester at WTCC I got a 4.0 (Calc 3, Physics 2, and Spanish 2). 

Despite doing well at WTCC and transferring with a 3.5, I had a terrible sophomore year at State. My main courses were Statics, Dynamics, Solids, and Diff EQ, and out of all of those, the only class I enjoyed was Diff EQ. I got so bored with drawing FBD's over and over again, and tirelessly deriving things without ever gaining an intuitive feel for any of the material we learned. I honestly don't feel any smarter about any of the subjects than I did before those classes, and that bothers me as I feel like I should be adding tools to my tool box with every semester. The two classes that I took in my major (Intro to Aerospace and Aerodynamics) were extremely dry, and even my wind tunnel lab turned out to be painstakingly boring. I spend countless hours in the library doing homework and studying for tests, but at the end of the day, I still had a terrible year (2.5 GPA) and don't feel like I learned anything. 

I am really a hands on type of learner, and it has been a hard change for me to go from working with my hands all of the time and feeling smart and capable, to sitting in a classroom getting lectured about theory and feeling completely stupid. Sometimes I just can't see the real-world application of endlessly deriving things and never seeing where it applies. We rarely used anything except for variables in my Aerodynamics class. 

I have been told by a few people that UNCC's Engineering programs are different (and it looks that way by the curriculum) and a little more hands on than the programs at NCSU. I am really hoping that this is the case, because I don't know if I can put up with two more years of what I just went through. I am trying to get into the Motorsports program and participate in Forumla SAE and all of that, but I'm hoping that the core curriculum as a whole is a little less dry. I honestly wouldn't have felt qualified to be an engineer if I would have continued at NC State (if it would have stayed that way throughout my time there). 

I have also seen the Mechanical Engineering Technology degree, and this is kind of new to me as NCSU didn't offer one. The only thing that I've really heard about it is the stigma that it isn't ""real engineering"", but from reading the ABET website description of what it is, it does seem a little more in line with what I want. However, I don't want to give up on what I have already started and regret it, and I am afraid if I switched there wouldn't be as many job opportunities and the starting pay would be lower (although if I enjoyed going to work every day, I wouldn't really mind as long as there was room for growth). I head some companies stick their nose up at people with BSMET degrees because they don't know what all the coursework covers. 

I have had two internships at this point (UTC Aerospace Systems and NAVAIR Systems), and it has been far more deskwork and excel than I would have liked, with little to no hands-on (not just for myself as an intern, but this is what I observed of the engineers as a whole). At NAVAIR, all it seemed like anyone did was update publications and try to act overly smart if one of the hourly workers asked them a question. There didn't seem to be any actual ""engineering"" going on at either place. If I have to go to work and sit in a cubicle 90% of the time I am going to be miserable. I like to think of it in the sense of a prototype- I would rather be testing it and building it with some design input than designing it and maybe getting to touch it a little sometime. I'm not sure if this is actually how it works in the real world of engineering, but I don't really have much to go off of here with my limited experience. 

So after this rant, I guess I should boil it down to a few questions: 
-For those of you in the Mechanical Engineering program, how hands-on are the courses? Do you feel like it's just endless theory and no application? Do you feel like you'll be a good and effective engineer who is equally ready to grind out Diff Eq's or go in the shop and weld something together?

-For those of you in Mechanical Engineering Technology, how bad does the stigma affect you, or have you even noticed it at all? What are your internships like? Are you worried about finding a good job after you graduate or making enough money? What kind of job do you expect to have? 
 
-For those of you who have switched (in either direction), why did you do it? Are you happier now, or do you wish you would have stayed where you started? 


I hope this all made sense, thank you for your time. I may edit this a little and post it to one of the engineering subreddits as well, but I also really want some insight that is specific to UNCC's programs since that will apply to me most. "
3bljdy,2,2015-06-30,"Me (24f) and longdistance bf (22m), together almost 4 yrs, just not sure if I'm into it anymore (long, sorry)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bljdy/me_24f_and_longdistance_bf_22m_together_almost_4/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3.5 years. I am 24 and he is 22. In October, I told him I was ready to take our relationship to the next level and wanted to talk about getting engaged. He was unwilling to talk about it or consider it and I think it has taken a major toll on our relationship. He graduated from college at the beginning of May, so we are now long distance (about 2 hours driving time). I am currently finishing up my last year of grad school, and he wants me to consider looking for jobs near where he lives. But I’m not sure I can do it anymore…

In the past few months, everything he has been doing is annoying me. The stuff he posts on social media and literally just the fact that he wants to talk EVERY. SINGLE. DAY and gets angry if I am not able to answer him right away has become a huge issue. I am completing my internship to become a therapist and meet with clients practically all day, but he refuses to hear that. He says I am not putting enough time into our relationship, but I work 8-hour days, do my internship at least 4-5 hours per day, AND go to school on top of it all; I don’t have a ton of free time. 

Like I said, he just graduated in May, with a good degree. He has the potential to get an awesome job with good money until he starts school again in fall 2016. However, right now he’s working at a restaurant. He refuses to search for a job where he can use his degree because “no one will pay him enough” and he does not want to work a 40-hour work week. I try to help him find jobs online to apply for and he dismisses me. He keeps saying he’s “going to start looking” but puts it off because his resume is not ready and he “needs his mom to help him with it.” I’m frustrated because I feel like he doesn’t want to be an adult. He was in a fraternity in college and is fucking obsessed with it – it is all he posts about. He took a position on the frat’s alumni board and that is how he spends his free time – researching stuff for the fraternity. The last time I went to visit him, he spent the majority of his time on the computer doing “Research”.

I last went to visit him about 3 weeks ago, and something he said became the final nail in the coffin, I think. We were talking about what we would like at our wedding when we got married, and who we would have in our wedding party. I named four of my closest girlfriends, and mentioned that I’d also like to have my friend Aaron in our wedding, who is gay. My boyfriend looked at me like I grew another head and said “there is NO way Aaron will ever be in our wedding.” He didn’t elaborate why, but I think it’s because my boyfriend’s family is SUPER catholic and demands a Catholic wedding, and my friend being in our wedding party would somehow offend his family. 

His and his family’s beliefs are another issue I’ve been thinking about. They are very Catholic. My boyfriend goes to church every week because he lives with his parents and says his mom “forces” him to. Religion is not a huge deal to him, however, he says if we were to get married, it would have to be a Catholic wedding because his mom would not accept anything else. I have a huge issue with the whole non-Catholics having to ‘agree’ to raise their children Catholic and send them to Catholic school. I want my kids (if I ever have any) to be worldly and not bound to any particular religion. I also feel shitty that my boyfriend seems to agree with his mom more than me, and doesn’t really stick up for me. I told him we can have Catholic wedding, but I did NOT want a mass because my family is not Catholic and would not be able to participate. He told me I would just have to deal with it. If we are going to spend our lives together and you want to agree with your mom on everything and do everything just to appease her…I don’t think this is going to work out.

8 months ago, I really did want to get married to him and start our life together, but I’m not so sure anymore. I don’t know if I’m just too busy for a relationship right now (is that even a thing?) or just don’t want to be with HIM. The thought of spending time with him isn’t something that I look forward to or get excited about anymore – it feels like a technicality that I have to deal with. He is also very certain he wants 3-4 children, and I am starting to wonder if I even want kids at all…I just feel like we are going different directions. He’s just finished college, and I’m almost done with my master’s degree and ready to start my career and adult life. I don’t know if it’s just the wrong time, or really what is going on.

I’m starting to think maybe this relationship should just end due to some conflict of interests. I have a hard time thinking about it…we’ve been together for so long. I admit, I have the whole “I’m afraid to be alone, I will never find anyone else who will love me” syndrome…plus many of my friends are getting married in the next two years, which makes it even more difficult for me to think about breaking up with my longterm partner. Any advice would be appreciated!

TLDR: Long-distance boyfriend and I seem to have different ideas of what we want in life and are in two different places right now. I’m afraid of being alone, but I don’t get excited to see him anymore. Should I just end it now?

I know my lead got my back, but I've realized as an intern, no one gives a shit about me and I have to literally force help out of them, since they are reluctant to go out of their way to help me. I don't want to bother them since they are busy to be fair, but I'm here to learn, I'm here to learn what I can't get out of school, last thing I want is to leave this internship with no gained knowledge.  Should I be more aggressive in getting help? Should not give a fuck about these employees, and try to learn as much from them as I can, even with their busy schedules and indifference to an intern? Should I force them to help me? Should I make them my books? I'm here for 3 months, I need to take control of my internship."

3blmwz,1,2015-06-30,Some questions on the Graduate(MS) CS program.,ankitvg,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/3blmwz/some_questions_on_the_graduatems_cs_program/,"Hello slugs,

I am an incoming international graduate student for the MS in CS program at UCSC. While the time of my application, website mentioned that we require 48 credits to earn our degree, however a few days back while I was planing my class schedule for the upcoming quarters, I learned that credit requirement has come down to 40 only. So basically, it is possible to complete MS at the end of the Spring 2016 semester for me (I start in Fall 2015). Before graduating, I wish to spend as much time as possible in the industry/research projects.

My questions are:

1) Will this decreased credit requirement have impact on the ""value"" of masters degree in CS at UCSC?

2) I crawled through the whole UCSC CS department website and couldn't find the minimum credit requirement to be taken in a quarter to be considered as a full-time student. Please share your knowledge on the same.

3) Is it possible to do co-op internship as an international masters student at UCSC? I have heard some colleges require students to take some number of credits while they go for co-op. What are the conditions at UCSC?

4) Course enrollment has began. I wanted to take CMPS242:Machine Learning course this quarter so I would be eligible for Advance Machine Learning course to be offered in next quarter. But the course if full. I have mailed Prof. Helmbold regarding my issue and requested him to take me into his class; yet to receive a reply. Can I attend his classes for the first 2 weeks and wait for people who might drop CMPS242 and ask him again to take me into this class? Is it possible?

5)  Who is Wesley Mackey?

Thanks guys ;)"

    I know people complain about it, but I actually like the explicit `cat` at
    the beginning of a pipeline... makes it more clear and readable where the
    data is initially coming from.

3blqqq,1,2015-06-30,"[US] Moving abroad for a few years, need a moderate gaming/Excel laptop with a 15.6"" or 17.3"" screen ($800-$1,100)",iamlookingtosell,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/3blqqq/us_moving_abroad_for_a_few_years_need_a_moderate/,"**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: US

* Budget range: $800-$1,100 (may stretch $100 or so for a great laptop. I'd like this to last a few years)

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming/desktop replacement

* Screen size preference: I enjoy larger screens

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows 7. I'm willing to upgrade to 10 but I am NOT a fan of 8.1. I've used 8.1 in an internship and I didn't enjoy it. Not a fan of the interface on Macs and not sure a laptop in this range will run WINE well enough.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):
Sims 4, TF2, Civ IV, Rayman, GTA V, many other ones that may not make full use.
* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.):
Needs to be able to run 30-40 tabs at a time in Firefox. I also often have 3-4 Word and Excel documents open as well as Skype and e-mail. I want this to have a beautiful screen as I will not be taking my desktop and tv with me to Germany

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility):

None that I can think of. I really wish I could have just built this myself.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):

It doesn't need to be ultra slim. If I can do moderate gaming on it, that's fine. It should be somewhat durable.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance:

High Performance and long battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance:
Build quality/high performance

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

As long as it isn't burning my thighs, high performance takes preference

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: Possibly

* A great keyboard: Sure?

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I've got a gaming mouse so nah.

* Great audio: This is a plus, or I can just grab a set of nice headphones

**List any features that are critical:**

I want this laptop to be secure. Perhaps one that comes with encryption of some sort. I'm very paranoid about my own safety. I like running Tor. I want this laptop's security to be tight. I'd prefer it not come with loads of bloatware (although I can uninstall). I've also been advised to not to go with Intel U processors. Avoiding these would be nice. A dedicated card and a decently sized SSD are essential. This should be able to run Skype and games like TF2/Gmod at max settings at the same time. Fast boot times and loading are great. I'd like a larger screen."

3bm1g7,2,2015-06-30,Phone interview Internship,AMontero62,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/3bm1g7/phone_interview_internship/,"Hello to everyone.

I am a law student applying in a big 4 in Germany (internship in transfer pricing), they already told me that they want to have one “phone interview”, but I am quite unsure what does that means, in terms of interviewing process in a big 4.

All my friends that had applied had one interview with HR and then one with partner or some “businessman/woman” and I don’t know which stage I am, my friends had applied in Spain and maybe in Germany things work different... since is not my native language any sort of anticipation on “what will be” could be really helpful, any idea? Will be like a human resources interview? Has nothing to do with it? Thank you very much although I appreciate any German answer, I am sure “phone interview” are not only made in Germany so any help from anywhere will be perfect.

PD: I have done the “logical thinking and reading exams”

PD2: i am quite new at posting in reddit, I hope everything is ok.

I’m very excited about learning more about Moldova and Chisinau, and I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it easy to find ATMs that will take Western European chip-and-pin cards? I have read contradictory things about this online.

2. I’m learning some Romanian at the moment but am still on the basics. Is English spoken in many restaurants and shops?

3. What’s the best way to travel around the city? I’ve heard there’s a trolley bus system.

My name is Tom and I am the social media intern at The House Shop, an online property portal for private landlords (check us out - https://www.thehouseshop.com/) 

I have been tasked with creating a video about 'living and working in Wimbledon'. As we all know, the Wimbledon tennis tournament is currently taking place and will be lasting for the next two weeks. We are looking to find out what effect the event has on those who reside in the Wimbledon area as well as the effect the tournament has on trade for local businesses.

If anyone here falls into the catergories of living or working in Wimbledon or knows of someone who may be able to help me with this task, please drop me a PM and we could hopefully get an interview arranged for 1st July (morning or afternoon)

We are looking to ask general questions such as effect on transport congestion, litter, crime,  parking space rentals (if this is something you are doing this year). Please also don't hold back on your thoughts about the tennis. We are trying to obtain a mixture of responses. So if you adore it or you need to rant about it, why not have a quick chat with us.

Thanks for your time Reddit!

Like the title says, I am an aspiring program evaluator.

Is joining the American Evaluation Association worth the money? 
What blogs/twitter feeds/ email lists do you all follow and/or find worthwhile? 
Are there any trainings/certification I should look into getting that would increase my skill set/marketability?
Im a bit of a data viz nerd, does anyone have any recommendations for books/resources I should look into? 
Lastly, I have a year left of grad school, but I am always updating/modifying my resume, would anyone be willing to give it a once over and provide some constructive feedback? 

Thanks!

3bmfyv,7,2015-06-30,Help finding an internship at a Library or Historical Society,Macaroknee,dayton,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/3bmfyv/help_finding_an_internship_at_a_library_or/,"Hello fellow Dayton Redditors! 

I would just like to preface this post with a little info about the most amazing person I know. I originally wrote a huge piece but figured I would break it down into a somewhat smaller tl;dr post so you all don't have to dig through paragraphs upon paragraphs upon paragraphs. 

*First and foremost my mom is the most amazing, sweetest, and caring person I know.

*The past 4 years she has gone from a GED to one step away from a Bachelor of Science in Information and Library Services all while working a very physical full-time job and taking care of her mother who suffers from numerous mental and physical disabilities. 

*She has a 3.9 GPA and has made the Deans List or Presidents List every single semester of college. She has been out of school for 30 years mind you. She completely blows my mind. Her dedication and work ethic are unparalleled. 

*She recently moved to Dayton from a tiny close-knit New England town to be closer to my brother and I.

*Things were going great. She was feeling more comfortable day by day. She found a decent job to hold her over until she graduated. Ecstatic to be just minutes away from her children again.

*Robbed at gunpoint at her place of employment a few weeks ago. Emotionally distraught. A third of her hair turned grey that week. She vacated her position at work as she was too frightened to return. My mother would never hurt a fly and it angers me deeply that someone did that to her. No arrests, no leads, the police have bigger fish to fry, sadly. 

*The house she owns in New England was being rented by a tenant she believed would fulfill the lease. He did not and missed months of rent which went directly to her mortgage payment. She had to evict him. Since she was unable to pay her mortgage for months due to the tenant, and the unfortunate events that led to her leaving her position at her job, the bank is threatening foreclosure if not acted upon soon.

*The robbery and foreclosure notice happened the same week as the majority of her finals. Despite being incredibly shaken and distracted my mother passed all her finals with flying colors. She once again showed me that she is capable of anything. 

*Her degree is a Bachelor in Information and Library Services. It is somewhat of a uncommon degree, nonetheless is was the one my mom felt most passionate about achieving. My mother is a quiet and reserved woman who has a love for literature and history alike. Her dream job is as a Librarian but her door is always open to opportunity.

* The only requirement she has left in order to earn her degree is a internship at either a Library or Historical Society. She has contacted nearly every library and historical society in the greater Dayton area. (Dayton, Kettering, Beavercreek, Fairborn, etc, etc) Hardly any of them even reply and the ones that have stated that they do not have any internships available at this time. Her time to find an internship in Ohio is dwindling down and she is starting to lose hope.

*Though she doesn't want to, she is heavily contemplating moving back up north into her house, retaining a position at a previous employer, and finding an internship there. The college she attends has guaranteed placement within the state libraries there. That is a viable option, but one she really does not want to take. She wants to stay close to family and Dayton has FAR more opportunities employment wise than the area in New England in which she would be living. 

*I know this is a very long post but I'm just really hoping someone can help my mother out with finding a internship. We don't know anyone here and we don't have any connections. She just wanted to be close to her boys. She has worked harder than anyone I know to get to where she is in life. I guarantee as even just an intern she would be one of the libraries greatest assets. She is my hero and she deserves the best and nothing less. If anyone has ANY advice whatsoever please comment or PM. I would be so grateful and I know she would too. Thank you all so very much! "
3bmh2s,1,2015-06-30,I need to turn down a great opportunity. How do I do it without burning bridges?,ikarka,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3bmh2s/i_need_to_turn_down_a_great_opportunity_how_do_i/,"I am a student and recently applied for internships. As they are super, super competitive I applied for 3 different companies. 

I received a call back for a really great employer (#1), and attended the interview. However, before I heard back from them, I also got an interview with firm #2. A few days after the interview, I received an offer from employer #1. Over the phone I was really excited, however I held on to the formal letter of offer waiting to hear from firm #2. About a week and a half later, I was also offered a position with firm #2. This was a fortnight ago.

I agonised and finally decided on firm #2. This is because the position with firm #2 is a year long part-time position with much better hireback. Firm #1 is an amazing firm too, but it is only for a month and is small with less chance of further employment. I was supposed to do this in March 2016.

I planned to call Firm #1 as soon as I received the formal offer for Firm #2 but I am yet to receive it. This is really awkward because Firm #1 is having a 'Christmas in July' welcome party next Wednesday and I am supposed to attend. Obviously I can't go, but I also fear turning them down and then the other one falling through.

So I guess I am looking for advice in 2 parts:

1. Should I wait until I receive the formal offer from Firm #2, or trust the phone call? I sort of doubt they would renege but still worried.

2. How can I approach the phone call? I know it is going to be awkward but I want to minimise future damage, both for my employment prospects and also because they are really nice people and I am genuinely very sorry to be turning down what is a great offer.

I have very bad anxiety and I am really working myself into a lather about this! Any advice would be appreciated :)"

I want to go to grad school so im looking at entrance exams.  I currently have around a 3.0 and 3 summers of intern experience.  not the best grades but certainly not out of the running.  my question is will I have a better chance getting accepted taking the GMAT as opposed to the GRE?

3bmmsb,3,2015-06-30,[Advice] 18 y/o recently hired in cybersecurity looking for guidance financially,Aerto_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bmmsb/advice_18_yo_recently_hired_in_cybersecurity/,"Hello all,  
I am an 18 year old male living in the Fort Worth/Dallas, Texas area with my Mother (50) and Sister (12). I have been interested in cyber security and within the past year I had a job shadow of a Security Analyst at a 600+ person company. Since then, I have been offered an internship, and recently a full time job making $40,000 per year. I graduated high school with a 3.989 GPA and will be attending Penn State Online to further my education in Cyber Security.  
  
Now to the finance part. I ended high school, got this job, and had to select an online college all within the past 2 weeks. As you can imagine, this is a fairly crazy part of my life right now. I live with my mother and sister as previously said and we live in a good neighborhood close to my grandparents. My mother is recently divorced and we don't talk to my father as he is an alcoholic that needs to get his life together. Anyways, my mother makes roughly $35,000 a year. I am currently at a loss on what to do. The company I work for is offering me $40,000 and will reimburse my college at $1,000 per semester. The will also pay for a bootcamp and certification every year. Those run anywhere between $1,500 and $5,000. They offer full benefits which I assume is a good thing. I want to plan for the future so I can live comfortably later on in life. I don't mind saving if it will help me later on. I drive a 2011 Nissan Altima that costs ~$175 a month. We also borrow money from my grandparents to help pay for the house we live in. They don't mind at all since we are so close and we help them out physically in any way they need. I have a debit card and use it for basically everything.  

Now that you know the backstory here are the questions I have,  
1. Should I get a credit card? How to build up credit?  
2. I will be paying my mom roughly ~$500 a month to cover my living expenses at our current house. Would it be more beneficial for me to move into an apartment by myself? We have discussed that as an option.  
3. Saving, here is where I want the most help. What can I do to ensure that by the time I'm 30-40 I will be living comfortably? What are some options that I can do now to save and have my money work for me?  
4. If I do stay at home, would it be okay to upgrade to another car?  
5. What are the ""rules"" as to how much to spend on certain things? Like 20% on your car, 40% on living, etc.  
6. Any other advice that you can throw at me! I really want to make sure that I can live without worry later on.   
  
  
Thank you for reading and let me know if you need any more information. I might not respond right away as I am currently at work."

3bmxnz,4,2015-06-30,"Succeeding In Corporate America, Response and analysis of some questions and complaints regarding the issue of a living minimum wage, and whether or not America rewards a strong work ethic.",Cad42988,inthenews,https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/3bmxnz/succeeding_in_corporate_america_response_and/,"I would first like to mention this is a response to a previous thread called ""Salaried workers who earn nearly $1,000 per week would become eligible for overtime pay under a proposal President Barack Obama unveiled Monday"" by OP /u/bulldog75 that can be found here. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3blho3/salaried_workers_who_earn_nearly_1000_per_week/
My response Is mainly geared toward the comments regarding men and women who work long hard hours for little money, and why they are not rewarded for their hard work. I mostly analyze the issue by drawing from my own life experience. While there is no empirical evidence or data in my analysis. I could easily find plenty to support it, and would be happy to do so upon request!

That's because the notion that hard work is valued in America is a lie. I once had a high-school math teacher tell me, ""if you're smart enough you'll never have to work a day in your life."" At the time I interpreted this to mean that I would find a job I loved so much that I wouldnt consider it work, however I would still need to work my ass off to get and hold that job.

More than ten years later I feel like I have a much better understanding of how the world works and now I realize that what she said should actually be taken literally. I have found that companies are most impressed by the person who can create the best and most creative shortcuts to avoid ever actually working. I think my life up until this point if anything is proof of that.

During High-school I was a major Slacker and basically blew off everything. I graduated with only a 2.2 GPA. every term at the parent teacher conferences my parents heard, ""He's such a gifted boy, if only we could get him to apply himself."" I was grounded from the 6th grade until I turned 16, because my parents did not allow us to get C's on our report cards. In the 7th grade I literally got straight C's for an entire year.

When I turned 16 I got a job that paid very well for a 16 y/o at the time, and I basically got paid $12/hr to do nothing. I worked this job all the way through undergrad and managed to complete my B. A. with no debt. in College I was an even bigger slacker than I was in high-school, however I became much smarter about it. I would only register for classes between 2-9 pm, taught by professors who did not take attendance. After my first semester I realized I could fit all my classes into two days a week. the first year I was there I developed a strategy that involved sitting by the nerdiest looking girl in the class who was above a 6 on my attractiveness scale, and immediately charm her into being my friend. then I would skip about half the classes, and basically only show up to chat with said girl, and other friends I would have/make in the class. at the end of the semester I would always bum an outline off the girl and host a study group, sharing outlines with everyone involved. from this i created one master outline which i then gave a copy off to the nerdy girl. then we would cram the night before and, 7 times out of 8, ended up hooking up.

As college went by I got into drinking, I made the deans list at the shitty Community College I attended for free, and transferred to a better school. By the time I got to my Junior year I attended on average less than 25% of my classes. I graduated in 2011 and had already decided the year before to go to law school. I rocked the LSAT studying only the night before playing logic games. Got accepted everywhere I applied even though my college gpa was average (3.0).

I decided to attend the highest ranked law school I applied to. so this is where I tell myself for months that I really actually need to put in the work. After all, every person you talk to prior to attending law school will tell you about the grueling amounts of work they have to do. My new found work ethic lasted about a week before I fell back onto old habits of never taking notes, and literally playing cash poker games online during 90% of the time i spent in class. Near the end of my first semester everyone around me starts freaking out since at my school finals are 100% of your grade first year. I did not freak out, most likely because i had always been a terrible procrastinator, am probably the only person at the school who isnt capital type A, as in Anal, And honestly just had faith that I would somehow do well even though I had only a weeks worth of notes for each class, consisting mostly of things discussed in the syllabus. 

Apparently my non-nonchalant attitude caused quite a few people in my section to think I was some kind of prodigy genius. About 3 weeks before the final I start getting random facebook msges, and even a few friend requests from people asking me to look over their outlines to see if they looked sufficient. After that my old system basically fell into my lap, and I made no effort to fight it. I made it through all but one week of lawschool without ever taking notes, or even paying attention in my classes, unless for some off reason I felt like it.

I Graduated Law School in 2014. so I thought, Ok I will definitely have to work my ass off to pass the bar right? After all it is supposedly one of the most excruciating tests one can take in academia. like many of my alumni, I decided to take a vacation immediately after graduation before my online bar class opened up. The bar class was completely on demand, with videos of the lectures streaming, practice tests, outlines ect... well about 2 weeks before the bar I still had not started studying. I basically get in a week of cramming, one day for each subject on the MBE and a cumulative day at the end.

Not only did I pass the bar, I got a job almost immediately following.
So my job consisted mostly of talking through legal problems with other first year associates, at a decently sized law firm with about 200 employees. We occasionally had to write Legal memorandums, or other short writing projects, every time I convinced someone else to write based on my own verbally expressed ideas, and told them I would proofread the work and credit them as having assisted when I passed it to my boss. 9 months later the company eliminates about 80% of the first years, which is pretty common in the legal job market. Not only was I one of just 4 attorneys to be offered a Job, I found out a couple months later that I was also the only 1 of the 4 who even attempted to negotiate salary, and as a result I managed to begin my second year with about 25% salary increase over my peers.

I literally do nothing now except explain my idea's to first years, hire unpaid interns to do things for me off my schools version of Monster job finder, and show up to expensive client lunches where I can be drunk or even stoned, as a lot of my clients now are, and I dont even have to pay for any of it! The moral of my story is, Corporate America does not respect work ethic. Work ethic is almost useless, anyone can work hard, and most of the time those who do are rewarded less than their lazier peers. My advice to you (reddit). In order to succeed, instead of working hard, focus on improving these three things about yourself. 

1. Your attitude. The problem with people who work too hard, is they often care too much. As a result they come across nervous, anxious, or weird. This often prevents the people/person who works hard(PWWH) from actually getting the credit they deserve, because when their boss has to take credit for the ideas of the people below them, they will likely not want give credit to the PWWH. This is because not only can they just take the credit themselves, no one has even heard of the PWWH, and the person cares to much about being seen as a ""good employee"" to confront their boss about it. To change this all you need to do is care about 99% less. People who dont care, often come across more relaxed, charming, and assertive than PWWH. As a result, their boss will not only be more worried about you calling them out for taking credit for your work, they will also see you as a leader, and will be more likely to include you in talks with their superiors. This is crucial for success, because It allows you to move up in the company solely based on how your bosses bosses perceive your personality during usually short time frames. This brings me to Item #2 

2. Learn to read people. I developed a texas hold' em addiction around the age of 16 when I joined my first Boss' weekly game, which lasted 8 years. As a result I had a nice head start on honing this skill. Also by the time I got to Law School I had become pretty proficient at Online poker as well, And managed to use it to pay for a decent sized chunk of my Law School expenses. Now when I say Learn to read people, I do not just mean find out if someone is bluffing or not. Watch people, see how they re-act to things, learn to read context clues in order to accurately guess things about a person before they even speak. As you do this you should be thinking, ""what is this person thinking, how will this person re-act to a given relevant hypothetical situation, and when they do that how can I best respond to further my own agenda. Once you do this for a while, people will start to become very see through and predictable. Personally I like to expand the hypothetical analysis to not only include usually 5 or more ""moves"" in, but also to include a couple back up conversation routes/Plans, in case the person act's in a way that does not conform with my top ranking predictions. I'm not sure how difficult this is for other people to master. While I think I clearly have a talent for it, I cant imagine it is impossible for anyone with Slightly above average intelligence, or higher. Then again, as far as I know, I have never lived as anyone other than myself, therefore I have no clue how difficult it actually is for others on average.

 Finally this leads me to the last, and in my opinion, most important tool you'll want to develop in order to be successful.

3. Learn to Hustle! No I do not mean quickly run to first base, or get your homework done in a hurry (although being able to write a 30 page paper the day it's due is a useful skill to have!) When I say Hustle I mean the ability to create money from nothing other than being clever! To be clear, I am not advising you to break the law, or intentionally hurt people through deception. I personally have my own moral code when it comes to hustling, but I think that will differ from person to person and is something everyone needs to find for themselves. As I previously mentioned, I paid for the entirety of my undergraduate experience while attending school, without loans. I had some scholarship and grant money but being 19 and trying to come up with even 10k a year for tuition on top of rent, bills, gas, food(beer), and spending money, can be a difficult task. So some weeks money was tight. By tight I mean, its Saturday, I already spent the entire paycheck i received 2 days ago, and I dont get paid again for another 12 days. So in order to eat drink and date I needed to find alternate sources of income.
 I continued to do this for the next 7 years and became exceptional at it. I'm not going to tell you my tricks, because I would refer to keep my IRL identity anon, and too many of my friends know my tricks and also use Reddit, and I would likely be pretty boned if anyone I work with could identify me as in this post. 
The Hustle is the most important factor in your success because this is what 90% of corporate America is Built on. all the Targets, Walmarts, and yes, even the entire legal community, is just one big hustle. None of these Jobs, or businesses actually create anything! All they do is take something from one person, whether its an idea, knowledge, or actual material goods, and they turn around and sell it to someone else at a higher price. Once you learn to hustle well on a smaller scale with your own dinner on the line, hustling rich people who have never had to take a bus in their entire life, becomes almost effortless. I know this was a way too long answer to your question, but I enjoyed spending 50 mins to type it all out, so I hope you find it useful, or at the very least, entertaining. Also I am linking a response thread I also posted it in, because I love to hear peoples reactions, and the more the merrier!

Tldr: Hard work is for suckers, if you read about half a paragraph and then jumped here you're probably already doing it right!"

I've started doing my internship and I realized, it's college life all over again. It seems that people automatically hate me when I speak in English. But I'm too scared to speak in Tagalog since I sometimes struggle with it. I'm also that ""rich"" kid who realized too late that carrying a high-end phone, driving to work, and wearing certain clothes can incite criticism. I constantly try to be careful of what I show and say nowadays.

English speaking has become a bane for me these recent years. People expect you to speak Tagalog else you're not accepted. This has impacted my social skills, tbh. For example, the way I try to mediate this problem is by speaking silently (to the point of mumbling) or just nodding yes/no at questions.

The people there do make fun of me. Sometimes, they would say it in front of my face, thinking that I wouldn't understand Tagalog or thinking that I wouldn't recognize the words they call me. After a rough week, I was overly depressed after hearing all the things they would call me, indirectly and directly.  Even just after hanging out with friends and having a good time, I went to bed crushed over the judgments made on me at work.

On the bright side, I can socialize naturally when it's one on one with someone I think wouldn't judge me for my poor Tagalog or my English preference. They would speak Tagalog and I could understand them, I'd even reply in Tagalog, oftentimes without struggling.

But when I'm in proximity with others, I react badly to people talking to me. Mumbling, broken or just plain stupid.

So I guess I'd like to ask for advice. Advice on how to deal with this and possibly fix my own problems."
3bn0e4,1,2015-06-30,Help me find a good MSP in Chicago,ScottRaymond,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3bn0e4/help_me_find_a_good_msp_in_chicago/,"So I've put in notice at my current job and I'm trying to find a competent MSP to take over once I leave.  We're a fairly small business but we have some slightly complex IT, and we're struggling to find a place that we think can handle it all.

Best case scenario, we find a place that will do everything from helpdesk (mostly keyboard actuator issues) to troubleshooting Exchange, Server 2012 R2 Failover Clusters, and the vCenter setup.  At this point though I'd be fine with having an MSP just handle the servers and find an intern to do the day-to-day helpdesk stuff.

Here's a quick overview of what we've got going on:

* Multi-homed IPv4/IPv6 internet with BGP
* 3 host vCenter 5.5 cluster with iSCSI storage
* SQL Server 2012 Failover Cluster (2 nodes)
* Domain-based DFS shares on a 2012 R2 Failover Cluster
* Pervasive use of Folder Redirection and Offline Files on workstations
* DirectAccess VPN with native IPv6 on the whole network
* On-premise Exchange 2013 (single server)
* On-premise Sharepoint 2013 (single server)
* Cluster of IIS backend web server behind a cluster of IIS reverse proxies running ARR
* Site-to-site VPN on Cisco ASAs to our DR site

Anyone have any good experiences with MSPs in the Chicago area and want to give a shout-out?  Any places I should definitely **not** look at?  Thanks!"
3bn4ou,12,2015-06-30,Saw Trainwreck last night. A very good comedy.,batatasta,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3bn4ou/saw_trainwreck_last_night_a_very_good_comedy/,"Went to an advanced screening last night. I went in with decent expectations because I'm an Apatow fan and I was mildly familiar with Amy Schumer. Glad to say that the movie definitely delivered. Easily Apatow's best movie since Knocked Up, and Schumer is probably going to blow up after this because she is very talented.

There's a ton of small supporting roles played by familiar faces and famous athletes. The stand-out being John Cena, who got some of the biggest laughs in the movie and shows off a shocking amount of skin. Lebron has a big part too, and is solid in the part and got a lot of laughs, but I don't see him becoming a successful actor.

Love me some Bill Hader so it was fun seeing him be the male lead for once. Unfortunately he is definitely the straight man here so doesn't get to be quite as funny as we're used to. His character is also a bit too perfect so it can be a tad hard to believe he would fall so hard so fast for the titular trainweck. He does have what I personally thought might have been the funniest bit in the movie when he plays some one-on-one with his bff Lebron and it goes exactly how you'd expect a one-on-one with Lebron to go.

There's also a strong B-story featuring Amy's dad and sister. Colin Quinn absolutely kills it as the dad, but he does still look a little young to be living in a nursing home surrounded by people that are clearly a lot older than him. I also appreciated that this story didn't go the way I expected it to for a rom-com and delivers some really strong dramatic scenes (Schumer can really act).

The movie's definitely not perfect. Like all Apatow flicks, it's too damn long! Easily could have cut 15 mins and the movie would have been much more effective. There's a subplot involving an intern (played by the guy that will be The Flash) that didn't really add enough. One of the guys I saw it with did find the it to be one of the funniest parts of the movie so I might be alone on this. Mainly Apatow just needs an editor that can help him reign it in here and there because this really effects the pacing of his movies.

Overall the movie was great. Every scene made me laugh out loud, and the whole theater was laughing the entire time as well. The last scene in particular brought the house down with some good old physical comedy. I did not partake, but the audience did applaud at the end which is always a good sign. I'd go as far to say it was my favorite comedy of the last year or two.

tl;dr Despite being too long, it's Apatow's best since Knocked Up and Schumer is definitely the real deal.

So here is my problem:


A little background, my gf and I have been dating for a year an a few months (both college students) and it's the summer. We live an hour away from each other but see eachother 2-4 a week. Now at the beginning of the summer life got a bit stale (mostly my fault in poor date planning) and I bumped up my game and now no problem. Well I shouldn't say that. There is a problem.


My gf interns at a large technology firm, I won't say what but it's big and located west. Anyway she has tons of intern friends now that she'll hang out with after work, mostly guys but that's just because it's a technology firm. This didn't bother me because why should it, she can have a life outside of me.


Here's the tricky part, my gf is very competitive and is good at teasing/smack talk and I have seen how she is around my guy friends and it can totally be mistaken as interest/flirting. Well as I suspected there is a dude who was interested in her at work. I didn't know this until she took me to a concert with the other interns and his feelings were apparent to everyone. I tried to brush it off and just make small talk between sets and the night went without conflict.


After he texts her and says how he had no idea how she had BF (he definitely knew, I'm a photographer and I'm all over her social media) but he doesn't want to come between us, he didn't even know if he liked her yet blah blah blah. Basically saving face and at the end offered just to stay best friend. Now that shit will not fly with me. When someone announces they are into you and you have a SO and you do not feel the same way you back off right? Wrong, being the nice(sometimes too nice to a fault) person she is she feels bad and still wants to stay friends. She even wants me to come on the group hike the two of them had planned in 2 weeks. I've tried telling her how that him no longer liking her is bull and that she needs to separate from him and she just brushed the topic off after apologizing a ton. I'm getting dinner with her tonight and I'm still a bit pissed.


**tl;dr**: Girlfriend lead a guy on at work, I told her how I was against it and was brushed off.  How do I deal with this? 


Edit: oh and one more thing, we crazy about each other she's just a tad naive. Smartest person I know but there are sometimes when I just think ""did you not know this?""


Edit 2: So I forgot to add one major detail. I moved to this state a week before starting university which, as fate would have it, means I have 0 friends where I live. Tons of friends at school but 0 in my hometown. The GF is the only one I hang out with besides going to work. I freelance so no work buddies.


Edit 3: She actaully has mentioned him and not in a way that was good at all. She had brought up the fact that she was questioning what if she ever wanted to see other people. Her words were something along the lines of ""theres this guy at work, I know i would never date him but what if I wanted to have the opportunity to find out."" Basically I'm her second BF in college and she always looks towards the future and if she marries me she says she doesnt want to regret not being single. That was a while ago and she had just felt that way because we had an off week and she will focus on a doubt and sort of freak out so I wasnt too worried although it hurt to hear she had her doubts. And so yeah that's why I was worried about this.

She is supposed to stay for an additional 6. Since she has been gone, we have been having minor issues in our relationship. Due to the time difference here in America, 6 hours, it made it difficult for us to talk sometimes. However, we still spoke every day. 


Before me, my now ex-girlfriend (lets say Amy), was an abusive relationship for just over a year. About 6 months after, I came along and we completely fell for each other. Our relationship for the past 3 years had seriously been like a fairly tail. People would commend us on our communication skills and our ability to work things out maturely. We got along great and everything was perfect. Now this is the part that I need help understanding a bit. Throughout our relationship, it had been brought up many times that she suffers from mild to severe depression. Something she has been battling most of her life. 

When she was younger, she used to cut and contemplate suicide on a regular basis. Nobody would ever suspect this from her. She told me she hated who she was. Now fast forward to her time in Barcelona, eveything was goin great for her at first. She was doing this internship with a company that gave her housing and all that jazz. But something bad happened. She got in trouble for having a little bit of pot in her apartment, and it resulted in her almost getting kicked out of the program entirely. This was terrifying for both of us. After like a week of hard ache, misery, and simply not knowing what the outcome was gonna be, they decided to just give her a slap on the wrist. Although that sounds great, she suffered a lot emotionally from it. Her new group of friends have basically shunned her from the group. She feels like she is in the darkest place she has ever been since the point in her life she used to cut herself. She said something along the lines of ""I have locked myself in a room with all the fucked up parts about myself and im not meant to escape."" 

She told me that she feels worse than she felt when she was 15 yearls old. She is in a very dark place right now. And she told me that there ""is something inside of her that is missing."" She says its something that nobody can provide for her, its something she has to find on her own and she doesn't really know if she can. She told me that I have been the most amazing, supportive boyfriend anyone can ever ask for. But she feels as if she may have used that as a crutch, a shield so to speak, that protected her from the parts of herself she hated. She feels emotionaly unavailable and unable to invest in not only our relationship anymore, but other relationships with her friends back home too. Her emotions are so messed up right now that she says she feels like she doesn't even know who she is anymore.

I am posting here because I am lost. I am so fucking broken and I feel like I lost the love of my life. I need help understanding what happened. I have never been depressed before, so its hard for me to understand where she is coming from. If someone asked me why we broke up, I would be unable to give them a short answer. I need to know what to do with myself. I have already deactivated my facebook, unfollowed her on other forms of social media, I have pretty much gotten rid of every aspect of her on any social medium I am subscribed to. I don't know how to move on from this. Any other relationship I have had has ended in cheating (on the other part, not mine) or much worse. This is killing me. 

tl;dr Is there anyone out there that can help me understand 
what my girlfriend is going through and why it ended our relationship? What can I do to help me cope with losing the one person I thought I could actually spend the rest of my life with?"

 So I go into the office to find the boss' sister having a massive frowny face and crossed arms like she's already annoyed with me and she starts telling me that the computer is frozen and she can't open up her bookmarks. 


She's using Internet Explorer


She's using IE 7 because ""some sites don't support IE 10..""


WELL THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM


So I close the IE out completely and open firefox
&gt;"" I suggest using firefox next time...blah blah""


She tells me that certain client's websites can only be viewed in IE and that she HAS to use IE because it has all of her saved bookmarks and she doesn't want to 'copy and paste' all of the bookmarks into firefox.


Okay, whatever


Open up IE


Go immediately to 'favorites' 


Open up her bookmarks with no trouble and bring up the websites that she wanted.


&gt;""HOW DID YOU DO THAT??""


&gt;'Uh... I clicked on favorites and then the website. If it freezes again, just close the browser out and then open it back up again""


&gt;""Well I KNOW how to click on the favorites; but how did you get it to not freeze for you?""


Try to joke around and lighten the mood 
&gt;""Because it can sense fear. Just give me a call if you need anything else""


So I leave and go back to attempting to create a CRM from scratch in Access

 
15 min later get call from the boss again


His sister's computer is still freezing up.


&gt;""Pyro, I thought you said you fixed it!""


&gt;""I did fix it sir, it worked perfectly fine when I used it and the several other times that I repeated the same process""


&gt;""Well we don't have tech-savy people here! I'm paying them to blah blah! Your job is to fix it the first time!""


Force smile and agree and go back to fix the computer


&gt;""It's frozen again Pyro! What did you do to make it work?!""


I literally do the exact same thing I did last time. Close completely and open it back up and go to the favorites.


&gt;""It's fine, I can get to your favorites without any problems""


&gt;""Yes but what steps did you take to get it to do that?!""


Go step by step in how to do the thing


&gt;""Don't patronize me; I'm not an idiot. I know how to click buttons""


&gt;""Yes ma'am, is there anything else you needed help with?""


&gt;""No, I can do it""


Leave and continue pulling hair out trying to make the stupid project in Access work


Hear angry bellow from down the hall 


&gt;""PYRO! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO FIX THIS!""


wtf I've fixed the damn thing 


&gt;""I have fixed it sir, and shown her the steps on how to do exactly what I did to fix it""


Get yelled at for about 5 min on how I'm supposed to fix these issues the first time without him having to look over my shoulder and make sure it's done correctly.


Have to do a walk of shame WITH MY BOSS over to the 'problem computer'


Turns out his sister was using a coworker's computer.


The coworker has returned and has turned off the machine and is turning it back on


Oh thank fuck someone who might actually have critical thinking


Get yelled at in front of entire office for wasting everyone's time in having to be looked over and for 'not doing job right the first time; wasting precious time they could have been doing their job.. etc""


Coworker turns on computer


It fucking works FINE


No problems, even shitty IE is working and not freezing


Proceed to get yelled at AGAIN in in front of coworker and the entire office (everyone has pretty much stopped to listen in and gawk around to be able to hear me get blessed out. Bitch face boss' sister is looking smug in the back) about how ""the other workers don't have time to keep resetting and turning off the computer."" and that ""They HAVE to have IE because some client's sites ONLY work in IE""


I have to spend my lunch break 'fixing' this computer to make sure that there are no more 'problems'

I spend my lunch break importing all the bookmarks into firefox and then spend the rest of the time seething; but get over it after venting to another IT friend

I see the boss' sister in the hallway every day and every time I see her she just narrows her eyes and gives me this shit eating 'ha ha I got you in trouble' smirk.

Welp, I guess I should just go ahead and get used to this I guess?






**UPDATE:** Apparently bitchy boss' sister hates me because she wanted her 15 and 14 year old sons to be the 'IT' people at this tiny ass firm; and apparently everyone in my building hates her too. We work in two different buildings right across the parking lot form each other, but she's ALWAYS over in my building wasting time and not doing her work. One building is the 'tax/accounting firm' the other is the 'insurance' building. I tend to just not say much to people here, but when I do I always try to be somewhat friendly and helpful. It seems this has come to be VERY good for me. 


Office politics may suck, but I learned YEARS ago to ""listen, but never contribute"" to gossip/news/dramaz and such..From the stuff that the older office workers have told me, they think that Sister is a mooching pro, and that she's a grade 'A' bitch. Fun receptionist lady is my best friend in the office. She's from Guam and is like 50 and takes me out for pizza during our lunch break sometimes; and then we talk about our dogs and what we are going to to this weekend.  She told me this while I was putting my lunch in the kitchen this morning:


 She also told me that Sister went bankrupt and the only reason she even has a job here is becuase my boss (her brother) felt sorry for her because she couldn't keep down any other jobs becuase she was ""unreasonable to work with"" or something along those lines; and that she's trying to weasle her entire family ,the two sons and and her husband who has no degree, into working at this tiny firm. She moved three states down becuase she couldn't hold down a job. I may store this away for later ammo....For now I can hold this knowledge close to me and laugh internally every time I see her now.

3bnq4a,1,2015-06-30,Is my dream job salvageable? Need help on where to go from here,smoogrish,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3bnq4a/is_my_dream_job_salvageable_need_help_on_where_to/,"So I am a recent graduate from a top university and I majored in Classics and German. These majors clearly don't translate very well in the job market, however I did work REALLY hard to pull out a 3.7 GPA and honors. I worked in our IT Department at my University doing tech support for 2 years and I have internship experience in investment real estate in Germany.

Basically, what I was trying to do was make up for the fact I chose the wrong major (Classics, at least) and carve out my professional interests separate from my academic ones.

I just feel like I made a huge mistake staying with Classics, but I never gave it up because I worked so hard to even get through the whole major. We have one of the best undergrad Classics department in the country, but no one knows that when they see my resume or even know what Classics is (it's Latin and Greek language). I realize I can make this clearer but how do I make this relevant?

I keep applying for business analyst, project manager, and other graduate positions and seem to have pretty good luck at least getting through the first round, but so many companies (large banking ones) just drop off the face of the earth when I try and continue in the hiring process. I've applied to tech support jobs as a backup and those are going pretty well because I'm 100% qualified, but I don't want to keep doing tech support.  I have a few tech supports jobs on the line, but I just really want something more and am debating between taking them and settling.  I really want something with more responsibility than tech support and I KNOW I'm smart and capable. I work my ass off too and I can't say that I regret doing two difficult majors and working at the same time, but I am definitely having trouble being able to translate this onto paper so that I can get in the door of a company as a business analyst.  

I know that not all business analysts are created equally, but how can I move past the feeling I chose the wrong major completely but still keep applying for those positions? I came so close to analyst positions in other companies, and I know I can make a good impact when I get through the door. I don't have the business major experience, but I am an extremely hard worker, have a positive attitude (except maybe a little down right now after a few rejections), am very self motivated and I am smart.

This was really more of a venting post, but I just feel lost right now. I'm stuck between my dreams (being a business analyst) and reality (I'm having a lot of luck with tech support jobs and no one wants to hire humanities majors). I just want to work harder than I know tech support will make me work. I'm also planning on applying to a top 15 MBA program in the next 2 years, but I also want to get some experience under my belt before I do that.

I just went on a trip and saw a lot of successful young professionals who were a year out of college (where I went to school) and thought ""what am I doing with my life right now""?  I also got rejected from a job I wanted pretty badly. I feel like I'm in crisis mode and have been stuck there for 2 days or so.  Everything just feels wrong.  

Any advice would help!"

**END EDIT**

Hi everyone,

First off, you're a great group of redditors! So supportive of one another and the devs, I admire that!

With that said... I've been checking out this subreddit for the past week (found via AlienTube) and saw how awesome and helpful everyone was. I was hoping someone who has experience with the game could help me out?

Below is my current setup and I was curious if the game would be playable for me? I can't afford to spend money on a game if my computer won't be able to run it... Gotta save that money from my internship and PT job for fall tuition/her engagement ring!

If something in my setup is lacking and I won't be able to play it... Let me know what I need to save up for after my bigger purchases (mentioned above)! Whether it be a GPU, MoBo/CPU upgrade, etc.

Lastly, I would still love to help the devs as I think most of you love them to bits! Haha. Even if I can't play, maybe I'll just donate a five or something... Even if you can't help with advice, maybe you know of how I can ""tip"" them?

Thanks guys! Continue being an awesome community!

3bnqs8,0,2015-06-30,Early warning signs between me [26M] and my girlfriend [25F] of four years.,dbdb4,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3bnqs8/early_warning_signs_between_me_26m_and_my/,"I love her and want to marry her. She feels the same.

Excepting our dead bedroom, or at least what feels like a dead bedroom.

I'm enrolled in a graduate program at a university on the east coast. She lives on the west coast. My program is two years long, with the option of a third year, and I'm to enter my second, and hopefully final, year this fall. I fly home to her in northern California at every opportunity. (Out of the first nine month academic period, I spent about seven or eight weeks with her in California.)

When our relationship began, she warned me that she was ""broken."" She couldn't become aroused. We discovered very quickly that that wasn't the case. There was a lot of sex, maybe seven to ten sessions per week, despite her insane schedule. She had two jobs, two internships, and was a full time student. We also lived forty minutes apart.

The first nine months I spent out east were hard. I pursued therapy and became more communicative and open with her to make things work. And now, we are closer than ever before, just not physically.

Infrequent sex was already an issue before I left for school, so I spent February, March, and April amping up my workout routine to two and a half hours a day, six days a week, while sticking to a strict diet. I was in unbelievable shape. I told her that my goal was to get her wet just by taking my shirt off--to no avail. We didn't have sex for the first 13 days after I returned home for the summer. The only palpable response I got out of her was her hands on my chest and a momentary, ""Ooooh.""

It's now July, we're in Vegas, and we've had sex eight times since my return in early May. One session was pity sex through and through. One was her watching me. And another was our first foray into light bondage: I tied her down and used an assortment of toys on her for an hour and a half. The others were, more or less, vanilla.

I feel petulant, like I'm expecting too much of her, too much of a relationship. What confuses me is that we've had a heart-to-heart about our libidos: she's satisfied by sex one to two times per week, whereas I'm satisfied by three to five (I'm hungry for more than three when I work out). We aren't even hitting her minimum (I returned nine weeks ago).

I can count the number of times she's initiated sex with me in the previous two years on two hands. Initiation is my job, and I'm tired of it. I feel that if I were to stop, sex between us would disappear completely. Her rejections are almost rote, ""I'm too tired. It's late. I haven't showered. I feel gross. It takes too long. I have to drive to the city tomorrow. I'm hungry. I'm too full. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe this weekend."" She'll spend several hours on her phone before bed every night reading social media and Reddit while buffeting me with these excuses. I've even upped my foreplay game: ten to twenty-minute massages before gently kissing her neck and unfastening her bra, but I'm shoved away regardless.

If it helps, she rarely masturbates (maybe twice a year).

From what I've read, most DBers would kill for weekly sex, even biweekly sex, so I wonder if I'm the problem; however, I can't help but feel that our libidos are mismatched and that I should consider moving on.

Thank you for your time."
3bnu1u,4,2015-06-30,My [39f] nephew [21m] is a white supremacist and my BIL/sister[46m/45f] don't care,nationalisticnep,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bnu1u/my_39f_nephew_21m_is_a_white_supremacist_and_my/,"*tl;dr - my nephew seems to have become a white supremacist/ultranationalist and I'm worried about having him around my kids, my BIL and sister don't seem to care at all because I don't think they see it as a problem*


My nephew has always been an independent and controlling person, and he's never really been a person that interacted with others. Whenever he visited us as a kid he
never really got along with his nephews and anyone else and always went on his own. He's always been a loner. He was more interested in technology and history then he was
interacting with people. 

When he got to 14-15 he rebuffed invites to hang out with my brother who was 18/19, and preferred to spend his time walking through forests near my
parents house and visting the history and technology museums. 

My BIL and sister fed into his interests a lot which grew into a military fascination which they fed by taking him to airshows, helping him participate in Civil Air Patrol, naval things since his father has a relationship with the navy through work and never really encouraging him to be social beyond CAP.


He spent a lot of his time in high school from what I know trying to get internships at companies in their local area that offered high school apprenticeships, mainly Sikorsky and I think it fed into his ideals even more. 


My husband and I, are rather liberal, and my BIL and sister were more in line with my parents that, they're pretty conservative, and they reinforced a lot of that into their 3 sons. My nephew is currently living overseas for school and my brother
is facebook friends with him, and he posted pictures of visiting war museums and gravesites through Germany, CR and Poland. 

I took a look and from first glance he's become a survivalist, he spent a lot of time hiking alone
in the alps and posting his escapades after, and he's been posting material out of ultra-right wing parties out of Europe and some specific anti-racial stuff. It looks like his friend group is pretty much people in the same vein
as he is. He even learned german and polish enough where he could talk to these people. 

Am I supposed to worry about this? Is it my job to worry about it? My sister said he wanted to come visit our dad because he hasn't seen his grandfather in something like 5 or 6 years now, and my father wants to see him too,
but I'm worried about him being around my kids because of his views, but my kids are really excited to see him because they haven't seen him since he was here visiting my dad. 

Should I keep my kids away from him? Is it something
for me to worry about when he comes to visit? My brother plans to have him stay over at his house and watch his daughters so they can have some bonding time. I'm not sure if I'm making mountains out of molehills since I know
that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. My kids are between 10-16 right now.

I'm a 22-year old programmer girl. 

I've been working retail since I was 16 and just got my first big girl job in industry. I'm working for a small company (10-20) people that does translations for STEM industries. They hired me on to help the other solitary programmer maintain and contribute to their proprietary database system that manages their quotes. 

When I started, they were pretty vague about job duties. The first project they gave me was designing their site, which took 2.5 months after waiting on content, bosses changing their minds etc. I also set it up as an ASP.NET framework that accesses their custom database. 

Next they want me to do error logging for another in-place system, for the VPs side company. This is all in c# and sql.

My experience is in network administration and Web design, but mostly student positions. I'm still currently in college, graduating next year with my Computer Information Systems degree.

Office is small but nice, I have my own desk in an office shared with 3 other employees. People are friendly, we have company outings every so often, so that's nice. 

I'm being paid ten an hour, 40 hours a week. They moved me from summer intern to permanent  employee a couple weeks ago, but when I inquired about a pay raise (that they discussed in my interview) I was told there wouldn't be one right now but ""Keep up the good work, I'm sure you'll see benefits from a job well done :) ""

During my interview I mentioned I was coming out of retail, as my resume says, so I'm worried they're undercutting me cus think I'll take whatever they're giving. 

Am I getting fucked over or is this a decent job? 


Tl;dr: ten an hour, 40 hr work week crap pay for entry level web developer?

I applied rather late for my 1st internship and got the work permit at the very last minute.. it was a very close call. This time I want to be on top of the ball from the very beginning and I have seen internships that I would be really interested in.

So my questions are: 

* should I apply anyway (mentioning in the cover letter that I am applying in case they would be still interested in having other interns for the same position after the advertised date)? 

* is there such a thing as applying too early for an internship/job?

My career goal is to become a Quantitative Analyst on the east coast, but I've heard from many sources that the name of the school you graduate from is a major factor for breaking into the finance industry.




I'll be coming out of this state school with a GPA in the 3.6-3.75 range. Last summer I volunteered with the cs department for an hour of code project, I have summer internships with startups / small companies, and last semester I made a computer game for the psychology department. I'll have another 2 summers before graduation to get more internship experience, and I'm trying to get into freelancing to get more experience.

With all of this in mind, I am worried that despite all the hard work I put in, my application to Quantitative Analyst jobs will be discarded immediately just from them looking at the school I went to. The two strategies I have thought of to counteract this are

1. Hustle my way through jobs on the east coast to establish more career experience in key technologies and fields.

2. Apply for top graduate schools to further my knowledge and expertise (my thought would be to apply for a masters in statistics, since that would be the area I have least experience in after my current undergraduate track), and build contacts in the area.

In both situations, I know that networking is going to have to be a large focus.

Does either one of these strategies stand out as ""smarter"" than the other for the end goal? Are there other potential strategies that I haven't given enough attention to?"

They say it increases collaboration.

And it does. There’s more collaboration. But it’s of a lower quality and almost completely useless.

After a super productive year of working from home – 4 major client engagements, 1 book, 1 video course, countless blogposts – I started going to an office again.

Here’s what my typical day at the office looks like:

**10:12am** – roll in after having to stop writing just as it started flowing
**10:30am** – tea is ready, Emacs is running, work can start
**10:35am** – “Hey did you check my PR?”, coworker
**10:50am** – finish leaving many comments on PR
**10:51am** – start priming brain on what I have to work on
**11:00am** – “Oh no hey, you misunderstood, all those PR things are actually correct”, coworker
**11:01am** – “Oh okay then, let me just merge that”, me
**11:05am** – “Oh hey I just noticed you didn’t check my PR”, me to coworker
**11:06am** – “Sure, I’ll do that eventually, just assume it’s merged for now”, coworker
**11:15am** – found the perfect music to match code, getting into it
**11:25am** – “Hey can you look at this?”, intern
**11:40am** – write first line of code 2 hours after coming in
**11:50am** – “Shit, what did we say we needed to do here?”, me to coworker
**12:15pm** – after briefly distracting the designer, the biz ops guy, and another two engineers, have a less muddy idea of what the thing should do
**12:30pm** – fuck, I’m hungry
**12:35pm** – stop working, start arranging to go for lunch
**12:50pm** – find compatriots to go to lunch
**13:30pm** – tea is ready, get to work
**14:13pm** – “I got the thing done, I think, is this what it needs to do?”, intern
**14:35pm** – after teaching the intern some theory and explaining how to apply it to our use case, make another cup of tea
**15:01pm** – “Hey did the intern get that thing done, I need it now?”, coworker
**15:45pm** – fuck the nearest Starbucks closes in 15 minutes and I’m getting hungry anyway
**16:20pm** – get back to work, re-sync with coworker about what I’m doing and what he’s doing
**16:50pm** – “I got the new UX done for that thing that you own, do we have clarity on everything now?”, designer
**17:10pm** – stop talking to designer, back to coding
**17:55pm** – fuck, I have to dash off to go boxing
**18:15pm** – leave office after answering one quick question to the intern, and syncing with coworker on how things are going

Eight hours of office time. Two, maybe three, hours of sporadic coding. Very sporadic coding. Yay offices are great.

3bobpc,1,2015-06-30,Don't Want to Use my Degree After Graduating,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3bobpc/dont_want_to_use_my_degree_after_graduating/,"I'm in an odd situation. I have a year left of schooling and I have little intention to use my degree once Im gone.

I started college as a physics major. I knew I was vaguely interested in the sciences, and even though my passions were in music and writing, I had the idea shoved down my throat that artistic majors were a waste of time. In retrospect, I should have waited before starting college to decide what I wanted to do, but cest la vie. 

I ended up getting interested in computer programming, so I decided to be a computer science major. I liked how it applied mathematics and logic to accomplish tasks, and that was very rewarding for me in the beginning. I had one internship that wasn't bad, then a second one that was awful. After taking some electives in animation, I had begun to realize that, not only was I not particularly interested in computer programming, but also it was too late for me to turn back. In addition to the money my wonderful parents saved for my education, I received some hefty financial aid. I can graduate debt free, which really deters me from going back for more schooling because I don't want the burden of college loans to force me into a computer science job I don't want.

Right now I plan to graduate, live simply, and work a few part time jobs to decompress and figure out what I want out of life. I have recently been developing my hobbies of writing music and scripts. I would enjoy recording some music on my own and maybe making a web series or two with my friends. I have enough skills to do some freelance web development to earn some money, and I have always liked the idea of working as a barista in a small coffee shop, meeting all kinds of new customers and hearing their different stories. I have also considered tutoring, I have taught piano lessons in the past, and I could offer some introductory sessions in mainstream computer languages.

Does any of this sound sustainable? Does it make any sense? I see my friends around me graduating and moving on, a few of them are excited, most of them are incredibly nervous and uncomfortable, and a few are downright devastated about what theyre about to do. I regretfully ended up in a major I didnt love, but I dont want that to shackle me to a life I dont want. I just want to graduate, make enough money to keep a roof over my head, food on my plate, and have the time and mindset to explore my options. I dont plan on this being the rest of my life, I just want some time to let my mind wander and figure out what my next path will be. Am I being childish and ridiculous? I have heard all kinds of different responses from my friends. I feel pressure to get an impressive job since I have the ""impressive"" degree to match, but in a weird way I envy my friends with less marketable degrees who are still bouncing around and figuring themselves out.

I am just very confused and would like some advice on how to move forward."
3boer7,9,2015-06-30,Someone's Sending Letters To My Sister's Friends...It Might Be Me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3boer7/someones_sending_letters_to_my_sisters_friendsit/,"**Tuesday - 3:12PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I stood outside of my little sister, Farah's, classroom waiting for her to be dismissed. Her elementary/middle school holds a summer camp where they learn certain things to prepare them for their next grade level. It's supposed to be a 5-week program and we're on week 3 now. Man, I miss my days as a 6-year-old, not having to worry about exams, financial aid and internships. She doesn't even realize how lucky she is in this moment.

&amp;nbsp;

The 3:15 bell rang and I patiently waited for her to come out with a loud, *""HI SIS,""* as she always did. Instead, one of my sister's friends, Leila, approached me.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi Leila! How was school today?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked down to the floor with an uneasy facial expression. She then pulled a folded piece of paper out of her Tweety Bird backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Umm...hi. Why did you leave this is in my cubby?""*

&amp;nbsp;

Confused, I retrieved the paper with Leila's name on it and began to unfold it when I saw her run down the hallway to her mom.

&amp;nbsp;

*""HI SIS!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Startled, I looked down at my little sister. Putting the note in my purse, I took her hand and we went home.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tuesday - 6:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was lying on my bed in my room, doing some online shopping for an upcoming trip. I grabbed my purse to get my Chase debit card when I saw that folded piece of paper and remembered I hadn't read it. When I opened it I was highly disturbed.

&amp;nbsp;

[The Note](http://imgur.com/AtH3eWq)

&amp;nbsp;

I obviously know for a fact that I didn't write this and I'm even more sure that I didn't sneak into a school building and put it in a 6-year-old's cubby. I knew I was being framed or SOMETHING. I didn't know how to decipher this code, so I did what any person my age would do. I Googled it.

&amp;nbsp;

After trying different codes I was finally able to break it. Not so happy that I did:

&amp;nbsp;

**At night, when you sleep**
&amp;nbsp;

**I wake up and start to creep**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you dream, I stand and stare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Over your bed with an evil glare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Nightmares come and nightmares go**
&amp;nbsp;

**But not before I steal your soul**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you wake up in sweat and tears**
&amp;nbsp;

**Into your closet I disappear**

&amp;nbsp;

What in the actual motherfuckin' fuck. Who would even think of writing this in code, let alone give it to a little girl? I put it back into my purse and forgot about it. Thinking it was somehow a prank or a misunderstanding.

&amp;nbsp;


Later that night I decided to watch some television with my dad.

&amp;nbsp;

The 10 o'clock news told us that a boy named Robert Yenick was missing from his bed this morning.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 3:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a little late picking my sister up due to some heavy traffic. I see her waiting by her locker when I approach her classroom.

&amp;nbsp;

She looks up with a, *""HI, SIS""* and gives me a hug.

&amp;nbsp;

*""How was school today?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I'm getting used to saying this. I'm on my mom shit for some reason.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Good! Leila didn't show up today and Robert is still missing...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You mean the boy from the news? I didn't know he was in your class""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yup! We share erasers sometimes. He has batman on a few of them. Pretty cool, huh?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Totally!""*

&amp;nbsp;

On our way to the car, a little boy came up to me.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi Tyler,""* said my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

He ignored her and handed me a piece of paper.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I don't know how to read this, Briana.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""C'mon Tyler, say goodbye to your friend, we have to go!""* His father called.

&amp;nbsp;

He looked at me, smiled, and walked away.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the piece of paper only to see the exact same code from the one Leila gave me yesterday.

&amp;nbsp;

Shit. Just...shit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 10:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

My dad tells me that another child has gone missing. Leila Woodsen. She was last seen leaving class with her mom Tuesday afternoon. When her dad went in her room to get her up this morning for school, she wasn't there. My dad told me that he spoke with my sister about it and she just cried. How do you tell a 6-year-old that another friend is missing?

&amp;nbsp;

Freaking out, I figured I'd try to end this madness. I don't recall becoming a mailman (or woman) overnight. I plugged my charger into my laptop and turned my webcam on. If it were true that I was making late night deliveries to the school and not getting tipped, I was going to find out!

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 7:00AM**

&amp;nbsp;

My alarm clock is the worst thing in the world to me right now. I get out of bed to get my little sister, but she's already up. Great. One less thing I have to do, so I get dressed and ready to take her to school.

&amp;nbsp;

*""SIS! I'm ready!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Coming!"" I call.*

&amp;nbsp;

We're on our way out of the door when I remember my webcam must still be recording.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Go get in the car, I'll be out in a minute!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I run in my room to press the ""STOP"" button, but see that it hasn't been recording. I look at my saved files, and the most recent one is 53 minutes long. I can see by the thumbnail of me in my bed that it's the right video...just a shorter version. Hours shorter. I took it with me and decided I'd check it out in the car after dropping my sister off. I didn't have anything better to do. I walk her to her classroom and her teacher greets me with a smile.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in the car I open up my laptop to view the footage. The first 51 minutes is me tossing and turning. Then, I see a figure walk past the laptop and up to my bed. It's a child.

&amp;nbsp;

It's my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

She turns around and faces the laptop, then walks up to it and sticks her tiny hand out. And that's the end of the video. Now I'm thinking why the hell was she in my room. She used to come in there last year when she would have nightmares and get in my bed. I thought maybe she was thinking about doing that and the webcam freaked her out. I wondered if she slept with me last night and went to her room when she woke up. I'd ask her later. I was about to pull off and head for home when I noticed that her ID card to get her lunch was on the floor of the passenger seat. She likes to sit up front, and yes I know it's illegal. I grabbed it and went to the classroom to return it to her. Her teacher opened the door.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi, Briana! Back so soon?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yeah, my sister left her ID in my car.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh! I'll return it to her for you!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Thank you, Mrs. Martin!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I handed her the card and looked around the classroom. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. I began to walk out of the classroom when a damn telephone frightened me.

&amp;nbsp;

*Rinnnnng* *Rinnnnng*

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped by the door and decided to be nosy for no reason at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hello, Mrs. Martin's classroom.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Uh huh...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh my goodness.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I'm so sorry, please call me back with an update! I'll ask the children if they know anything.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked around the classroom again. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. And Tyler.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyler was missing.

&amp;nbsp;

I felt sick to my stomach and drove home feeling responsible for all of this. I don't know why. It's not like I had gone around kidnapping children. I was sure of it. I didn't want to go back to the school to pick up my sister. I didn't want one of her friends to hand me another note ""I"" had written. I didn't want Tyler to make it on the 10 o'clock news. Or any news for that matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 3:15PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was at my sister's school. I went to her classroom and grabbed her hand, ignored her, *""HI SIS!""* and went straight for the car. I avoided every child from the classroom to the parking lot. When we were finally safe at home, I went into my bedroom and shut the door. A few minutes later, my sister was knocking.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Briana! Here, I don't know what to do with this.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the folded up piece of paper she was holding.

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay, I don't want it, throw it away.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""But-""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""THROW IT AWAY!""*

&amp;nbsp;

She stuck the note in my trash can and that gave me the urge to light the entire thing on fire. She left.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I forgot to ask her about turning my webcam off.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Did you sleep in my bed last night?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""No...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay if you had a bad dream, you can tell me.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I promise I didn't!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Then, why did you come in my room and turn my webcam off?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked confused.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What's a webcam?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I told her never mind and that she could leave my room. I didn't care. I knew she was lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of watching the news, I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I didn't want to see a picture of Tyler staring back at me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:03AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up with the urge to piss in my bed. I hadn't left my room all night, and let my bladder get the best of me! I went to the bathroom, came out and peeked into my sister's room. She wasn't in the bed. I went into the kitchen to see if she was sneaking some food at this time of hour when I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs. They reached the top and my sister looked at me eyes wide opened.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What the hell were you doing down there?*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I thought I head something...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You're supposed to be in bed! You have school in the morning!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Yup. I was still on my mom shit.

&amp;nbsp;

She rolled her eyes at me and walked back to her bedroom. I never thought a 6-year-old would be brave enough to go into a basement at night because they heard a noise. What type of shit is that?

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing her door shut, I decided to take over her mission and see what she was REALLY doing down there.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:10 AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to turn on the light switch by the stairs, but the damn light didn't come on. On top of all of my other problems, I needed to find a light bulb.

&amp;nbsp;

I searched around for the supply cabinet. It was pitch black and clammy and I wanted nothing more than to be back upstairs in my room, but I had to find out what she was doing down here. I was only a few steps away from where we kept the light bulbs so I wasn't in too much of a frenzy. I made my way to the back and fiddled around until I found the handle to the cabinet.

&amp;nbsp;

YES!

&amp;nbsp;

There was an unopened box of light bulbs on the shelf. For some reason I was afraid that it'd be like one of those scary movies where there's one light bulb left and the idiot character drops it. Or when the batteries to a flashlight just so happen to stop working.

&amp;nbsp;

I took one out only to sadly realize that I had to make my way back to the middle of the room to actually CHANGE the bulb. It took me about five minutes of mazing around before I became highly irritated, and threw my hands in the air. I felt something cold and thin travel along the back of my arm. I jumped before realizing it was the chain to the light. I happily unscrewed the bulb above it and replaced it with a new one. And just with the yank of a chain, pitch black became pitch perfect. Yes, I regret saying that, but I won't backspace now. With my newly lit basement, I looked around until I came across a cardboard box taped securely. I had never seen it before so I picked it up (it was pretty light) and I carried it up to my room.

&amp;nbsp;

What I found inside, I cannot explain.

&amp;nbsp;

School supplies. Fucking school supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

A Ninja Turtle notebook.
&amp;nbsp;

A Spider-man pencil case.
&amp;nbsp;

A Batman eraser.
&amp;nbsp;

And a Tweety Bird fucking backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

I fell asleep leaning against my wall trying to figure shit out. And let me tell you, shit was not figured out. I woke up at 7AM again to the sound of my alarm clock. I needed to talk to my sister, find out if she knew about this box. She's only 6 so I know it's highly impossible for someone her age to kidnap children. Maybe she was stealing their school supplies and the disappearances were a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, right.

&amp;nbsp;

I got up and went to my sister's room, but she wasn't in her bed.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I yelled her name a bunch of times before my dad came in asking me why I was screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I can't find Farah. I looked around the entire house!""*

&amp;nbsp;

My dad went outside and I heard him start the car. I went back in my room to hide the box just in case we had to call the police. It was then that I noticed her new Hello Kitty lunch bag was now in the box. Panicking, I decided I would just throw it all away. I took the garbage bag out of my can and began to put items from the box in it, when I noticed the piece of paper my sister threw in there. It had her name on the front of it. I already knew what it said, so I didn't open it. I went outside and threw the trash in the dumpster.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 10:01PM**

&amp;nbsp;

*""A 6-year-old girl by the name of Farah P****** went missing from her bed this morning...""*

3bomot,1,2015-06-30,I have a very hands-off manager. How do I improve the internship program?,Datusbit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3bomot/i_have_a_very_handsoff_manager_how_do_i_improve/,"I am 1 of 8 interns for a small tech company. Managers are very hands off and so interns have a lot of freedom but at the same time no real focused mentorship.

The internship program currently, has no formal documentation or structure. No manuals, or how-to documents. No regular meetings or check ups. Simply a work wish list and some really smart guys you can ask if you have questions.

At this point, i'm open to any suggestions that help build an effective internship program. Maybe you have a system in place or are using a particular tool that aids workflow, please do share.

Below is just me spitballing my own idea and would like your 2 cents about it, if you’re willing to read:

My first stab at trying to improve the internship program was to expedite the learning process.

For the most part, all the interns here work autonomously on different projects. Naturally, they all go through their own learning process for their respective projects.

I love learning, and I want to learn about what the other interns are working on, but learning is a time consuming and at times frustrating activity.

I toyed with the idea of making the interns document what they learn, because I naturally do this on my own (Evernote). But I know this wouldn't be viable because most of the time, the document only makes complete sense to the author.

Also, writing these documents could prove to be difficult, not everyone can teach or explain the best, especially in writing. As an example, I just learned unit testing and the idea of writing a how to unit test document is opaque right now even though I just learned how to do it."

This is written on very little sleep.

I'm a college student (19 Y/O) going to community college for Computer Networking I enjoy working with computers. I don't enjoy school very much so I'm choosing to only get my associates and hopefully find an internship or something, I also don't want debt.

I've also been working a minimum wage job, the job itself is easy and co-workers are fun. My only gripe is it doesnt allow me to do the things I want because of money. Because of this I applied to a major warehouse (Amazon) not too long ago and started 4 days ago. The job itself is soul sucking and I'm a zombie all night (7PM-5AM) but I suffer through cause the pay is much better compared to the other job. I work 4 days on 3 days off. I told myself to push through cause of advancements but I dont know If I/my body can take it. Even though I'm fresh I dont think the job is good for me even if the pay is good.

Having experiencing both of these jobs, I have perspective that I dont want to be stuck like this and work my life away. I always wanted to do music production but I lack the motivation/diligence to keep after it. I yearn to travel with friends and especially skydive eventually. Of course theres a list of things I would love to get into (photography to name one) but again it all comes down to money. I'm also not in the best shape and play games all the time in a way to escape.

I just want to know what this sub thinks is the best way to find where to start and escape this hole I feel like I'm stuck in. I want to be successful and content in life while getting to do all the things I want. If you have any advice I will appreciate anything I can get.

She looked down to the floor with an uneasy facial expression. She then pulled a folded piece of paper out of her Tweety Bird backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Umm...hi. Why did you leave this is in my cubby?""*

&amp;nbsp;

Confused, I retrieved the paper with Leila's name on it and began to unfold it when I saw her run down the hallway to her mom.

&amp;nbsp;

*""HI SIS!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Startled, I looked down at my little sister. Putting the note in my purse, I took her hand and we went home.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tuesday - 6:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was lying on my bed in my room, doing some online shopping for an upcoming trip. I grabbed my purse to get my Chase debit card when I saw that folded piece of paper and remembered I hadn't read it. When I opened it I was highly disturbed.

&amp;nbsp;

[The Note](http://imgur.com/AtH3eWq)

&amp;nbsp;

I obviously know for a fact that I didn't write this and I'm even more sure that I didn't sneak into a school building and put it in a 6-year-old's cubby. I knew I was being framed or SOMETHING. I didn't know how to decipher this code, so I did what any person my age would do. I Googled it.

&amp;nbsp;

After trying different codes I was finally able to break it. Not so happy that I did:

&amp;nbsp;

**At night, when you sleep**
&amp;nbsp;

**I wake up and start to creep**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you dream, I stand and stare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Over your bed with an evil glare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Nightmares come and nightmares go**
&amp;nbsp;

**But not before I steal your soul**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you wake up in sweat and tears**
&amp;nbsp;

**Into your closet I disappear**

&amp;nbsp;

What in the actual motherfuckin' fuck. Who would even think of writing this in code, let alone give it to a little girl? I put it back into my purse and forgot about it. Thinking it was somehow a prank or a misunderstanding.

&amp;nbsp;


Later that night I decided to watch some television with my dad.

&amp;nbsp;

The 10 o'clock news told us that a boy named Robert Yenick was missing from his bed this morning.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 3:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a little late picking my sister up due to some heavy traffic. I see her waiting by her locker when I approach her classroom.

&amp;nbsp;

She looks up with a, *""HI, SIS""* and gives me a hug.

&amp;nbsp;

*""How was school today?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I'm getting used to saying this. I'm on my mom shit for some reason.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Good! Leila didn't show up today and Robert is still missing...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You mean the boy from the news? I didn't know he was in your class""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yup! We share erasers sometimes. He has batman on a few of them. Pretty cool, huh?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Totally!""*

&amp;nbsp;

On our way to the car, a little boy came up to me.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi Tyler,""* said my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

He ignored her and handed me a piece of paper.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I don't know how to read this, Briana.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""C'mon Tyler, say goodbye to your friend, we have to go!""* His father called.

&amp;nbsp;

He looked at me, smiled, and walked away.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the piece of paper only to see the exact same code from the one Leila gave me yesterday.

&amp;nbsp;

Shit. Just...shit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 10:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

My dad tells me that another child has gone missing. Leila Woodsen. She was last seen leaving class with her mom Tuesday afternoon. When her dad went in her room to get her up this morning for school, she wasn't there. My dad told me that he spoke with my sister about it and she just cried. How do you tell a 6-year-old that another friend is missing?

&amp;nbsp;

Freaking out, I figured I'd try to end this madness. I don't recall becoming a mailman (or woman) overnight. I plugged my charger into my laptop and turned my webcam on. If it were true that I was making late night deliveries to the school and not getting tipped, I was going to find out!

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 7:00AM**

&amp;nbsp;

My alarm clock is the worst thing in the world to me right now. I get out of bed to get my little sister, but she's already up. Great. One less thing I have to do, so I get dressed and ready to take her to school.

&amp;nbsp;

*""SIS! I'm ready!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Coming!"" I call.*

&amp;nbsp;

We're on our way out of the door when I remember my webcam must still be recording.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Go get in the car, I'll be out in a minute!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I run in my room to press the ""STOP"" button, but see that it hasn't been recording. I look at my saved files, and the most recent one is 53 minutes long. I can see by the thumbnail of me in my bed that it's the right video...just a shorter version. Hours shorter. I took it with me and decided I'd check it out in the car after dropping my sister off. I didn't have anything better to do. I walk her to her classroom and her teacher greets me with a smile.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in the car I open up my laptop to view the footage. The first 51 minutes is me tossing and turning. Then, I see a figure walk past the laptop and up to my bed. It's a child.

&amp;nbsp;

It's my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

She turns around and faces the laptop, then walks up to it and sticks her tiny hand out. And that's the end of the video. Now I'm thinking why the hell was she in my room. She used to come in there last year when she would have nightmares and get in my bed. I thought maybe she was thinking about doing that and the webcam freaked her out. I wondered if she slept with me last night and went to her room when she woke up. I'd ask her later. I was about to pull off and head for home when I noticed that her ID card to get her lunch was on the floor of the passenger seat. She likes to sit up front, and yes I know it's illegal. I grabbed it and went to the classroom to return it to her. Her teacher opened the door.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi, Briana! Back so soon?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yeah, my sister left her ID in my car.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh! I'll return it to her for you!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Thank you, Mrs. Martin!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I handed her the card and looked around the classroom. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. I began to walk out of the classroom when a damn telephone frightened me.

&amp;nbsp;

*Rinnnnng* *Rinnnnng*

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped by the door and decided to be nosy for no reason at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hello, Mrs. Martin's classroom.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Uh huh...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh my goodness.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I'm so sorry, please call me back with an update! I'll ask the children if they know anything.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked around the classroom again. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. And Tyler.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyler was missing.

&amp;nbsp;

I felt sick to my stomach and drove home feeling responsible for all of this. I don't know why. It's not like I had gone around kidnapping children. I was sure of it. I didn't want to go back to the school to pick up my sister. I didn't want one of her friends to hand me another note ""I"" had written. I didn't want Tyler to make it on the 10 o'clock news. Or any news for that matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 3:15PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was at my sister's school. I went to her classroom and grabbed her hand, ignored her, *""HI SIS!""* and went straight for the car. I avoided every child from the classroom to the parking lot. When we were finally safe at home, I went into my bedroom and shut the door. A few minutes later, my sister was knocking.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Briana! Here, I don't know what to do with this.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the folded up piece of paper she was holding.

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay, I don't want it, throw it away.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""But-""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""THROW IT AWAY!""*

&amp;nbsp;

She stuck the note in my trash can and that gave me the urge to light the entire thing on fire. She left.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I forgot to ask her about turning my webcam off.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Did you sleep in my bed last night?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""No...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay if you had a bad dream, you can tell me.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I promise I didn't!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Then, why did you come in my room and turn my webcam off?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked confused.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What's a webcam?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I told her never mind and that she could leave my room. I didn't care. I knew she was lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of watching the news, I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I didn't want to see a picture of Tyler staring back at me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:03AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up with the urge to piss in my bed. I hadn't left my room all night, and let my bladder get the best of me! I went to the bathroom, came out and peeked into my sister's room. She wasn't in the bed. I went into the kitchen to see if she was sneaking some food at this time of hour when I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs. They reached the top and my sister looked at me eyes wide opened.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What the hell were you doing down there?*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I thought I head something...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You're supposed to be in bed! You have school in the morning!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Yup. I was still on my mom shit.

&amp;nbsp;

She rolled her eyes at me and walked back to her bedroom. I never thought a 6-year-old would be brave enough to go into a basement at night because they heard a noise. What type of shit is that?

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing her door shut, I decided to take over her mission and see what she was REALLY doing down there.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:10 AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to turn on the light switch by the stairs, but the damn light didn't come on. On top of all of my other problems, I needed to find a light bulb.

&amp;nbsp;

I searched around for the supply cabinet. It was pitch black and clammy and I wanted nothing more than to be back upstairs in my room, but I had to find out what she was doing down here. I was only a few steps away from where we kept the light bulbs so I wasn't in too much of a frenzy. I made my way to the back and fiddled around until I found the handle to the cabinet.

&amp;nbsp;

YES!

&amp;nbsp;

There was an unopened box of light bulbs on the shelf. For some reason I was afraid that it'd be like one of those scary movies where there's one light bulb left and the idiot character drops it. Or when the batteries to a flashlight just so happen to stop working.

&amp;nbsp;

I took one out only to sadly realize that I had to make my way back to the middle of the room to actually CHANGE the bulb. It took me about five minutes of mazing around before I became highly irritated, and threw my hands in the air. I felt something cold and thin travel along the back of my arm. I jumped before realizing it was the chain to the light. I happily unscrewed the bulb above it and replaced it with a new one. And just with the yank of a chain, pitch black became pitch perfect. Yes, I regret saying that, but I won't backspace now. With my newly lit basement, I looked around until I came across a cardboard box taped securely. I had never seen it before so I picked it up (it was pretty light) and I carried it up to my room.

&amp;nbsp;

What I found inside, I cannot explain.

&amp;nbsp;

School supplies. Fucking school supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

A Ninja Turtle notebook.
&amp;nbsp;

A Spider-man pencil case.
&amp;nbsp;

A Batman eraser.
&amp;nbsp;

And a Tweety Bird fucking backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

I fell asleep leaning against my wall trying to figure shit out. And let me tell you, shit was not figured out. I woke up at 7AM again to the sound of my alarm clock. I needed to talk to my sister, find out if she knew about this box. She's only 6 so I know it's highly impossible for someone her age to kidnap children. Maybe she was stealing their school supplies and the disappearances were a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, right.

&amp;nbsp;

I got up and went to my sister's room, but she wasn't in her bed.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I yelled her name a bunch of times before my dad came in asking me why I was screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I can't find Farah. I looked around the entire house!""*

&amp;nbsp;

My dad went outside and I heard him start the car. I went back in my room to hide the box just in case we had to call the police. It was then that I noticed her new Hello Kitty lunch bag was now in the box. Panicking, I decided I would just throw it all away. I took the garbage bag out of my can and began to put items from the box in it, when I noticed the piece of paper my sister threw in there. It had her name on the front of it. I already knew what it said, so I didn't open it. I went outside and threw the trash in the dumpster.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 10:01PM**

&amp;nbsp;

*""A 6-year-old girl by the name of Farah P****** went missing from her bed this morning...""*

Since it was the last week of school, the teacher left ""busy work"" for the morning and a movie for the afternoon. I found the class EXTREMELY challenging, which was later confirmed by other teachers at the school as being the reputation of that class.
  
I had a lot of difficulty keeping the class under control. It was all normal student misbehaviors - they would not stay in their seats, they would not do their work, they would get into arguments with one another, etc. To get their attention, I tried shushing them, clapping, turning on and off the lights but they didn't really respond to any of it. There was also a student with autism, but no student assistant, who kept trying to run out of the classroom when things weren't going his way.

  I felt pretty crappy about it all and have really doubted whether or not I'm cut out to teach, although I did love my internship. I definitely don't want to spend every sub day just trying to survive, so what can I do differently? How can I better manage the behavior of the next (K-6) class I sub? "
