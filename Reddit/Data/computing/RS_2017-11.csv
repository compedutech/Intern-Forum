After a prolific career in cinema, she invested heavily in a lifestyle [magazine](https://www.goop.com) that gave advice to women wanting to succeed and look as pretty as herself, but... well, the contents were shit. I mean, come on, even you at your age realized that beauty is not related to stars and that inserting [jade pieces on your vagina](http://goop.com/wellness/sexual-health/better-sex-jade-eggs-for-your-yoni/) will not make your skin younger...

You thought that she just went along with it, that she pretended to believe in all that to get views, but soon enough, after making up some stories about how bad it is to eat broccoli and backing them with a poorly done fake article done by yourself, that you realized, a little terrified, that she actually believed anything that was published and had a minimal appearance from a legit source, even a fake screengrab or a made up website, which you did to convince her afterwards to get her to buy you a new PC ('Old computers can misalign your son's chakras') and get her to rub a raw onion on her face as a revenge when she punished you to stay home on a weekend ('Raw onion, nature's facial?').

She is gullible. Too much for her own good, specially when it comes this lifestyle, latest éco femininity trends, natural beauty, how to clear chi pathways in the body and whatnot... And you are a horny teen with too much time and wanting to discover the female body and real pleasure...

Sitting in front of your computer, fingers shaking, you start writing an article about how...

* Mixing cum with food is rejuvenating
* Applying a cum mascara everyday is the latest
* A spoonful of cum a day keeps the doctor away
* The dangers of your son not masturbating properly
* Cleaning your family chi through nudism 
* Son-mom bonding through breastfeeding at any age
* ??

After making it, you paste a stock picture of a doctor with a lab coat to make it look legit, and attaching it to a mail you have access to from her magazine, you send it to her personal mail as if one of her interns had discovered the new gold mine and trend for the magazine to write about.

From your room, you hear your mom's phone ping, receiving your mail...

******************************************
Hope you liked it! This would be an ageplay RP based on a mom (let it be Gwyneth or any other celebrity or not that you fancy, let me hear your preferences) that she is too gullible and you finally decide to take advantage of it. It can either be a short RP or a long one, with daringly increasing lies, at your choice ;)

My kinks are cumplay, ageplay, reluctance, celebrities and many more. Let me hear your ideas!"

Lots of the questions will revolve around basic qualitative questions to understand my experience in maths with a focus on stats as well as going into developing plans around questions product managers have and figuring out what data to record and how to analyze them.

Does anyone have any insight into how much hard math I should know? I'm a junior in university studying game design with a marketing minor but I have yet to really dive into any insights analyst classes. I haven't even taken a stats course since AP Stats in high school.

I've analyzed data from usability tests but thats different.

I'm trying to just refresh my memory as much as possible and from what I remember stats math isn't too difficult mainly understanding what biases can occur and how to remedy them is the hard part. Can anyone confirm that?

What level of math do you need? With calculator or no calculator?

What kind of paradoxes are common and I should definitely know? The recruiter mentioned ""Simpson's Paradox."" Never heard about it until now -- should I have?"

I’m noticing now that I’m back to having 10-15 hair fall out each day. The hair that do fall are a mixture of thick/ normal hair and thick hair with thin roots. Sometimes even the Folicle is attached. I am also noticing that my left temple is thinning and is beginning to slowly recede if I don’t act now. I also have thinning in my crown area but I don’t care about it because it’s not super noticeable. 

I am now going to start taking finasteride (0.25mg) once every three days. I encountered a bit of side effects on the 6 month mark the last time I took fin. Nowadays, I am sooo busy that I literally don’t have time to think about anything that wastes my time. I am going to the gym 5 days a week and pursuing lifting to get stronger. I just dead-lifted 225lbs earlier today so I am getting my beginner gains and am losing weight to become healthy. I have been chubby most of my life so going to the gym right after my internship at the medical examiner is very rewarding. I feel that now is a good time for me to take fin because the sides have mostly gone away and I have been waking up with morning wood for weeks now. Yesterday was my first does, will be taking a 2nd dose this Thursday.

I've applied for 20~30 jobs and got a few interviews last month. These interviews didn't go really well probably due to lack of preparation. My grades are decent and I've done 3 internships, but somehow I 'm not getting any interviews recently, and I couldn't find any entry-level developer jobs to apply for anymore. There are other entry-level jobs but they either require web dev experience or Java experience which I don't have. I only did low-level system development (C) during my internships, but only a few companies hire C programmers in Vancouver.

I think I should probably stop searching for jobs now, focus on school and try to learn something new so I can apply for other types of jobs after moving to Vancouver in January. Also, I can have more time to prepare for interviews since I will not need to worry about assignments/exams at that time. But I'm really worried that I couldn't find a job in Vancouver and I need to move back to Toronto, so it is ideal for me to have a job offer before January.

The problem is I have never done any internships and have never had any job opportunities. I have no experience whatsoever. 
I have recently convinced myself that I hate doing business and feel incompetent in my field of business, for I feel like I just went to class for the degree and nothing else; not even to pursue to the knowledge/theories in business classes.

The only thing I feel like I learned anything about business is people skills and how to observe the situation, and maybe a little bit on business thoeries but nothing on how an organization is structured or how to read a financial statement. After graduation, I convinced myself that I wanted to learn computer science and to become an android developer, so I have been studying since then.

While studying I have been getting opportunities to do sales jobs, which again I am not interested in, and feel cocky for since I believe my degree holds more value (I also believe these sale jobs are scam posts in linked in as well). But after so much time of not having any experience whatsoever, I realized that I not doing anything or growing at all.

Right now, I really want to get a job and make some income, while I learn coding; I feel like learning coding and getting a job with coding while not having a degree in Computer Science; makes my dreams seem unrealistic. So right now I believe that I should get a job in something that I at least have a degree in business. 

But the issue is, I feel like I will resent working in business and not find the line of work meaningful (I know I sound spoiled). So I'm really lost right now.

Do I go back to school for a CS degree, or do a bootcamp in CS and then try to find a job afterward; or should I be looking a jobs in business. 
I know I say I hate business, but I have never done any real work in business so I am unsure whether I am just being bias, since I was not interested in the management aspect of business. 

I know that I enjoy doing work involving analyzing and solving problems, hence why I have started learning code, but is there a job like this in business. So what can I even do with a business management degree besides business consulting, and sales? I am so lost and unsure what to pursue here. Do I go for that small business job and build my resume with that experience or do I pursue what I believe I will enjoy doing in the future? 

Any advice that anyone can share or give would be very much appreciated.

7a14kc,7,2017-10-31,Partner and her family is in serious financial trouble,alazar14,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7a14kc/partner_and_her_family_is_in_serious_financial/,"Hi all, 
I'm in a bit of a situation here, and i'm writing this partially to vent, and partially as a cry for advice. 

My partner of 7 years (not married) is in some serious financial trouble. 

Her mother never worked, and depended on her father most of her life. The father left them, and this caused them to loose the home when she was still a minor. By the time the father had left her mother, her mom had become disabled and partially blind. Following that, they moved into a corporate owned apartment, which continues to increase rent every year. They are in such a bad financial situation that they cannot even afford to save enough money for a deposit to move to another place. 

She has her bachelors degree (graduated this year), but is also in quite a bit of debt. She has been unable to find a job, because she didn't get much work experience relevant to her field (her economic status didn't allow her the luxury to do unpaid internships, she had to work retail throughout school). 
She is the first person in her family to go to college, but her family continues to be a giant burden on her. Recently, her mom found out that she owed over 40k, this freaked out my girlfriend. The entire family of 3 (Mom, her, and young brother) is basically living on gov. assistance, and my girlfriend's measly $500 or so a month in part-time retail earnings. 

I am not in a great financial situation either, as I am currently in graduate school, 2 states away from her, and am only able to come back to visit during summers and winter (sometimes in between for a few short days). We both grew up poor, we were both the first in our family to go to college. The big difference between her family and mine is that my mother worked since she was very young, and learned to not depend on anyone (she raised me entirely on her own). She sacrificed a lot so that I could go to school, and have the opportunities I have had. I have been lucky to have a mother like her, and have worked hard to make it into a PhD program with full funding. Further, I currently have zero debt to my name. 

In contrast, my partner's family continuously pressured her throughout her college career, due to their financial situation. She feels the pressure of all of the mother's debt, and now her credit is at risk. Since discovering her mother's recent debt, they have been unable to get enough money together to pay rent, and her name is on the apartment lease. 

I know that I could easily quit my PhD program, move back to my hometown, and get a decent paying job (around $45,000/year) with just my M.A., but I also don't think that would be wise. I can't help but feel some responsibility, some sense of duty to help her. Don't get me wrong, I hate the situation that her family has put her in, and for that I resent her family. But I love her, and I want the best for her. I just don't know what I should do, if anything. 

I wrote this partially to vent, but also to ask for advice. I'm super frustrated about her situation, but can only imagine the stress she must be going through. I have helped her as much as I can in applying for jobs, but the lack of experience is really hurting her. 

What can we do in this situation? More importantly, other than asking for a 1 year deferment for her loans (which she has been granted), what can she do given her horrible situation? 


Thank you all so much.

I have 11 FedLoans totaling about $46,000 (I know I got off kinda cheap didn't I? how sad) I graduated college in December of 2016, and applied for income based repayment in April, was approved in May, and it took effect June 1st, 2017. 

One thing my college didn't do very well was explain loans and do an exit interview, all that jazz. So while yes, I was doing a full time unpaid internship from August 2016 until December 2016, and therefore didn't receive my diploma until December 2016, I dropped below ""full time"" and so my loans came due in March 2017. I had no idea until I logged on to apply for the IBR and noticed they were past due (60 days when I first saw it.) 

When I applied for IBR i inquired about the past due balances, and told them that it was too much. I was unemployed at the time, had no way to pay the past due balances. I was assured it wasn't an issue, approved for IBR with a $0 minimum payment, and my past due balances were put in forbearance as well. 

The accounts show on my credit report as ""Current: paid or paying as agreed"" but with a ""maximum delinquency of 120 days."" 

Obviously with 11 of these accounts total, this has tanked my credit. That is 33 missed payments on my credit report. I want to cry. I can't get approved for a car loan, I can't rent an apartment, I can't do anything. 

Has anyone ever had any luck getting these removed? I attempted to dispute with transunion and all they did was update the account to say ""dispute resolved; reported by grantor"" and then equifax also just updated them to say I was in IBR.

I have almost paid off all of my credit cards and was looking forward to moving out and starting my future and my credit score is crap and it's the biggest source of stress in my life. I can't believe some stupid stupid loans will tank my credit for 7 years. 

Other factors: credit card utilization is at 20% right now so good, 0 derogatory marks, 19 total accounts. Credit age is 4 years, 11 months (nothing much I can do about that) and I have 6 hard inquiries mainly due to student loans. The payment history is by far the worst thing on my report.

So, I am a teenager, will be graduating from high school soon. I am the one to whom you compare yourself when your father compares you to Sharmaji's son; at least you didn't do as bad as I did. And it's pretty evident to me that even though I will get the pass marks due to country policy, there won't be any college waiting for me. And, my parents seriously lack the ability to pay exorbitant fees or donations to get me into some private college. I think I can make it to a local college, but I guarantee you that I will end up dead within the first four semesters. These are less colleges, and more recruitment centres for political parties to fill their goons quota. And I, for the love of God, can't figure out when to keep my trap shut. Sooner or later I will say something to someone, and bam! My body will be in a ditch.

And I know the most sane advice for me would be to just study and work as hard as I can to avoid getting such low scores. And believe me,  I am trying, I really am. But each night is just ending in more tears for me. I seem to lack the minimum capability to make sense of the written materials and books, I can't even recall what I studied an hour back. The only subject that I think I will be okay in is English Literature and Vernaculars since I love reading stories and shit. At this rate, my future looks pretty grim. My friends are studying to be doctors, engineers and shit and I will be stuck forever in this shithole of a place.

Now the thing is I know a bit of programming. Not good enough, but many  other guys (not Indian, I met them on various forums and groups) I know, who have been learning with me and are around the same level as me, are gearing up for internships and apprenticeship after high school. While most of them will attain a college sometime in the future but they ain't that worried about jobs without degrees. Does India have such opportunities? Can I intern for any companies? If not a coding job, any other things I should look into? My town, or half-village or whatever, doesn't have any such opportunities, (unless I am willing to work at a tea stall, in which case it has plenty). I haven't been really to anywhere  that is not within a few miles radius of this town and as such I lack first hand experience about any other places. I tried searching on internet, but most internships are for college students. So is there any such opportunity in India? Or am I just fucked, plain and simple? Anyway, thanks for reading this long."
7a2apa,7,2017-11-01,"Me [20 F] with my SO [21 M] of 1 year, what to expect if we move in together?",lenviot,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7a2apa/me_20_f_with_my_so_21_m_of_1_year_what_to_expect/,"Hello Reddit!

My SO and me have briefly discussed the possibility of us moving together. As for now, our relationship has been very good, we communicate, have a lot in common and enjoy spending time with each other. Usually, we would spend the night at each other's places almost every day, cook together and play games in our free time.


Both are university students but I will be graduating next year before summer, whereas he will start studying again for about 4 years in the same university. I have no plans on moving back to my hometown and I would love to live in the same place we both met (university town). However, I currently live in a student apartment so when I finish I have to move out. Thus, finding a new apartment for myself (that is not for students) would be very difficult here, and since I would start working it would be very nice to come home to someone who I love instead. Benefits of this would be splitting the bill, chores and all that of course. Bonus? Company 100% guaranteed!


**Quick facts about myself:** I am a clean-freak, pay bills on time, have a budget spreadsheet which I follow daily, keep my place nice and clean (did I mention I am a clean-freak?) and can cook any meal (well not any, but I am damn good at it). I stress easily and like to be on charge most of the time.


**About him:** He is the chill one, he does not need to have a strict plan of things, he is very attentive and listens to my needs, he does not enjoy cleaning as I do, but does his part when we hang out. He is fine with me taking the lead on things but does not mind to do it himself (balance is the key right?). He's fun to be around and probably the only person I don't get tired of spending time with (see below).


But even though I would really see myself living with him, I am hesitating about consequences... First of all, my parents would not be happy with this since they wants me to ""do it the right way"" which means engagement first, marriage and THEN move in. But I do not have this desire since I think we are too young and not even close to those steps. The reason I would be fine with moving in is that we are already comfortable with each other being around and work together well.


Second, I need my personal space but I do not mind having him around. However, when we spend time at HIS place, I know that I have no right on telling him who can come over or not. His friends and he himself are usually very chill about just coming over to hang out with him/us whenever, but I feel that if we move in together, this would have to change. It would be not only his place but also mine. I prefer alone time (with/without him) at my home but he tends to be more social than me.


Are we still too early for thinking about this? I know the best way is to talk to him, and I plan on doing it once I get back home from my current internship abroad. It would be good to hear some opinions from you, and get more perspective about this.

Happy Halloween. 

our new episode is ready for download!

Trick or treat? I guess this week its trick. 

The app has been super slow, and nothing too exciting has happened. But here are some highlights.. 

Marathons are over, the last bedsheet has dropped and the last week of gilded is here. We guess we should start seeing some new Marathons very shortly.
Or will we? Are marathons old news? Maybe the sneaky weeklies are the new marathons. 

The speculation is that Topps would seem to be trying to hold onto user base by creating weekly sets to keep people interested or at least coming back in app.
Dragging out the set over weeks, similar to marathons, is a way to keep you holding on. This maybe a smart move seeing as even some of the vets appear to be packing their bags. 
A smart move is that they’re bringing back older sets and offering super awards. At least that works for those that completed the old sets. Appeasing the vets is what they need to do at this point to keep the app alive as it doesn’t appear that new users will be sticking around long in a pay only app. There isnt enough attachment for a new user to bother sticking around when it just costs money. 

Even with the nostalgic sets and weekly drops to ease the pain of opening your wallet, is it enough? The prices and odds may still be too high as it turns out, as we are still seeing inserts stack weeks later. 
Do you think its strange that marathons were so hard this time around? think about it, if it were still the “good old days” we would only be HALF way through new marathons. 
Don’t forget to tell us what you think. 

MONUMENTS. 
Lets remember that once upon a time monuments were something Topps gave us as a reward for something we were doing. For no reason other than we wanted something else to do in the app. 
They never asked us to hoard. It was a gift. Hoarding is something we choose to do. They never promised us anything. But like a business they kinda took the idea and rubbed it in their pants. But we let them do it. 
we shouldn’t have expected a monument. Hoarders hoard because of the love of the game and the character. Doing it for a reward just makes it another base variant. 
This time around, thats what it is. check out the Bay, they’re $14.99. 

What they should have done, was nothing at all. The expectation was too high. 
The counts will be high. Because its open for too long. 
Melding the cards only takes apart the hoard you’ve worked so hard to build. 
And without a name, its a base variant. 
We should have left what we had in the past where its still a good memory. Bringing this all back up just hurts a little. 

This is what else happened this week...

Alphabet set dropped, OE for coin bags and and healthy counts for crystal bags. 

Black and white sigs still seem to be dropping but im not sure who sees the value. This is something to chase for those interested in a charter or just a straight up sig guy. Niche. 

Underworld is over. You can all breathe again. 

Classic arts continue, not bad sets, keep you busy if its in your price range. 

Lots of crystal bag fire sales. HOT TIP none are worth pulling the trigger on. Only appear to be unsellable sets that get thrown in and missing the mark in whats offered in the daily bag offers. Save your gift cards. 

HALLOWEEN hit the market, nice set to chase for anyone, open 24 hours counts good odds and no variants make it a fun daily set. Not trading for anything super valuable but another fun one for the collection. 

Halloween base. Crystal bags only. nuff said. 

Weeklies have been dropping as usual, You’re either in or your out. Except, Out of the box is BACK! but, Weekly. 
Special offer is the super awards for all 3 waves. Stay tuned!

However, the hit of the week is the NOSTALGIC NOUVEAU - must have a new French intern. 
These retro looking blasts of colour are flying off shelves showing that topps can give us something that we want. 
Its a counted card, 1000cc it’s offered in crystal AAAAAAAAAAND COIN bags. No variants, edge to edge design. 
First card sold out in less than 15 minutes, the second less than 30. 
Even the most jaded of players are trying there hands at crystal bags before the coin option hits the store. Thats how its done topps, well done!

Thanks for being great fans and putting up with our terrible jokes, including this one. 
We greatly appreciate your patience while we take a week vacation.

7a364m,0,2017-11-01,Getting an Internship before starting college?,Vedem-Gaming,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/7a364m/getting_an_internship_before_starting_college/,"Good morning everyone! 
Currentl I'm a network Admin and I have been in the Computer/IT world professionally for about 4 years now. Immediately out of high school I found a full time job and started working right away. I knew that in the Computer world experience and certifications can sometimes speak louder than a degree. After working with computers and networking I've come to realize that this isn't what I want to do. As I'm sure many people have done in their lifetime. 

I've always said that if I go back to school it would be for Engineering. That is the only other thing that has interested me and after working with a couple of Electrical Engineers I know that I would like to get my electrical engineering degree. 

Unfortunately my current role requires me to travel very frequently (at least 2-3 times a month) and getting into school is going to be problematic with this role. 

At the moment I live with my Fiance in an Apartment and out rent alone is a fair amount. So I need to have a job that can at least help cover our bills while I am going back to school. I would like to get into something like an internship where I can start gaining electrical engineering experience while also going to school(internship). 

However I would have to find this job before starting school so I can make sure that my schedule is able to accommodate my class schedule. Have you guys ever been in this situation or seen where this situation is possible? Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  "
7a391b,14,2017-11-01,Manhunt: Part 1,StupidHorseface,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7a391b/manhunt_part_1/,"My professors at the university liked to tell us college students that “studying abroad is one of the biggest opportunities one can get, and a massive advantage against others in a job interview”, so as I saw an ad posted at a bulletin board about a four-weeks internship at a large electronics company over in Japan, I jumped at that opportunity. I know, I know, Japan seems like a dream for many people, but to be honest, for me the only important bit was the name of said large company to be written in my resume. The ad was well made, had all the logos and important information on it, so I had no reason to be wary.

I wrote a long E-Mail to the address on the ad, praising myself, my knowledge and the company, and, to my delight, I got an E-Mail back that informed me that I was going to be accepted! Along with it, there was a massive contract about all sorts of things, that, on hindsight, I really wish I had read. But, being in a state of glee, I just printed the whole 200 pages, signed multiple forms about data protection, some disclaimers, packed the whole thing up and sent it to an address that I got via E-Mail. So far, so good. A few months later I received further instructions alongside with some plane tickets, so I packed up my stuff and went on to make the jump over the great puddle.

I arrived at the Tokyo Airport from where I took some weird kind of space train south to Kumamoto. I guess that should have been the time for me to get nervous, since the company that I was visiting is located in Minato, Tokyo. But, whatever. I was kind of bummed out that day because I thought that I was going to be working at a third-party company that was owned by the big one and that wasn’t necessarily what I got in mind. I reached the assigned hotel in Kumamoto and checked in for the night. Upon reaching my room, I found a letter for me which informed me that tomorrow an official would come and pick me up from the hotel to take me to the designated location. That’s fine, I thought, and proceeded to go to bed. It had been a stressful day with all the travelling and the new impressions, and I wanted to be well rested to make a good impression in the morning.

I woke up to a dark hotel room. Something was off, I knew that right from the moment I opened my eyes. I was a exceptionally light sleeper, and would often wake from minor disturbances. I kept laying still to figure out what had set me off this time. After a while, I could make out a very silent hissing noise. The air conditioning, I thought. I tried to resume sleeping, but the sound, as silent and small as it was, kept me awake. It began to seep through the integrity of my whole self, penetrated my sanity and with every second that passed on, I felt myself slipping deeper and deeper into a furious rage. Suddenly, I had enough. I flipped my bedsheets and sprang up from the bed. Except for, I actually punched myself in the face because my arm felt like it was made from lead, and fell face first to the ground as I rolled from my bed. Something was very, very wrong. I tried to stand up, but felt it very hard to even move my limbs. The metallic taste of shock and panic rose in my mouth. Was I having a stroke? My panic rose, as I felt darkness chewing away at the edges of my vision. Suddenly, everything went dark.

*A dark alley. Screams in the distance. Sirens. People running, falling, stepping on each other in an insane frenzy as everyone scrambles away. I look up. The sky is dark, lit by an orange glow of a hundred fires. I feel powerful, huge. I look down. I’m on all four. My hands are disfigured limbs of pure monstrosity. Three fingers, two thumbs. All with obsidian claws, sharp as a ceramic dagger. Somehow, I am fascinated by it. My arms are muscular, scaled, but also overgrown by a shiny fur, like the one you would see on a Doberman dog. The insides of my palms are dark. A fluid is dripping from my claws to the floor. I know it’s blood, I can smell it. I raise my hand to my nose and take a deep breath. Thousands of different smells hit me like a strong wave. A new part of my brain jumps to life, and I instantly feel a massive amount of information flow into my consciousness. Eighteen different people. Seven women, eleven men. None of them older than 35. One of the men had tuberculosis. Another was pumped with excessive amounts of some kind of antidepressant. I feel bad about them.*

*As I lower my hands, I take a look around me. I am in some sort of hallway, in a building. The place is heavily messed up. My hands and feet make no audible sound as I begin to travel down the hallway. In front of me lies a body, trampled by the fleeing pack of humans that try to get away from me. As I move closer, I can hear the heartbeat. The woman is on the edge of death. Somehow sensing my approaching, she turns herself around in a last attempt of defiance. My arm rises, the claws spread out. Wait a minute, I don’t want to kill that woman! No matter how heavy her injuries may be, I’m not going to be the one who ends her life. I realize just now, that I’m not the one in charge of this body that feels like mine. I feel a mild surprise, that didn’t emerge from my own self. Something is in this brain together with me. No, the opposite is the case. I am inside another brain, and now I’m busted. It doesn’t want me there, where I fight against its will to do unspeakable things to the poor woman down there on the floor. I feel a strong reluctance against my presence. It’s so much stronger than me, and slowly, very slowly, the raised claws start moving again, faster and faster, gathering more and more energy, targeted right at the face that stares up on me, wearing a mask of pure, unadultered terror. Right as it hits, I feel like I’m getting flinged away. Everything goes back to black.*

*I’m sorry, random woman.*

Blue Sky. A bright sun. Birds are flying. I think those are… yes, those are seagulls. It’s warm around me. I raise my arm, and to my relief, it is my regular, human arm that I spend countless hours on shaping at the gym. Sand falls from my hand into my eyes. I sit up, rubbing my eyes to get it out. My head hurts. I feel a thirst that could empty a whole bathtub. With the sand removed, I take a look around. I’m on a beach. A rather nice one, to add. Nice, white sand, a nice, blue colored sea. Palm trees. It’s a perfect cliché of a holiday beach resort. Minus the people, I must add. To my left, the beach ends in bushes and rocks that look volcanic, you know those, sharp edged, black volcano stone. To my right, the beach continues a couple hundred feet and disappears around a corner. Behind me is a jungle of palm trees and other plants, seemingly impenetrable. As I try to get up, my hand brushes cold metal. I look down, and its... a shotgun? Some kind of Mossberg, I guess. I pick it up, it’s loaded. To my other side lies a backpack. I open it up, and the first thing I see is two bottles of water.

Never in my whole life have I ever tasted something that good. It’s amazing, like an elixir of the tears of god. That’s a stupid metaphor, its fresh water. I keep sitting for a while, trying to figure out what the hell happened to me, how I came here, and what I’m going to do next. I have no idea what happened after the hotel room. My clothes are the same that I came to Japan with, say: a T-Shirt with the logo of a metal band, khaki cargo shorts and my trusty shoes with separate toes. I can feel my headache starting to fade, and I decide to get going, shoulder the backpack, take the Mossberg (you never know), and start to head down the Beach. Maybe I will find someone who can tell me where I am, and how I got here.

End of part one."
7a3cpa,24,2017-11-01,Tardy senior,NAMMANNAMMAN,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/7a3cpa/tardy_senior/,"Hi all 

I need some practical advise re: a condescending preppy type, tardy senior

I have a senior resident who is always late.  Like 5 to 15 minutes.  Every single rotation.  Gets by, barely passing. Who cares. 

Well I finished my goddamn 13 hr night shift + 2hr drive + 1hr to shower/eat/talk to family. Giving me only a few hours of sleep. 

She is never on time when I have to give signout in the morning at 5am after finishing the graveyard shift.   More importantly shit comes up, nurses call, codes happen bla bla bla and I don't want to deal with any of that once I am done at the end of my drsignated time. I am mentally n physically exhausted, and would rather sleep hungry in a call room in mt scrubz than drive home, shower n eat.

This woman just comes in as she pleases, bosses me around for around few seconds and then eventually settles down ""ready"" for report. By the time I am out its 30 to 45 minutes after my designated time. 

How do I deal with this? Esp because the whole ""does not show interest"" ""is not a team player"" comes across making me look bad when that is not the case. I mean just be professional and come on time. 

She has set a poor example for my co-intern who also waddles in half asleep 5 to 7 mins late. And now the medical students n NPs show up willy-nilly. 

The other day I waited n waited finally putting in orders for a new admit n she waltzes in late saying 'let's do report, you can do that later"". 

No, missy, i can't do it later. You mean at my expense n not at hers? Even though she is late and I am technically putting in her orders coz the admit was during her shift to which she is late, n not mine.  UGH. 

Yesterday she left without putting in admit orders, nor seeing 2 patiennts that were admitted on her shift.  Leaving the nurses to page me to get it done n documenting it as me not doing it in the first place. 

Today the pager went of at 4:58am for an admit, and i am still fucking waiting for madame facnypamts to arrive. I shpuld, but dont want to leave at 4:58 to see the patient when signout is at 5. Plus i cant put in orders n notes until the patient is in the system. Coz then by the time I am back it would like an hour late. So I waited it out. By the time the patient was in the system it was 5:10. Only then can admit orders be put in. That's her fucking shift.  Not mine.  I am waiting to see the drama tonight.  

Yesterday when I arrived to start my graveyard 4pm shift she was no where to be seen till 5. No signout n idea wtf is going on. I am sitting there like a fool. Sassy lady shows up 45 mins later n is like ya it got busy since 1pm. She gives me a halfassed signout with still 3 outstanding patients n leaves. I later discover she hasn't put in.orders for any neither seen them. And I look back at the charts. We had one admit at 1. N then these 3 that she didn't bother with.  Like wtf. What was she doING?   If she was  infact was busy how poor are her time management skills??? Actually prwtry poor. I have aeen interns n reaosnt be ready for rpund bedoee she ia. And she has the easiest of the patinets coz she is the senior. And by the time she physically left the hospital it was 8 - like 3 hrs later. Why is she still here! 

Now, I am already backed up coz she left me a buuch of patients pushing my further back n making me look inept. Now I have to step up my game n energy to catch up n be on top of new incoming patients 

Today morning i started report at 5:10 immediately as as she waltzes in. She says ""I know you have to go home but give others the time to arrive, it's so early in the morning, n others need the information too"". Well fuck you. Yes I do fucking need to talk to my kids who I havn't seen in 8 months. Yes I do fucking need to go home coz running 4 floors as an intern isn't a fucking joke esp with pissy faculty.  I am fucking tired n sleepy. I will sleep here on rhe fucking floor i had no shame. Yes, others fucking need the info n they should ALSO fucking be here on time.  Yes it is fucking 5 in the morning for you but it my 5am after a 13 hr night shift so shut the f up. 

I started n continued report anyway. 

Anyway guys I don't know who to talk to without sounding like a snitch. Without coming across as a poor team player. Without sounding like I don't care or am not interested in the patients n in the program.

Like I don't have enuf shit to deal with.  Smh. N she is to be my senior for the rest of this year n the next. I need to handle this delicately. Also, she is barely passing, had to repeat multiple rotations, and I have previously given her a poor evaluation. This n other resident's evaluations could be enuf to kick her out. Which is a double edged sword. Someone n by that I mean us interns are going to pitch in n cover the program for being 1 senior resident short.  Has happened previously so I can't expect that that is they the program willl handle it again. 

If she brings up any of this tmrw or is ever late again n asks my abt orders for patients that I did not place I feel like I will lose my shit n tell her to be on time. I will also most definitelyask her why she thinks is ok for her to not put in orders for admits on her shift. I feel like my tone would be aggressive n blamatory n retaliatory n vengeful coz that is who I am n I know how I react in situations involving interpersonal conflict.  

Anyway thank for reading my rant.  Time I get some sleep now. Thank god for an outlet. Sayonara. 

Oh I technically only have 3 more shifts with her till the end of this rotation n I pray to God I don't have to work with her in sny rotation for the next 2 years.

7a3n2s,2,2017-11-01,Und jetzt nochmal: Versteuerung von Fonds ab 2018,Streetwind,Finanzen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/7a3n2s/und_jetzt_nochmal_versteuerung_von_fonds_ab_2018/,"Aus gegebenem Anlass (soll heißen: jedes Mal wenn ich kurz weggucke bin ich wieder genauso verwirrt) habe ich jetzt nochmal überprüft, was die Steuer-Neuregelung für Fonds ab 2018 für mich bedeutet. Deswegen will ich hier mal darlegen, was ich persönlich verstanden habe, und welche Fragen noch offen sind. Und ihr schlauen Leute klärt mich dann auf :)

Ich habe Anteile am ETF110 (ComStage MSCI World UCITS ETF).

1.) Da die Fondswährung in USD angegeben wird, gehe ich davon aus, dass das ein ausländischer (Amerikanischer) Fonds ist, und kein Deutscher. Das bedeutet, dass *keine* zusätzliche 15% Körperschaftssteuer auf vom Fonds erzielte Erträge erhoben wird. Als US-Fonds zahlt er bereits 35% Körperschaftssteuer in den USA, sowohl in der Vergangenheit wie auch in der Zukunft. Somit ändert sich für mich nichts - ich stehe weder besser noch schlechter da.

2.) Da es sich um einen Aktienfonds handelt, erhalte ich in Zukunft auf mit dem Fonds erzielte Kapitalerträge eine Teilfreistellung von 30%, solange der Steuerfreibetrag bereits ausgeschöpft ist. Dies soll bei Deutschen Fonds die Verluste, die dem Anleger durch die neue Körperschaftssteuer entstehen, ersetzen. Allerdings kommen, wie bereits oben erwähnt, keine zusätzlichen Steuern für diesen Fonds auf. Die Teilfreistellung bekomme ich trotzdem. Wenn ich das richtig verstehe, zahle ich auf Verkaufserlöse ab 2018 also *weniger* Abgeltungssteuer als noch im Moment - ich stehe *besser* da als vorher!

3.) Zukünftig muss auf die Wertsteigerung eines thesaurierenden Fonds jährlich Abgeltungssteuer gezahlt werden, auch wenn man gar keine Erlöse erzielt (""Vorabpauschale""). Dazu errechnet der Broker eine sogenannten Basisertrag: 70% des Fondswertes zum Jahresbeginn, multipliziert mit dem von der Bundesbank veröffentlichten Basiszins. Steuern werden dann entweder auf diesen Wert berechnet, oder auf die tatsächliche Wertsteigerung, je nachdem, welche *kleiner* ausfällt. Im Klartext: man zahlt eigentlich immer Steuern auf die eigentliche Wertsteigerung. Erst wenn der Fonds mehr als 70% innerhalb eines Jahres ansteigt, wird der zu versteuernde Betrag gedeckelt (in der Praxis ein glaube ich unerreichbarer Wert). Diese Steuern habe ich vorher nicht gezahlt, muss sie aber in Zukunft zahlen. Somit stehe ich *schlechter* da als vorher!

4.) Allerdings ist die Bank verpflichtet, darüber Buch zu führen, wieviel Steuern ich so ""im Vorraus"" schon gezahlt habe. Wenn ich Jahre später dann tatsächlich Fondsanteile mit Profit verkaufe, werden mir die bis dahin angefallenen Vorabpauschalen von der Steuerlast abgezogen. Ich habe die Steuern ja bereits in der Vergangenheit gezahlt!

Unterm Strich: ich verliere den Steuerstundungseffekt eines thesaurierenden Fonds. Im Gegenzug werden 30% meiner Verkaufserlöse von der Abgeltungssteuer befreit. Hmmm... ich weiß ja nicht, wieviel mir die Steuerstundung tatsächlich bringt, aber 30% ist mal ein ziemliches Wort! Ich würde das so interpretieren, dass ich unterm Strich besser dastehe als vorher.

Soweit schön und gut... allerdings gibt es da ein paar Dinge, die ich nicht verstehe, bzw. die unzureichend erklärt werden. Und vielleicht hab ich sogar das Prinzip völlig falsch verstanden.

* Zum einen habe ich [folgendes Rechenbeispiel](https://www.avl-investmentfonds.de/img/berechnungsbeispiel_besteuerung_gewinn_fondsanteile_2018.png) gefunden, welches den Prozess verschaulichen soll. Allerdings zeigt das was ganz anderes, als die Webseite selbst in ihrem Text erklärt! Hier wird die Vorabpauschale erst bei Verkauf fällig, und dann als zusätzliche Belastung? Häääh?
* Zum anderen: was ist, wenn der Fonds drei Jahre lang steigt, und man zahlt Abgeltungssteuer auf die Kurssteigerung, aber dann fällt der Fonds wieder, und man verkauft mit +/- Null tatsächlichem Gewinn? Muss man dann bein Finanzamt eine Steuer-Rückerstattung beantragen? Oder läuft das intern bei der Bank?"
7a3qef,1,2017-11-01,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7a3qef/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I'm a junior in CS at a non-CS oriented private school, 3.3 GPA, not too many projects. I'm trying for my first internship after not being able to during past summers (details irrelevant.) I recently interviewed, managed to impress and received an offer from JPMC for their Tech Analyst intern program. I've applied to other places where I don't think my resume would be too competitive, big 4, fintech, etc. 

I'm continuing interview prep and considering lowering my focus on that, since classes are demanding more from me lately, but I'm not sure if it's worth my time. 
Anyone have any experience going straight to a big-4, a unicorn (or any other more tech-oriented company) with these sort of credentials, or any advice they'd like to offer? 

Thanks a bunch. "

7a4rwz,17,2017-11-01,How I blew $3400 worth of bitcoins and $2500 of cash on painkillers between Aug. 20th and Oct. 28th,YoungGoosebump,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7a4rwz/how_i_blew_3400_worth_of_bitcoins_and_2500_of/,"There I was, 4 months sober at the start of August. I had spent all summer away from my hometown on the amazing West Coast. I was working, exercising, eating properly, and enjoying sunshine. I was around my family, a couple friends, and fellow coworkers I had met at my summer internship. 

Then, around Aug 16th I had to go back to the Midwest. I could feel myself slipping into a depressed state the moment I reached the airport to head back to my hometown. Every passing moment on the plane was filled with bi-polar thoughts, switching between negative and positive. 

Then... I landed...

The moment I got off that fucking plane, it was like I had entered a new arena, a new battlefield, a new life. I immediately wanted to go back to the West Coast but I couldn't due to school. I was forced to be here, and I didn't know what to do, or how to cope. 

So what did I do? 

I pissed away 4 months of sobriety and called up the pill heads I hadn't talked to in several months. From there everything spun out of control. From August 20th until Oct 1st, I pissed away all of my money. Even though I am in college, I had developed a bitcoin portfolio that at the time was $3400 (As of Nov. 1st, it would be worth a lot more), along with $2000 in cash.

Where I was born in the midwest is still flooded with pills, even though there have been major cutbacks by the government and big pharma. So the street dealers, and monthly script receivers took all my money.

Once I was out of hard cash....

I started selling my bitcoins for USD, and then transferring every last penny into my bank account. From there I went on 41 day bender where I was high as fuck on painkillers during the morning and day, drinking booze every evening, and popping xanax multiple times a week to sleep. 

Then on October 1st, I woke up and realized how I had no money for gas or food or anything. So I started to go through horrible withdrawal. I would be sitting in lecture for statistics class and I felt like I was going to pass out and die in front of everyone. After about a week or two of this hell I knew I had to make a change.

So I called a very good friend and lied to him about why I was broke and why I need to borrow $500 until January. Luckily we are on great terms and he agreed to give me the money with no questions. 

So what do I do?

Go buy more pills instead of getting clean and trying to get my shit together. RELAPSE CITY BABY! IT FEELS SO FUCKING HORRIBLY GREAT!

Then October 28th hit and I ran completely broke again. I knew I couldn't ask for anymore hand outs, so now I am trying to figure out where to go from here. 

Currently I am on day 4-5 of being clean and it is horrible. I have no energy, no appetite, my social anxiety is so bad I have been missing classes because I don't want my classmates or friends to see me like this. In fact, my friend group at my university has become suspicious of my whereabouts because I have been avoiding the hell out of everyone, even my best friend Jack. 

My mental state is horrible. Every time I look at the price of bitcoin GO UP AND UP AND UP AND UP, I literally want to take a gun to my head and kill myself. It's fucking terrible. Every time my family calls me, I have to muster up all my energy and act super happy over the phone and lie about how well I am doing. 

I just want to blow my brains out. What the fuck is wrong with me.


AVERAGE DAILY DOSAGE DURING PEAK USE:  60mg of oxy, 20mg of hydro, alcohol, 1mg-2mg of xanax.

I really don't want to stay in Ireland, not because I hate it. The reason I'd love to go to the Basque country is because that's where my girlfriend is living (long distance relationship). 

I've come to understand that Spain isn't the best country to move to as a graduate but I'm really optimistic. My hope is to have a job set up and then move (I understand a lot of employers probably won't be comfortable hiring a graduate who's not even in the country).

Another option is to work any job I can find there for a few months until I can find something that is related to my degree.

I don't have a good level of Spanish so I feel this may restrict a lot of opportunities and I also don't have that much experience.

The relevant experience I have to date is:
3 years: Dell as Data analyst intern
6 months: Propylon  quality assurance analyst
3 months: Servicedesk at my college

I would really appreciate any advice as I've been searching for jobs online and it's not been fruitful. I really just don't know what is the best way to go about this."

I do have a strong CS background growing up. I've been applying to jobs since late August with no success. 200 job applications actually. I've only gotten responses from 20 of them, a lot of them from referrals. That turned into 5 on-site interviews, 3 of which have been rejections and the other 2 upcoming ones I've lost all confidence for.

I've become a social recluse turning down all social activities to apply to jobs/practice technical questions/interview. Or struggling to finish my schoolwork because of lack of time. I'm definitely not suicidal or anything like that other guy, but so I'm just *so* fucking stressed out and frustrated right now. Like I know I'm smart (like actually smart: I placed in all sorts of math competitions growing up, among other things) and I figure that as long as I've been working hard like I have been, I should've gotten something by now, but I haven't. And it's already November, and before you know it the holiday season is upon us and it's 2018. (Remember, I graduate this December).

7a5ztv,2,2017-11-01,Leaving Retail,MaskYourExpressions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7a5ztv/leaving_retail/,"I've been working at Costco. Important things to note:
- Health and Dental
- I make $15/hr, and time and a half on Sunday. Eventually I top out at about $21/h. Bonus checks kick in around the same time.

However, my building is a hellhole. So with these benefits come
- Verbal abuse from supervisors and management
- Favoritism in regards to everything
- Expectation of doing the job of 3 people.

Needless to say, I hate the job with every fiber of my being and I want to quit. However, I also currently go to college for Computer Science. I'm half way through my (hopefully) second to last semester. My grades aren't the best due to working while in school, and I've never gotten an internship. But I really really dislike the concept of loans, so I've avoided them...until now?

I want to leave Costco, yesterday. I won't go into it, but I find the actions of management disgusting, disrespectful, and unforgivable. However, I've never been wealthy and I have no help from family or anything, so there's a mentality that I can't shake that won't let me throw caution to the wind and just quit. College tuition is taken care of, but leaving the job would require me taking out loans in order to survive during that time. I live very basic means (currently in my car), so it won't necessarily be a large loan. Still, the idea of leaving guaranteed long term income, not knowing if I'll land on my feet after school, worries me. There are a lot of stories on this sub about that makes me feel like I shouldn't put all my eggs in the CS basket.

Costco actually has a college retention program. This allows you to take time off, only working during winter/summer break. You need to apply for it at the start of a semester, though, making it so I would have to wait until January to put in for it, when I'm at the end of my rope now. I want to use my last semester at school to really dive into the tech field, without the stress from Costco weighing me down.

Has anyone here even been in a similar situation? I have some ""escape tactics"", but I'm curious to what the general view is.

I'm also becoming more and more disgruntled with the social experiences here, and the boring-ness of the school and town. I'm originally from STL and just kind of gave up and decided to go to S&amp;T because a lot of my friends were going here. I also fell into the marketing trap and thought that getting a degree from here would be more 'prestigious', but it really doesn't matter, especially in CS.

I know how to code and have even landed an internship with one of the Big N. At this point, I just kind of want to be done and get my degree.

To further that, I was thinking of transferring to MSU. I imagine it's a bit of an easier school all around. Is that necessarily true, and also what's the CS program like? I'm looking at the Software Development option and picking and choosing what theoretical classes I'd like to take. I am not fond of all of the theoretical aspects of CS such as things like finite automata and turing machines, but I do sort of like spacial/computational complexity, Big O notation, operating systems, etc.

I recently had an interview for an internship with a financial advising company, and everything went great. 

He mentioned getting licensed, which got me to thinking about it, so I asked, and found that I can't be hired by the company because of my record. 

2 felonies, convicted 04/2014 and 06/2015, both of them were marijuana possession convictions. 

I have never been to prison, nor done any significant jail time (had to pass a UA to get out of county jail, took me 6 days) 

I get that I broke the law, but through these experiences, I'm a much different, and I'd like to think, a better person because of it. 

Since being convicted, I have come back to college, been taking 15+ hours a semester (21 currently) at a state University, and don't want it to all be for nothing if I can't get a decent job because I made a bunch of bonehead decisions when I was younger. 

I've still got other interviews for internships with some companies for this coming summer, so now I'm curious what all types of jobs I can even legally get into, and what kinds of jobs I'm completely out of luck for. 

Also, should I tell my interviewers in the first interview, after they've shown some interest, or wait until a background check comes?

I know I need to tell them before the background check comes back, but I'm unsure wether I should tell them from the beginning, or try to make a good impression first and then let them know once we've gotten things going. I don't want to feel like I'm wasting either mine or their time by not telling them, but I don't want to immediately be written off because of that conviction. 

Any advice would be tremendously helpful, especially from those of you who are involved in that process and have maybe been through this before. "

My name is Sarah. In May I graduated from a 5 year double bachelors program where I double majored in German and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering. The program is 5 years because you go to Germany for a year (study and internship).

After school I took a job at an elevator company doing a training program to be a project manager because it was the first job I was able to get after searching for many months and I was starting to get scared I wouldn't get hired so I just took it. I'm realizing its not a perfect fit but I will probably stick with it for a while just to get some experience out of college.

I have so many varied interests that I have no idea what career/job would be right for me. They include the following:

* Statistics/ statistical methods/ experimental design
* Process improvement/ process optimization (not keen on the idea of working in a factory but I'm interested in improving non-manufacturing processes)
* Traffic systems/ traffic flow management
* I'm really good at CAD (Solidworks) and I love doing it (including fluid mechanics simulations, stress/strain evaluation, all the advanced stuff as well as regular drafting)
* I'm really good at Excel and I love using it to solve problems (using the different formulas, learning new ones, using the solver function and setting up optimization problems that way, I have basic handle on writing and employing macros using VBA to make tasks faster/ make ""excel calculators"" for repetitive tasks)
* I really like computer programming (i have a good grasp on Python but that's the only language I know), in my last year of college I did an independent study writing a genetic algorithm from scratch in python and I absolutely loved it
* I'm interested in Big Data and IoT but I don't have a computer/software engineering background so I don't know how I would ever enter that field

Does anyone have any advice on a good job/ place to look that I might be able to combine some of my many interests? I kind of feel like I'm all over the place and I just don't even know what I should be searching for. Searches for ""Industrial Engineer"" on places like Indeed.com usually turn up with manufacturing engineering things and like I said I'm not too keen on the factory work environment.

Just a little background, I already possess a M.S. in Physics (2015) and since been trying to transition into the data science/analytics industry. I have done things such as The Data Incubator bootcamp and have a decent grasp at basic concepts like machine learning. So I'm not a complete noob. 

Unfortunately, I have done interviews and always fall short of landing the job. It has mostly been due to experience in knowledge and work. But it hasn't been all bad as I am freelancing to pick up projects when I can and currently working on a contract that could potentially lead to a full-time job. 

My parents are tired of me failing in my job prospects and my father keeps insisting I go work as a physicist instead of a data scientist, despite the fact I've spent all my resources into learning more and more about machine learning and other topics in the field. As a result, they are almost forcing me to apply to graduate schools to get another M.S. (stereotypical asian family).

My question, ""Is it worth it to even apply to graduate schools now?"" If I did apply I would only apply to ones I would really want to go to vs. just to get accepted. 
i) It forces me to retake the stupid GRE (hate it and std exams with a passion) because my scores are expired. Not hard, just annoying
ii) Would I even be competitive vs. other applicants.
iii) Is it even necessary? My gut instinct says I should just focus on building my career and see where my freelancing and continuing job search takes me. 

The pros of continuing another degree would be to focus on fields I'm most interested in like NLP (i know some stuff, but it getting some expert knowledge on it would be awesome). The fact that I could be eligible for internships since I would be a student, that would finally get me that ""work experience"" in industry that so many jobs are looking for. 

I'm not looking for interview advice or anything because I am very well aware of my current weaknesses (which I am working on rectifying). 

I'm at a crossroads in my life and seeing what professionals and others think I should do. "

EDIT:Thank you for your words encouragement! A year ago I didn't even have the mindset to grind for an internship. Also, my school is not a big name school in CS, so that results in no type of on campus recruitment. So Im doing my best I can with what I have. Thank you once again!"

I've already had the technical interviews and just a few days ago I was told my application would be passed on to the hiring committee for review. 

From your experiences, how did the rest of the process go? How long did it take for them to get back to you and if you moved forward, how did the project selection go?"

I'm currently on the full time job hunt. I've had several different internships (HVAC, Maintenance, Process Improvement) in the Mechanical Engineering industry. I've come away from each of them disappointed. I've never had an interest in any of my projects that I was doing. Now during my interviews for full time, I'm feeling the same sense of unfulfillment that I had in my previous internships from the job descriptions. I don't really want to enter into a manufacturing environment. I want to be more challenged and work on something innovative. During my schooling, I've felt the most excited in my computer programming classes (C++, MATLAB, and Python mostly). So my question is are there Mechanical Engineering jobs that pertain to more computer science responsibilities? If so, what are some of the industries or companies with these jobs? Should I look into going for a Master's degree or a Bachelor's degree for CSE? Were the industries I was working in just not very exciting? Are there more exciting ME industries? Thank you"

7a7o9z,5,2017-11-01,Oh please... i feel like my life is a mess. Please help me be better,bubababa93,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7a7o9z/oh_please_i_feel_like_my_life_is_a_mess_please/,"Updated. I feel that my life is a mess on every possible level. I know there are looots of worse things that they could happened, but for sure i hit my rock bottom in regards with my feelings. And of course no one to discuss them with. Overall, i think i haven’t genuinely  smiled in over an year and I am trying to make myself feel more energized, happy, to lose weight (60kg, 167cm), i do not feel appreciated and for sure no one is going to appreciate me if i do not appreciate myself. I have low self esteem and unfortunately not enough money to go to a therapist. I have tried a few times going to the gym, but usually after two weeks I lose motivation. 
Tomorrow i am starting an internship ( it is going to be my first day) and i lack any emotion besides some anxiety because I will have to talk in german, which is not my mother tongue. 
Please, if you ever found any help (cure) for anxiety, sadness, light depression, lack of motivation, let me know. I do not want to decay any further, cuz for sure i used to be motivated to do anything. Now i just feel like a dead fish in a pond. 

Update: Thank you for your messages! 
To be honest, i felt good overall! A little confused about what I need to do since my supervisor was not in the office today. It also felt a bit strange that i was the youngest (24) in my department, where about 40 persons work, and i think the next oldest person after me was 15 years older, and other older than 40 with approximately 3 kids at home. I am still trying to figure out what to discuss about besides work. 
The language was not a big problem, or at least yet. 

I followed ( or currently following) your advice, guys. I baked 50-60 mini cupcakes for the people in my department just to thank them and i am planning on offering them to the ones in my office and after that i will put them in the kitchen for everyone. 

Also, i got slightly too excited today, after my bf asked me if i could help him with an event (running dinner) because he needs to prepare dessert for half of dozen persons and has no clue on how to do it. Ofc he told me to chill, since we usually fight about me being overexciting when he asks for my help. 

It was an ok day, still didn’t feel happy, but at least I had satisfaction feelings a few times today.

If anyone is willing to continue the below with me I would be forever grateful to you for helping to fulfill a fantasy that I've had for a very, very long time.I'm happy to hear from anyone, i'm fairly flexible, whether you want long or short exchanges, a long or short term RP, or even if you have certain elements you'd like to change/add Please feel free to message me to continue the scene, speak about it, or anything else. I hope you enjoy reading the below.
Its the 14th of December. Its 2am, the night is coming to an end.
I bring my glass to my lips, finishing the last of my gin and Tonic, downing about half the glass in one go. We all put our glasses down on the table at the same time. Me and a few of the work guys are completely smashed. A long evening of food, alcohol, cigars and dancing starting to take its toll. My phone vibrates, a notification from the minicab firm that the company had arranged the week before was 5 minutes away. I tell the guys i'll see them tomorrow. ""8:00am sharp. Last one gets the bacon rolls in!"" we all laugh as i shake their hands and walk away
I need to find her. Our company has had a bad year, so to save money they've pooled everyone's cabs by area. Us two are the only ones living in North West London, so we're sharing the cab home.
I walk to the cloakroom, taking care not to stagger and reveal how drunk i really am. The senior directors are still around, I cant give a bad impression. Fumbling around the pockets of my tuxedo trousers for my token. ""I'll find her as soon as I get my coat, she's probably waiting outside for me already."" I think to myself. Trying my best to muster any ounce of logic i have left.
I feel a tap on my shoulder ""Hey, there you are!"" she says, her sultry voice like music to my ears, her warm breath running down my neck, making me shiver. I spin around, shes standing behind me in the queue, my eyes quickly glancing from her heels to her face, taking in her sophisticated heels, her slender, toned legs protruding so seductively from her tight fitted, classy red dress. Her pink lips, and her long brunette hair flowing down just past her shoulders. ""Jesus"" I think to myself. She looks even more beautiful than she normally does in the office. She has to be the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. She’s like a work of art, and I can’t take my eyes off her.
I’ve fancied her since I joined the company just under a year ago. She was so helpful and kind when I was new, and I was so grateful to her for her help in settling in. We were both in our mid-twenties, graduates working in an investment firm. We only worked a few desks away, but we were so busy that we didn’t get a chance to speak much at work. Whenever we did though, it made my day, I loved speaking to her, she was so funny, so charming, and I was always so glad whenever I ran into her in the kitchen and had a brief 5 minute chat. She never failed to put a smile on my face. It didn’t do any harm that she was absolutely gorgeous either. About 5”4, probably around a size 6, she always wore tight fitted skirts and dresses that sent my imagination running wild. I could never really place whether she was in to me, or if she was just being kind and friendly like she was to everyone. I hoped she didn’t think I was some sort of creep. ""Hey! There you are!"" I reply, smiling politely as I catch her eye, she smiles back. ""How are you? Have you had a good night?"" I ask. ""Yes! It was great, my heels are killing me though, i've been dancing all night, I can't wait to get in the cab and take them off!"".”Haha, yeah I bet you can't. You look a little worn out."" I reply, grinning. ""OH! Well thanks!. You're not looking too fresh either!"" she replies, pointing to my now crooked bowtie, giggling sweetly.
""Next please"" Calls the cloakroom attendant, so engrossed in our conversation that we're both slightly surprised to find ourselves at the front of the queue. Hesitating, i gather my wits and respond ""Oh.. After you."" She smiles, and her taken to the attendant. I step up behind her, and place mine on the counter too. He returns with her coat, handing it to her. ""Just a moment, Sir, I'll just get your coat for you now"". I nod, smiling at the attendant in response. I look over, seeing her struggle to put on her coat as she holds her purse. “Here, let me do it” I say, smirking to myself. “I put my arms out, holding her coat for her, she slides her arms in effortlessly, and wraps the black coat around herself. “Oh.. my knight in shining armour.” She remarks sarcastically. “Come on, lets go.. the cab drivers probably been waiting ages for us!” only barely containing my laughter as I speak. “Oops!” she replies. I take my coat from the attendant, holding it on my arm, thanking him as we leave the prestigious, swanky 5 star Belgravia hotel together.
I Hold the cab door open for her, looking away instinctively to preserve her modesty as she steps into the cab. I needn’t have bothered, maintaining her ladylike elegance so effortlessly even after a long night of drinking, she steps through the door gracefully and settles down on the seat. I step through the door, stumbling clumsily into the seat beside her. “Oh dear. Did someone go a little overboard tonight” She asks innocently. Her eyes sparkling so beautifully. “Hmm. Perhaps, just a little...” “Right, I’m gonna drop you off first mate, and then her afterwards” calls the cockney driver from the front as he pulls of the car park, and onto the main road. “Oh, actually, would you mind dropping her off first, please?” I ask. Even in my drunken state remembering my parents preaching to always make sure the lady gets home safely first. “Can do mate, but it’s going to add an extra thirty minutes to the journey, and cost about 40 quid extra.” “No”, she interjects firmly. “Honestly, its fine, you don’t need to do that. Don’t be silly.” I agree very reluctantly, still not entirely comfortable with the situation.
We settle down as the driver speeds along through central London. We spend our time catching up, it’s been several months since we had a proper catch up. She tells me about her job, she’s recently been promoted to managing a few of the younger interns. Her family, how frustrated she gets with her boss. And then we start talking about relationships. I feel so comfortable around her, so relaxed and able to speak freely. We are both in long term relationships, she’s been with her partner for about 5 years. I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 2. Somehow, the conversation gets to sex. I tell her that I haven’t had sex in over two years. “She isn’t ready,” I reveal. “It’s really hard, I try my best to not pressure her, and I want to take it at a pace she’s comfortable at. But she’s had a very traditional upbringing, and her parents have always told her it’s wrong to have sex before marriage. It’s getting so hard for me.. It’s like torture.. I have a high sex drive…” My voice trails off.. suddenly becoming aware of my drunken rambling, scolding myself in my mind. I’m such an idiot, why am I telling her all this? She doesn’t give a shit, and she’s going to thing I’m a real loser.. Fully expecting to spend the rest of the journey in an awkward silence, I’m shocked when I hear her voice, almost a whisper, respond “I have a high sex drive too…” My heart skips a beat, I turn my neck to face her. Our faces so close to each other’s. “You’re boyfriend is the luckiest guy in the world” I respond, trying to hide any hint of jealousy. She bites her lower lip, looking me straight in the eye, did she shuffle closer to me, or did I just imagine that?. My fingers brush the bare smooth skin of her thigh ever so lightly.. She her uncrosses her legs. Her eyes sparkling, her lips glistening.. so tantalising. We both look down to her legs, she parts them, just slightly."
7a851u,20,2017-11-01,Am I [30F] doomed to long term relationship Groundhog Day hell?,drugsasaurus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7a851u/am_i_30f_doomed_to_long_term_relationship/,"Longtime reader, first time caller here. 

My issue starts in college when I was 19. I began dating a guy named Andrew who was initially interested in my roommate. She did not reciprocate, but we had hung out quite a bit together and began dating. Our relationship was fun, and nice, he was/is a good person. When I graduated we had been dating about 3 years, I moved maybe 30 minutes away from school where he still attended, and then we had major relationship issues. Cheating, gaslighting me about cheating, etc. We dragged out this nonsense for 2 more years, and he finallly broke up with me after my first year of graduate school that I had moved further away to attend. We had talked at length about marrige, but he didn't feel ready. After we broke up he married the woman he was totally not dating while we were dating within the year. Ok. I go to school, I make new friends there, I date again, but nothing serious. Then in my last year of internships I meet Dave.



My (ex?) BF Dave and I have been together for 3 years. We met online and I felt an instant connection I've never had before on the first date. Dave was also headfirst into the relationship and we soon spent all of our time together, and moved in after a few months. Dave and I never had to have the ""so where do you see this going?"" Talk because we just clicked and knew we wanted a serious relationship. Dave has made me so happy, and helped me work on communication issues that I had in my previous relationship. Not letting me shut down and be a fake martyr over disagreements but instead I felt empowered to voice any unhappiness. We like a lot of similar things, have similar world views, in general get along and compliment each other very well. Dave is one of the funniest people I have met, and we have a lot of great laughs. When we talked about marriage in general I mentioned a wedding wasn't my dream and I would never want to get married just to be married. Dave would mention in passing things he would do if he had a wedding. But we'd never had a ""are we getting married"" discussion. In January we had to put my dog to sleep, and the same week we were notified our landlord was no longer going to rent our house, so we had to move in short order. Talking about finding a new rental in our area, Dave mentioned buying, I said I didn't want to buy a house with someone I wasnt married to. Dave then says, he doesn't see himself being married ever.... um, what? We argue a little, but then agree emotions are runnning high and we table the discussion. 

For a long time. 

This summer he mentions marriage is not off the table (he says he does not remember this). However here we are at the end of the year, Dave is never getting married. I do understand his reasons, messed up childhood, mom issues, and he does divorce/custody for a living. I have been working through this, because I didn't think I wanted to end an otherise great relationship over marriage. This year hasn't been great, but Dave is the guy I dreamed about and asked the universe for. Instead, tonight he ends it. He says he loves me but is afraid I will resent him. We live together and have 2 dogs, I mean, he just torpedoed our whole life.

I know, I know: gym, therapy, Facebook. I'm searching for a therapist in my other browser window, however I don't really have any friends and I'm not comfortable talking with my family about this just yet. Am I doomed to keep having a 3 year relationship I really care about pulled out from under me? Am I only tolerable for 3 years? Do I just need new joke material to make it to a happy 4 years? How do I learn to trust a relationship again? I know you don't know, me and can't tell me why nice men fall madly in love with me but only for a set period of time. I guess I want some feel good stories about people who have been through a few ringers but did meet their ultimate person? Thanks for listening, I apologize in advance for spelling, grammer, but I'm crying and getting licked in the face by two fluffs while I type. 


TL,DR: I meet nice men, we have happy relationships, but like an extended directors cut version of Cinderella our relationships turn into rotting pumpkins and the prince bounces."

7a88np,1,2017-11-01,Law of Attraction Working?,icemoons,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/7a88np/law_of_attraction_working/,"I'm semi-new to the law of attraction. I always knew about it, and read about it, but I've never really lived it until recently. I recently read about it and how it actually works and the way of living that helps it work, and things are falling into place, I think.

For one, there's been this guy that I've liked for literally over a year, and for the past year I've been stressing over this ""crush"". He kinda liked me back, never said it explicitly but constantly said he's not in the state for a relationship when I never asked, which I always assumed was directed towards me. Me and him have become close friends over the past year, and after reading about the law of attraction I've realized though I really do love him and want this to go somewhere, I'll be satisfied whether it does or doesn't. A couple months ago (before i became serious about the law of attraction) he made me really angry by trying to get with this other girl (who rejected him) and I decided to focus on myself but more out of spite than out of self love. Recently I've gotten over it, we're closer than ever, I've let it go, and focused on self-love for myself as this sub-reddit often says to do, and he's making moves towards a relationship, which I do believe is due to the law of attraction. The only thing is that the other girl has been away for some time, and she's coming back, and I feel like this is some sort of test to see if I can withstand this obstacle. Does the law of attraction do that? 

I've also seen the law of attraction work in other ways in my life, my boss that I don't really like is transferring, another boss that I like is being promoted, school is working out great for me, I'm finding internships, life is good.

I've also been seeing a lot of signs, I saw a feather and the angel numbers 111 and 1234 all in the span of a week. Also about a month ago I kept seeing butterflies, which I never ever see and I wondered what that meant but I think it was a sign that all of this was going to happen. 

I guess I just wanted to let all this out to people who would understand. But I just would like other opinions, am I on the right path? What do those angel numbers mean to you? And what do butterflies mean? And does the universe ever throw things that would seemingly be obstacles in your way just to see if you can handle them?

Background story: I’m a senior at a local university. I find my university to be very easy and isn’t challenging. I always have all As, and the coding assignments are not that hard (very basic/ I can get A just by having the correct thought process). I then thought that CS is for me, and I really thought that I like to code for daily job until I transfer to a top 10 university for CS. During my journey on the new campus, I find that I really don’t like coding. I’m dreading to code full working projects (bigger scope than previous univ’s assignments). It’s annoying, and I don’t want to do it anymore. Though, I have 5 semesters internship experiences, where I’m working on data analytics using analytical tools (this is probably the only thing that’s going to save me, but idk for sure). 

What are my options after graduation? Should I change major?"

I'm currently a third year working toward getting my Bachelors in Comp Sci and was curious on steps I can take for my professional development. 

I currently was thinking about honing my skills as a software engineer. I've been reading programming literature like H&amp;R as well as books like Mythical Man-Month. I enjoy learning about software engineering but I'm not seeing myself getting a high return on investment if I want to develop into a SysAdmin.

I see a better strategy to be to work on my CCNA and other certs so I have a leg up when I graduate. I'm already working on getting internships in IT/Sys Administration.

My overall question is the following:

What would you recommend to someone wanting to develop themself professionally into a SysAdmin?"

My dad died at a very early age and my mom was left to take care of me and my sister on her own. All things considered she was a very good parent. She did the work of two parents while bouncing around several different jobs, and she was very present in our life. My mother was the only parental figure in my life until I was 11 or 12. We had what I consider to be a healthy relationship at this point.

My mother and I were always sort of destined to butt heads just because of the way we are. We're both strong-willed and opinionated, and I've always had somewhat of an ego problem. We frequently got into small arguments that never really escalated, and looking back today I'm of the opinion that they were mostly harmless. 

The biggest turn in our relationship would have been at the start of my senior year when my mental health started to deteriorate. There were a few things weighing on my pretty heavily at that point but they aren't terribly relevant so I won't get into it. 

It's hard for me to say how much of a personality shift I took, but it was certainly enough for my mother to notice. I became a lot more cynical and in general I was pretty depressed. That definitely weighed heavily on my mother as I'm not the type to share how my life is going, so the fact that she was always unsure about the extent of my problems was probably hard on her. 

My mom offered several times to send me to a therapist but I always refused because even at that age I knew it wouldn't be productive. That said seeing my mom upset like that made me so uncomfortable that I tried to put on a happy facade as often as I could. My mood would shift rapidly and I lashed out at her frequently. I've always been allergic to criticism but that point in my life was probably the worst. I was an absolute nightmare to deal with (and to be fair I still am) because I can never back down from anything even when it's ridiculous not to. I took out my anger on her frequently and I imagine she always felt that she had to tread carefully with me.

I think my negative attitude would have been especially apparent to her because I was a bubbly kid, and I mean outrageously so. I've always been a good talker because I can come up with things on the fly and I was never really nervous around people. At a pretty early age I figured out that saying the right things and manipulating the fact that I was a cute kid could get me a lot of things. I learned how to juggle when I was little and played a couple small shows at festivals when I was around 10, and I sort of got addicted to attention. I was always very bubbly and I always made sure I was the center of attention. Because of this my personality shift was probably very concerning. 

I started smoking weed casually at this point, I'm not entirely sure how she found out but it was pretty clear that it scared the shit out of her. She made a lot of vague, passive-aggressive comments about it that made it obvious she knew. She never found anything on me and I never smoked in the house so we actually never got in a huge fight about it, but it definitely escalated her worries. The following months (this would have been around 3/4 way through my senior year) was probably my lowest point, however I don't think the weed had a huge impact as I was really only smoking on the odd weekend with my friends. Unfortunately my mom has a 1960's view on marijuana so I definitely think it created more tension than it needed to. My one criticism is that she basically straight up refused to do any research on the topic at all. That being said I understand that as a parent it's basically the last thing you want your kid to be doing.   

One thing I have to make clear is that all the struggles in my life were completely internal. No one outside of the family would have considered me to be a troubled kid. Despite my terrible work ethic I consider myself quite intelligent and I coasted through most of high school with straight A's without having to work very hard. I haven't had any run-ins with the law besides traffic tickets, hell even in high school I never got in much trouble. I don't think teachers viewed me as a trouble maker, rather they just thought I was exhausting. Debating people has always felt like a sport to me so I tended to instigate debates frequently because I knew I would basically always have the upper hand. I guess it just made me feel good at the time. 

My mother and I fought so frequently that I often wasn't entirely sure what we were fighting about. I wish I could say I was in the right but the truth is 90% of arguments was just her saying something and me taking it the wrong way and ripping into her. Looking back it's pretty inexcusable and I carry a lot of guilt from those days. 

I've since moved off to college and my mother and I don't see each other very often. I've tried to apologize for my behavior in those days but to be honest I would consider it to be mostly unforgivable. My apologies are pretty worthless. 

For what it's worth, I'm doing better now. I'm a lot happier than I used to be, and it seems like my life is on track. I have a 3 point something GPA and an internship lined up at a bank. I still feel frequent guilt about the type of person that I am. I only see my mom once or twice a month, and we talk on the phone once or twice a week. Our interactions have improved a lot, we don't fight nearly as much, but it's very apparent that she doesn't trust me at all, which I guess is fair. I tend to feel the worst after talking to her, as I'm reminded how much stress I caused her and how much damage I did to her life. I think she still worries that my drug problem is far worse than it is. Once I graduate college I think the best thing to do will be for me to move away, because I know I cause her too much stress and she'll be better off without me.

I'm sitting here pretty stoned as I right this, so I apologize if I made errors. I'll go through this in the morning and fix them. 

Not putting a NAW tag because I don't really care if people want to tell me I'm a scumbag because they're not exactly wrong. Really the only advice I need to hear is to man the fuck up and be a better person but I always seem to end up hurting people close to me.   "

I was able to keep on keto for a solid month this summer when I was only working at my internship full time because I had so much more time to prepare meals and focus on weight loss. Now I've got an entirely full plate and I have no idea where to get back into losing weight because I fell back into old patterns once my classes started again. Fully committing to a diet as strict as keto is hard for me because I have very limited time throughout my day and I have a hard time saying no to drinking (which is one of the main factors in my weight gain aside from poor diet) because I want to enjoy my last year of college while I still can. Do any of you have any tips on small steps I can make to ease back into healthy habits without overwhelming myself? I'm heavier than I've ever been at 170 (I used to be about 140 in high school) and I'm at the point where many of my clothes don't fit me anymore, even the ones that I've bought throughout college when I was significantly heavier than I was in high school.

My life has always been quite messy growing up (losing our homes/cars/college fund in 08, watching my mom struggle to bring us out of homelessness, a generally dysfunctional family life growing up, etc.) which might explain some of my disorganized tendencies although i don't necessarily blame that for my current state.

I used to have a decent job at 18 working in the mmj field. I can happily say that I was good at my job, had good feedback with customers and ALWAYS picked up extra days but NEVER took days off unless I was deathly ill. I even came to manage the shop alone the day after having surgery. However, this is what inevitably drove me to quit. I was spending 2 weeks straight working 10 hour days, no lunchbreak, stuck inside a windowless store and although I was banking, It was taking my life away from me for merely $10 an hour. That was 2 years ago.

Since then, I've gone back to school, taken some oddjobs and internships in fields before realizing that it wasn't for me. I'm currently unsure of what my next step should be. I have interest in so many things. I love politics, law, PR, film, computer technology. My biggest dream would be to become a documentary-film maker but I feel that I'd need the experience in other fields to get there along with film school. I'm very close to a Journalism degree incidentally but I've found that I would rather continue with classes focusing on broadcast media rather than print journalism. I don't want to be a print journalist but I would use it as a stepping stone. 

Excuse me for my ramble-I just wanted to paint a picture of who I am the best I could in this post. At the end of it all, I have no idea what I am doing. I feel like I am wasting space and my mind this way. I'm at a point where I'm struggling to get my motivation back. Im so incredibly disappointed in myself. How can I start the process of getting my life back? I don't even know what goals I could set. I don't know where to go."

So far, I've been rejected by at least 12 companies while looking for a full-time role after I graduate. Some large, some medium, some small. I spent the summer at Google for an internship, but even the hiring committee there rejected me for a full-time role (which was a surprise for me, since my internship feedback was positive). 

To be completely transparent, I've worked incredibly hard to make up for the lost time despite not programming before college. My school (BYU) is a very conservative school so it's been nearly impossible for me to find any decent mentorship/connections seeing how less than 10% of the major (maybe even less than 5% of the major) is made up of women. Despite sexism from TAs and classmates, and despite the lack of mentorship, I've managed to come out of school with a 3.7 GPA, published ML research, and extremely relevant internship experience/app development skills. I'm even pursuing my budding interest in big data by doing a big data related senior capstone project. I've come so far, but it seems like my efforts and emotional labor have been almost completely in vain. 

Am I just not cut out for this and nobody told me?
Has everything just been one big facade up until this point? 

I understand that I need to continue practicing coding questions (since the point of failure for me is usually in my displayed technical skill in the interview), but I thought that I would've gotten at least one offer by now.

I'm feeling incredibly discouraged, so I could use some motivation/insight from those who are a bit further on in their career. 

When you feel like the odds are stacked against you, why do you keep trying? When you get that ""thanks for your time, but..."" email, what helps you feel confident in your skills again? 

I'll probably wake up tomorrow and continue doing practice questions and networking, but for now, I feel pretty downtrodden. "
7a9tl2,6,2017-11-02,1L Doubts,McTitties420420,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/7a9tl2/1l_doubts/,"Hey all,

  I know this is a common post, but I'm looking for some advice. It's going be hard to post some of the honest doubts I am having here without sounding like some prick on r/iamverysmart, but here we go.

  First, a JD is the right degree for me for what I want to do. I'm not so much doubting that, but I am having some issues at school. Any and all advice appreciated, and please don't take any of this as bragging or a challenge.

1.) Let's start off with this one: The social scene is fucking *terrible*. I'm at a top 50 law school in the Northeast on a full scholarship, which I legitimately didn't even know was an option in law school. I was *really* humbled and- frankly- confused when I had full-tuition scholarships start rolling in. I was absolutely prepared to sink myself into $200k of debt. When these offers came knocking, though, I pounced.

I'm finding that I just don't click with the students here- at all. I'd say this is the first time for me where, in an academic setting, I *really* made a concerted effort to make friends in class. That effort has gone unreciprocated and has failed. I see a lot of the more extroverted types making tons of friends. I'm definitely someone who has 4-5 very close friends and does not make friends easily, so I realize that this might just be me. But I really have tried to reach out to these kids, and it hasn't worked. I used to work in the entertainment industry and usually find that I can at least get people to open up and be friendly. Not so much here. I think some of this has to do with me being an older student (a lot closer to 30 than 20), but still. What the fuck?

At my school, we have small sections of about 15 for one of our classes. I drank the kool-aid on the tour about how we would meet our best friends in this class. I know, I know- that was stupid. Probably one of the few moments of my life I've really looked at something with rose-colored glasses.

It's just not the case at all. Despite being pass/fail for most of our classes, these kids are *competitive*. A huge part of the reason I chose this school was the ""collaborative nature"" of the school that was so touted on the campus visit. The 1L class I visited- the last day of con law- seemed really cohesive and conversational. I thought it was so great how the students were open with their political opinions and so forth.

Yet my section is a bunch of stiffs. Probably 80% of my larger section consists of hardcore social justice types, which I think is admirable... but, it also means I have to really keep my head down and watch what I say. These people are humorless and quietly cutthroat. I'm feeling extremely isolated. Now, onto the academics:

2.) I came to law school wanting to be challenged. I went to undergrad at a high-ranked school and worked very hard, graduating Summa Cum Laude. I honestly found undergrad easier than my high school (which was an intense prep school that I'm forever grateful my parents sent me to). I was really lucky to have parents who could afford private school for me, and I was even able to skip grades so I could be challenged and not be bored.

We just had practice exams for all of our classes in 1L, and the teachers emphasized that the finals would be very similar (albeit with more material). I studied hard. But I didn't find them at all challenging. I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch here and being an arrogant 1L who hasn't seen his rank yet; we don't even HAVE class rank here.

The exams were really easy. Moreover, I find the material to be really easy. I don't know if it's because I'm just used to reading a lot and maybe some other students aren't, or... what. But I feel really bored, under-stimulated, and frankly kind of lost.

My dad, who is himself an accomplished attorney, tells me to just keep my head down and remember why I'm here: to get a JD. He's absolutely right. Seeing him practice and doing mock trial is *definitely* a huge part of the reason I'm not feeling super challenged by the material. I know for a fact I'd feel like I was drowning in material if not for growing up with a lawyer-- I'm not attributing the ease of the material to some kind of genius that I have at all. 

Any general advice would be really helpful. I'm feeling super isolated from my classmates socially, super isolated for being in a city without many friends here, and frankly bored to fucking tears by the material. 

Property absolutely sucks. I feel like we could learn that material in a week. Maybe because I had my Real estate license, I already know some of this stuff, but it's just so dull. Torts is interesting, but moves at a god damn snail's pace. Civ Pro is what it is; I wouldn't say I grasped that material until I spent long hours prepping for that practice exam, but now I ""get it"". 

The ONLY thing that excites me is beginning the process for scoring a 1L internship. I actually think that it's going to be fairly easy to score an internship at the local DA's office in this city (which is what I want) a.) due to the overload of work the DA has, b.) based on the say-so of my advisor and upper level students who interned there and c.) because so many of these kids are SJWs and have no interest in such a job. I think a lot of my classmates will be picking up jobs at places like the ACLU, which I admire, but have no desire to do. (This is another reason why everyone's constant looking-over-the-shoulder and passive aggressive competitiveness pisses me off; even if half my class applied to work at the DA's office, they need the help so badly that we'd probably all get one gig or another in one of the roughly 15 units we can apply to there.)

What would you do? I spend a ton of hours alone in my apartment with not a ton to do, and it's soul-sucking.

Please don't give me shit for finding the material easy-- I'm really not bragging here. I see classmates without lawyers in the family struggling, and I know I'd be absolutely lost if not for having a lawyer for a dad as well.

I don't know how to end this post, really. I'm not doubting the degree or if law is for me. I'm just miserable here. I have a pretty lengthy history of depression, and I can absolutely feel it creeping back up on me as I near the end of my first semester. 

I really appreciate ANY advice or solace, and anyone who took the time to read this whiny-ass post. Thanks guys."

Equipped with an insatiable curiosity and a screwdriver, I was amazed when I discovered what lay underneath a CPU cabinet. The sight of complex circuits, a number of chips and a ton of different devices was more than enough for me to fall in love with computers. The experience inspired me to learn more and more about computers. It was fascinating how software and hardware integrated with each other. I wanted to experience first-hand how writing, compiling and executing a program feels, urging me to learn programming languages. And just like that, I was hooked.

I started studying Machine Learning (ML) via a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC). The mathematics involved was fun to code and it was nothing less than magic watching mere equations create models used for prediction and classification. By the end of the course, I successfully implemented a Multilayer Perceptron that could accurately classify the MNIST Dataset. I began to have a predilection for the algorithms and the underlying mathematics; it was then that I realised that my interests lay in pursuing ML.

At the end of my fifth semester at VIT, I interned at i3Systems Pvt. Ltd., a start-up utilising Machine Learning to automate medical insurance claim processes. Dr. Mallesh Bommanahal, CEO defined two objectives for the internship. My first objective was to create a classifier to segregate medical reports. The approach was simple: vectorise the text and then feed it to a classifier for training. To find the best classifier, I worked with Random Forests, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron. After the requisite experimentations, it was decided to incorporate the Naïve Bayes Classifier in production. My second objective was to create a Computer Vision (CV) model that could identify and mask the name of the patient on a medical report. Utilising a concoction of Tesseract and openCV ensured the objective was met perfectly.

Impressed with my work, I was given a return offer of another internship at the end of my sixth semester. The objective was to develop a custom spell checking algorithm to fix OCR errors. Utilising a general dictionary was not helpful as very specific words and phrases needed correction. At first, I was trying to meet my objective using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which performed with an accuracy of 85% at best. However, while looking out for possible tweaks, I came across a blog that suggested using n-grams. After building a prototype, it was found that the n-gram algorithm had an accuracy of 92%, which with further adjustments increased to 97%. It made me realise that not all problems should be solved using complicated approaches; sometimes, the simple ones do a better job.

During my sixth semester, I worked with Prof. Muralidhar A in VIT on a research project that focussed on developing a new algorithm for mining High Utility Itemsets (HUIS). HUIS are the combination(s) of different item(s) that yield high profit in any transactional database. It is imperative to recalculate HUIS whenever the value of any item changes, creating a huge computational overhead. The proposed algorithm suggested saving states beforehand and utilising them later to improve efficiency. The proposed algorithm worked similar to and at times better than the existing one. The paper was published in International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IJPAM). My interest in neural networks led me to contact Dr. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya, a professor at the University of Manchester who is an active part of the spiNNaker Project, which aims to simulate the human brain by generating biologically inspired neural networks. Working with her on creating a model to simulate the Thalamic layer of the human brain made me understand the importance of mathematics and computer sciences in the present world; no scientific research is possible without the both of them.

My undergraduate course at VIT has inculcated in me not just a hunger for knowledge but also a moral responsibility to share ideas. Alongside securing 6th rank academically with a CGPA of 9.45/10 among a batch of 220, I have served as a member of The English Literary Association (ELA) since my second year. Through ELA, I had the opportunity of organising a TEDx event in the college, which received a highly positive response.

At VIT, I made various constructs using Python and ML libraries. Using Tensorflow, I created a Video Analyser that detects frames from any video clip and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict whether I would like the video clip or not. I further downloaded transcripts of the episodes of a TV show and trained a LSTM model to generate sequences of its own. After 100,000 epochs, the model could create its own transcripts, astounding me with the power of AI.

With an enormous increase in availability and accessibility of data, computer science has become one of the leading areas of research. I would like to further delve on this area: to develop and improve ML algorithms so that various sciences can benefit from advances caused by the ripple effects. My capstone project for the UG degree focusses on this domain where I will be working closely with LSTM, CNN and CV. The idea is to closely monitor speech and facial expressions of a person to validate any statistical claims made.

At University of Southern California, I look forward to collaborating with Prof. Hao Li. His work on capturing facial performance using deep convolutional networks has been very successful and is a prime example of using CV with ML. The possibilities of extending this algorithm to generalise users while retaining the accuracy metrics excites me.

In conclusion, my passion for computer science has taken a firm shape over the years. From a simple construct in Turbo C++ to working in various fields with successful start-ups and interacting with inspiring researchers, every experience has helped me develop and nurture my interest. The opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at USC would provide me with an increased exposure and knowledge of current trends being adopted in ML. With my interests lying at the confluence of machine learning and computer vision, a Masters’ degree in Computer Science (Data Science) would be the next important step in realising my passion for researching and developing ML algorithms to create a better future."
7aa4ex,9,2017-11-02,Unemployed Millennial Chemical/Environmental Engineer: Laid off and stuck,OHUM,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/7aa4ex/unemployed_millennial_chemicalenvironmental/,"Dear Fellow Unemployed Redditers, 

   Hi. I'm an Environmental/Chemical Engineer and I got laid off earlier this year. I'm having trouble getting back on my feet and am looking for any advice/help I can get. 

   My BS is in Environmental Engineering. I finished my MS in Chemical Engineering with my thesis in May 2015. After that, I went to go work for an engineering consulting firm. I was laid off earlier this year. There was nothing I could have done to change the outcome and I left on good terms with my immediate coworkers, several of whom are current references for me. 

   My job search has been a slog since then. I've submitted almost a thousand applications to engineering positions all over the United States. Dozens of network connections have looked at my resumes, cover letters, etc. I've had a bunch of interviews and several mock interviews. I've been in contact with the career centers at both my alma maters. Everyone in my corner says I'm doing everything in my job search right to get at least one job offer. Many of them are flabbergasted I haven't gotten one job offer in the last six months. 

   As far as I can tell, I'm the best version of myself as a job candidate as I can be right now. And it's not working. I feel stuck. I don't get much feedback when I get rejected. If I interview with someone, I always send a follow up thanking them for their time. If (when) I get rejected, I send another email thanking them for consideration and letting them know to contact me should other opportunities come up. I then ask them for feedback on what I could have done to be a more competitive candidate. 

   Not once have I gotten a response to that question. I understand many companies have a new HR policy not to give feedback for fear of getting sued. As someone currently collecting unemployment checks, I assume you there's no room in the budget for legal fees.

   So my inner circle thinks I'm doing everything I can. Those rejecting me won't tell me what I'm doing well or wrong. One definition of insanity is ""doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."" 

   I've looked into internship opportunities just to see if I can get more experience to bide my time. Unfortunately, in all my searching for internships that remotely smell like Environmental/Chemical Engineering, they are all unpaid and thus require me to be a student so I can get course credit. By being a graduate, I'm overqualified and thus ineligible. 

   The job market has this gaping hole: There are interns for current students, but once you're a graduate, there's only a handful of precious ""entry level"" positions that require 3-5 years experience and prefer you to already have your PE. I'm stuck in the Catch 22 of not being able to get a job cause I don't have enough experience but I can't accrue more experience cause I can't get a job. 

   Some have suggested I go back to school. The timing of my lay off means I probably wouldn't get to start that new program until August 2018, and I wouldn't be done till May 2019. Furthermore, I've already spent 6 years in higher education learning how to be an engineer. I shouldn't need a second Master's Degree to get one job offer. 

   In trying to diagnose my situation, I think there's three main variables working against myself (and other recent engineering graduates). 1) As previously stated, the job market sucks right now and there just aren't many opportunities. 2) As previously stated, I only have 1 year + of experience and employers think ""entry level"" is 3-5 years experience with certifications, super powers, and at least two Olympic Gold Medals. 3) Geography is a variable. My applications aren't being taken as seriously when I apply to something out of state. Saying I'm willing to fund my own relocation and am willing to move anywhere in the United States hasn't affected change. *steps off millennial soapbox*

   I'm stuck. None of my friends have had this much trouble getting work. I'm now going through my second period of prolonged unemployment (it took me 7 months after graduation to start my first job out of school). Everywhere I've gone (university lab, internship, my last job) I've kicked butt and added value. I believe I'm good enough to get one job offer doing something related to Chemical/Environmental Engineering in the United States making at least $40,000 a year. Clearly, my prospective employers think otherwise. 

   I welcome any advice, suggestions, questions, commiseration, etc. May no one reading this ever go through what I am going through right now.

My dutymates didn't think I'd be able to do it, but later that day I asked her up front if she had a boyfriend. To my dismay, she said yes, but immediately bonded around with me like we were close (maybe it was her first time being confessed to like that). Fast forward now, I'm assigned to a different duty site, and we added each other on FB and started chatting about books and music and movies and had deep talks on spiritual and fate and soulmate stuff. She opens up easily, but I knew my limits, I respected her relationship, and just recently I told her I do not like her (romantically) anymore. She then told me she cannot lend the stuff she promised to lend me anymore, and I was absolutely fine with that.


Some days ago I received a message request from a guy, and a few clicks later found out he's her boyfriend. This guy is HUGE and an athlete, maybe as tall as me (I'm 6') but he's bigger sideways. Now I know usually this does not mean well, the guy might be looking for a fight, or maybe he argued with her already, I do not know. So I'm avoiding any form of argument, but what do you think guys? It's not that I'm scared to be beat up, it's just usually these things tend to end complicated and would involve many more people if allowed to happen, and I do not want that. Should I talk to him or let it pass?"

7ab952,338,2017-11-02,Helpful Tips For Anyone Struggling To Land Their First Job,selftaughtgrammerpro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ab952/helpful_tips_for_anyone_struggling_to_land_their/,"I've been seeing a lot of posts on this sub recently regarding the difficulty of landing that first job. Since this sub helped me so much when I was looking for a job, I wanted to try my best to give back. 

I'm a self-taught developer working at a mid-sized tech company (Not at a Big-N), I don't have a CS degree or any internships, and I didn't graduate from any boot camp. If I can land a job, I know that those of you graduating or whom have graduated can too! 

I asked my manager, who hired me, what it was that set me apart from the other candidates. His response was simple: I had working, easily demo-able projects that followed many conventions that they use. 

The single biggest thing I see lacking from most Github profiles or personal websites is a link to a working version of your projects. This is what helped to set me apart. For what it's worth, my one project was A full stack ToDo application, very simple in its presentation but I worked really hard to get all the pieces right and use modern best practices. This includes making the front end with Bootstrap, Sass, and React/Redux and making the backend using a Node/Express.js API and a Mongo database. It also had authentication/authorization for users to log in and view their specific To dos. I hosted it online at Heroku. After my interview, I even noticed my manager had created an account and made some blog post himself, to test out how the app worked. 

I realize not all companies are like this, and some just want you to known algorithms front and backwards. I just don't think you can underestimate the impressiveness of having a working application that uses the latest technology, especially if the job you're applying for uses that very same tech! 

Edit: Just to clarify, this was not the only thing that landed me a job. I still had to go through the interview process and answer questions on design patterns, do some whiteboarding on Linked List and Stack/Queue questions and discuss the pros and cons of certain technology choices. I also live in a US tech hub with lots of job opportunities, and still had to send out 300+ applications to get this job. "

I'm interested in getting some hands on experience in an internship (preferably in NYC) but am not sure I have enough programming experience and knowledge of machine learning to be useful. Are there are any beginner level internships I would be suitable for, or are some of the standard DS internships not as reliant on experience as they advertise?"
7abotd,2,2017-11-02,My [23F] and my fiance's [23M] friend [23M] has been crashing on our couch and the outlook seems bleak.,sojarexi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7abotd/my_23f_and_my_fiances_23m_friend_23m_has_been/,"So our friend of about a year got kicked out of his house Tuesday of last week. My fiance and I allowed him to stay with us until he gets things figured out. However, it seems like his plan is to just stay...

So some back story. Our friend has been doing a lot of cocaine leading up to this rock bottom. He and his former roommate even did it together. He quit his job back in September for unrelated reasons and started blowing what little money he had on it. He sold a valuable possession of his for $2800, spent a good amount of it paying off debts, but then spent 500 of it on coke in one night. A few nights after the 500 night he did it again in their house. His now ex-roomie (also now ex-bestie) is kinda crazy and extremely selfish. She had been planning to move out before this all happened.  Initially she told our friend their landlord didn't want him there after she moved out. Well he called the landlord and the landlord said he could stay without her for more rent, so she flat out lied about that. But that cleared up and was all well and good until the ex-roomie then decided to call their landlord and report our friend for doing coke in the house after this last time. Obviously, he got kicked out. He's decided to quit coke for good and he has contemplated rehab and another friend of his who had been doing it too decided to quit so he has additional support outside of my fiance, me, and his grandma who lives in town. 

So now we are here on Thursday, a little over a week after this has happened. Initially his plan was to move into his grandma's house. But his grandma's house isn't a great option either. In addition to grandma and grandpa living there, there's also his freeloading aunt (she's not disabled and doesn't work) and his schizophrenic cousin who he'd have to share a bedroom with. Overall it just isn't a good situation to be going into because of the stress and the problems in the house, mostly caused by the cousin. I know they have considered institutionalizing the cousin in the past because the problems have been so bad, but I'm no sure where the discussion is on that at the moment and it seems like he's staying at grandma's for an indefinite amount of time. 

So my fiance and I learned the serverity of the grandma's house situation on Monday and told our friend he could have a few more days to get things figured out. Our friend also has a job prospect in a much bigger city about 40 minutes from us, which he learned about this week. 

My fiance and I are moving out of state in January for an internship I got to finish my degree. Our friend has been planning to rent our house after we move. I tried to talk to him about his plans yesterday and he just talked about how anxious he is about the situation (which I completely understand) but also about how he doesn't wanna find a place for 2 months and about his grandma's house. I tried to mention being able to find a place for himself and how we could help him, and I suggested moving to the city for this job. He didn't seem too keen on any of these ideas. 

So it just seems like he's set on staying on the couch. He's been our good friend for about a year and even helped us move into our current house which took 12 hours because we had someone promise us a trailer and then back out the day of (surprise, that person was also his shitty ex-roomie/friend). But there are also problems. My problems with this situation are:

1. My fiance and I don't have a bedroom door and our bedroom is adjacent the living room where he sleeps, so we can't really have sex while he's here. He leaves sometimes for 30 mins to an hour but that is at random times and usually right after my fiance gets home for the day, so it's hard to ignite the fire in a moment's notice. We're both people who like to just let it happen, which when it's just the two of us happens a few times a week. We could probably work around this issue and just do it when he's gone but it sucks ass because it's our house and we shouldn't have to. 

2. He's spending his money in all the wrong places. He always has money for an 8th of weed but not the 100 he owes us for random things. He went grocery shopping with me yesterday and didn't offer to help cover the cost of paper towels, tp, food, etc. He did give us some almost new products from his house such as laundry and dish soap and some freezer food so that's helped cover some of his costs, but compared to his stay he's pretty much run out the worth of that. My fiance and I are just above making ends meet at the moment, so we can't financially support another person. 

3. I'm a person who needs space. Outside of my fiance and family, I don't really wanna spend more than about 3 hours with someone. It's just how I am and I had some difficulties with our last roommate because of space issues which we eventually worked out as a house. When we moved here I was so grateful to be done with roommates, and I didn't sign up for one aside from my fiance. Im  currently not working becsuse my last job ended and finding a job for 2 months is hard, so he's home with me all day. I can sneak away for a bit, but I feel pressured to always ""hang out.""

4. He helps... kinda. He'll do the dishes but there will be food stuck to them after they're put away. He also cracked one of my stemless wine glasses doing the dishes. (They were from Walmart, but still.) He does pick up pretty much daily which is great and apparently loves to clean. But he's started to let things go-- he moved out of an environment where his roommate was a clean freak into our house, which I would consider average cleanliness. 

5. Pressure to hang out. I mentioned this earlier, but it extends to my fiance's and my time together. He and I are PC gamers and would usually play games for 1-2 hours a night. Now I feel guilty if we leave our friend on the couch and he'll sometimes come bother us, though he's gotten better. We play primarily PVP so there is no pause on the game. Also my fiance is student teaching, so he has to take time to plan every night for his classes, which is made more difficult with the pseudo-roomie because he doesn't know when to shut up and seems to have a hard time understanding how much time planning takes. We can't even really go to bed early to get alone time because of the location of our room. I mean we could, but the lack of a door makes it almost pointless for getting away from the situation. 

6. Food. My fiance and I have gotten a lot better about not eating out to save money and eat healthier in the last 6 months. Our friend ALWAYS wants to eat out. Sometimes we do food separately, but it's almost always together. When we cook he will help sometimes, and has made a couple meals for us on his own. But he doesn't pay for groceries, drinks our soda, and typically doesn't want make the healthiest meals. I'm fine with cooking myself to make healthy meals but my fiance is easily swayed away from salmon and rice for a cheeseburger and fries, and I don't wanna hurt feelings by cooking for 1. 

My fiance and I have discussed our options regarding the situation but it seems like someone is either going to live in upset or someone is going to get hurt. We've talked about letting him stay the two months and asking for money to cover utilities and food. This seems like the most likely option but I'm worried about the possible strain on my fiance's and my relationship and I'm not sure how to bring up the money issue when our friend seemingly has none. We could kick him out but I would feel guilty making him go to his grandma's. We could try to help him find a new place but that takes effort on his part, which seems unlikely. He has made little-to-no effort on finding a job, and I'm not even sure if the supposed job in the city is happening. 

On the other hand, he is our friend. My fiancee and I genuinely enjoy hanging out with him and I have enjoyed the company during the day and the help around the house. It isn't all bad... yet. But I could easily see this turning into a terrible situation, which is where it looks like it's heading and I'm already having some problems with the situation as it is. I don't know how to regain control of my house and don't want things to continue like this for the next 2 months. My fiance is just as lost as I am about this. We both want to show kindness and help our friend in need, but don't want to be taken advantage of.

Sorry for the long read and possible rambling, and thanks in advance for any advise or support. 

Tl;dr My fiance and I have taken in our friend who is currently homeless, but our friend is making no moves to improve his current situation. It is taking an emotional and financial toll on us."

However, their internship program has a fixed rate of $18/hr. The average pay around my area for similar internships is around $25/hr.

A large technology company reached out to me on LinkedIn offering me a position post-grad that would likely pay around $90-100k/yr.

Should I inquire about the salary I'd be offered at my current company once I graduate? Should I mention the other company as leverage?

Should I also express my frustration at the fixed rate, as it would be 9 months of interning there by the time I finish my next semester?

So you know my question, here’s a bit of a back story. I’m 20 years old and currently attending community college in Upstate NY studying CIS (Computer Information Systems) after a major switch from Computer Science, I couldn’t pass calculus but I also think I wasn’t applying myself enough. Anyway, since I did switch my major in my second year of college some of my credits didn’t transition over so fluidly to my new major leaving me with around 8 credits that were worthless to my new CIS degree. This led me to have to stay an extra semester in college and I’m currently in my third year, fall semester finishing up my associates degree. Problem being is that the one class that I need for my degree was not offered this semester so I couldn’t complete my degree this semester. Basically I’d have to come back for one class for a whole semester, which is worthless to me because it’s a two year degree school, not a four year. So my plan was to transfer out to a four year school and complete both my associates and bachelors degree there. 

... Fast forward a couple months and I have a girlfriend who now goes to school in Manhattan and she moved down there. Me being moved out of my parents house for the past year and being completely independent from them figured it was time for a change and I’m (basically) living down there and commuting upstate for school two days out of the week and some other days for work. I’m in the process of getting a transfer down to a store in Manhattan with my job but it doesn’t pay all to much (around $14-15 an hour, full time). I want to try to “get my foot in the door” of a technology company down in Manhattan because were going to be there for the foreseeable future. 

I have programming experience on my own and have even ran my own freelance business for programming and web design which did well and I had quite a few clients. I want to apply for jobs with these larger tech companies but also want to know the best way to go about it so that someone like me without a full college degree yet but with experience can score something entry level or even an internship with a company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft etc. I already have a resume that I complied and have my certification from Apple as well as a side note. My job currently is also in a technology related field.

Rather, I'm far more interested in going to business school to learn about the business curriculum (marketing, product development, entrepreneurship, etc). I'd sign up as a full-time student to truly commit myself to that.

I would prefer to go to a top 25, top 15 school because I'm well aware that it just wouldn't be financially feasible to go anywhere below that- and I'd like to think that knowledge transfer between students would fare better at a better ranked school (I'm open to being convinced otherwise)

So my question is: what are the best schools to just learn, from professors and each other? I truly do not care about recruiting from other companies or getting a plum internship at a big company or hooking up with a consulting firm after graduation. I really don't need that stress in my life, and honestly, I do just fine at my current job to go after unnecessarily cutthroat job opportunities. I'd like to be able to start my own company after getting an MBA, and hopefully the knowledge I learn in business school would help with that, but my main focus is enjoying the two years I spend going to school. 

What do you guys think?"

What do you plan on doing?,michiharuharu,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7ad5fe/im_worried_about_my_plans_after_graduation_what/,"I'm graduating next fall, a semester ahead than planned. I currently attend school three hours away from home and majoring in a major within the human services field. Typical higher paying jobs in my field require a masters degree, but I don't know if I want to go straight to graduate school after graduation since I have no experience in my field besides my planned internship next fall. If I do go for my masters, I've been contemplating going for something different than my undergrad major to get a higher paying job. I just don't know what though because I haven't found a love for a field yet. 

If I don't go for my masters, I'll probably go back to my hometown which is a suburb outside a large city. I could get my own apartment with roommates, but I know I'd save more money living at home for a while and I don't know if I'd find a job right after graduation. The only problem with that is that dating and hanging with friends would be awkward/difficult while living at home. 

I've also entertained the idea of job searching within the field of my undergrad degree that is above minimum wage and somewhere new. I want to experience more than just my hometown and college town, but I'm afraid of doing this by myself since I'd have no job security and moving away is expensive. 

It's a lot to think about considering I have almost exactly a year until graduation. I feel like it's much easier for those within the STEM field who can get jobs right out of college with large companies after their internship. My internship has to be within 60 miles of my college town which is a pretty rural area and I do not plan to stay here after graduation. Anyone else at the same point in life as me and stressing?

There is now a possibility of the program not allowing him and his class to graduate from residency because of being past the cutoff.  He and the other interns want to leave the program (which is understandable) because they might not graduate and there will never be any more residents coming in which is important to him as he hopes to get a teaching position after residency.  The Hospital will not release the intern class funding to go to another program even though there is the possibility of not graduating.  All the other programs at the hospital transferred to another hospital.  There is no longer a surgical residency at the hospital. The options for my friend are either
- apply in the match this year
- stay at the program and hope it receives ""no resident left behind"" approval

Is there any other options? Any advice? 

The program director stated already they wont shut down. According to the AOA The PD and CEO can sign a form to let us leave with our funding however they refuse to do it.

7ae89r,0,2017-11-02,What I Learned at the Ameren Accelerator --- a startup story,retapeoj,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/7ae89r/what_i_learned_at_the_ameren_accelerator_a/,"Last spring was an exciting yet challenging time for RB. Coming out of LightFair 2017 we were confident about our potential but we knew we had a ton of work to do. We had customers but our team was still small and there was a bit of uncertainty in the air.

In our little office in Sun Prairie Wisconsin we focused on rebate data collection, project submittal work and making our software more user friendly. We were making strides and confident we were heading the right direction yet still unsure about our future.

When we first got notice about the Ameren Accelerator it was in an email via F6S, I still remember the first thought I had when I looked at it, this was exactly what we needed.

I mean really, a investor owned utility running a startup accelerator!? Could this be real?? Seemed too good to be true.

The email was from Brian Dixon, the COO of Capital Innovators in St. Louis. A few days later another email came in from their Program Director Trevor Tune. We applied, interviewed two times on the phone, travelled to St. Louis to pitch our business and were fortunate enough to be one of 7 companies that were selected for the first Ameren Accelerator cohort out of 210 applicants, all focused on the energy industry.

As I write this today we still haven't finished the program. On Thursday October 26th we will come together at Demo Day where will be present our business vision in front of our peers, the investor community, Ameren, our customers and friends. The entire cohort is diverse, innovative, forward thinking and we are all solving real problems in the energy sector. 

I wanted to lay out my thoughts on what I learned at the Ameren Accelerator with the team from UMSL, Ameren and Capital Innovators.

* The best ideas may actually come from your customers, listen to them!

The Ameren Accelerator was unique in that the lead investor is a potential customer for our company. This is special because most of the time incubator programs have a wide range of potential customer segments. In this experience we could all agree on at least one thing - the electric utility as a potential client. This helped in our working sessions, with our mentors and in our collaboration as a cohort. We all have a shared customer segment and therefore could offer insights from our own perspective as to doing business with the utility sector.

Ameren also had select business leaders join our teams for the program. This was incredibly impactful. We worked closely with their team and there were a few key individuals who helped us really understand the business. Understanding your customer is really the first step in building anything and by putting us in the same room we really unlocked a lot of great insight, things that otherwise may have been missed.

* It's better to invest in your team than invest in someone else's.

Early on in the program we decided one of our goals at the end would be to launch our next gen RB website. Initially we considered going out to a 3rd party to build it for us, we met with a few local development firms and got quotes. At one of our weekly goal sessions I presented the situation to the other companies. Everyone encouraged us to think about doing the redesign ourselves.

We knew that we wanted to use wordpress but nobody on our team really had much experience with it. At the same time we were matched with our amazing intern from UMSL, Bailee Warsing. She brought a new set of skills to our team and was more than willing to try and learn wordpress.

Bailee, together with our marketing manager Aaron Campbell worked to design our new site, fill it with content and make it look beautiful. And now, we have the expertise in house to handle anything we need to do on the front end. If we had hired out for this it probably would have looked beautiful but would it have been as impactful to our team? Probably not. We did hire a consultant to help us, Brianna from Being your Brand helped us fill in the knowledge gaps and trained our team on how to use the system.

* You have to know what problem you are really solving.

Sometimes the problem you think you are solving is not the real problem at all. We learned early on from our mentors that the solution we’re building needs to solve the end user's problem, not the utility client's problem. If we focus on figuring that out we will find our place in the industry.

Defining and really understanding the problem you are trying to solve is such a focus for early stage startups and you can very easily head down the wrong path just by mis-interpreting the problem. We spent a lot of time on this in our working sessions.

* Hard work is really the secret sauce.

There are no guarantees when you start a company. The only real thing you can control is your effort. Effort can be any number of things and yes it can include thinking. I tell our team that at this point all we need to do is continue to work hard, build our software, listen to our customers, try to earn new ones and think about ways that we can improve the efficiency of utility rebates. These are really the only things we can control.

We come from a background and deep understanding of the utility sector and we're not afraid to ask the questions that need to be asked. We are well aware that we have a lot to learn. Asking the questions and being willing to put in the work to understand is the key foundation we need to make RB successful.

* Connections are valuable but realize that not all of them will turn into opportunities immediately, patience is a virtue.

Realize that when you're building a startup you are forming a thing. Ideally it's a living growing organism that evolves, adapts and innovates to create solutions to the problem you are solving. Sometimes when you present a new company or even an idea it can get the cold shoulder. Change can be difficult and anytime someone is trying to build something there is always a bit of skepticism which surrounds the build. Doing nothing is much easier in most cases.

Patience is a core value that we need to effectively embrace when starting something new. You must be patient and willing to let the the no's wash over you. There will be plenty of them and even more non-responses which sometimes can be worse.

Be ready to always look at your business with a clear lens based on feedback from the no's and think of new connections through the lens of how they can help you in the future, not necessarily right at this very moment.


* Your Core Values are what really matters.

The core values of your company should always remain, no matter what strategic direction you take. If they don't stand true to their core for your company than they are not core values.

What I have learned from the Ameren Accelerator is that if you are consistent in your message to industry and within your team, the values will ring true in everything you do.

It's kind of like staying true to your cause. The core values for us represent the basic things that we are working toward every single day. Keeping it simple.

* Small wins can grow into big ones.

Sometimes we get it in our head that we just have to get this one deal closed or get a meeting with this one investor to be successful.

In reality success is measured by all the small stuff coming together and forming a story. Being persistent is critical but you don't need to try to close the big deal everytime you get the decision maker on the phone, small steps can add up to big success.

Timing is very important and the pacing of your company speaks loudly. Be ready when your time comes by being prepared and confident about what you have built.

Also --- storytelling is key.

* Building the core team is like building the foundation, hiring the right people is critical.

We have been fortunate enough to have met some amazing people who are forming the RB core team. Everyone has their own skills, strengths and unique value that they bring to the team.

Hiring the right people is so important, a great hire can produce 10X results whereas a bad hire can pull down the entire team. Taking time to find the right people is a worthwhile investment.

* Creating a system that can operate independently without constant oversight is hard work but thinking about it early is key.

A company is a system of people and technology, working together to produce work that is valuable.

RB has found through this experience that we work best in a system that has a clear flow of information, transparency and trust. I am not interested in building a company that needs me to make all the decisions, all of the time. This is why hiring curious, intelligent and hardworking people is so important.

We are building a company based on shared decision making, at all levels. We're not even sure what that means at this point but we do know that everyone will have input. We want to be a sustainable business working toward a sustainable energy economy.

* Family is key.

We're still a small team but we are bigger than we were back in the spring, we're now at 12 employees and it does feel like a small family. It won't always be like this but I would hope that we will always maintain a respect for one another, trust, a willingness to laugh at the problem and fight through the hard work while always listening to our customers.

We want the customer to feel like they are part of our family, because they are. We are building a member based organization, all centered around the intention to drive energy efficiency forward by making the utility rebate process simple.

And, speaking from my personal experience my family is owed a serious monster truck of gratitude. It was not easy on my wife Katie the last 12 weeks. We have 4 little kids and they have ""home by Halloween"" wired into their little brains, knowing that Daddy will be back home full time by Halloween.

Katie helped me in so many ways these past 3 months, from picking out the clothes that I wore to handling me on the difficult days when nothing seemed to go right, to helping out with key decisions. She is a rock and I am thankful for her love and support.

And, in an odd twist of fate our seed investor, my father in-law Tom was traveling through St. Louis on our final day of the accelerator and got to sit in on one of our cohort meetings. Tom was our initial seed investor back in the summer of 2016. In that meeting Warner Baxter, CEO of Ameren was in attendance and it was a real pleasure to see Tom shake his hand and say, we're partners in this investment.

It really does take a team / family to make anything happen in a sustainable way.

Peace,

Joe"

I did have 3 semesters of co-op experience, but they didn't have any work for me to. I'm not saying that as an exaggeration, I mean that literally. Every now and then I would ask my manager if they wanted me to do anything, and they'd always say no. I would clock in, sit in on meetings, then go back to my desk and read books, play on the internet, watch movies, etc., but I did not produce a single line of code for them in a year. Now as I look towards getting a job post-graduation I don't think I'm remotely qualified to do any of it.

I always assumed in previous semesters that they'd teach me some stuff and eventually I'd know how to do computer science, but now that I'm working on my senior design project (with vastly more knowledgeable team members) I'm panicking at the idea of doing this professionally every single day. I don't understand project architecture. I don't get how a project can have components in more than one language. I know the definition of a server, but the idea of an app communicating with a server is incomprehensibly complex. I don't know any frameworks and I don't have any opinions about IDEs. I've never made a personal project. I'm completely out of my depth on a project that is supposed to take 3 undergraduates a semester to finish. Nothing in my education has prepared me for this, and I always assumed it would. 

It just seems like there's such a massive chasm of difficulty between the trivial (fizzbuzz) and the absurdly complicated (useful projects that run on a bunch of different frameworks with complex architecture) with very little in between. Am I overreacting to think that I should be looking for an internship instead of a job, or delaying my job hunt to spend some time trying to actually learn how do computer science? If I accepted a job that required me to produce things as complicated as the senior project I'm working on, I think I'd crash and burn in a matter of months because of incompetence. 

P.S. If it matters, the project is basically a clone of Tinder, plus/minus a few features."

7aerxw,2,2017-11-02,my me too story,letsgetitoffzechest,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7aerxw/my_me_too_story/," Over the past few weeks, I've struggled with what medium is correct for sharing this story. I don't know how to get the feelings out, and I'm so scared people are going to tell me I'm lying because of just how fantastical it is. So maybe I should start by saying however crazy, this happened to me, and I've been carrying it around with me for far too long. For years I believed the lies he told me, how he had proof that everything was consensual, not realizing that i was just falling into his trap again and again.
  Let’s call my boss “ Bill”. I was a young male of 18, fresh off the mom and dad boat and making my way into the real world. By some miracle ( at 22 the miracle is now more apparent to me) I scored a job at a traveling zoo that runs a course from virginia to georgia, stopping at county fairgrounds and community festivals, sometimes doing college lectures and rescue efforts as well. I thought I was happy as can be, feeding and caring for monkeys and kangaroos and even a big tiger. I was a dumb fucking kid.
  Over the course of six months from october 2013 to march 2014 bill raped me 5 times. When I came back to the establishment in 2015 to false promises he raped me again. He convinced me that it was all consensual and he promised me things, but when i didn’t want to do it, he would coerce me harder and harder until I gave in. he drugged me on three separate occasions with opiates to have his way more easily. He insisted on not using protection because he was allergic to latex. 
   It started early on, when I first arrived to work at the zoo, although for him, the planning probably started when he picked up the telephone and heard easy prey on the other line. The funny thing is, when i called him to ask about the job, i was suspicious of his establishment. Something didn’t add up. I called him out on it, said his pitch sounded like bait, he got upset and hung up. I called my mother to tell her about the job prospect and how it sounded weird and together we looked online. This man was famous. He had animals on the today show. His monkeys were in movies and perched on actor’s shoulders. I fucked up. I called him back apologizing.
      And of course he accepted. The next week I was on a bus down to the zoo and there we were, in the midst of a carnival, training monkeys and riding camels and horses and all was well for a few days. So i thought.
     The first night i got shitfaced at a party the fair was throwing. Bill noted my attraction to alcohol.
        The first weekend, Bill saw the flirty attention I was taking to look at a gentleman in the crowd. But Bill also saw the same flirty attention I was giving to a female in the crowd. Bill took note of my sexual confusion.
I remember the first  night we drove together in the main semi, after the fair was over and we were packed heading to the next location. His tone got more and more sly as we talked through the night, I remember him telling me stories i would one day find out were lies, but at the time, I trusted him and they awed me. I was a sheltered kid and i didn’t know any better. And then i heard him say “ who don’t you give it a little wiggle”. I looked over and he had his fucking cock out. 
     I’m 18, alone in a semi with a guy who’s bigger than me, away from all known family and friends, traveling to god knows where in the middle of the night. The situation has delved into creepy as hell and it’s all my fault, but I do it, because, what the hell, it’s only a cock and i can’t lose this job and be dumped in the middle of the road. I wish I had made him pull over then. I can’t fucking BELIEVE i didn’t realize how BAD that situation was. I had no idea how hard it would traumatize me. Time number one.
        In november we made our way to savannah georgia, for an annual festival at a racetrack. Bill had a partnership with a hotel there and they paid a contract to stay on the racetrack/golf course for the entire month, bringing our animal activities to the public attending. Of course, with that contract came hotel rooms, and that’s when my hell really started.
     The first time, Brian brought all of us to the hotel to sleep (didn’t happen very often,because usually we had to stay with the animals and make sure they were ok) and at the last second, pulled a switcheroo and told me I’d be staying with him. Him asking me to give him a back massage ( which, again, far away from my family or friends) ended up with him being naked, and that turned into him coercing me to take my clothes off, because he just wanted to see, and before i know it I’m in the middle of his fucked up fantasy. Another man using you in that way without your permission is probably the worst feeling i can describe, and that time fucking hurt. I can remember how it felt to this second. I thought about leaving that night, but where the hell was i going to go.
     And then that happened again. And again. He made me send him text messages “telling him what i wanted him to do to me” and i would just make stuff up because i didn’t know what else to say. This was the clincher. I knew the second i’d try to tell someone these messages would come out and nobody would ever believe me.  He’d had other interns before me and I’m pretty sure he did this with all of them. 
The third time he brought a bottle of pills and told me to take one. It was oxycontin and it made things a little bit easier. This whole time he convinced me if i told anyone, my life would be over, he’d out me to my family, he’d tell them all the nasty things we did together.
On the fourth time, I finally had the strength to leave. I waited til night,I made it as far as the hotel itself from the racetrack before I realized it was cold and HE realized I was gone. I think he knew I was going to tell the police so he begged me to come back. He bought me a plane ticket home to my parents that night and he told me to take a vacation. I don’t think he was thinking very clearly. I never got on the return flight. I never wanted to see him again.
In 2015 I began to miss my animals, badly, and the trauma from the previous events hadn’t fully taken over my life. Like the dumb kid i was, I decided to give Bill another try. I rang him up and he told me everyone out there missed me, and if I came on down, We would talk about how things were better (there were other problems I was having beyond the obvious one with Bill).
I made my bed on the couch at his place when i drove down, because someone was in the spare room, and i thought that would be sufficient enough to keep things pg. I was wrong. I hadn’t even been in the house for 5 hours when Bill decided to pull his shit again. I told him I was going to yell out and he still put his hands down my pants. I should have yelled. I left again that night, drove all the way back to my home in california, and i told myself that that was the end of bill. I couldn’t prove he raped me, so i needed to move on with my life.

I can’t move on. This tears at me almost daily. I’ve literally never typed it out before, and I’m sorry that details are so sparse, but actually reading it like this, I can’t believe how fucked up it sounds. Any questions that might clear up an inconsistency I’m happy to answer. I’m not looking for sympathy, but I want to be able to share this with someone, ANYONE before it eats me alive. This man is still my facebook friend and every day I see him with another success i will never have, because of the things he’s done to my body and head. The fact that i let him get away with doing something like this to a young adult makes me want to kill myself.

me fucking too.

7aes46,2,2017-11-02,Need help deciding between two moderare company offers.,TheAbLord,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7aes46/need_help_deciding_between_two_moderare_company/,"I recently received an offer for a software internship from two places: a large, well-known investment bank, and a smaller business analytics software company in California (not a startup).

At the moment I am trying to decide which is the better option to go for, based on specific criteria:

- Which company will be best experience wise/Where will I gain the most valuable work experience. I've called both companies and they have told me that interns do substantial and relevant work, but I have learned it can be hit or miss at both.

- Which company will look best on my resume? Yes this is kind of a superficial reason to select a company, but it is only and internship and I would like to have my resume boosted to be able to apply to a company well suited to what I'd want to be doing, further down the line.

I am not too concerned about good fit for now, since worst case I can always leave the company if I do not feel at home there. Does anyone know if working with a large investment bank has any tangible benefits over a smaller, less known Silicon Valley tech company?


EDIT: in the past some people have given me the generic advice of ""do what falls in line with your goals."" At the moment I have no idea where I want to go in CS, and am just hoping to pick the best option that may help me find the job I'd want to do down the line, should my interests change."

What's your general day at work like and how's the salary? 
    
I have an opportunity at an internship in a Fortune 20 company in this type of position, and I was considering working on IT &amp; security certificates (Security +, CCNA, then CISSP), as well as self learning Python and other tools, to advance into a more technical role within the company. This is a company I really want to work for.   

I was wondering if this would be a smart move, or if I should aim for a more technical role (IT Security Intern) with a lesser-known company and build on from there. They're implementing AlienVault and I'd have to monitor their SIEM. Surprisingly, the pay is less here.   

For scope, I've already had a helpdesk internship and a sysadmin internship.

I'm a second year graduate student who is about to start their full-time externship from Jan-May. I'm caught in a little dilemma... I have spoken with my clinical director and have been placed at a Chicago public school and a non-profit private adult clinic (non-medical) setting. However, just received word from my family friend that her hospital is taking SLPs. Just received an email asking for an interview. Anyway, my last resort for a CFY/job would be in the school setting and I definitely don't plan on applying at Chicago public schools. I am aiming for more of an adult setting preferably something medical. My director said I could potentially opt out of the school placement but in IL you cannot get hired at a school without a full-time externship placement. (p.s. also at a school setting right now for my internship). Basically, I'm wondering if anyone had any advice on which placements I should take and which can give me better advantage for a job. Do I stick with just doing the schools, in case that's the only job possible? Or would it be better to take the two adult/medical placements because that's the setting I would like to be in. How important are starting connections now? Thank you in advance! Any comments are appreciated. "

Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is.

Kinks: BDSM, spanking, anal, traditional gender roles, cheating, lactation play, older men

Limits: Humiliation, toilet play, feet, violence, bimbofication

7afuac,2,2017-11-02,A nervous undergrad's attempt to not screw up,pengweather,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7afuac/a_nervous_undergrads_attempt_to_not_screw_up/,"Hey guys,

I got a lot of questions I want to ask regarding applications for graduate school, but I kind of don't know where to start. Hopefully I can delineate my thoughts and concerns in an organized manner. 

I'm currently in my fifth and last year as an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I did decent on the GRE and have a solid cGPA of 3.72 and a major GPA of 3.97. For now, I'm still undecided whether I want to do a Ph.D or get my foot into the industry, however I do have interest in continuing my education in graduate school, hence why I'm going for a Master's after talking to a few of my professors. I have completed my statement of purpose and getting ready to do my personal history essay. However, after I got several of my professors to go through my SOP, I think I may have goofed up and want to get your opinions on this matter.

I first tried to read SOPs that people have written and posted on their personal websites, however they were mostly for Ph.D programs, not really meant for Master's. When I read through the SOPs, they were very specific with what they want to research and who to work under. They also have done a plethora of research beforehand and talked about it in the SOP. For me, on the other hand, I've only done about 3 months of undergraduate research in 2016 and currently starting a new project with my professor where we hope to get a conference paper by the end of May. I'm just worried that it is not enough for a Master's. 

Additionally, I had a hard time writing my SOP. Most of the examples I've read had people discuss their interest in STEM since childhood whereas for me, my interest in Electrical Engineering didn't really begin until my 3rd year. Also, I've been exposed to different areas of Electrical Engineering. For my internship last summer and the Hyperloop project I am in for my senior design class, I've mostly focused on implementing SCADA and controls system. The research I'm going to do this semester involves wireless communications, more specifically into using software-defined radios for beamforming. Furthermore, I've been taking classes on passive and active RF technology and currently designing a rat-race hybrid that I hope to get fabricated by the end of November. However, in my SOP, I was really vague about what I want to do for my Master's. Everything I've done that is related to Electrical Engineering project-wise don't tie in together since they cover different things. Plus, I feel like I don't have enough ""credentials"" to say I really want to focus on RF, control systems, etc. I want to go to grad school to give me a better idea of what I want to specifically do but I feel like that will cause my application to go straight into the trash. Everything I've read online is making a bit nervous to be quite honest. 

But enough of my rant, here are the questions I have.

1.) What do admissions look at in applicants pursuing a Master's vs PhD? Will writing about my work experience, my projects, undergraduate research, internship, etc. suffice? 
2.) How ""broad"" can I be for my SOP if I am applying for a  Master's? Will discussing what I've done that is Electrical Engineering-related be too broad? Should I just focus on say Controls and not mention about stuff I've done that is RF-related or Comp-Sci related?
3.) I've been looking at the EE departments of schools such as Berkeley, Stanford, UIUC, CU Boulder, etc. to see what research groups they have. For the Ph.D SOPs that I've read, it seems like they use the last paragraph to talk about which professors they are interested in. Is this necessary if I'm just going for a Master's?
     - If so, I've read through some of the publications that were published and quite frankly, I got lost after the first page but I was curious about it. Is it appropriate to ask specific questions regarding the research they have done?
     - If not, what should I mention? What courses I want to take?

I know this was a long post but I kind of had to let it out. Any honest feedback or criticism is greatly appreciated. You guys have been an incredible help so far.

7afxpz,3,2017-11-02,How does one decide becoming an executive vs. a skilled individual contributor?,drcuddlesworthjr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7afxpz/how_does_one_decide_becoming_an_executive_vs_a/,"I'm in a big company doing a paid internship for recent college grads. After my final rotation, I will be able to choose which department I would like to work in. My dilemma is that I don't know if I want to go the executive route (fast paced/high pressure/longer hours/getting higher up faster) or the technically skilled individual contributor (better work life balance/longer projects/get to play with data, which I enjoy). 


The feedback I received was that I would do very well in both environments, and it was really up to me what I wanted in my career. I interviewed with Dept X and Dept Y and so far I can't decide which team I want to join. Dept X is willing to let me use my time to learn new languages like Python and focuses on long term projects. However I don't see this work being super important, and this will likely take me longer up the career ladder. Dept Y is a integral part of the organization and the staff routinely meets with senior management and the CEO, which means more pressure and quick turnaround times but likely to work in my favor during promotions. 

Personally, I am ambitious and would like to see myself in a senior position and living up to my potential but the stress, responsibility and high pressure scare me a lot. However, I feel I can overcome this fear by being immersed in it. At the same time, I enjoy the technical aspects of the work and wouldn't mind satisfying my intellectual curiosity as well. I also enjoy a more laid back environment but I worry that I will be too complacent. It is an extrovert vs. introvert situation and I'm 50/50! 

How did you decide in your careers? "
7ag4ll,2,2017-11-02,"Is there a ""Rehab"" type place for depressed people to go to (Not Drug Rehab)?",Layne_Staley33,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ag4ll/is_there_a_rehab_type_place_for_depressed_people/,"I hope I am being clear here. I have seen several therapists since 2007, so about a decade. My depression is caused mainly by treatment-resistant daily migraines and severe anxiety.

My depression is very bad right now, maybe the most ever. I **don't** have thoughts of suicide but it's gotten to the point that i can't leave my house and I can't practice (I got my masters in social work but I am too afraid to practice).

But I feel like I need some sort of intensive place to go for a few months to focus totally on my physical and mental health. I'm surrounded by a lot of negativity in my daily life. People are starting to take advantage of me and I'm withdrawing from my real friends. If nothing else I would at the very least like to be physically and mentally better so that I can try to get rid of my social anxiety and help my migraines.

I give *all* of my money and resources to people (like my ex-girlfriend) because she has cancer and I always took care of her. And the only thing that makes me feel happy is taking care of her even though we arn't together anymore. I don't focus on myself, which I need to do.

I think it would be beneficial if I just left that situation all together.

So I don't know if places like this exist or not, but I was thinking it would be interesting to try a type of ""retreat"" or ""intensive rehabilitation of the mind and body"" to help curb my severe depression. If nothing else, I can go there and just focus on myself but I don't even know what these places are called or if they exist. My internships in graduate school never mentioned them.

If anyone has any resources for me to read about that would be helpful. I live in Baltimore, if that is any help in regards to places that are close by (if they exist).

Thanks for your help and have a wonderful day."

7ag9p4,1,2017-11-02,Should I attend a Coding Bootcamp or work and Self Teach given my circumstances?,thes8m8,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7ag9p4/should_i_attend_a_coding_bootcamp_or_work_and/,"Hello,


I am wondering if I should attend a coding Bootcamp or self-teach with my circumstances.  I would like your input!


**Background:**


Right now I'm 22 and a sophomore at a community college.  Weighing lots of options regarding college transfer plans, I believe my best option would be to transfer to a good UC school in Fall 2019.  That gives me a solid 2 years before the transfer takes place.  Apparently for the UC transfer plan I might have to be enrolled for 2 semesters before hand (which would give me time to finish my sophomore year in college) as I'm currently not enrolled.  This means I would technically focus on college starting Fall 2018.


That means I have a year of free time before starting college (if I decide to go to college).


I think this is perhaps good that I have a year of time for decision making as I'm very new to programming and want to play with it more before dedicating myself to heavy math courses such as Calculus 1, 2, and 3 etc.


**Situation:**


With a year of free time, I have some decision making to do.  I definitely want to flirt with programming more to make sure I want to take it in college, but I'm not sure how I want to approach this.


My parents want me to do something, whether I am working full time or going to a coding bootcamp.  It doesn't matter what it is and they will support it.  In a perfect world, I would spend all day learning online in my own time as it's much cheaper than bootcamp, but again, my parents require me to be enrolled in a full time job, or full time school (can include bootcamp).


**Options:**


My first option would be to work a full-time minimum wage job, and code when I get home.  I calculated it and would probably have ~4 hours at most a day (if that) to self teach while working 8 hours a day aside of my other daily activities.  I don't need the money as my parents will pay for schooling, it's just a ""need to be doing something"" type of deal.


My other option is to go to a bootcamp ASAP, try and get an internship or a job after, and then continue self study into theory like data structure and algorithms while I am employed which is a stretch as likelihood of hiring is unknown.  This option would have me coding pretty much all day ~8+ hours programming every day rather than working a pointless minimum wage job.  If I don't get an internship or job, then I can always go into college for 2019 and if i do get a job, I can always go into college 2019 as well if I feel it would be important for career growth.


**Question:**


So should I do minimum wage and less time self teaching, or coding bootcamp with a big fee and more time programming.  If I do coding bootcamp, I was thinking of Epicodus in portland as I see it's much cheaper than others but seems just as legit and one of the best.  Portland is like 15 hours away from home so it's a big move... any input of this particular or bootcamps in general?  Would it be crazy to go that far and move just for a bootcamp, are there better ones in california of the same cost?  Also, if I do coding bootcamp and I DO get a job, do you think that the first job will lead to more with ease or should I still start college 2019.

7agez2,20,2017-11-02,Calling Consults,Therapist13,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/7agez2/calling_consults/,"As an intern, I get told to call lots of consults. Most of the time it’s fine and most services are great. Then there are services that give a lot of push back. I get that there is a spectrum of consults, from “I’m seeing ST elevations and my patient is having chest pain” to “we don’t really know what’s going on, can you assist in the evaluation/work up of so and so”. I also know consultants must know I’m usually not the one making the decision to consult, so I’m left to frame together a good question to make it work. I also know consultants are extremely busy, but at the end of the day, everyone else is busy too and just trying to give the best care they can. 

I guess I’ve just received a lot of push back from certain services, usually surgical ones aside from general surgery, who won’t see my patient or leave a note and always want to give just give recs unofficially over the phone, and I’m wondering what I can do to do a better job. Maybe I don’t understand the questions we pose to consultants well enough to give them a good reason to come, maybe I’m not assertive enough, I don’t know. "

BlackRock would be in downtown SF, Capital One would be in McLean, VA.  Both offers are for about the same amount but Capital One also covers housing.

That being said, I haven’t heard much about BlackRock.  I know it’s definitely more of a financial firm, but they seem to put a decent emphasis on technology (although less than Capital One).

I guess my main two questions are which company is going to give me the better experience both for the summer but also in the long-term (assuming they’d give me a full time offer).  Also, which company is going to look better on a resume?

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

My First and Last Letter: The History of my Depression

Sorry to my friends and family, and whoever ends up reading this.  This is my first and last letter, a story of my depression. I tried to fight it no avail, and it's something it's something that has haunted me for over 10 years. I don't know why but it all started when my grandparents and I moved into my aunts household. While I may have looked like boy in 6th grade that was simply obsessed with playing video games all day instead of eating or communicating much with my family, I was trying to escape the sadness that existed in my mind. Everything was twisted from there, and I was already thinking and researching ways to commit suicide in the most painless and least gruesome way possible. I was confused and clueless as to why I felt so worthless and unloved, when I was surrounded by people that cared for me. There was only teacher in middle school that saw something odd about me and asked if I was alright. That year was the last year that I ever had any good grades in school, and then came a downward spiral of hopelessness. I never had a father figure or anyone that taught me how to be a man, or a strong, independent individual.. But I felt like needed to be, and I never really understood that it was okay to ask for help. I kept everything to myself, and I lied about my grades and report cards. In 7th grade my aunt picked me up from school and asked me how I got cuts on my forearm, I told her that I got scratched from the fence playing tennis. I cut myself. I cut myself because I felt and truly believed that all I ever deserved was pain. 

By the time high school came along I still had no aspirations or any dream careers while all my friends were thinking about college. Instead I was doing drugs to escape my reality. I always told myself that I would kill myself after my grandparents passed away. I eventually wanted to join the Navy and try to discover myself and start my life over, but that was not an option for my family. That was the one thing that I was slightly ever interested in, but instead there was only heavy pressure and emphasis on going to college and getting a good job. How could I do that when I didn't care for it? I kept failing and failing and there was still only pressure to go to college and get a degree like this person or that person. My whole life I've been compared to random successful people and relatives. I barely graduated from highschool. So I didn't join the Navy and went to community college, I failed miserably, and eventually dropped out. I have no blame for any one person, but for the Asian culture and upbringing itself that mental illness doesn't exist and that education is the only way to success and happiness. 

When I reached out to friends and family I was only shot down. ""You can't be sad"". ""You have no reason to be sad"". ""You're too young to be sad"". ""Just get a good job and make money you won't be sad"". I wish that everyone that I've told just accepted that I was sad, and even more that I needed help and support. One of my friends brought me to church and I thought I found hope but I didn't understand why I was still depressed. Church was good and fun for the years that it lasted but it wasn't enough to save me from myself. Then there were people that spoke like they had a magical cure that said ""just don't think about it"" or ""just read the bible and pray"". I never needed anyone to understand my pain or try to fix it, I just wanted someone to be there. I wanted to be happy, but my soul was tired. In college one of my psychology professors noticed that I failed to turn in my final research paper. She gave me a chance to turn it in late for most of the credits and to possibly talk about it after class. I rejected both offers. I want to stress the importance of reaching out and offering proper help  towards those in need. I reached out to her after finding out that she also one of the counselors at the school hoping to talk about my depression. I couldn't get any service because I stopped attending but she led me to a mental health clinic in the area. I was on Zoloft for a while and I had to double my dosage eventually. It was actually alright and I was doing better until I felt comfortable enough to share my suicidal thoughts with my therapist. She took it like I was possibly a danger to myself and made it aware to me that some people might be sent over to evaluate me and that I might be held until I was stable under drugs. I felt betrayed and I was beyond angry and frustrated. How can I get help with the thoughts in my head without speaking about them? I'm sure she was either an intern or just highly inexperienced, as it was a low-cost/free clinic. That was my first experience with a therapist and it left a very bad impression. I never came back and I dropped the medication and sessions. 

Videos games and fishing were good distractions, along with all the other hobbies that I found like thrifting. Those were the only things I was able to enjoy in solitude, other than that I hated being alone. Working helped too, but they were just that. Never a means to a solution. By this time I have also given up all drugs and smoking to no benefit. How can I be so young yet my soul, mind, and body be so tired? I could never put the pieces of my life together. I've been called selfish in the past for having suicidal thoughts, and there's a good chance that whoever reads this will think I was selfish in thought or action. I want you to have an open mind. I fear death just like everyone else, if not more because death knocks on my door every single day. Do you know what it feels like to wake up every day wanting to die? To have thoughts of worthlessness pounded into your existence for years and years coming from your own mind? To not have any energy to do simple things like get out of bed, shower, brush your teeth? During the time of writing this letter I have been struggling with insomnia and lack of appetite as well. These seem like trivial things but there's symptoms of mental illness in many forms, and they were mostly undiscovered because it either wasn't hard to hide or people were not properly informed on how to approach my situation. How can people help if they have no idea what it could look like? How can they reach out without aggravating  or increasing the risk? Days have passed like clockwork and after many years of rejecting suicide as an escape it has sadly come to life. 

I hope whoever reads this understands that I tried to live a normal life despite everything going on in my head. I hope you know that I chose to be vulnerable about my depression even after my trust in people was broken. I hope you realize that I truly believe in my head and heart that I've exhausted all of my options, and that I see no other escape from this but in death. I can't wait any longer for some terrible disease or curse to strike me, or for God to take my life away. I hope that this letter raises awareness of mental illness and the importance of observing the growth, behaviors, and symptoms of the mind, especially in children. I was depressed and I had many reasons to be. In the same vein I had little reason  to be depressed. My thought is that external and also internal factors resulted in depression being a part of my being.

It's a selfish request but I would not like any Christian or Buddhist ceremonies or speeches, for in death or life I am neither. If perhaps there is the chance that I end up in a braid-dead state I request that all life support be cut off immediately. I don't want to live any longer or to end up in the same condition as my grandfather in his last days. My only wish is that if my brain is in good enough condition for it to be donated to science to hopefully further the research and treatment of brain disorders, if not I would like my remains to be cremated and laid to rest. I'm sure that would bring my  soul great peace. It's the one thing I've yearned for my entire life but was not able to grasp. I didn't want to bring anyone pain, especially my family and close friends, but I could not bear this any longer. I chose not to go back to drugs or anything because it is only a vicious cycle with no end, and I don't want anyone to think that drugs or any addictions were the cause of my suicide. It was depression and depression alone. I'm sorry  for whoever finds my body in the state that it may be in, as I would opt to simply disappear if I could than to share any part of the pain and hurt I have suffered. I thought that I could just hold everything in and hope that things would sort itself out eventually. I reached out for help the best that I could. I can't bear the pressures of life any longer. I'm sorry I was  not the greatest grandchild or nephew. My shame I seal to the grave, but I hope that I was able to paint a clearer picture of the chaos, bitterness, and sadness that was my life. If I could sum my life up in one sentence it would be this:

I never wanted to die, yet I've always wanted to die.

The people I met there were great, and I had a connection to one person at the firm that recommended me for the job. I accepted on the last day to respond. However, the Big 4 firm I was going hadn’t even started office interviews until after I got the first offer. Big 4 has always been my top choice, so even after accepting the offer, I continued interviewing. Today I had my office interview with Big 4 and it went really well. If I get an offer from them, I’ll have to make the decision on whether to renege my first offer. I feel terrible about that because I don’t like to burn bridges, especially when I know someone who helped get me that offer, and they seemed so excited about having me. But I feel like if I got an offer from this Big 4 firm, I can’t just let it pass me by. The people I’ve met at the Big 4 firm are also great, and I just think it would be a better opportunity. Any advice on what to do in this situation?  "

The big bank seems like it would pop out on my resume to recruiters, but I'm not convinced I would get a lot of hands-on work. Meanwhile the smaller company is actually a tech firm and would likely give me lots of opportunities to learn a lot, but many recruiters may glance over it on my resume because it has a relatively dull name and is virtually unknown.

Sometimes when I'm under pressure I don't perform the best in timed settings, and I tend to use my time to learn other outside skills, work on projects, apply to internships, clubs, work study job, parties/hang out, occasional Netflix, etc. so I don't spend much time studying compared to my peers.

If it matters, I go to USC and I'm majoring in computer science and business administration. It's my freshman year so I'm hoping I adjust better next semester, but my classes are supposedly going to be much, much harder with a much larger workload (guess I didn't do a good job planning my schedule based on expected workload from classes). I expect to get around a 3.3 this semester, but I'm wondering if I should really drop some of the outside things I'm doing and just focus on my classes.

Ideally, I'd like to learn more applicable things (which I feel like I'm doing by working on projects, joining CS project-based clubs, web dev-ish job, etc.) and I just don't see a huge benefit from some of my other classes. Obviously I don't want to fail and any learning is beneficial, but I've always had the mindset that I only have 24 hours a day so there's only so much I can do and it's up to me to choose where to spend it.

It might be important to note that I didn't come into college with much coding experience so I can't breeze through those classes. Basically, am I doing the right thing by being so involved on campus and doing career stuff or should I really just be heavily focusing on my classes right now? In the end, if I don't have a great GPA, but it doesn't disadvantage me in any way, then I don't really care. Just don't want to limit my opportunities because of it."

I have an extremely difficult relationship with my mother, involving some fairly heavy/dark family history. I'm feeling paralysed by indecision at the moment and it's really stressing me out. So, here goes.

My sister is getting married, yay! However, as is to be expected, it is bringing up a lot of past family demons. We were all prepared for this, though perhaps not to the extent that it's currently happening. The story goes that when my sister was 6 or 7 and I was around 4, my paternal grandfather was sexually abusing us (we don't remember any of it) and it was all uncovered when my sister told my aunt (maternal), who then filed a police report but never ended up pressing any charges. Supposedly, my dad's side of the family were all in on the secret and didn't do anything to stop it, maybe even going so far as to enable him. My dad confessed a few years later that he didn't believe it had gone down the way my mum/aunty said it did, so they got a divorce. My dad is now happily remarried and lives out in the countryside - where my sister wants to have the wedding.

In the years since my mum and dad divorced, it's become apparent my mum has a whole lot of unresolved trauma in her past. Our relationship is not the most healthy, and ever since the divorce I have become a bit of an emotional crutch for her. For example, when I was 9 y.o. and my mother was heavily drinking, my 'job' was to make sure she got up and dressed for work, and to make sure my little brother had breakfast and was ready for school. She also had an abusive on/off again boyfriend who hit me and my siblings when he got drunk - we pleaded with mum many times to break up with him but it didn't go anywhere until a health scare got her sober. I still live with her at 24 years old, mainly because I'm worried about her mental/physical health and because she really isn't all that capable of looking after herself. If I go away somewhere for a week, she will not eat a proper meal for that whole week. It gets pretty dire. But you know, she's my mum. The guilt would eat me alive if I left her. She also recently adopted a dog for companionship, and I have ended up being her main caretaker. I love this dog and I've totally become one of those annoying 'dog mums' - but I really did not sign up for the financial/general responsibility that comes with owning a dog. It feels a bit like it's been thrust upon me. I can't really complain though because, well, she's the best wee fuzzball.

Let me just say that my paternal grandfather was absolutely a nasty piece of work and held a lot of power over that whole side of the family. It was an arranged marriage between him and my paternal grandmother, and there was not a whole lot of love lost when he died of a painful and long illness about a decade ago. He definitely physically abused my father. I don't know what exactly what happened 20 years ago, and neither does my sister, but we have had a LOT of therapy and since forgiven that side of the family and spent a lot of time with them. Our view is that it probably is not as black and white as our mum makes it out to be, and they were all probably (and legitimately) fearing for their safety. They're also genuinely lovely people  - and they're all being invited to my sisters wedding. That's happening on my dads farm.

Originally when we were planning this a few months ago, we had mum in mind and my sister was totally ready to compromise on location if my mum voiced any objections. We also asked if it's okay to invite dad's side of the family. She said that was fine, and that what my sister wanted was most important - she would just stay away from dad's family. That's definitely not the case anymore. My mum, maternal grandmother and maternal aunty got together and this week have told my sister that if any of my dads side of the family show up, especially my paternal grandmother, they will not be attending. This came as a huge shock to my sister and has really distressed her.

After my mum and her side of the family gave my sister their ultimatum, I started seeing red a little bit. I got home and pretended everything was fine, because I knew I'd say something I would regret, until my mum brought it up. I then told her that I thought her side of the family were being selfish, and if my sister has forgiven my dads family, why is it so bad for them to be invited to HER wedding? Why can't my sister just have this one day that's all about her?

It did not go down well, and she ended up kicking me out and slamming the door in my face. I figured this was probably a bluff of hers, and moving out for a few days probably wasn't a bad idea. I'm currently living with my boyfriend, but I'm heavily dependent on his charity as I don't make a lot of money (I'm doing an internship rn, partially paid) and I can cover rent + bills but have about $10 a week leftover for food. I'm also really fucking worried about my dog. I miss her so much it physically hurts.

But the freedom!! It's amazing to come home to a house where you don't feel like you're walking on eggshells. Where you're not wholly responsible for another adult - where not a single one of the conversations involves guilt trips or manipulations or fishing for compliments. I'm upset and angry and relieved and happy all at the same time. And this is all because I got kicked out over some wedding drama. My sister has become aware of the situation (my mum told her I had 'moved out', lol) and wants to start looking for affordable flats for us to live in together. I'm super excited about this prospect, but I'm also so so so guilty. I can't believe I'm even entertaining the notion of leaving my mum alone to fend for herself. What if I have to leave the dog behind, and she becomes neglected? What if my mum tries to manipulate me into staying by using the dog? She has also implied that if she 'loses me' over this, she would seriously hurt herself.

I'm sorry if this story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I'm aware it's very convoluted and spans a long stretch of time. I'm just really distressed at the prospect of leaving my mum alone and at possibly leaving my dog, but I also cannot seriously imagine going back to living with her. I feel like there's no good decisions here. What would you do? What should I do?

I don't know if it is right subreddit to ask this question or not . If it is not, i am sorry for advance. 

I am one of undergrad students in Turkey. This year is my freshman year and I am a bit worried about the amount of people who study cs in worldwide. 

I have chosen cs faculty due to neither money nor good career  , I really like cs and I have been interested in programming and computer hardware since my childhood. Also, I have already known python and Linear Programming. I have done a summer internship.
However, I took introduction to programming course last week and all of industrial engineering freshman students were taking this course and this situation caused a bit anxiety on me because of the fact that most of people learn programming and i thought we(people who have cs degree)  won't have supremacy  as programming won't be rare skill in worldwide. I know that cs is not only about programming, but also solving problems,algorithms etc.  Therefore, I am not sure that if cs will provide good career opportunities or not ? There are bunch of people who are more experienced than me, they might answer my question .

We live in Pennsylvania. 

We both work, but are also both in school and as of next fall, neither of us will be working due to our programs requiring all our time (him in unpaid internships at that point for physical therapy and me in 10-12 hour days 5 days a week or more for dental hygiene). We were saving to be able to afford bills for that period, but I had to have a sudden, unexpected spine surgery in May that our insurance didn’t fully cover, so our emergency savings went to that and to bills while I was unable to work until the end of September. So now we are down to only ~$2000 in savings and paying two payment plans to cover expenses from my surgery and physical therapy. 

Is there anything I can ask when I call the Marketplace or bring up that can help us? We can’t afford to go up even $50, let alone over $400 a month and while my husbands job offers insurance, it’s terrible, costs over $600 per month as well and wouldn’t cover the continued care I’ve needed while recovering. I would be screwed without insurance, as on top of my complications from the surgery, I have EDS and need constant care for that, too.

Any advice would be welcome. We just got the letter this morning and my husband is at work, so I’m panicking a bit being here alone and not knowing what option could keep us from losing our insurance."

**Warlock:** Alright, you completely sure about this? You’ll have to go it alone since we couldn’t afford a second baseball bat.

**Romero:** I am very sure! They may be two men, but I am a man with a fucking bat! And besides, I hear our environment will play into our hands.

**Warlock:** How so?

**Romero:** Well they’re coming into the show late, but the people managing the lights here assume everyone who will be here is since the show’s started, so they’ve turned off the lights in the driveway leading up to this lot, and so, i’m a dark man, who’ll be able to come at ‘em in the dark, they ain’t gonna see me ‘till it’s too late.

**Warlock:** Ha! That’s a damn good convenience for us. I think they should be here at any moment, so go get ‘em. 

Romero then hops off the hood, but before he can walk off, Warlock talks to say one more thing.

**Warlock:** But before ya go, remember our values, don’t go all down to their level, don’t go too far with this, we want a fair match at Copyright Strike, not one against bat crippled freaks.

**Romero:** With what they’ve done to us, what’s too far may be pretty damn far out there. But i’ll keep in mind, see ya in a bit.

The two wave off to each other, as Romero walks through the parking lot, near where the driveway up to the lot is, the shot getting progressively darker. Until, we hear a bit of distant rumbling that seems to be coming from a car, as Romero runs up to a wall, now nearly completely consumed by the darkness, as he waits for the rumbling to come closer. Meanwhile…

We cut to D&amp;B driving in a generic beige car, as we see the backseat and trunk filled to the brim with various halloween candies, Blackwater feasting down on a bag of Candy Corn, eating it by the handfull, while Dutch is left to drive. They seem to be outside, but not far from the indoor parking lot.

**Dutch:** We’re fucking late, Louis. I swear, if we get paid less because you wanted some more fucking candy, i’m taking the cut off what I lost from you.

**Blackwater:** Don’t ever worry, how can showing up late just once hurt us? We’re the tag team champions! So it’s not like we’re gonna be fired! And besides, having a whole year’s supply of candy is always worth it.

**Dutch:** And half of that is just every bag of Candy Corn you could find..

**Blackwater:** I had to make sure i’d get some candy for myself!

Dutch continues on driving, as eventually, they reach the tunnel leading to the lot, natural lighting getting enough in for them to see, but as they turn a corner, all of it is gone, and they realize there’s no light.

**Dutch:** Who turned off all the fucking lights? We could’ve hit anyone walking there, like some Make A Wish kid who fell out of his chair and is crawling to the door!

**Blackwater:** Oddly specific..

**Dutch:** Shoulda seen what happened this past christmas.

Dutch turns off the headlights to the car, as we cut back to Romero up against the wall, now seeing the lights turn on, and the car approach closer. Keeping to the wall, he moves towards it, before eventually being in range, and striking out one of the headlights with the bat! Smashing it and disabling the light!

**Dutch:** AW FUCK! What was that? Is some bored intern tossing rocks again?

**Blackwater:** Mark! Do you even know what day it is?!

**Dutch:** …..the 30th?

**Blackwater:** No! It’s Halloween Eve! Do you know what that means? It means that the monsters have begun to awake from their slumber, they’ve been hiding here in the dark, and they’re coming to get us! We gotta get out!

**Dutch:** CALM DOWN MAN! Jesus! I’m sure it’s nothing serious, probably won’t happen again-

Just as Dutch says this, Romero walks over, and smashes the other headlight! As complete darkness once again consume!

**Blackwater:** SEE! SEE! IT HAPPENED AGAIN! It’s taking out all light, so it can use the power of darkness to steal our souls! We’re gonna die if we don’t break for it! I’m getting out!

Blackwater takes off his seat belt, as he tries to kick open the door, but Dutch grabs him, and keeps him in the car.

**Dutch:** NO! The sugar’s getting to you! There’s no god damn monster, and even if there was, what good is running out by yourself gonna do? We’d be split and easily picked off! I bet whatever caused it is already gone! I’ll get out my phone and use that to shine a light, and we’ll see there’s nothing to be afraid of!

Dutch pulls out his phone, as he turns it on, and shines it through the windshield…..as they then see Romero, baseball bat in hand, on the hood of the car, smile planted on his face. D&amp;B are frozen in shock and possibly fear for a few second, before Romero exclaims..

**Romero:** Boo!

Romero then smashes his baseball bat through the windshield! Shattering the glass all over the place, as D&amp;B duck and narrowly avoid getting directly hit, as Blackwater kicks open his door, and runs out in the darkness screaming! Romero laughs seeing the faint image of Blackwater running, as Dutch is still down low in the car, seemingly hoping it’ll just pass by, as Romero gets off the hood, and goes to the driver side window, before smashing that in with a bat! The glass shattering once again! Shards go all over the back of Dutch’s clothes, as he makes a dive for the door Blackwater opened, as Romero walks over to there, and smashes the window of the opened door in! More glass going everywhere, the bat just barely above Dutch’s head, as he’s sent into full panic, frantically getting out and running! Noticeably tripping and falling a few times in the distance, Romero laughing at this, as he pulls out his phone, and calls Warlock. Who quickly responds.

**Romero:** Yo, man, I wish you just seen what I did, gave him such a great scare as they pulled up, both of ‘em ran away with a fear I haven’t seen much of in a good few years. Fucking hilarious

**Warlock:** Heh, getting them to run away does sound like a good time, but….did you not..actually hit them with the bat?

**Romero:** Not yet no, but while they’re not damaged physically, their car sure is. And they themselves are prob messed up as hell in the head right now!

**Warlock:** Getting into their heads is good and all, but our goals still actually hitting them with the damn thing as full payback, remember that.

**Romero:** Don’t worry man, they ran toward the arena, so I think they’ll be sticking around, we’ll have another chance.

**Warlock:** Alright, just make sure you don’t miss that chance.

**Romero:** Man we know how they roll by this point, even if they’re hiding they’ll make a scene of it, we’ll know where they are. Oh! And on an unrelated note, you in the mood for some candy?

**Warlock:** Uhhh, sure if you got any.

**Romero:** Oh I think i’ll have plenty…

Romero then walks around the car, and smashes open the back windshield with his bat! Opening it, and leaving enough room for him to reach in, and grab a few bags of candy, before he heads off, as we fade out.

**Commercial**

We come back backstage, as we see Dutch and Blackwater walking around, looking very flustered, and breathing heavy from the events that just unfolded.

**Dutch:** Christ! The fucking madman! He could’ve killed us!

**Blackwater:** Yeah, I can’t believe the devil woke up a day early to attack us!

**Dutch:** ….what?

**Blackwater:** That’s what that was right? The devil?

**Dutch:** …...no.

**Blackwater:** Well what was it then?!

**Dutch:** Alright, so what’s tall, muscular, black, and doesn’t like us very much?

**Blackwater:** EXACTLY! THE DEVIL!

**Dutch:** No silly! Romero! One of The Warlords!

**Blackwater:** Oh…..yeah…...WELL HE’S A DAMN PSYCHO THEN!

**Dutch:** I KNOW! We can’t let his actions stand! We must make it right!

**Blackwater:** And I know how to do it!

Blackwater walks a few steps ahead, and kicks open the door to Russell’s office, blasting through as he grabs Sharp my the collar.

**Blackwater:** WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!

**Sharpe:** W-what?!

**Blackwater:** WHY’D YOU SEND THAT LUNATIC TO MURDER US?! I KNOW YOU PLANNED THIS YOU BASTARD!

**Sharpe:** Who the hell are you even talking about!

**Blackwater:** ROMERO! WITH THE BAT HE TRIED TO USE TO CAVE OUR SKULLS IN! HE TRIED TO EAT OUR BABIES! WE DON’T EVEN HAVE BABIES, BUT HE WANTED TO EAT THEM!

**Sharpe:** L-listen! I’m not sure about eating babies, that sounds kinda sketchy and untrue, but anything with the bat was entirely his plan! I had nothing to do with him going out there to do that!

**Blackwater:** THEN WHY DIDN’T YOU STOP HIM HUH? DO YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR MOST VALUABLE CHAMPS GET MURDERED?! DO YOU NOT NOT CARE?! DO YOU NOT LOVE THE MONEY WE MAKE?! DO YOU NOT HATE MURDERERS ENOUGH TO STOP THEM?!

**Sharpe:** I only have so much power! What am I gonna do to stop a 320 pound man from doing something he insists on!

Blackwater looks straight into Sharpe, grabbing his collar tighter, as Sharpe looks terrified, before Blackwater decides to push him off, Sharpe stumbling back into his desk, breathing heavy, as Dutch then walks towards him, trying to plea their case.

**Dutch:** While you can’t stop him, I assume you can punish him yes? Well I say BAN HIM for being an ABSOLUTE LUNATIC!

**Sharpe:** What?! No! If I banned people just for doing things I don’t like or want to happen you two wouldn’t be here!

**Dutch:** We’ve may done some things the general public doesn’t like, but when have we *ever* tried to kill someone?

**Sharpe:** You two pushed a full body casted men down a hill and into a lake just last month!

**Blackwater:** He wasn’t a wrestler! Who cares!

**Dutch:** EXACTLY! Thank you Louis! Don’t you see our case! Blackwater had to run for his life! I almost got struck in the head multiple times! Don’t you see the danger of letting this man roam around?!

**Sharpe:** Not much more danger than you two being around!

Louis then runs back up to Sharpe, grabbing him by his collar again, as Sharpe panic and flails.

**Blackwater:** LISTEN DAMN YOU! WE’LL PRESS CHARGES IF YOU DON’T FIRE HIM! YOU’RE NEEDLESSLY ENDANGERING YOUR WRESTLERS!

**Sharpe:** Listen! I already made your match at the IPPV official! I can’t just fire one of the people in it, this could be a big money match!

**Blackwater:** ARE YOU INSANE?! YOU’RE KEEPING US IN A MATCH WITH THAT MADMAN! WELL LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE-

Blackwater then starts to try and choke out Sharpe, but Dutch quickly pulls him off!

**Dutch:** CALM DOWN MAN! JESUS!......it seems clear he won’t do what’s right, so we must take action ourselves. Now come on, i’ll go get you a drink to calm you down a bit, then we can solve this the D&amp;B way, and walk out on top like we always do, alright?

**Blackwater:** Yeah….yeah I guess…….BUT WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT TIME I SEE YOU SHARPE!

Dutch then leads Blackwater out of the room, as Sharpe just sits down by his desk, looking very scared by what just happened. As we fade out to the scene of the backstage area, specifically the locker room, where we see Maverick, taping up his fists, but still wearing Jeans and a T-Shirt. He has a look of scorn and vengeance on his face. Suddenly, WiR interviewer Chad Hammocks slides into the room, with a mic in hand, and approaches Maverick.

**Hammocks:** Umm…..Maverick? Could I get a quick word with you?

Maverick turns to look at Chad, looking a bit annoyed, but he obliges.

**Maverick:**....Sure, I guess.

**Hammocks:** Well, you’re not scheduled for In Ring Competition tonight, why are you taping up your fists?

**Maverick:** I may not be in a match tonight, but that doesn’t mean I’m not going to FIGHT. Eric Matthews hasn’t arrived to the arena yet, but when he does, I can guaran-damn-tee he’s gonna get a Texas-Sized ass kicking.

**Hammocks:** Oh…...umm…..you’re not gonna like this….

Maverick looks a bit confused.

**Maverick:**...What? Not gonna like *what?*

**Hammocks:** Umm... Matthews isn’t going to be coming to the arena tonight, he’s staying at his hotel for the night.

**Maverick:**......you’re shitting me….

**Hammocks:** It’s true! He already called Mr. Sharp, and demanded a “day off” after what you did to him last week.

**Maverick:** Well, no matter. If Matthews isn’t going to come here, then I’m going to come to HIM.

Maverick picks up his gym bag, with all his belongings, and stands up, walking out of the locker room. He walks through the corridors of the backstage hallways, until reaching the parking lot exit. He walks through the door of the parking lot, and walks over to his red truck, opening the door, getting inside, and starting the car before driving off and away from the arena!

**Paisner:** Where the hell is Mav going?

**Woodbridge:** He’s going after Eric Matthews! My god, what’s gonna happen?!

**Paisner:** I don’t know, but hopefully we can get a camera crew to follow him! Tune into After Party, fans, as we’ll have more updates to this situation as they occur!

**Paisner:** Funkatron had a tough match and a tough loss against Alex Perilmorde last week, so it’s wise of him to take a match like this to rehab!

**Woodbridge:** Big Al, is there any way to even make it sound like The Superstar has a chance?

**Paisner:** Not even I can come up with a good bullshit explanation, Woody.

**Babaganoush:** The following contest is a singles bout scheduled for one fall! Officiating is Mia So Hung!

**Crowd:** WE LOVE MIA! *clap clap clapclapclap* WE LOVE MIA! *clap clap clapclapclap*

[A chiptune that sounds vaguely familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUq611JIBuk) plays as the mysterious, silent Superstar makes his way to the ring to polite golf-claps from all in attendance. Nobody is chanting for Superstar. Nobody ever chants for Superstar.

**Paisner:** I have to give this man… whomever he might be in civilian life… credit for still coming out here to fight after everything that happens to him in WiR.

The Superstar gets into the ring generically, between the top and second ropes.

**Babaganoush:** Introducing first - from Parts Unknown, weighing in at 235 pounds - THE! SUPERSTAR!

**Crowd:** YAAAAY!

**Woodbridge:** You can say this for the Superstar - he’s never done anything to offend these people.

Then the Funk starts as [“Party All the Time”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWa-6g-TbgI) strikes up, making the crowd go nuts. Funkatron’s disco lights fill the arena as the Man - or the Alien - Himself boogies his way to the ring, much more confident than he was the previous week, pointing his finger wildly and even flipping into a handstand to raucous cheers as his superfans in the front row dance along with him.

**Crowd:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY!

**Babaganoush:** And his opponent - from Planet Funk, weighing in at 185 pounds… FUNK! A! TROOOOOOOOOOOOOON!

**Crowd:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

**Woodbridge:** Everybody loves the Funk! And Funkatron’s gonna make us proud tonight!

Mia So Hung finishes getting ready and calls for the opening bell…

**DING DING DING!**

Instead of locking up, The Superstar tries a straight punch. Funkatron shimmies out of the way. He goes for a toe kick - Funkatron evades by spinning off to the side. So far, so Funky.

**Woodbridge:** Not sure why Superstar’s trying to strike here. He’s not gonna beat Funkatron at that.

**Paisner:** The Funky One’s agility always an asset in the early game, not only because of dodging. It’s precisely those quick and esoteric movements that make him the acclaimed striker he is!

Undeterred, The Superstar continues to try to assail Funkatron, barraging him with punches that miss due to Funkatron’s bobbing and weaving of his head. Even as The Superstar tries to get more aggressive with hard body shots, Funkatron just falls back into a bridging evasion.

**Crowd:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! FUNKATRON! FUNKATRON! FUNKATRON!

**Woodbridge:** And Funky taking us to the Matrix!

**Paisner:** This is Funkatron’s favorite opening gambit - the question is when will he start to attack?

As The Superstar lifts his leg back, telegraphing another attempted kick, Funkatron jumps to the side and slips behind The Superstar’s back with a shuffle, pounding him immediately with bionic elbows to the spine followed by the loud crack of a jumping chop to the back of the head!

**Crowd:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

**Paisner:** Funkatron’s defiantly old-school striking has won fans!

Before Funkatron can brain chop again, The Superstar rotates his body towards him...

**Woodbridge:** Look out, Funky - Superstar might be rallying!

The Superstar spins around to try to throw a discus haymaker… and connects with nothing but air as Funkatron does the splits underneath his punch, dropping his head out of the way just in time! Members of the crowd begin to dance.

**Crowd:** WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

On the ground, Funkatron quickly pulls on The Superstar’s legs to sweep them and the bigger man comes crashing ungracefully down onto his back!

**woodbridge:** Here comes some flight!

Funkatron kips up, climbs the ropes, and jumps off the top, tucking and rolling forward to smash his body onto The Superstar’s in a beauty of a 450 splash! He hooks both legs deep and Mia So Hung counts!

**1!**

**2!**

**3!**

**DING DING DING!**

**Crowd:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY! FUNKY! / FUNKATRON! FUNKATRON! FUNKATRON!

**Woodbridge:** OH MY GOD HE GOT HIM!

**Paisner:** Funkatron’s godlike 450 splash finally paying off as he makes some truly quick work of The Superstar!

**Babaganoush:** Here is your winner, by pinfall, at a time of 58 seconds - FUNK! A! TROOOOOOOON!

“Party All the Time” begins playing once again as Funkatron, his mojo seemingly back after the previous week, dances in elation under his disco lights. The Superstar has already exited the ring…

**Woodbridge:** Wait, Al - look under the ring!

**Paisner:** I don’t see - oh my God, is someone under there?

Indeed, AKI Man crawls out from underneath the ring, holding a steel chair!

**Crowd:** *surprised murmurs*

**Paisner:** AKI Man’s not scheduled to wrestle this week - OH SHIT!

Funkatron doesn’t notice AKI Man entering the ring at first, due to his music and lighting and being preoccupied with dancing… But he spins around to see the representative of AKI swinging a steel chair at his face! Funkatron gets his hands up just in time to protect himself somewhat but is knocked over, and AKI Man stomps on him!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOO!

**Woodbridge:** JESUS! Funkatron’s been attacked post-match two weeks in a row now! Somebody help him!

**Paisner:** AKI Man is The Superstar’s tag partner… but why avenge *this* loss out of so many? Why is he attacking the innocent Funkatron…?

Just then, as Funkatron begins to roll away from the stomps and kips up to fight back against AKI Man, The Superstar runs down the ramp and hits the ring again with a baseball bat, cracking Funkatron across the back with it!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Create-a-Tag Team with a cowardly double assault on Funkatron!

**Woodbridge:** Despicable!

Mia So Hung calls for security, who rush the ring and pull Funkatron out of it, restraining AKI Man and The Superstar… but AKI Man has already gotten ahold of a mic from near the ring and holds it up to his face as he resists being escorted out!

**AKI Man:** Our time has finally come!

**Crowd:** WHAT!

**Woodbridge:** AKI Man can talk?!

**Paisner:** And… what the hell does he mean?

**AKI Man:** For too long, we have been humiliated! And we want revenge and stuff! And all you marks are jabronis and your local sports teams suck!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**AKI Man:** Now we must suplex Funkatron… do other stuff to him… and make him HUMBLE! So sayeth our Higher Power! OUR TIME HAS COOOOOOOOOOOME!

AKI and the Superstar are finally dragged away, and AKI is forced to drop his mic.

**Woodbridge:** Fuck. I don’t know what to make of this, but it looks like a jobber rebellion!

**Paisner:** And… a higher power? That’s never a good sign, is it?

**Woodbridge:** Nnnnnope.

**Paisner:** We’re told Funkatron is being treated backstage after that awful attack. House Party will continue in a few moments!

**Commercial**

[Still Burning](https://youtu.be/QNbWcJtaqgA) blasts over the speakers, as we see The Mark Dutch and Louis Blackwater hop out to the entranceway, trash and boos instantly being poured upon them, as they walk down to the ring, taking it with stride. Title belts around both men’s waists

**Paisner:** And the usual reaction for D&amp;B here tonight, and what could be their purpose tonight? They said they’d solve their problem with The Warlords, and after earlier, especially Romero in their own D&amp;B way, whatever that entails…

**Woodbridge:** It entails that they’ll do something cuntish then do everything in their power to get away with it.

Several fans shout at the two, to which the two hold their titles in their faces to gloat to them, as they eventually hit the ring, stepping up onto the apron, and in, as Dutch quickly grabs a mic from Maurice.

**Dutch:** Hello London, me and Blackwater in a few moments will be about to show you a special presentation!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Dutch:** It is a story of the strong overcoming the weak! Men going in and taking what they want, and getting it! Today, I will be playing the role of myself, and my good friend Louis, the role of Robert Warlock last week!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Oh jesus christ….

**Dutch:** Indeed! The brave man Louis has agreed to put his own body on the line, and be put in a crossface so tight, Warlock had as little chance of escaping it as Jizza Cwoabyn has a chance of becoming your Prime Minister!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Come on! Not in his own constituency! 

**Crowd:** FOR THE MOST! NOT THE LITTLE! FOR THE MOST! NOT THE LITTLE!

**Blackwater:** SHUT UP! WE ARE NOT DONE!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Dutch:** Thank you Louis! Now lets get to it! Get on the ground! Become Warlock!

Blackwater obliges, as he gets to the ground, stomach on the mat, as Dutch gets on the ground, and puts him in the crippler crossface!.....but not really, lightly putting his hands over Louis’s face as to barely even be touching him let alone hurting him.

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Of fucking course……

As Dutch has the “crossface” “applied” Blackwater beings to deliver ear destroying screams, as he frantically claws at Mark’s hands!

**Blackwater:** AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Oh god it hurts so much! Oh my god triple crown champ and two time AMUDOV winner The Mark Dutch you’re the best at submissions because I am in so much pain right now no wonder you beat us for the titles! In fact I think i’m gonna...i’m gonna-

[Just as Blackwater seems about to quit, Rise From The Ashes by STRIA blares over the speakers, as Robert Warlock comes from behind the curtain! Mic in hand!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wrhojx7ARo)

**Crowd:** YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

**Paisner:** Warlock not having it!

Dutch releases the “hold” as he grabs the mic, and begins to speak.

**Dutch:** Aw coming out on your own eh? Bold move there, i’m sure you’re confident after Romero nearly got us by himself, but he got lucky. You have no bat, you have no darkness, what can you do but walk into our bear trap, or run like a coward!

**Warlock:** Oh, don’t worry about me, i’m just out here to watch you two, I got different plans than attacking you two alone.

D&amp;B look confused as to why exactly Warlock is out here, as Warlock grabs a chair, and casually sits on the entranceway, as then…

**Paisner:** Oh my god oh my god, Romero’s running out from the audience! He’s got the bat!

**Crowd:** WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Romero jumps over the barricade, and quickly slides into the ring behind D&amp;B, as the two look around, paranoid from the sudden cheers, as they then turn around, and see Romero, leather jacket on, bat in hand!

**Paisner:** Oh this ain’t gonna end well for somebody.

Romero smiles, as D&amp;B both rush to double lariat him! But Romero ducks and runs through, Blackwater turning around quicker to face Romero, but he receives a bat shot to the side! Crumpling him, before a shot to the legs! Getting him to the mat!

**Crowd:** YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

Dutch tries to attack Romero, but Romero quickly turns around, and strike Dutch in the gut! Bending him over, before smashing the bat hard over Dutch’s back! Knocking him face first to the mat, as he holds at his back, gritting his teeth in pain!

**Crowd:** YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

**Paisner:** Romero taking D&amp;B out with the bat! Oh how sweet this has to be!

We see Warlock watching from his chair with a smile, as Romero looks down at Dutch, before placing a foot over his head!

**Crowd:** WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Putting his boot onto Dutch’s head! Just like they did last week to Warlock! He not only wants justice, he wants it to be poetic!

Romero smiles, as he takes his boot of off Dutch’s head, looks down at him again, before he raises his bat into the air!

**Paisner:** Oh my god, he could be about to strike that down onto Dutch’s head! 

Warlock’s smile on the stage turns to a sort of concern, seeming out of worry of Romero taking it too far, as he stands up, but does not move further, as Romero swings the bat down! But Blackwater pulls Dutch out the ring at the last moment! As Romero drives the bat into the mat! Driving a hole straight through it!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Oh god! He easily tore a big hole in the ring! That could’ve been Dutch’s head!

Romero pulls the bat out the hole, looking a bit frustrated, as Warlock quickly runs to the ring to calm him down, as Dutch and Blackwater jump over the barricade, and run out to escape! Romero looks out as Warlock points it out, as Warlock smiles at making them run, but Romero left looking a bit unsatisfied, as Warlock speaks again.

**Warlock:** Ladies and Gentlemen, D&amp;B, the tag team champions, have now left the building!

**Crowd:** WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Warlock takes in the crowd reaction, and the chance to finally be able to get one over D&amp;B, as he grabs Romero, as they then walk out, Warlock pointing to the crowd, as we fade away.

**Commercial**

We cut back into the ring, as we see Javier standing in the middle, mic in hand, ready to announce.

**Javier:** Ladies and Gentlemen, the following is a singles match set for one fall, and it is the MAIN EVENT of this evening!

**Crowd:** WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Javier:** Introducing first….

[Tommy’s Planet by CrazyEightyEight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsyV-1hHDvc) blasts through the speakers, as Joey McCarty busts out from behind the curtain! Baseball bat at his side, which he tosses and flips backwards, as his goonsquad come out from behind to flank him.

**Javier:** From Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, weighing in at 232 pounds, Joey McCarty!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** And here we see Joey coming down to the ring, an interesting few weeks for him after losing his world title, having savagely beaten down Appelbaum with a baseball bat while screaming some weird shit about baseball, and then helping his goons get a win against BBC after launching a baseball at Krieger! He’s shook up a lot by losing his title, but his confidence does not seem to be lacking in getting it back.

Joey hypes himself up on the ramp for a moment, before he charges down to the ring! Filled with more energy than usual, as he slides into the ring with speed! Before hopping up onto the second turnbuckle, and looking out, screaming various things at the crowd, before he hops off, and awaits his opponent. His goons taking a spot outside the ring near his corner

The lights cut to darkness, as [Root of All Evil by CFO$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cSZ3Vsugso) begins to play, a dark atmosphere overtaking the whole arena, as after about 30 seconds, Brodie finally appears on the entranceway. As we see him stare down Joey from the top of the entrance, as he then takes a moment to gather the feel of the crowd.

**Javier:** And introducing next, from Atlus, Arkansas, weighing in at 280 pounds, Brodie Hansen!

**Crowd:** YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

**Paisner:** And a man who’s also had an interesting time as of late, having a superviolent encounter with Brendan Byrne at AMUDOV, giving a great threat that if a few things went differently, could’ve ended with our now AMUDOV winner having been eliminated by Hansen there. Following that by retiring former foe Kaitlyn Jones, where he would stop Teddy Coronado after he began to attack her! And now, Teddy seems to be hellbent on bringing out the old darkness, and the old beast in Brodie, no matter how much Brodie wishes not to be that ever again.

Brodie takes a slow walk down to the ring, looking intensely focused on the match ahead of him, as he climbs up onto the stairs, and gets onto the apron, and just as he’s about to climb into the ring….before suddenly the lights come fully back on, as the heavy rock track is [replaced with Game Show music,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S623yzR6SY) as Teddy Coronado appears on the entranceway, adorned in a [pink, polka-dotted suit,](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GTCAdeooL._SX342_.jpg) as he makes his way to the ring with a twisted smile.

**Paisner:** And speaking of Teddy, here he comes interrupting Brodie’s entrance...can’t figure much good can come out of him being at ringside…

Teddy quickly makes his way down to the ring, as Brodie sighs, and steps into the ring, taking a spot in the corner, as Teddy yells and smiles at him, as he goes over to Joey’s corner with the goonsquad, who look completely creeped out by his presence, as Wong signals to both men in the ring if they wish to start, to which they both nod, as the bell is sounded!

**DING DING DING**

Brodie and Joey stare off, Joey bouncing around and looking confident with his goons and Teddy in his corner, as he walks over to a stoic Brodie in the corner, as he begins to shout at him.

**Joey:** Who the hell are you you eh? The shell of a shell of a man? When’s the last time you were world champ? You’re chasing a midcard title now! I was world champ just last month! And i’m gonna get it back, and have more title reigns that you ever had!

Brodie just stares in passive anger as Joey, before Joey’s confidence turns into complete cockiness, as he slaps Brodie in the face!

**Crowd:** OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**Paisner:** I...i’m not sure he realizes what he’s just done.

Broide nonchalantly raises his hand to his face, as Joey gets in his face, daring him to do something, as Brodie slowly turns his face to stare in anger into Joey, as Joey’s cocky smile begins to quickly wear off.

**Woodbridge:** Oh I think he does now though.

What he just did sinks in on Joey, as he begins to back off, Brodie walking towards him to keep closing the distance, before Joey just tries to run! But Brodie catches one of his arms, and pulls him back in to take his head off with a short arm clothesline!

**Crowd:** YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

**Paisner:** Brodie decapitating Joey! He’s not quite the same man he once was, but he’s still a dangerous one for sure.

Joey looks hurt on the mat, but he has no time to register the pain, before Brodie kicks him in the side to turn him on his stomach, [before getting on the ground, wrapping his arms around Joey, before tossing him back hard onto the mat with a Bul-Plex!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZTreL1o0zE)

**Crowd:** OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Joey clenches his teeth in pain, and holds at his back, rolling over onto his stomach, as Brodie moves back over, grabs Joey’s waist again, then flings him with a second bul-plex to Joey! Landing him even harder this time!

**Paisner:** Christ! Reminds me of when he won the world title against Harvey! He started off by tossing him with a few of those! Teddy may not have brought the full beast back yet, but he may be onto something if this is any sign.

Joey once again holds at his back, rolling around all over in pain, as Brodie then picks him, and whips him into a corner! Joey hits the buckles hard, as Brodie then rushes him, and pounds him in the chest with a clubbing corner clothesline! Knocking all the air out of Joey, as then sinks down a tiny bit in the corner. Brodie then rushes back to the opposite corner, before rushing Joey once again, and impacting his face with a stiff corner big boot straight to it!

**Crowd:** OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**Paisner:** Brodie really taking it to Joey! He seems lined up for an independent title shot, and if he beats the #1 contender to the world title, a shot there could be in his future as well!

Joey falls out from the corner to the mat, as Brodie drags him to the center of the ring, before he runs the ropes, and comes back with a big boy senton! But Joey moves out the way! Brodie landing on his back! Joey then scrambles to his feet, and rolls over to Brodie into a jackknife pin before Brodie can stand!

**Painser:** Jackknife! Joey looking to steal one! The count!

**1!**

**2!** No! Kickout from Brodie!

The two then get to their feet, Brodie a bit faster having took less damage, as he swings a short arm lariat at Joey! But Joey quickly ducks, and as Brodie’s momentum spins him a bit, Joey takes the chance to schoolboy him from behind!

**1!**

**2!** No! Kickout from Brodie!

Joey then this time quickly gets to his feet, as Brodie is trying to stand up, Joey quickly running behind Brodie, hooking his arms from behind, before sliding him down into a quick backslide!

**1!**

**2!** No! Kickout from Brodie!

Joey quickly gets to his feet once again, as Brodie is only a kneel, Joey quickly grabbing Brodie’s head and a leg to roll him into a small package!

**1!**


**2!**

**No!** Kickout from Brodie!

Joey pops back up once again, but now in a panic, and seemingly out of roll up ideas for the moment, he grabs Brodie’s arm, and goes to whip him into the ropes! But Brodie reverses and whips Joey instead! Joey makes the split second decision to slide out the ring rather than stay in with Brodie, as he goes to hide behind his goonsquad!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Joey calls together the squad, as they huddle up to discuss strategy! But Brodie has none of this, as he steps out the ring, and charges towards the huddle! Joey quickly boots it out, but much of the goons get trucked to the ground, as Joey runs around to ring to evade Brodie! Brodie giving chase! The two run around the ring for a moment, before Brodie reverses course while Joey won’t notice, as Joey continues to run, but runs near the path of Brodie! Stopping just before he runs into him! Joey then runs back the opposite way, Brodie being close enough he decides to give chase again, but Joey then quickly swerves back around to Brodie, and catches him with a surprise dropkick to the legs!

**Paisner:** Joey managing to lure the beast in! And while he’s no small man, he’s smaller than Brodie, giving him the agility for quick turns!

Brodie holds at his leg, but is still standing, but Joey looks to quickly change that, as he grabs the limped Brodie, and tosses him straight into the barricade! He then quickly runs back into the ring, as he yells at Wong!

**Joey:** COUNT HIM! COUNT HIM!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Joey trying to steal it with a count out now! Wong starts it!

**1!**  **2!** **3!**

Brodie begins to stir on the barricade, holding at his back, as Wong continues the count!

**4!** **5!** **6!**

Brodie fully gets and up begins to go back towards the ring, but suddenly, all 4 members of the get in front of Brodie and stop him!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**8!**

So Brodie punches them down one by one! Them not fighting back due to fear of causing a DQ!

**9!** **10!** **11!** **12!**

All goons are down, as Brodie then goes back to getting in the ring, but then Teddy quickly hops in front of him!

**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**14!**

Teddy stops Brodie for a moment, daring him to hit him, daring him to snap for getting in his way!

**15!** **16!** **17!**

But Brodie just pushes him out the way!

**18!** No! Brodie gets into the ring!

**Paisner:** He was nearly stopped several times, but Brodie still beating the count!

**Crowd:** YAYY-- BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

The cheers are then cut off, as Joey begins to stomp Brodie as soon as he slides in, laying them in as hard as he can, before grabbing Brodie’s legs, and beginning to drops an elbow on them! He then gets back up, keeping hold on the legs, as he drops another elbow into Brodie’s leg! Then another one! And another one! He then begins to drop them even more rapidly! The point of his elbow tearing at Brodie’s leg!


**Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Joey destroying Brodie’s legs! Not only hurting the big man’s base, but also weakening his legs to he’ll be more vulnerable should Joey go for his sharpshooter!

Joey then stands up, as he stops dropping elbows onto the leg, but instead, just begins to throw down some vicious stomps straight to it, before he runs the ropes, and comes back in with a baseball slide into Brodie’s leg! 

**Crowd:** OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Brodie tends to his leg, his face a mix of pain and anger, as Joey’s momentum carries him out the ring, where a recovering goonsquad cheer him on, as Joey gets back to grab Brodie’s leg, and slams it down onto the apron!

**Crowd:** OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Brodie grits his teeth a bit, but tries to not look too pained to maintain his pride, as Joey then grabs at both his legs from the outside, before pulling Brodie into the ringpost, as he takes one of his legs, and slams it once again! Brodie’s leg bouncing off the ringpost!

Joey grabs Brodie’s legs again, wrapping them around the ringpost, as he wraps his own legs through, before falling back into a ringpost figure four! Joey screaming as he wrenches in the hold as tight as he can, a viciousness in his eyes, as Brodie grits his teeth, but pride keeps forces him to not make any noise of pain, despite his legs being put into an unnatural angle against a hard surface like the ringpost, as Wong begins to count off Joey’s hold!

I have to go to school, work an internship with a charity organization for work experience and tutor kids for a living. I also have to study for loads school exams and do homework. Mom's also pretty sick so I have to take care of her. I love my jobs. I hate school. It's too excruciating to stay there for 8 hours and wake up early in the morning. Everyone around me is either a hooligan or a zombie. I have no time to study for so many exams. It's everyday! 

I used to get invited to parties and I had a lot of friends, but ever since the stress from junior year kicked in, everyone thinks I'm a creep because I have little time to talk or groom myself decently. I mean, I do shower and brush teeth, but I don't have time to brush my hair or cut it or iron my clothes. To be honest, most people kind of look creepy in my class.

This is the average life of most teenagers. It's pretty depressing. Especially when the school system sucks and you're poor. 

I could let go of all the weight, but you could picture what catastrophe would happen, right? Especially at this age.

(Then you get people bragging about how they worked 3 jobs, walked 10 miles a day to school and work and got good grades while paying his own tuition and supporting his parents 35 years ago at the age of 18. Yes, I mean my father. And I say he's bragging because our family wouldn't be in this situation if he were to be telling the truth.

 I just wish my father and his friends would stop making fun of me and understand me. )

 I just wasted 15 minutes and it felt good ranting. Life is just too fast for me. I wonder if I should quit life. Lemme drop to sleep. I just hope I graduate quick. The workforce seems much better than school.

Tldr, I'm just whining"
7alkr6,3,2017-11-03,National Firm Audit Staff vs. F500 FLDP,KreedZ06,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7alkr6/national_firm_audit_staff_vs_f500_fldp/,"Hey guys,

So I just received an offer today for a F500 Financial Leadership Development Position and I currently also have an offer from the national firm I interned at this past busy season. I double majored in accounting and finance and am currently taking upper level accounting classes to be CPA eligible this winter. Some information about both positions:

FLDP: 58k starting out, 14 weeks of general training and then several years of rotating through the different parts of the finance department. Pros: decent starting salary, F500 company, great exposure to different areas of the finance department, I get to see which area I like the most, and the senior management seems like a fun group of people to work with. Cons: in a shrinking industry(traditional retail), not sure if they will provide any assistance when it comes to CPA exam costs, department is more horizontal, would be harder to move up on a consistent basis.

National Firm: 55k starting out, I will be doing mostly audit.
Pros: will pay for CPA exam costs and has a bonus for passing the exam, Top 10 firm in terms of revenue, great group of leaders that are a lot of fun to be around based on my intern experience. Even though the starting salary is a bit lower than the FLDP, public accounting in general provides more vertical mobility and more accelerated pay increases compared to industry from what I've heard. Cons: does not work on any public clients, busy season, less varied experience. 

I was also considering working at the national firm for a year or 2 and then potentially doing a transition to big 4 as an experienced hire down the toad. I never went through recruiting for Big 4 as an undergrad, so it would be nice to potentially get that on my resume. Would greatly appreciate any input ya'll have based on what you've seen from your experience."
7allyv,1,2017-11-03,Should I code in Java?,csmie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7allyv/should_i_code_in_java/,"Despite having experience and a portfolio of projects in many languages, I've been using Python to study and code in internship interviews, but I've seen job descriptions or HackerRank that seem to look down on the language. At times, in interviews, I get a sense that people think I'm less of a programmer because I choose Python.

IMO, any language should be respected. Computer science is not about a specific language, and the best software engineers should be able to learn and adapt quickly given that a job demands switching a language.

I am tempted to switch to Java for interviews since some companies tend to be snobs about this language and cannot be convinced that you can switch gear on the job to code in Java if you code in Python, and the ones that aren't snobs about it, don't care anyways. That said, I don't like Java. But, a lot of local jobs demand Java knowledge (even if the actual job does not require it or would require a variety of languages :D). If given the choice besides Python, I would go with C++ since I use it for personal projects, but again, not many jobs that I'd go for require C++.

Please advise."

&gt; ""Who Exposed the pedo network within H wood?

&gt; You can't answer the above but will laugh once disclose details.""

Pedowood and the left have a long history of protecting their own from would-be whistle blowers. This is how Weinstein, and others, have been getting away with this for decades. But why didn't they even attempt to cover for Weinstein this time? Did he diddle someone that would be considered ""off limits""?

What would it take to make one ""off limits"" to the likes of Harvey Weinstein? I imagine one would have to be a king or at least their offspring. Anyone come to mind that might be off limits?

How about Malia Obama?

I did some digging to see what I could see. Turns out that when the Weinstein story broke at [*The New Yorker""](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) on Oct 10 2017, the investigation into Weinstein had already been underway for 10 about months according to the article.

Coincidentally, is was announced on Jan 19 that 18 year old Malia Obama is set to intern for Weinstein in Feb (about 10 months prior). I wonder how the interview went...

As far as laughing about the details disclosed, there would be no shortage of irony if this theory is correct considering Malik's brother pushing the very fake 1 in 5 women raped on campus nonsense."

Now I’m starting to doubt whether I want to work for them (I have no experience in the industry, and am kinda desperate for an internship/coop although I would heavily prefer a Summer internship but have gotten 0 interviews for internships). Why did he keep emphasizing that they were a small company in the interview? Do I still go to the in person interview or could I send an email and cancel?"

I'm currently a mechanical engineering student in my junior year of my degree. I want to create an updated resume for myself because I plan on applying for co-op internships in the summer and I also want to apply for a promotion at my part time job for next semester. That being said, I'm trying to decide what would be best to include on my resume and I'm having trouble deciding if I want to include some work experience I've had with my dad.

Basically my dad is an HVAC technician and all-around handyman with a good number of certifications. So usually a few times every year a family friend or someone of the like will pay my dad to do a private job for them and my dad will pay me to help him for the day. These jobs have included a variety of things including installing and replacing outside air conditioning units, boilers, water heaters, gas pipe for an outside grill, and really anything you'd see in an average basement. Keep in mind that all of this work is under the table, so it's not like I'm doing official work for my dad's business (He doesn't own one).

I think that this might be valuable to include on my resume as a MechE student because almost all of it is hands-on HVAC work, which is definitely a prospective career field for me. So I have to ask, would it be worth including? And if so maybe how would I word this on a resume without making an employer read it and think ""Aww, daddy's little helper."" Would it be wise to list it as working for my father's business even though that's a slight stretch of the truth?

Any opinions are much appreciated! Thanks for your help "

Everybody was counting down. “10, 9, 8” But I was silent. I was preparing for a journey. But little did I know that for this journey, no preparation was needed. Because you were never ready for this.

In 2013 I was 14 years old. I didn’t know what life had in stock for me. I was just a stupid kid. I have been overweight whole my life, I suffer from social anxiety whole my life. And since 2012 (I was 13 at the time) I suffer from depression.

Back to new year’s eve 2013. The journey I was going on was: getting my life together. I wanted to fix these 3 thing:

-overweight
-social anxiety
-depression

So in 2014 I got a gym membership. Went 3 time a week, run 2 time a week and boxed 1 time in the week. I ate healthier and was happier. In 6 months I lost 44 pounds (20 kilo’s) in 6 months my depression and social anxiety fated and I was happier as ever. I got a weekend job. And I did great in school.

So the first 6 months of 2014 were great! The only thing I struggled with was religion. I grew up a an atheist but you see, I was so despaired back in 2012/2013 because some terrible, terrible things happened to me. I was looking for something that gave me hope. So I started praying. Praying for god to help me, praying to save me. So the success I had in the first 6 months of 2014, I thanked god for that. My prayers were answered!

Until…
Until something happened to me. Something I still can’t explain to this day. I guess it was a major depression attack if those even exist. But I felt dead inside. No joy, no love, no anger, only fear. Fear is what I lived with for the rest of 2014 and 2015. 1,5 year of nothing. Al the weight I lost came twice as fast back, I stopped working out, stopped socializing with my friends. I went to new school but quit after 2 months because I had no motivation whatsoever.

So in 2015 I was a 16 year old boy with no school, no friends. Only depression, social anxiety and overweight.

I started to work 4 times a week. I felt lonely. And I was sick of living. I looked in the mirror one time. Saw something I wasn’t ready for. My hair. I was balding. 16 years… I mean common. If all the other stuff wasn’t enough already.

I worked till the next school year started, worked out a little but the social anxiety was too much so I didn’t go to the gym much.

So skipping forward to September 2016. I was a 17 year old boy who is fat, bald and suffers from social anxiety and depression. Going to his new school, with new students and new teachers. *sigh*

After 4 years I was at the same place I was in 2013. But only bald

But,
before I went to school, me, my parents, my sister and 2 other families went on a holiday to Spain for 2 weeks. For me this was taking a break from my life to experience what it was to always have people around you. And luckily all these people were nice. But something happened in Spain. I fell in love with this beautiful Spanish girl. I know, I know. “how can you fall in love with someone you never met?”. But when I looked at her. My hearth started to work again. For once I felt happy again by just seeing her. I felt something I never experienced before. I wanted to talk to her but deep down I knew my changes were 0%. And knowing that killed me. It really did. For the rest of the holiday I was dead inside. I can’t even express how awful that feeling was. You have to experience it to understand it.

I never wanted to have that feeling again. Like never!

On the last day of the holiday I decided I need to talk to her. Otherwise I couldn’t live with myself. So I waited like 2 hours and I saw her in the lobby. I approached here and I talked to her. We had a good chat and she kissed me on the cheek. We said goodbye to each other and left. Keep in mind this was the first time we talked and after that I felt amazing.

So the holiday was over and went back to my old live. And believe me, from being with all your friends and family for 2 weeks to alone in your room makes you realize how pathetic you really are.

So because I never wanted to feel the impossible love pain ever again and don’t want to be alone no more. I once again decided to do something.

Going back to school was hard the first few months but I managed. Made some new friends, started going to the gym again. Lost some pounds. Still had depression and anxiety. Started talking to god again. Hoping for a response. I was living life with no hopes so I wouldn’t get disappointed. Made it past my first year of this new school. And started my second year. The first half of the second year you have to do an internship.

September 2017,
still have the goals +1:

-losing weight
-cure depression
-cure social anxiety
-cure baldness (if possible)

Starting my internship at a multimedia company. Having a blast here. Nice people, fun work. I was thinking life was going to get easier. But I was wrong. My employer said he hired a new intern for administration and she was starting next week. I didn’t think much of it. So the next week approaches and I was sitting behind my laptop at my internship working on a project. The new girl came in. I was the only one in the office atm. I introduced myself and we talked about our schools and life. Just the regular stuff. My employer was the only one besides me that works in this office but because he was never there I spend the whole day with the new girl alone in the office. And the next day, and the next day. And this went on for 2 weeks.

And believe me spending so much time alone with someone else you really get to know each other. We started watching movie trailer together of upcoming horror films. We went for lunch at a fast food restaurant together. It was like having a close friend. At one point she started talking about her family, about her 1 year old nice that wouldn’t stop crying so she screamed louder than her niece so she would stop. And about her mother that doesn’t really understand sarcasms so she would always be sarcastic about stuff to her. As she was telling these stories I was just smiling and staring at her. And at this moment I knew that I liked her.

The first time after this “traumatic” moment in Spain, I fell in love once again. But then I realized the pain I had in Spain. The pain of knowing you had a 0% change with a girl you really like, of a girl you almost love. I didn’t want to feel this pain again. All the memories came back to me. I remembered I was on this journey to get my life straight. The things I want to cure.

So I stopped with the excuses. I accepted that I’m fat, I accepted that I’m bald, I accepted that I’m depressed and I accepted I that have social anxiety. BUT I WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT I WILL HAVE TO LIVE THIS WAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

So I wake up at 6A.M, go to the gym, try to eat healthy be a nice person and cure everything I have.

I lost 44 pounds again (20kilo’s) my depression and anxiety were slowly fading again. And I was ready to ask her out. But the next day, she didn’t show up at work (internship). I thought maybe she was sick, but she didn’t show up for the whole week. Or the next week.

I never asked for her number because we would always chat in real life. I asked my employer and he said she isn’t coming anymore.

I am still waiting for the girl to come back. But I doubt it. It’s been a few weeks and I still don’t know why she left. We had a great time together as long as it last.

So here we are. At the middle mark of my internship. 44 pounds (20 kilo’s) down, 44 pounds more to go. This morning I felt amazing. Almost like my depression was gone. I stated smiling at girls on the street and they smile back. I have more confidence. Still bald though.

I felt happy again, but once again as I think everything was alright the following happened:

I was standing in the office with some people at my internship. Someone commented on somebody that he gained weight (not on me). We all laughed about it because it was mend as a joke because the guy was kinda buff. Next he made his belly bigger and said he needed to go back to the gym and we all laughed again. But while he made his belly bigger he said this to me: “Now I look like you” and we all laughed again. I was laughing on the outside and made in not a big of a deal. But I was dying on the inside. I lost 44 pounds. And you make a fat joke? Why? And after that he asked why I was balding on this young age. I mean common man, give me a break. I WISH I KNEW!

I’ve been on this journey for almost 4 years now. Twice my hearth has been broken and I know it was my own fault for not being good enough. I lost 88 pounds in total but also gained 44. Twice I came close to curing depression and social anxiety but it always comes back. And balding will be the death of me if I won’t cure it soon.

My journey is not over. I’ve learned allot in these 4 years. But not enough. My journey ends if I can fix these 4 things:

-overweight
-depression
-social anxiety
-baldness

I will get up at 6 A.M.
I will go to the gym every day
I will eat healthy
I will cure my depression
I will cure my social anxiety
I will cure my baldness
And my hearth will be broken again
until 1 time it doesn’t
either by me fixing these 4 things
or by me ending me"

I have several trauma's and as a result cptsd. 

So I'm studying social work and I need to do an internship. My internship is with children who have development/behavioral disorders. This is my thirth year of taking part in an internship with these children and nothing ever happend, until yesterday. We usually work with 5 children in one group. This time there were 3 children and 1 mentor (and then me ofcourse). I didn't know these children yet so I didn't know the right way to handle them in case something went wrong, except for what I've learned in the previous years.

A child was misbehaving and I tried to correct him, the mentor had his hands full on another child who cant handle stress and is unpredictable. So I had to work with an agressieve child I didn't even know.

The child pulled my hair for 4 times, I held his wrists so he couldnt hurt me, then another mentor came in (the mentor I was with messaged him to help). The child stopped pulling my hair, I stood up and then he kicked me two times. The mentors took the kids to another area and I burst into tears. I wanted to cry like a child.

Later I had a chat with the mentor who came over to help me, (still crying) he said that this can happen to anyone and I told him about my cptsd. He said that it was quite a normal reaction. He made me feel better and said I could go home. But today he called me. We're going to talk tuesday to see how to move forward. He said that it might be to soon for me to do this internship.

Need advice.",CaptainGeogoris,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7an7iq/graduating_college_and_hate_my_major_but_need_to/,"Hello all, thanks for taking the time to click and listen to my woes.  
_  
So... I'm 21 years old studying Computer Science in some school that won't make you swoon for being impressed. I'm graduating in May 2018 and I am petrified because I hate my major. I absolutely do not want to seek a job in it when I graduate, I know that for a fact. Now, I know what you're thinking ""A little late to decide that huh?"" The answer to that is obviously, yes. But I've felt this way for a year and a half and held it in to see if it passed, and it hasn't and that option is not helping me with my situation.  
_  
This has been stressing me out for that past year and a half. It got so bad that I went to my school's counseling center because the stress of hating this major, working two jobs (one being a CS-major-pertinent internship I hate), and being a full time student, was burning me out in ways that I've never experienced. The Counseling Center was helpful, but limited. They said what I guess most of you will i.e. ""stick with it and try to use the degree in another way"". They also recommended I go to the career services at my school, which I made an appointment for this next week.  
_  
But getting advice like that doesn't help me come up with a way to pay the bills. I'll be roughly $100,000 in debt, which my parents will help with, but I don't want to be a loser and have them pay for most (or any) of the debt if I can help it.  
_  
Any ideas? I am interested in graphic design, movie editing, digital media production, and music; all of which I have prior knowledge and experience in. I'm even taking the school's graphic design class just to mix things up. My school has absolutely no majors for these kind of areas, the closest thing would be Communications, which is basically useless and far too late to switch to.

Thank you for listening and I appreciate any feedback, no matter how critical!"

INT. - INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - ECHO CREEK HOSPITAL - MIDNIGHT
	

MOON &amp;nbsp;
Isn’t the bad guy always the bad guy?
	
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
Not what I meant.

 
Janna begins to disassemble her firearm and begins to clean it.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
You have to clarify because Lord Kronus isn’t just some “bad guy.”


After a short pause.


JANNA &amp;nbsp;
Told you he wasn’t gonna understand...	


MARCO &amp;nbsp;
O.K, you’re a time traveler representing your past, which entangles my past, but isn’t the same universe?
				

MOON &amp;nbsp;
Listen, boy, you are part of a future that was never meant to happen. The “bad guy” was banished to this universe, but he seeks to get back to his own universe. This is a universe that was never meant to exist. A hollow shell, lost in time.


On the lobbies whiteboard, Marco jots down a few more notes.
				
MOON(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;
(LONG INHALE)
I was sent from the past of the universe that was occurring properly.
Janna sticks out her tongue and raspberries while still paying attention to her gun. 


MOON(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;
Sent, because if the occurrence of this universe isn’t resolved in a timely manner, then both universes will cease to exist. One will be destroyed out of paradox, and the other will be under control of The Lord Kronus. My universe.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
Got it. The way you said it just now is so much easier than how you were explaining it.
			
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			That’s because I was forced to explain it wrong.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			HA! Hey, Queeny how was time-traveling?

				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			I vomited profusely.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Gross.


Marco fell in the chair between Moon and Janna.

				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Whatever. Time travel is bullshit. Just ruins things anyway.


Enter Doctor Dorian. All immediately rise except Janna.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Doctor! What’s the news?
				

DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			Well, she’s stable. Uh, depending on what you consider stable.
				

MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Are her vitals fine then?
				
DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			Vitals are also a small complication. She’s just, healing...at an alarming rate.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Mewnian blood.

DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			Mewnian?

Marco looks perplexed at Moon.

MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Uh, don’t worry about it. It’s just a small island off of the Mediterranean. 
				
DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			No, it’s not.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Yes, it 

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			No, it’s not.

				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Who gave you a badge?!

			
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			I hate the spread of misinformation involving geography.


The doctor flings his arms up and shrugs at Marco.

			
DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
But, yeah, you can see her now. I guess. I don’t know? There aren't any protocols about patients that heal miraculously.

MARCO &amp;nbsp;
First bit of good news today. &amp;nbsp;
								
CUT TO: &amp;nbsp;

INT. - HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - ECHO CREEK HOSPITAL - CONT. &amp;nbsp;

The group are walking through the hallway of rooms that hang left and right. Echoes of people and doctors echo throughout.

 
DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			Yes, her wounds were closing as we were removing the arrows. Never seen anything like that in my life.

MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Couldn’t it of just been the cut closing because it was an arrow. I’m sure you haven't worked on many arrows before.

DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			You’d be surprised. Truthfully, though, not that many arrows in a single person. Also, they weren't just closing because there was once a foreign body lodged. They were truly mending themselves.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			She must have learned a few new tricks while she was away, eh, Marco. You need someone with experience.
				

MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Not very much new. Just what most queens learn in times of war.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			God, you’re no fun.

The quartet walk past an open door.

MRS. PINES &amp;nbsp;
			  (FROM ONE OF THE ROOMS)
			I told you it wasn’t a good idea for him to intern with those two.
	
DIPPER &amp;nbsp;
I told you, Mom. I’m fine. It’ll wear off in a few days.

Janna pokes her head inside while the rest continue walking.

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			   (FROM BEHIND)
			Woah, gnarly. 

Janna runs up.

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Dude, guys, did you see that kid's-

The Dr. stops next to a closed door.

MOON &amp;nbsp;
			(HOLDING JANNA BACK WITH ONE HAND)
			Shhh, we’re here.

Marco begins to tear up.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Marco, do you need a moment?

Marco ducks his head down and smiles.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			I’ve waited a lifetime.

Janna rolls her eyes.

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
 		   	   (UNDER HER BREATH)
			Someone shoot me.

DR. DORIAN &amp;nbsp;
			(SOBBING)I’ll give you all a moment.


Marco grabs the door handle and slowly begins to open the door. Star looks over to see the trio while she was playing with the elevation settings on the bed. There is a long pause while the three are confronted with a laid-up Star.
				
STAR BUTTERFLY &amp;nbsp;
(HAPPILY)WOOHOO! I got visitors!
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Star!

Marco runs over to give Star an awkward lay-down-hug. Star, takes Marco by the collar and whispers in her ear. 
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
	They gave me some Earth medicine and now I feel great. (LAUGHING) WEEEEE!

Marco begins to look unamused.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Come on in guys, she’s soaring right. They got her drugged from here to Mars.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Well, that’s good, then.


Moon comes in and sits down next to the bed.


MOON(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;
			Dear, we’ve never met before, but do you know who I am?

Star looks closely at Moon and for a moment looks as if she has a revelation.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			No. But I know who she is!

Star points to Janna.

STAR(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;
			Janna!
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			What’s up, girl! Everything’s real' weird, right now.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			I know. (WHISPER) I almost died.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Dear, look at me. Do. You. Know. Me? It’s imperative that I know.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			I told you “no”, lady.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Star, who is the only person that could possibly have Mewnian Marks and has light blue hair?
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			Aunt Etheria?
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			I am your mother, Star. I just don’t know it yet.

Moon smiles at Star.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			NAH!

Star flicks her hands forward. 
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			I was sent here, through a series of powerful incantations, to fix the space-time continuum. 
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			(FROWNING) But you’re dead. I saw you die. I miss you, though.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			I’m sure I miss you too, Star, but I’m not that Moon. I’m the moon from your past. The correct past.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Wait, does that mean that the Moon we knew in our universe would have known all about this?
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			I don’t know? I can’t tell you either way.

Star begins pulling out the I.V’s in her arm. Alarms begin going off. She gets up and nearly trips. 
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Star, what are you doing?
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			All of you guys don’t know what you’re doing. So, I’m gonna do it first.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Uh, that might have made more sense in your mind, Star.

The clattering of feet are coming from down the hallway.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Whatever it is we gotta do it fast.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
Thought, I had time for a little vacation with my buddy, but I guess not?

Star flicks her hands up and her hospital gown transforms into a very posh-style pants and jacket combo, but one of her arm sleeves were too long. She corrects it.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Don’t queens wear dresses anymore?
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			Not, my thing.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Come on! Let’s get the hell outta here.

The four begin darting out the door.

NURSE 1 &amp;nbsp;
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?!

JANNA &amp;nbsp; 
Sorry, but we got a universe to save.
	
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
And a queen to protect.
							
SMASH CUT TO: 



INT. - HALLWAY - ECHO CREEK - NIGHT(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;


In an isolated part of the hospital, the quartet come cascading and sliding around one the corners of the hallway. Then proceed to lead Star down the corridor; meanwhile, an avalanche of nightshift nurses are hot on their heels.


JANNA &amp;nbsp;
Hey, why are we running?
	
MOON &amp;nbsp;
Aren’t they going to kill us if they catch us?
	
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
No, they just want us to sign some release forms.
	
STAR &amp;nbsp;
We’re running for old times sake.
	
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
We’re back, baby.

The party are huffing while they still run for the exit.
				

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Well let’s get to my cruiser and we can figure out where we’re going after we leave.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			Sounds fun! Janna, you’re a cop!
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			I know, right!? I’m kinda over it.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			What about your job Janna. You gotta be breaking all kinds of laws, right now?
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Yeah, but I got a magical princess from another dimension to protect. They can consider this my two-weeks notice plus a sovereign package.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Yep, we’re doing this!


The four run up to Janna cruiser and proceed to hop in. Janna starts the engine and they begin to flee the scene.

INT. - JANNA’s CRUISER - EARLY MORNING(CONT.)
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			We’re on the lamb, now. So how are we getting to Mewni?
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			Don’t know? When I came here I was in the middle of a battle and was just teleported.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			Alright...I guess we're gonna just keep driving until we run out of gas and we’ll see what we do ‘til then.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			How much gas did you got in this clunker?
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp; 
			Quarter tank.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Oh. I guess we pretty much need to immediately start brainstorming, then.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Why? What happened?
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			We have almost no gas. We’ll probably just get outside the city limits.
				
MOON &amp;nbsp; 
			That’ll give us enough time.
				
MARCO &amp;nbsp;
			Not trying to be rude, your heinous, but how do you figure? 
				
MOON &amp;nbsp;
			We have two of the most powerful spellcasters ever born inside the same carriage. We’ll figure something out.


Moon smiles at Star.


MOON(CONT.) &amp;nbsp;
			We’ll open our own.
				
STAR &amp;nbsp;
			Yeah, Butterflies for life.


Star holds up her hand to give a high-five. Moon just stares at it.


MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Uh, no.

Star, high-fives her own hand, lightly.
				
JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			I’ve got a really good feeling about all of this, and it isn’t just Marco. &amp;nbsp;


As the cruiser is driving into the outskirts of Echo Creek we: &amp;nbsp;


				
							CUT TO: CREDITS


STINGER SCENE&amp;nbsp;

FADE IN: &amp;nbsp;

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
			So, which one of you are queen?

STAR AND MOON &amp;nbsp;
			(SIMULTANEOUSLY) I am.


Both Moon and Star look at each other competitively. 
				

MOON &amp;nbsp;
			Let’s not do this. I am active queen. I have higher seniority. I was born first.
STAR &amp;nbsp;
But I’m an adult.


MOON &amp;nbsp;
Dear, you also started a civil war and had the entire kingdom collapse.

STAR &amp;nbsp;
(QUIETLY)
It wasn’t my fault.

MARCO &amp;nbsp;
Point: Moon.

STAR &amp;nbsp;
Shut it, Marco.

JANNA &amp;nbsp;
I will pull over this cruiser, right now.


After a moment of sitting in silence, Star waves her hand quickly and forms a crown. Moon points her finger and a sticky note appears on the crown that reads “Co-Queen”.

Are there any summer programs that would be beneficial for me or even a way to get an internship as someone who doesn't have much experience? Thank you!"
7anblo,1,2017-11-03,Christianity and Social Mobility,UGDon,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/7anblo/christianity_and_social_mobility/,"Hi All,

I'm a student from the UK and started going to church again earlier this year after a couple of years away from the faith.

 As a short background, I grew up in a Pentecostal Christian home with my Mum and Dad both ""Pastors"". In hindsight, it would appear that my siblings and I were taught a brand of Christianity that served whatever narrative my parents wanted to push at the time. Furthermore, my parents both come from difficult backgrounds - with not much in the way of examples of positive familial relationships - and this manifested itself through a family built on lies and really poor communication.

 Now, social status has always been a major insecurity of mine. Due to my sheltered upbringing, it was something I didn't have to confront until I moved away to university but it has troubled me since. 

 I consider myself working class - my parents both emigrated to the UK in the late eighties and did a variety of low paid jobs when they first arrived. However, this was made further unclear by the fact my parents both held a particular status among our little church community. We always lived in a decent area and my life didn't appear too different to that of my friends from Middle Class backgrounds. Again, the protective nature of my upbringing meant that I didn't think to question how Mum and Dad earned a living and where we stood socially.

 Fast forward to now and the loss of my mother has unearthed a variety of lies. It has transpired that we were borderline struggling and that my Mum did her best to convey the opposite to her sisters back home - whom she frequently fought with. 

 Anyway, I'm in the final year of an Economics degree and until a couple of years ago was well on the path to working in the Financial sector. After trying a few internships - and hating them - I became disillusioned with my chosen field and the career path it was leading me (and plenty of my friends) down. I decided to take a year out and asked some serious questions of my faith, my purpose and what I stood for.

 As a second generation immigrant, I'm constantly sold this narrative that I need to work hard to a secure a good job before jumping onto the property ladder and securing a future for my family. Given the ambiguous nature of our social situation, I never felt this urgently but kind of went along with it. Now, with the full understanding of where we stand, I still find it hard to motivate myself to chase a big job in the City etc.

The conflict arises when I have conversations with friends from similar backgrounds, who seem to have a certain fire in their belly' relating to a desire to transcend our social status. I sometimes feel guilty for not feeling the same way and wonder if I would have felt the same had my parents been more open about their struggles.

As trivial as the issue of social class may appear, it has weighed heavy on my heart recently. This led me to discuss the matter with someone from my new church. They did their best to answer my questions but I ended up feeling even more confused than when I started. In summary, they advised that the idea of pursuing the best job, then the best house possible, before finding a church was wrong and that we should be navigating in the opposite direction. Instead, the focus should be on rooting oneself in a caring, bible-teaching church family before finding a job that would allow me to sustain a living in the area to serve in my church community.

I agree. However, I can't help but feel guilty for holding worldly ambitions. (I think I'm answering my questions as I write this out but  I'll post anyway). For example, it's my dream to go and study for a Masters degree in African History. However, I was told by this friend from Church that the pursuit of a degree (and the social mobility that could occur as a result) is only to look great in other people's eyes and that my comfort should only be in the reconciliation with God through Christ. Again, I agree but boy is it a hard pill to swallow!

So I guess my questions are:

- How should being a Christian inform the career decisions I make?
- Can a true Christian have worldly ambitions?
- Are Christianity and social mobility compatible or is social mobility just another form of idolatry?

Apologies for the long-winded question - I needed to clear my mind to get to the root of what I wanted to ask...

Would appreciate any sort of advice/thoughts! Thanks for reading :)

TL;DR Come from a poor background; confusion over whether 

Disclaimer:

- I recognise that my emphasis on social class as a defining element of my character is a sad lens to view the world through but at this stage it is something I can't help. It is something I am willing to tackle through prayer and hard work.
- Please note, I'm not suggesting that education's sole purpose is social mobility. I believe quite the opposite: education presents the beautiful prospect of us increasing our understanding of the world but I'm slowly starting to realise that this needs to done with a grounding in God's word.
- Feel free to pull me up on any flaws in the way I think... I'm rediscovering Christ again and am all for constructive criticism!"

I'm a junior in college. Basically, I screwed up big time the first two years - 2.6 GPA so far. I took the spring semester off of sophomore year I know it's bad, I get it. I'm a math major btw. 

I plan to take P in January though. 
I want to be an actuary though. Yes, I know some people will discourage it, but I do love this career path very much. 

So I really need some advice for what to do this summer. I'm worried I won't get any internships in time because of my academic record and because I do not have an exam passed yet. And if I do not get an internship, I might not have a job next year as a senior, and might be destined to live in my parent's basement. 

As you can see I'm in a HUGE crisis and I need a way succeed. ANY advice on how to move forward is appreciated because I have no idea how to. Hell, even if someone who comments gives a specific course of action for me that would be appreciated, I just want to get my sh** together ASAP.

I'm having a lot of trouble deciding which internship to accept, so do you guys have any thoughts? Here are the offer and company details:


**Location:** Bloomberg in NYC, Salesforce in SF. NYC seems really exciting but im currently around SF for school, so I'm more familiar with the area.

**Compensation:** About the same for each.

**Housing:** Bloomberg has dorm-style intern housing in NYC, Salesforce has luxury intern housing in SF. Both are about 10-15 min from the office.

**Type of Work:** Bloomberg has interns to fill out a form to match them with projects they are interested in. Salesforce will have me working in their Infrastructure division, probably in database management.

**Full-time Conversion:** Both companies issue return offers to interns after the summer is over, if the intern performed well. But Salesforce almost exclusively hires full-time employees from its intern pool, so its conversion rate is pretty high.

**Company Growth:** Salesforce is rapidly growing and changing right now. Not really familiar with Bloomberg's trend.


I'm really lucky to be in this position but I'm pretty conflicted over what to choose. I'll be definitely trying to get a return offer in either case. Which company do you think would open the most doors / has the better work environment, growth, and culture?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your responses! You guys make a lot of good points, so I have a lot to consider. I need to make my decision my Monday, so I'll keep you posted. Thanks again."

I've been working with my supervisor for a couple of months now and I've had a crush on him since I started. As time has gone on I find myself more and more lovesick over him and thinking about him a lot. 

A lot of this started after he helped me get through a breakup and talked me through feeling okay with myself. I feel like i gained a lot of feelings bc he was checking up on me and showing sympathy for what I was going through. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore because I feel very unhappy and I need to know if he has any feelings for me. The only problem is that our workplace culture is very strict, meaning that if i were to bring up this issue I could be looking at severe consequences for both of us. HELP! 


I should add that  it's not a job for me, rather I'm an intern at the office &amp; he is my direct supervisor. Because of this we end up spending a lot of time together and have gotten to know each other.

7ao62m,6,2017-11-03,"Mom [47F] thinks I'm [22F] useless leech and boring for spending years getting degree, but not yet career",sun-bae,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ao62m/mom_47f_thinks_im_22f_useless_leech_and_boring/,"Hi all, I had this happen to me 2 days ago and things are “normal” at home, but I'm trying to process the situation and move on from it. 

For some background:
* I'm the oldest child of two (I'm 22, brother is 16)

* I have a relatively good relationship with my mother, just some bad days here and there, but there are days like this one where she totally blows up without a warning. 

* Only one in my family to attend college, full-time student (15-18 credits each semester w/ exception to freshman year that I couldn’t afford it). Have 4.0 GPA. 

* Am maxed out on credits this semester, only need 4 credits to graduate next semester in May.

* Have been working part-time since 18 to pay all school expenses and personal non-necessities.

* Dad is sole breadwinner in home, mom is stay at home mom. I work part-time.

* 2 of my 4 years working, my family was going through financial difficulties. I was making like $400-500 a month depending on my hours and would use my checks towards whatever I could. Always picked up family phone bill for $200/month and at least one grocery trip which was anywhere around $150-200 biweekly. Always covered emergency expenses (like buying new washing machine and our AC repairs). Occasionally paid a little extra if I could afford to do so for utilities. I was doing this while saving up to pay out of pocket for my tuition and books each semester.

* When my family’s financial situation improved, I was still paying for things until my father noticed and told me to stop because he didn’t want me doing this and he appreciated it, but hoped I would just be able to focus on school and save money for myself now. He told my mom this and she said ok.

* After all this he wanted to pay me back and I told him I didn’t want that or ever expect that when paying for things. He ended up buying me a computer for school and gifting me some money for textbooks. A value of about $1,000 as a “thank you” gift.



So 2 days ago I got home from an annual doctor's visit and my mom asked me how it went and what my plans for the day were. I told her it went well and that I planned on going out with my boyfriend in a few hours for lunch. 

She started raising her tone and asked “What did you just say? WHAT are you doing??? YOU'RE going OUT???” and I told her not anymore because her tone tells me that going out is a problem today.

And she just starts going off on me on how I'm not an adult, need to stay home and clean the house (which I normally do) or do something responsible today because I have “no sense of being an adult” … She goes on about “how long will you be in school for? You've been in college for 4 years already and there's more??? So you won't be totally done with schooling and have a career until you are 26, 27, 28, or even 30 years old???? And I have to have a 26 year old in my house? And then you finish school and start your career at almost 30, only to get married and have kids and then what?! You wasted so much time! You wasted all your studies! You are 22!!! YOUR FATHER AND I have been on our own since age 16!!! (Both of their parents were abusive and cut them off) And you still are in school and cannot pay a thing! You eat our food, live in our home, use our health insurance!!!”

Ok, so I am the only person in my family to attend college. I am only 2 classes away, 4 credits, from graduating next May with my Bachelor's degree at age 22. I am maxed out on credits this semester. I intend (and need to) attend grad school for at least a Master's degree which is about 2 years and need another 2 years post-Master’s of registered internship with the state to get licensed in my field. So pretty much 4 years minimum to get a career which is where she must have gotten her age estimate of 26 from. 
At that point I asked her what I was supposed to do? 

She screamed that I am irresponsible and should graduate in December and should have been faster to graduate, which I explained is not an option anymore and that I've maxed on credits each semester to even be able to graduate on time being that I was barely able to afford courses my freshman year putting me like a year behind that I've caught up on regardless. I also have a 4.0 gpa and she told me she doesn't care, I am still worthless.
I stopped her and told her that I've at least paid every penny of my tuition with money I saved up on my own. 

And she went off again. She started laughing at me and telling me that they (my parents) paid for my education because if they didn't let me live in their home, I couldn't ever afford school (ok true) and that every penny in my bank account regardless of how I got it and every paycheck I make belongs to them. My money that I've saved from working and any money I make belongs to them until I finally leave this home according to her.

She was screaming that I am wasting 4 years of my life dating my boyfriend who is just as “boring and useless” as I am. (She adores my boyfriend that I've been in a happy, stable, and healthy relationship with and even likes him more than me it seems, so this was a major surprise to hear suddenly) it seems like an eternity I have been with him and I will never get to be 22 again and she doesn't understand why I am not acting youthful and “doing things I like” (she used things she liked to do as examples…) . She went off on a tangent about how she was talking to just one of her friends and her son is like 23 and has a Bachelor's in engineering and is moved up to a different city and is “independent” so why the hell haven't I? 
I just kind of take it all because at this point it's clear to me that there's no reasoning with her and everything I say makes her more aggressive and she seems like she wants to hit me.

She also was screaming that I should be ashamed that I use the family insurance to pay for my birth control that she insisted I start… Also, I have pcos and would need to carry prescription pain killers and anti-vomit medicine along with visiting the dr each month because my periods were super intense due to hormone imbalances and she knows this and even was there when the dr explained it to me. I was kind of at a loss for words.

Anyways, she gets like this sometimes. The last time she did this to me was when I was starting college and she made me drop out and switch to a different school and then refused to help me get to campus to sort out the registration and refused to let me get on public transportation because it was “too dangerous”. I didn’t have a license or even car, so my dad found out and eventually took me.

She's acting like things are normal since this happened and even asks about how my boyfriend is doing like usual… which I prefer to how miserable 2 days ago was. It was an all day miserable time for me like there are so many things she just kept saying throughout the day that I didn't get into. Yet after what happened I feel really sour and like a burden in my own home.
My dad overheard it all and told me to disregard her and reassured me that he disagrees with it all and hopes I understand that I am more than welcome to stay living here until I have a career however long that takes as long as I am doing well in school and staying out of trouble, which is all he expects of me and sees I've been doing. He told me she has no right or power to say those things because she generates no income whatsoever and all of the money in our family and our living expenses are covered by him. We talked a little and he kept it short telling me just to ignore it all and keep doing as I've been doing and not to take her comments to heart about my personality. He's okay and even grateful that I am an “introvert and would rather stay home and only study and work because it means I'm not out getting into trouble partying and have my head on straight” and that's exactly what my mother asked of me always so her telling me I'm a boring waste of youth yet need to perform and be more of an adult than I am now doesn't add up.

I'm not sure where I'm getting at. I just don't know what to do. If it's right to just keep going as usual like this never happened especially since my dad told me not to change anything or what. I've considered trying to pay up and deposit money to cover whatever for my family letting me live with them after setting aside the money I need to cover my college expenses, but I even feel weird doing that being that my mother considers any income I generate as belonging to her and being her right anyway… I am grateful and willing to help… I just feel really sour about the whole thing after being screamed at all day that I am garbage and I pretty much owe her money for raising me. This was also kind of just out of nowhere… even my dad and brother were in shock. Has anyone else been through this…?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom out of nowhere starts screaming at me a few days ago that I am taking too long getting a degree after 4yrs of college, I should have a career in my field already without a master's or certification which takes more time, that I'm wasting my youth being boring, have been with my boyfriend for too long, will ruin my future one day getting married/having kids, should be 100% financially independent and out of her hair because I'm 22 and her parents kicked her out at 16 and made her life hell and she survived somehow. Also mentioned being entitled to my paychecks pretty much for raising me/letting me live with her and my dad, who is the sole breadwinner. Now is acting like nothing happened. Really confused…

Prof. Wahid said ""let's say you get an internship over summer and the company likes your work and asks you still stay working on the project for an additional 3 more months, should you say yes to the offer?"" Now she advocated you say no, return to studying and graduate on time. I could tell she was pushing the point of graduating on time a lot. 

What I want to know know is if you were offered a good job, with a good salary and had not completely finished your degree but could demonstrate you had a u working skill set in your field (engineering) would it be possible to just enter the work force and learn what you need on the job? Is it really wise to turn down an offer like that to finish school? What advise  do you have for a computer engineering transfer student at UCF? "

My volunteering hours are quite low ~100 each for nonclinical and clinical. 


So other than increasing my volunteering and getting a clinical job/certification, are there anything else you can recommend? 


Also, my school list was broad. Did not apply to any top tier. All low to mid tier. 


Thanks in advance.

Is it okay to reapply now that I have a lot more work to show for before waiting at least 6 months? Imo I feel like my application and skills had significant improvement since I last applied and the position is still open... so why not reapply. But Idk if this goes against recruiting ""etiquette"".

I'm not sure if at worse they just ignore me until the reapplication window is up or if there are some other negative repercussion if I apply again.

Just do it and reapply? Or forget it and apply to fresh companies?

The premise is basically humanity' first embassy to another species, presenting a tenuously-agreed-upon united human front despite Earth's remaining borders and divisions. It's going to be a story about interesting ideas, strange new alien beings, interpersonal conflict, moral thought, romance, action, adventure, and all the rest, but most importantly, it's going to be a story about *people*. What follows is sort of a prologue chapter, introducing several characters in a series of lighthearted snapshots. I know this isn't the usual type of story posted here, but I'm hoping it can kick off into something much bigger and better. Enjoy! And feel free to leave any feedback!

_______________________________________

**Chief of Science, Dr. Ian Green**

“Daddy, will there be any other kids at the Embassy?” 

Dr. Ian Green turned to face his daughter. Only nine years old, Jessica had already begun to look strikingly like her mother. Dr. Green sighed internally before forcing a smile he hoped appeared genuine.

“Yes, Jessica, there will be a lot of people working there. I know for a fact Dr. Paulsen has two kids, and I guarantee you there will be others. Certainly enough that they’re sending over some teachers for a school, at least.”

Jessica tried to smile back, equally forced. Dr. Green knelt down to face his daughter, holding her hand.

“Listen, Jessie, I understand how hard this is. It’s hard for me too, I’m leaving almost everyone behind. But this is important stuff, and you’ll get to be a part of it!” He smiled again, more real this time. “You’ll be growing up surrounded by some of the smartest people humanity has to offer, learning from all of it, and one day you could be involved in the Embassy too! Think about that! You could be the reason we have great relations with the Vettars, great scientific research… Of course, you don’t have to, you could obviously leave when you’re older, but I think it’ll be a great environment for you.”

Jessica looked back at him, tears welling in her bright eyes. She set her jaw and blinked, wiping the tears away. “Okay, daddy. Let’s go to the Embassy,” she said, in a tone so firm it could only belong to a nine-year-old. Dr. Green laughed in spite of himself.

“Yes, ma’am. Lead the way!”

_____________________________________________

**Designated Ambassador, Emily Shemyakina**

“Ms. Shemyakina, I have all your bags packed and waiting in the car. They want to leave for JFK soon; the whole team is meeting at Cape Canaveral to depart tomorrow morning.”

“Thank you, Johnson. Remind me again why I can’t bring you with me?”

“The Committee wouldn’t allow anyone with a criminal record, Ms. Shemyakina,” her assistant said ruefully.

“It’s a stupid rule. You’ll fly with me to Florida, I’ll insist on you coming. I know how much you’ve always wanted to see the stars.”

Johnson smiled, but his eyes did not. “Thank you, Ms., but I don’t want to cause you any trouble…”

“Nonsense. You’re coming with me. Those UN suits can all suck a fat—”

“Aren’t you a suit, Ms. Shemyakina?” Johnson asked, eyes glinting with amusement. Emily pretended to swat him away.

“Well, I mean, technically, but I’m not the same as them… am I?” she asked, false pleading in her voice.

“No ma’am!” Johnson laughed. “I can’t imagine any of them even being brave enough to get into the ship, to tell you the truth.”

“Exactly! Now go get me my sleeping pills—I’m horribly afraid of airplanes, you see.”

An hour later, Emily stepped into the car, deep in conversation on her phone.

“Yes, of course, Mr. President. But don’t think for a second that I’ll put the country above humanity—the UN Committee outline a very hard agreement, and unlike you I respect that organization… Yes, I understand… No, I will not allow that. I have a perfectly capable assistant already, bringing in a covert CIA operative is the actual last thing I want… I’m sorry, sir, but we’re representing humanity up there, not the United States. And believe me, that’s far more important.”

The shocked face of her assistant greeted her when she hung up, his mouth almost comically agape.
	
“You didn’t just…”

“Yep!” Emily said brightly.

“That wasn’t…”

Emily simply nodded.

“But he…”

“He did. But a girl can’t let herself get bossed around all the time, Johnson! Besides, wouldn’t you be more shocked if I’d actually agreed to go back on all my principles and secretly serve one nation at the Embassy?”

Johnson slowly nodded, gears turning behind his eyes, mouth closing slow like a drawbridge. Emily laughed.

“What are you staring for? If this Embassy goes how I want, defying the US President will be nothing but a footnote! Pay attention, Johnson—you might get interviewed about me some day.”

_________________________________________

**Defense Coordinator, General Lucas Moore**

“Look sharp, all of you! This is the biggest assignment any human has ever faced. I’m not gonna lie to you, I don’t know what kinds of things we’ll be facing up there, but we need to be prepared! Each and every one of you volunteered for this, and you were all hand-picked, the best of the best, so I know you’re all up to the task. Are you ready to defend the Embassy?”

“YES SIR!” came the resounding shout of twenty-four elite soldiers.

“Very good! Remember, the Vettars are not our enemies—yet. Don’t be hostile, but always, ALWAYS be on the lookout. Is that clear?”

“YES SIR!”

“Alright, soldiers! Dismissed!”

General Lucas Moore stepped down from the makeshift podium, haphazardly constructed near the Cape Canaveral launch site. He paused to wipe a bead of sweat from his brow before surveying the team milling about before him. Twenty-four men and women, all elite troops, with minds for strategy and officer credentials to boot. With him in charge, twenty-five. That was all that stood between humanity’s first real outpost, an embassy to a new world full of strange alien beings. He wiped away another bead of sweat. 

“Commander Ryker?”

“Yes, sir?” Ryker responded, turning from his conversation and approaching the general.

“I have a question of a… sensitive nature, that I’d like your professional opinion on.”

“Anything, sir.”

“Do you think this is enough?”

_____________________________________________

**Barack Moore, son of Gen. Lucas Moore**

Barack stood apart from the group, watching. A total of sixty-three future Embassy residents, leaving home simply because of their parents’ work, stood underneath a vast canopy, meeting those with which they would spend the next several years. Most were younger, but Barack identified a group of twenty-one near his own age, slowly splitting from the rest as they noticed each other. It was around them he moved, taking the group in as he walked; all dressed in varying styles, showing the diverse collection of people brought together. It seemed as though no two people were truly alike. He surprised himself by noticing at all, but save for him, none of the teenagers were black, something that interested him slightly as he contemplated from where all of these different people had come. Still, he did not move towards them, instead observing from eleven paces away. One foot, then the next. Always equal.

“Oh guys, look, another kid who’s out of diapers!” a girl called, to the laughter of those around her. “Get over here! My name’s Ashley, what’s yours?” Barack, discovered, grinned and waved back at her, stepping around two running toddlers to arrive before the group.

“Hi guys, I’m Barack,” he said.

“Oh, like that one President!” Ashley said, her blue eyes flashing with her smile.

“Yeah, I guess like him,” Barack said, laughing nervously. Quickly, he changed the subject, anxious to make a good first impression.

“So what brings all of you guys here?”

“Um, our parents, duh,” the same girl laughed, the others joining in soon after. It seemed that Ashley had established herself as a leader of sorts; it made sense. She seemed very friendly, with a warm smile, as well as her beautiful flowing blonde hair, and large breasts…

“Hey! Creep! What’re you looking at?” she asked, still slightly laughing. Flustered, Barack took a step back with his left foot, then matched it with his right. He realized that, in his surprise, he had taken a larger step with the left, and compensated with a smaller left-step and a larger right-step.

“What’s he doing?” another person asked, the first voice other than Ashley’s he had heard. He stopped and tried to let his hands hang naturally.

“Sorry, I don’t know, I’m a little spacey from the flight in, you know?”

Ashley grinned mischievously. “Well we’re all gonna be a little spacey soon, aren’t we?” Groans echoed through the group, drowning the few who had actually laughed. Barack wiped sweat from his hands, grateful to escape scrutiny for now. But still he worried; it was only a matter of time.

_____________________________________________________

**Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Vivian Chen**

“No, Dr. Warren, it’s fine, I’ve already done three checks, nobody has anything contagious or infectious at all… Not even a cold... Yes, of course I checked the ship’s crew! They’re going too… Yeah, I know, this is why we had everyone living in quarantine for a month!... Yes, okay, all except the Ambassador, but I’ll check her when she gets here. Everyone else is fine.”

Dr. Chen hung up, hands shaking with annoyance. If Dr. Warren had perhaps only called three times, or perhaps at least sounded as if he trusted her judgment… but no, of course he wouldn’t. A seventy-year-old man who consistently made jokes about Asian women driving? Driver-operated cars hadn’t even been around for decades! She sighed. Soon, she would be beyond his reach, symbolically at the very least.

She turned and immediately bumped into one of her hurried-looking interns, spilling the papers he had been carrying. Apologizing, she began to collect the forms from the floor, only to realize exactly which intern had just overheard her conversation: Jason Warren, grandson and heir apparent to the one and only Dr. Warren. Her boss. The all-too familiar tightness in her temples only grew stronger at this sudden remembrance. 

“I’m sorry, Jason, here are all the papers you were carrying,” she said, quickly stuffing them back into his hands. Jason opened his mouth to respond, then suddenly coughed. His face reddened as he hurried away.

“Wait! Jason!”

Dr. Chen breathed an exasperated breath. A coughing medical intern was exactly the last thing she needed right now. But, for the moment, that would have to wait; an alert on her phone told her that the Ambassador’s motorcade had just arrived. She pulled a notepad from under her coat and quickly wrote down several more tasks, muttering to herself incomprehensibly.

**Pilot &amp; Director of Exploration, Carlos Goldberg**

“Hey Carlos, check it out, they’re all set!”

Carlos glanced in the direction to which his co-pilot was pointing; “READY FOR TAKEOFF” in large green letters flashed across the screen. Carlos grinned, stretching his fingers. Looking around the front of the cockpit, he took in every detail, every instrument, and could not help but whistle in appreciation. His crew raced back and forth behind him, making final preparations for the launch.

“Well, guys, how are we feeling?” he asked the room, grinning wide, like a child receiving a toy. His crew smiled back at him, checking their stations one final time before all strapping themselves in to their various positions. Carlos’ eyes darted over a photo of a young woman before hurriedly coming to rest on the screen before him. He flexed his fingers again.

“Jenkins, turn on the PA, will you?”

“A reminder that none of the crew is named Jenkins, sir,” said his co-pilot, her eyes shining with amusement.

“You know I know that, just let me have this! Turn on the damn PA, buzzkill,” Carlos said, laughing jovially. His co-pilot flicked two switches and the PA system crackled to life—the crackle, of course, was more than unnecessary, but Carlos had insisted it be added digitally.

“Good morning everyone! This is your captain speaking. My name is Carlos Goldberg, and I know what you’re thinking and the answer is yes! That is a real name. Diversity and stuff. Anyway, I’ve heard it’s customary for a pilot to give a little inspirational speech before a launch, but I spent last night watching old movies, so forgive me for having nothing written. I will say this: all of us, and I mean every single human being aboard this hunk of metal, are about to embark on something historic. Something monumental. Let’s not be petty, let’s not be silly; humanity has a chance to put its best foot forward here, and that foot is us. We would all do well to remember the importance of everything we do at the Embassy. And we may not know what’s in store for us yet, but we do know that we can meet it with open minds, open hearts, and the best of the best that humanity has to offer. So everyone strap up and enjoy the ride, because we’re going to space, baby!”

I got into UCF, a couple other FL schools and my out of state pick UCONN. UCF and UCONN are my top picks. Clearly they both are completely different. I’m a Floridian (Miami specifically) and my brother is currently at UCF along with a handful of people I went to high school with so it’s a pretty safe pick, I can drive home whenever, I know people in the area, etc. I kind of don’t know much about UCF itself though, my brother (senior mech eng major) is a total whiner and I feel like he exaggerates things and makes everything sound awful so I want other people’s opinions. I’m a bit reserved and kind of a home-body but at the same time I’m really open to talking to people first or being approached. I’m not into the party scene, it LOOKS fun but it’s not who I am at all, I probably wouldn’t enjoy it even if I wanted to. So, what’s there to do if you aren’t a huge party person? Is the average person friendly? How hard is it to make friends, etc. and if anyone knows, are there any opportunities for geology majors when it comes to internships, etc. I’m just torn because I’ve only ever been at my CC, I’m not positive what I want in a university. I’ve always dreamed of going out of state, UConn has a nice campus, they have SEASONS, it’s a fresh start and I simply like the program I got into (geoscience) but UCF is home, I feel comfortable in Florida and I know it’s a good school..ahhh so stressed because I don’t want to make the wrong choice.

Sorry it’s taken me so long to post the next part, and I’m sorry it’s shorter.  It’s not always easy to find time to do things for myself anymore.  Keeping this façade up is draining on its own and trying to find a way to fight back is even more daunting.  The hours I have to work are minimal.  Even telling you guys this story could be considered a waste of my most valuable resource: time.  I need to do this though, for the sake of my sanity.  I need a way to reach out to people again.  I thought it would be like when I was a teenager, just coping by throwing myself into my studies, but things are different now.  I miss Jonny and Franky, hell I even miss Alexis (cold-hearted bitch), but most of all I miss Jill.  I want to reach out to her so badly, I want her to know that I didn’t choose to walk away.  Things were different, I was ready to make the sacrifices needed.  I still have the ring that she never got to see.


That’s not why you’re here though.  You’re here because you decided you needed to know the truth of what’s out there.  You’re here to learn of what I’ve been going through and how I’ve managed to stay alive. You’re here because maybe, and I pray I’m wrong, maybe it’s spread to your town and you need to know how to blend in. I promise, it’s possible, but it’s far from easy.  If anyone out there is experiencing what I’m experiencing, don’t hesitate to reach out.  I’m willing to help you, but only if you’re willing to help me. It’s probably safer if you just run though, go into hiding somewhere far away and hope it will all blow over for the best.


Jill, if you’re reading this…I’m sorry.  I am so sorry I couldn’t tell you what was going on sooner.  I know you know where to find me, but please…please…don’t come to me.  I need you to stay as far away as possible.  I need to believe that there’s still hope for you to be safe; to not be involved in any of this beyond what you saw happening with Franky that day.  It’s not safe here and I don’t know if it ever will be again.

I spent the next couple days packing for my trip back home.  Jill didn’t leave my side during this part of the ordeal, she made sure I knew she was there for me.  I didn’t pack too much in terms of clothes, just enough for about two weeks (I would make due by mixing and matching after that.).  The bulk of my luggage was for my research.  I was going to be helping my mom, but I needed to keep working, it was one of the main reasons I was able to get approval for an extended leave of absence while maintaining my internship.


I woke up bright and early in the morning on the day of trip.  It was going to be a pretty long drive, nearly 10 hours if I didn’t make any stops. I had just finished getting the last of my luggage into the back of my Jeep Wrangler when I heard a throat being cleared from behind, begging for my attention.  I leaned back out of the vehicle and turned around, locking eyes with Jill.


“I hope you don’t think I’m letting you get away from me again so easily.” A sly smile graced that elegant face of hers. I could hear the exhaustion in her voice; she was trying so hard to mask it. It caught me off guard but I couldn’t help but smile.  The way her golden brown hair locks fell to the sides of her face from amidst a messy top-bun, it was the single greatest sight to see so early in the morning.  I noticed she had a duffel bag slung from the shoulder where her purse usually was and a mid-size trolley set in front of her.


“Look, it’s not like that and you know—“ I had barely begun to speak before she cut me off, “Shotgun!” I let out a sigh of defeat and placed her luggage in the back. The trip may have been guaranteed to be longer, but the extra time on the road was worth it.  Jill’s presence was soothing. I was expecting to drive to be filled with mounting dread, the weight of which would grow heavier and more burdensome with each passing mile. It didn’t matter that I was taking an unexpected detour in life, it didn’t matter that these next few weeks (maybe months) would be difficult as I helped my mom to adapt to living with whatever medication they would place her on, it didn’t matter that I was once again going to be surrounded by memories of my dead sister.  Nothing of that nature mattered because, for the first time in life, I wouldn’t feel so alone while I dealt with it.


After a couple hours of driving, Jill told me I needed to pull over.  I suspected she needed to use a restroom or maybe just wanted to stretch her legs, so I pulled in to the next rest stop we came across.  It was quite the surprise when she told me to switch her places so she could drive.  I tried to argue, but she insisted, and I could never say no when she got persuasive.  My interest was really peaked when she said I would need to put a blindfold on for a while, she had a surprise planned for me. I laughed a bit as I put it on.  I’m not sure how long I lasted with the blindfold before I landed in my nap, nor was I sure how long I had been out for when the Jeep stopped rather abruptly, stirring me from my slumber.


“We’re here!” Jill cried out with glee, pulling the blindfold from my eyes. My eyelids cringed away from the high sun, it must have been around noon.  I wasn’t able to look around, my eyes didn’t have time to adjust before my passenger side door was pulled open and a dark figure loomed over me.  For a moment, I was terrified, still in the tail-end of my groggy state.  The next moment I had a pair of arms wrapped around me, still buckled up, in a hug I instantly recognized.


“Dad?  What? How?” the words were stumbling from my mouth as my terror was replaced with complete confusion. 


“Surprise,” Jill exclaimed, “I looked your dad up on Facebook after you fainted the other day, hoping he might have some insight.  He didn’t, but he was very interested in getting to know the girlfriend you never introduced to him.” She nudged me in the ribs, teasing with a false sense of insinuation in her tone. I rolled my eyes a bit at this, but she was right.  There wasn’t any reason for it though, I just hadn’t seen my dad since before we started dating the first time.


“That’s half of it,” my dad chimed in, “the other half is that after you got the call about your mother, Jill decided to let me know what was going on.  We talked a bit more and decided that she would be going with you and that you two would stop in here for the day.  I’ve missed you, champ.” My dad’s voice wasn’t as heavy as I remembered.  We talked a lot still but it was mostly online, due to our differing schedules.


“Well thank you so much for planning all of this without me and effectively kidnapping me with my own vehicle.” I teased, planting a kiss on Jill’s lips before she could respond.  I didn’t want to give her wit the chance to strike me down, not in front of my old man at least. It worked, for the moment; I knew I wouldn’t be able to disarm her so easily every time my father was around.

July 13, 2015


It was the day after my mother was released from the Psychiatric Ward.  Things were worse than I expected.  The past two weeks had been great, showing Jill around my hometown, and then my dad coming up a couple of days after we arrived.  It was really nice to be spending time at home like this again, I didn’t think my father would ever step foot in that house again.  Dad even pulled me aside at one point, telling me how I had ‘struck gold’ with Jill, even giving me a serious conversation about how I should consider tying the knot.  I had no idea how much that conversation would influence me. He suggested maybe having my mom move out of state, like he had, maybe bring her to Illinois with me so I would be close by again. He didn’t want to talk much about his incidents with seeing the dead, but he said it hadn’t happened again after he moved.  Now she was a wonderful and sad memory, not one that haunted him in his waking life though. That idea was completely scrapped the day mom came home though.


She was…unresponsive.  Doctor’s said the medicine was pretty strong and sometimes it would take time for her to system to regulate it, allowing her to be communicative again. Jill was pretty upset by this, she had been looking forward to meeting my mother, especially after she and the old man had hit it off so well.  I think she had a mental sigh of relief when she was called back home, although whoever called wouldn’t say why, they insisted that it was important. (It later turned out that her parents had been in a pretty bad car accident on their date night. They both survived, though her father ended up in a wheelchair.). My dad offered to drive her home, I don’t think he was able to handle seeing my mother in that state either.  To say he was heartbroken, judging by the look on his face, would be putting it mildly.


Things had ended up just as I feared they were going to be before Jill’s intervention.  I was alone, taking care of my mom, nobody to distract me.  Maybe this was a good thing though, after all, I hadn’t kept up with my end of the agreement for my leave my absence.  I hadn’t worked on my research at all, not even a single iota of thought.  I was going to change that today. If mom’s catatonic state the day prior was any indication for how the foreseeable future would play out, then I wouldn’t have any trouble doing my work, especially since I wasn’t the only one taking care of her…


The doorbell rang, as I expected it would, sometime around nine in the morning.  I had already cooked breakfast, hoping she would at least be able to eat a decent breakfast before her medication. When I got to the door though, I was shocked by who I saw: Franky. I nearly choked on my bite of sausage.  What the hell was Franky doing here? Did he come to see me? How did he even know I was here? How did he know where I lived? That’s when I noticed he was wearing the uniform of a Visiting Nurse.  Franky wasn’t a nurse. What the hell is going on?


“I’m here to see Patient 2-9-3.” Franky droned, his voice completely monotone. He was looking right at me, but his face had no expression, it was like he was looking right through me. I was in a conscious stupor and Frank pushed right past me, heading to my mother’s bedroom.  Had he been given a tour of the house without my knowledge, how did he know where he was going? I shook myself out of it and decided to follow him, seeing if maybe this was some type of elaborate prank by Jill.  I was several steps behind him and when I entered my mother’s room, he was already kneeling down next to her bed.  There was a voice-recorder on the nightstand next to it, a light indicated that it had been switched on, and he was filling a syringe from a brown bottle. Frank looked at his watch, placing the needle against my mother’s arm.


“9:07 A.M., patient is asleep. Administration of medication to Patient 2-9-3 commencing.” Frank’s monotone voice came, clearly speaking for the sake of the voice recorder.  He pressed the needle into her vein and applied pressure to plunger, sending whatever the medication was directly into her veins. My mom’s eyes opened within seconds of the needle being removed, she was wearing the same blank expression as the day before.  The same blank expression as Frank. Something wasn’t right here, what was that medicine?


“9:07 A.M. Administration complete, patient is awake. Will entrust care to the male offspring of subject.” Frank’s words rang out in the ears, they were sending up red-flag after red-flag, but this was Franky, one of my best friends. This definitely had to be some sort of joke that my mom was in on.  I decided to play along, I wanted to see how far they would take it.


“Hey Franky, what exactly is that medicine?” Franky didn’t respond. 

“Hello? Franky, are you listening to me?” I continued, trying to get him to acknowledge me as he placed the voice-recorder into his pocket and packed the rest of his supplies away. I reached out and placed my hand on his shoulder, his head rapidly turning in my direction, staring at me with intent as I spoke, “Uh, Franky, you alright man?” 

“I’m sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.  I am Dr. Francis.” That monotone droning again, this was starting to piss me off. 

“Yeah, no fucking shit. You hate being called Francis though.” I argued, hoping to call him out on the bullshit.  He simply stared at me, blankly.  

“No, I am Dr. Francis and I must be leaving now. Goodbye.” One final statement and walked out of the room and out of the house. Man, they were dedicated to this ruse.  I simply let out a sigh and helped my mom to the kitchen table.  She might not have been able to enjoy the breakfast before being put in this state again, but I could at least feed her.  I may have suspected that it was a prank, but I still had to feed her. Just in case. At least, that’s what I told myself.


Hours passed, and I had her sitting in front of the television.  I don’t remember what I had her watching.  Hell, it could have been static and it wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference. I was just getting finished setting up for my experiment. It was a multi-phase experiment, but I wouldn’t get passed Phase 1.  I turned the device on and it began to emit high frequency EM-waves.  I wouldn’t be able to gather any data that night; the moment I flipped the switch, my mom began to scream from her place in the living room.  I jumped to my feet, rushing to get there.  I nearly took myself out, tripping on the power cable and ripping it out of the wall on my way.  The screaming stopped before I got there, but she had contorted into something similar to a fetal position. I shook her shoulders, trying to get her to respond, to see if she was okay.  It was no to avail though, she seemed to have returned to that same catatonic state.


This wasn’t a joke, there was no prank going on. I grabbed the house phone (I had programmed the Psych Ward into the speed dial) since my phone was in a different room.  I wasn’t sure what was going on, but I figured it must have been some type of adverse effect to her medication. I explained that I didn’t know what happened but that she seemed to have some type of painful reaction based off the position I found her in and the screaming I heard, they agreed to send someone out immediately. I was on my knees, holding my mom’s hands in mine as I waited for them to arrive. It was about 20 minutes before I heard the doorbell.  I wiped the tears from my eyes and went to greet them, expecting it to be Franky again.  I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to a woman this time.


“Thank you so much for coming out though.  What happened to the guy from this morning though? You know, Franky- I mean, Dr. Francis.” I inquired.  He may have been behaving strangely, especially by somehow having a medical job (Come on, he’s the fucking bug guy!) but Franky was still one of my best friends and it was nice to see him.  She blinked at me, unresponsive at first.  That’s when I noticed her face.  That same blank expression, but it got worse… Her mouth opened up and out droned that fucking monotone voice, “You are mistaken. I was here this morning. I am Dr. Francis.”"

7aq45n,18,2017-11-04,Is this storyline cliché ?,WM0604,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7aq45n/is_this_storyline_cliché/,"Hello, I wanted to submit you my story's "" summary "" to know if it was too cliché. 

So, the narrator is a 16 years old boy who has paranoia and agoraphobia. He's highly intelligent ( over the majority of people but not a genius neither ), arrogant and a coward in the big lines. After seeing some doctors, his overprotective parents ( his parents are afraid for him everytime, they think something bad could happen to him because the world is a dangerous place, they are an indirect cause of his paranoia ) decide to intern him in a mental hospital. The narrator feels betrayed and thinks he has been "" imprisoned while being sane "". 

- He has to share his room with another 16 years old boy who came from England ( the story takes place in Boston ) and who has the particularity to look exactly like the narrator. This ressemblance makes him want to know him but when he figures that the other is way more extraverted and joyful that he is, he decides to reject him because he would be a danger. He also doesn't know why UK-boy is in a mental hospital and is afraid of being killed in his sleep. 

- The narrator thinks that the director of the hospital is some kind of psychopath who wants to perform illegal experiences on his patients, that's what happen in movies, and that he would be a good choice because he knows "" the truth "" about how the hospital and the world work. ( aka "" others are pitiful betrayers and liars and I'm the only one who know the truth so I'm better than them "" ).

- While being here, he meets two girls : the daughter of the co-director, who likes to hear rumors and knows everything about other patients, and a girl who thinks the director is in love with her and who has stalker tendences. The first one love to gossip because she is always bored about everything. She always try new things ( writing, painting... ) but abandon them not long after. So the only thing she finds interesting is talking to others and listening to their stories. The other one just want to feel loved by a man at all cost, even if she doesn't love him in return. He also see a boy who was his best friend some years ago and it makes him remember terrible things from his past. 

- UK-boy asks him what happened ( this happen in the middle of the story so the narrator considers him as an ally now ) and the narrator explains that when he was in middle school, he was always with popular peoples who loved his intelligence but he was only with them because it was normal. Truth is that he was extremely afraid of others finding that he was a really introverted boy ( his parents told him that it's better in society to be extraverted, that everybody put this kind of mask, and he sees other introverts as some failures. ) But one day, this boy came and the narrator discovered that they share a passion about cinema. After a while, BF-boy found out that the narrator played the extrovert and told him that it's okay to be introverted ( he is, himself ) and the narrator accepted himself because BF-boy told him he would protect him if others wanted to beat him for being different ( his biggest fear ). He also learned that his best friend was gay but he absolutely didn't mind it while the other was afraid because the narrator was the first person to know it. But one day, he saw his friend with the popular peoples and thought that he betrayed so after some times he decided to reveal his BF's secret which lead to the bullying of the other boy.

- After telling that the narrator starts to really care about UK-boy even if he doesn't want to admit that he is his friend and after some events, he discovers that this happy boy has done suicide attempts in the past and lost his family in one ( he burned his house ) because his illness is too hard for him and he knows that a complete recovery isn't possible for now. 

I'm actually at this part of the story so the rest is in big lines.

- They try to escape and it fails but the boys consider themself as best friends after that.
- The narrator talks with BF-boy and learns that the other didn't betray, but that he wanted to prevent the popular peoples from bullying the narrator. Everybody feel bad and they understand why the other did what he did, even if they don't accept it and they stop hating each other, they are indifferent to each other.
- The narrator starts to understand the reason behind his internment and accepts to work on his paranoia. 
- UK-boy and the narrator decide to make another escape attempt together but the day before doing it, the director calls the narrator to tell him that it is okay for him to come out of the hospital and his parents came to take him back home. He will still be a bit paranoid about things after that.

END

Do you think this is cliché ? This summary is already too long and I feel like I only told a little part of the story because there is a lot of little events which involve others characters... Also there is a big part in the story about how movies give a wrong idea of mental illness and mental hospital and I did research but I still fear that the story seems wrong too. ( Also sorry for my english, I'm french. )

EDIT : Since I wasn't very clear, I add some things which were in my review."

So my GF and I have been together for 4 years now, our first real and good relationship, and it has all been great with an exception earlier this year because of a slipup of mine, cheating on her once and I went into therapy because of out of my own accord. 
Wich we talked about and, wich I at first felt like, made us better.

My GF is the most wonderful person ever to have walked this earth and she loves me to the moon and back and i thought i did so too.

Anyways, about 8 weeks ago I started an internship abroad for my last semester of a bachelors degree. This meant I would only see my GF on the weekends  wich was fine because I love her.

The internship itself is amazing and ive got great colleagues, but as of 4 weeks my feelings have been drifting away from my GF. 4 Weeks ago I stayed there and my GF would have come over but she couldnt due to Severe back pains, wich I got and didnt make a fuss about.
But for some reason it started eating away at my feelings for my GF. 

Enter colleagues, attractive young females of about my age who all have relationships so it doesnt affect Me since ive a GF right? Wrong.
For some reason I developped a crush on one of my coworkers who I only speak with shortly once a day or so, but it still grew on me.

This led me to losing interest and attraction towards my GF and i dont know what to do. I love her but I just dont seem to be IN LOVE with her. 
If you asked me 9 weeks ago I would have told you that I'd marry this girl. 

Is this just a phase of being that far away from normal? Am I a jerk, a narcisist? What is wrong with me?

I am in dire need of advice if someone could shine a light on Me?

Thanks in advance!

**TL:DR**
I think time spent away abroad made me fall out of love with GF or am I just overloaded? Whats happening never felt like this before. "

My parents, however, are openly disappointed in the fact that I am not pursuing medicine. They send me articles about wage caps and  job security and predict I will have to live at home (ect., ect.). They are also extremely off put by the idea of my working right after under-grad (say it is essentially like a HS degree).

I don't have much of a rebuttal, because I don't know many working ECE's (outside professors). What has been your experience? What do you think of working right after undergrad? How are things going for you - ever regret not picking a different path?

I hope this is the right subreddit - first time posting.

I run and maintain test suites for our three web applications. Right now, they are pretty basic ""happy path"" testing, but I am going to start going back and improving a lot of the tests because I know a lot more now than I did back then. 

Now, I am familiar with Page Object Model but I am new to BDD. I have heard a lot about Cucumber but I don't really understand the point of it or how useful it really.

Similar to that, I have heard and researched PageFactory but I don't really understand how that is beneficial either. It seems to me like defining methods for returning WebElements in your page classes would render the same effect as using PageFactory.

Anyway, I'm aware I'm probably just not understanding some stuff, so I guess my question is, what is it about these BDD/Cucumber/other stuff like it and PageFactory make them so useful?"

True, he'd used it before, he'd pointed it, he'd fired it, but he had never felt comfortable with it. What would his father think? His son, unable to hold a revolver properly? It was ridiculous, he knew, to think that his father disapproved of his path; but sometimes Edgar wished he had chosen a path he could share with his father, one where they would have common experiences, common knowledge.

*BANG*

The pistol fired, the bullet hitting the rim of the target. Good enough. Maybe if Edgar aimed for the heart of an assassin he would at least slow him down. He left the target range, depositing his pistol in a safe and taking off the ear defenders. He stepped into the morning sunlight, the suns rays beating down on to his weary face. He was under a lot of stress. It went without saying. He had, admittedly, a smaller workload since he gave the duty of Foreign Minister to someone else, but being under constant threat of assassination was not good for the mind. In every shadow, around every corner, it seemed a would-be assassin might lurk. That man he shook hands with earlier might have a nerve agent taped to his palm. The guard standing by the hallway entrance could be a thought reformee, ready to kill him at the first command. Creeping shadows of paranoia engulfed his mind.

What work to do now? Explain the ADMHC300 threat? Plan the security for Nott's funeral? Get round to forming Tassie and NSW militia forces? Investigate reports of cassowary attacks in the Torres Strait Islands? Tell Rhodes to not frighten him to near-death when he delivers reports? So much to do, so little time.

He poured a glass of whiskey. He downed it one go, flinching from the kick. Flicking on a light switch, he turned on his laptop. How many levels of security was it he had to go through? He counted as he went, one, two, three, four, seven in all. At least no one was going to walk into his office and look at his reddit subscriptions. An email from Gronville, thanking him for support at the last cabinet meeting. An email from Char about the wedding. Fuck, he would need to plan security for that as well. In the distance, he could hear all the other ministry workers pouring in for the beginning of their days. The laptop whirred beneath his hands. A notification. Meeting with the commander of WADF in half an hour. Might be alright. He's a droll fellow after all. In the meantime, he should get on with reading the ADMHC300 report, these interns won't evaluate themselves."

Just so folks know, I'm as laid back of a Midwesterner you can imagine. Nothing gives me stress. Stress doesn't induce panic. However, on this particular night, in an intimate crowd of 300 in Paris, I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.


To the TIFU: So I was invited to join a university professor as a photography intern to both Puerto Rico and Paris. We would be spending a few weeks in each location. We were essentially hired to shoot and deliver a final evening video presentation at each trip. A recap, if you will. Now, keep in mind, this was for C-level management of a major vehicle brand — as well as multi-car dealership owners from around the country (USA). We're talking millions in costs for the brand and hundreds of guests who were accustomed to top-notch service. 


Now, my role was to head out on daily excursions and take photographs of the guests. Think of places like the Louvre to underwater snorkeling in the ocean. Easy-peasy as I buttered up the guests with charm and delivered some cool photographs in the end. However, the main reason I was sent was to create a computer slide-show that would Hollywood Blockbuster the guests. Puerto Rico was trip one, presentation went without a hitch, and the guests were dazzled.


Fast forward to the moment I'll never live down. On the final night in a 10 day trip to Paris, I was putting together the slide-show on a small laptop with hundreds of photos throughout the week. What I forgot to do was resize the images as they'll be projected up to a massive screen. Instead, hundreds of photographs were getting loaded into a program, on a slow running laptop, into said presentation program at full resolution. This, just hours before go time.


What ensued was to be expected. At first, the computer started up with the obligatory wheel of death. Eventually, it reached its limit and just crashed. For two hours it wouldn't even start up. On top of that, moments before the wheel of death, the video file (think stop-motion animation) of the CEO at the Ritz Hotel Chef School was now coming up corrupt. ABC'ya later, all that work out the window. 


Dear God, dear dear God, we're in full panic mode.


Thinking on his feet, my professor basically said ""ennnealioo, screw it, let's just play the images from start to finish right from the computer folder. Screw the program."" as we finally got the computer started in the ballroom where the event was being held.


The evening was all set. 100+ guests were seated. Meal was served. The master of ceremony made a huge introduction for our photo presentation before a b-list music group was to get on stage. I hit play, hoping some miracle would allow for the images to run straight through so people could at least see their trip recap. Not today. That's now how this one goes. A moment later, I realized that I'd clicked the photo option to ""shuffle"" as I clicked play. That means 4 of the same image were getting shuffled back and forth to summarize over a week of incredible travel for hundreds of guests. Cue laughing. Hundreds were now laughing hysterically. And, to top it off, my professor was pacing behind me saying ""well, my career is over... this is it... I'll never be hired again""

The nightmares continue to this day. 

TL;DR Traveled as a college photo intern to help a major company's destination event. Night of major event in Paris, my computer crashed. So hundreds of guests sat and watched the same 4 images summarize their entire 10-day trip to Paris. Professor told me it was career suicide."
7arqoz,3,2017-11-04,I'm Pretty Sure Every Person I know Considers Me To Be A massive Failure,DoNotMatter,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7arqoz/im_pretty_sure_every_person_i_know_considers_me/,"I pretty much flamed out over the past few months. 

For reference, I spent most of my life overachieving in school to compensate for being bad at everything else. I'm not an athlete, I'm not particularly funny or attractive, there's really nothing about me that's even remotely appealing.

So a few months ago is when I graduated with my Master's at the age of 22. It is the only success I've ever achieved in my life.

That was the only thing I could use as a source of pride: that I'd gotten two degrees and finished by schooling by 22. That was in June.

November has come along and I still have no fulltime work, and not even in the field I studied for so long. This is not to say that I deserve any more than anyone else, but I feel like I've wasted my time. I've been applying everywhere, since I'm not stupid enough to think I'm owed anything, but I've been getting rejected from minimum wage jobs and unpaid internships at this point. Literally nobody wants me.

I've had a handful of interviews but I bombed them all so badly that it's pointless to even get another one. 

I'm at the point where I spend most of my time scrounging for any freelance gig I can get just so I'm not drowning in my own incompetence. My social life is nearly nonexistent and I worry it's because people think I'm as pathetic as I feel.

I struggled so much to get those goddamn degrees, I put everything I had into it. I'd even dropped out of school after suffering a mental breakdown a year before graduating and didn't go back until my girlfriend at the time encouraged me to go back. The last time I had fulltime work was during the year that I wasn't in school at all. 

What the fuck do I do? It's driving me completely insane, to the point where I had to end my relationship because I was being so emotionally toxic around her. I've been thinking about suicide nearly constantly, and the only reason I haven't gone off and done it is because I don't want to upset my grandparents or my ex (we still talk, and I'm still very fond of her because of how well she's been taking all of this). My ex has depression too and even though she has no degrees and I have two, she's the one who's able to afford everything and is just fucking incredible at getting new jobs when she's needed to. She's even been sending me bucket loads of applications to help me out, and I've been rejected from each and every single one of them. Every contact I potentially make anywhere falls out of contact, and the last time I tried to go to a networking event, I had an anxiety attack so bad that I began bleeding out of my nose all over my clothes. 

I feel like I'm designed for failure, as if that's the only thing I can do right. I look for validation everywhere else because I can't find any myself. Considering what I got was a film degree, I've made contact with exactly two producers and had the chance to pitch projects to both, and was soundly rejected. 

How many rejections should one take before giving up for good? At what point should I conclude that I will never lead a happy or fulfilling life? I've been in therapy for two years but it can only do so much. I've spent session after session trying to figure out why employers are so repulsed by me. 

I know my ex doesn't really need me. I know that my grandparents have six other grandchildren who will all lead happy and fulfilling lives and make them proud. But I know they're not inhumane monsters, I know they want me to succeed. But I can't, I literally can't, and should I just spend the rest of my life rotting away just so they don't worry? I don't know if I'm strong enough to go on longer than a couple years. I genuinely don't want to die, i really don't, but I'm reaching the point where I'm so completely ashamed of myself and my failure that I don't think I can continue existing like this. 

Don't tell me to exercise, I've been doing that. I've been trying to improve my diet and sleep better (though I can't sleep better than a couple hours a night even with over the counter shit for it), trying to stop drinking and smoking as much as I used to. I've reached the point where if I was offered any kind of hard drug I'd probably take it just so I don't have to suffer for a while. I know full fucking well what it'll do to me but I'll do anything to make it go away, don't you get it?

I was fooled. I thought that once you go to school that things will work out. I think everyone hates me. I think they're all disgusted by me. If they don't hate me, they pity me. My own parents actively avoid me at every opportunity and tell people facts about me that aren't true so they can pretend I'm not the failure they gave birth to. My own family, minus my grandparents, pretend that I'm not alive. The messages to people I send who I thought were friends are read with no response. I can't blame any of these people for treating me this way. Why would you want someone like me in your life?

I'm 22 years old and I'm barely surviving with freelance gigs from people taking pity on me. I'm not particularly good at it. I've made four digits a month from it exactly twice in my life. For reference, a former classmate of mine (I had a giant crush on her in high school and she went to the same college as me) is now working as an animator at Adult Swim at the same age as me, immediately after graduation. Another high school classmate who also got the exact same degree as me is now in charge of a marketing firm at the same age as me. I'm just stunned by how utterly incompetent I am. I'm stunned that I can be good at nothing and have nothing of value and no matter how hard I work to improve, it just doesn't happen.

I'm sad and I'm scared and alone, I don't know what to do. I'm begging you, on my knees, to tell me that this is going to work out somehow. I need to know that I'm not here in vain. "

So I've finally gotten a job (well, paid internship) where I've saved up enough to actually be able to do this. 

At the moment, I actually have a motherboard that I got for my birthday about a year ago (yes I haven't done anything with it, there's a reason for that but it's not important). It's a MSI Z170A Krait Gaming X3. It's cool, but I'm not sure if it'd be compatible with the [Ryzen 1920x](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-1920x) which I *really* want. And even then I'm not sure how well that board would work with Linux. 

After that, I'd like to know what other hardware would be best to meet this other stuff I'd like:

  - 32-64 GB Memory

  - 8 (or more) GB GPU

  - 2 TB of storage

Other than that I can figure out the rest. 

I'm only asking because I've searched for ""linux compatible hardware"" but haven't found anything that's just a straight up product name like ""AMD Thingx X#### Whatever"", just lists of drivers. And I'm lazy, I just need a product name really. 

**EDIT 1:** u/squad_of_squirrels got me to check out [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and I made a really rough build [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cwfGr7). Note that I only have 2 storage devices because (for some reason) I'm not sure if Samsung is down with Linux. If both are compatible, I'm obviously going for the cheaper one. I'd also might wanna swap out the Threadripper for a [Ryzen 7 Pro 1700X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-pro-1700x). If there's cheaper stuff for what I want, please, feel free to edit the list.

I am currently a graduate student getting my MSTax who is currently working in a private company as an intern. I will be interning at a F500 in the winter during tax season.

While I am not completely terrible at public speaking, I do find myself struggling with social anxiety when it comes to speaking in front of more than one person. I feel as if I am being judged based on how I present myself and my confidence is taking a hit. I find myself constantly pausing and feeling ""unsure"" at what I say at times and there's this cloud of self-doubt that comes whenever I talk to anyone who I see as superior because they're ahead of my in regards to career advancement etc. I am not jealous, I just feel inferior. 

For example, during presentations or whenever I have to speak in front of people, I feel as if I am not speaking loud enough, and I feel shaky. I feel my heart pounding loudly and it is so strange how this is almost a natural response, yet when it comes to one-on-one interviews I have no problems acing it and I talk to boss and other superiors at work without any issue. This nervous response is usually when it's new people/in front of a group/presentations.

I wondering if it's because I have little to talk about, or just somewhat awkard? What are some tips you guys use to be more knowledgeable and expand your vocabulary? Is there something you read to keep up with your superiors, is it all politics? Do I have to pretend? What do you do to improve your fluid intelligence in public speaking? I'd like to hear your thoughts.



Thanks!"

7asmqd,1,2017-11-04,To move or not to move?,s4dinypsi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7asmqd/to_move_or_not_to_move/,"**Sorry for the length. See TL;DR at end.

**Background info:** Me and my boyfriend (let's call him Marty) met in college, and I recently finished my undergrad. He is working on completing his, with only one semester to go. We are doing long distance right now, since I moved to start a second degree after graduating. 

**The Situation:** Marty's parents offered me a free place to stay while I worked on getting my second degree, but I graciously turned them down and moved in with my sister instead. 

As it turns out, I am really unhappy here. I don't have any friends, I hate my job, and I am struggling to balance work and classes. I'm barely able to support myself, living paycheck to paycheck. Marty is going to be moving back home in a couple months after graduating while he looks for a job. I went to visit him recently, and told him how unhappy I have been. After hearing all of this, he suggested I take his parents up on their offer after my current lease is up.

I have been living on my own (or with roommates) and paying all of own bills since I moved out of my mom’s house five years ago. The idea of living with Marty’s parents seems almost like a step backwards for me, and I don’t want to lose any of my independence. When I told Marty this, he made the point that it is common for recent grads to move home for a short time while doing unpaid internships (likely scenario for me) or searching for a job. He also said I might not even end up living with him/his parents that long depending on how long it takes him to secure a job, and that we could move out together when the time came. I expressed concern that I would still be in school and working part time, but he said he would be happy to pay for the majority of rent/bills and support me while I’m still in school. Marty has always been very reassuring and supportive of me in everything I do, and I am so grateful to have him.

Marty’s parents live near Big City, where there would be many more job opportunities for me. I would also be able to actually start saving up money for a while, which would be nice and put me ahead of the game. Both degrees I have wouldn’t necessarily require me to do an internship, but the industries are easier to break into with one, and I definitely can’t do an internship (most are unpaid in these fields) unless I move in with them. Since I’m still not sure what I’m doing, it would be nice to have that as an option. I feel like moving there in general just opens more doors and gives me more opportunities. The fact that I would be living with Marty is just a bonus (a very nice bonus). Overall, I think it would be a more productive environment for me, and I would be surrounded by a good support system. 

The answer seems obvious to me at first, BUT then there is the flip side. Moving to Big City means I would have to finish most of my classes online, which isn’t a deal-breaker, but also certainty isn’t ideal. And yeah, Marty and I have a wonderful relationship that I see lasting many years down the road, but isn’t that how most people in relationships feel? Realistically, there is a possibility that we could break up, and I can’t bring myself to rule that out no matter how happy I am with him. Whether that is me being insecure or appropriately cautious I don’t know.

Or maybe I haven’t given my current living situation enough time. It’s only been three months. Maybe I will make friends eventually and find a better job too. I could survive doing long distance for the next year and a half. I can finish my degree in person instead of online, maintain my independence, and not worry about what will happen if Marty and I split for some reason. Staying here is an option, but I think for me, it would mean knowingly heading into the next year and a half in a constant struggle to pay bills and fight my depression.

I am trying to be objective about this whole thing, to make a decision that is best for me both financially AND mentally, but I just don’t know. I know the decision is mine to make, but any advice or thoughts would be so greatly appreciated. 

**TL;DR:** My bf of three year's parents offered to house me while I finish my second degree. They live near a big city with the potential for more opportunities. Right now I'm struggling to pay my bills, have no local friends, hate my job, and am generally unhappy. Moving could be great, but also a disaster on the off-chance Marty and I split. Trying to decide if I should risk it and move, or stick it out where I am until I finish school.

I didn't prepare for interviews and applied to internships all over the world. I got interviews at top companies, and they didn't go so well. I have only one chance in London left, and that's it (for now I guess)

I am studying CS in the US, and everyone pushes the rhethoric that you must have an internship. I am also a non-US citizen, so sometimes I notice companies reply within a day, saying how they cannot hire me, and I assume it's because of my citizenship. Going back home isn't an option, since work ethic where I'm from is terrible, and I already did an internship sophomore summer there and hated it.

I need advice on what to do and if you know any companies who are particularly supportive of minorities and non-US people that focus on work in CS?

Since I hate the interview process overall, I am getting to a conclusion that I might want to start my own business. Do you think that's a possibility as a Junior in college who isn't from here? I would love to start a business anyway so this experience might push me into it, but I would like to do it in a big city in the US or generally the ""western world"" with the possibility to support myself with food/apartment. Are there any people/places you know who can get me to a startup scene that can support my living/food costs?

I know it's a complex issue, but if any of you could offer any advice that would be great. I am aware that I might have rushed with applications, but I put a lot of effort into some of them, and some that I didn't want to work for not so much, and didn't get much opportunities nevertheless.

Since I am in college I maked 2 friends the south american she is a real sweet heart but our friendship is to recent to me so I am not comfortable opening up to her .
 The other is muslim like me but she loves to party all the times drink alcohol say in shaa Allah/ Allhamdullilah 24/7 but speak in the back of other all the time and date A LOT . 


So I lost my muslim friends network of HS and feel very lonely religiously and just in general . Strangely I came to a point where it doesn't even bother me I am not suicidal at all but I just don't enjoy life anymore because of the lack of intimacy in my life , I am kinda dead inside . 

I can't go back a lot to my hometown since I live 4 hours away in train and I don't have enough money ( i need a lot to get back usually) . 
I have a lot of project and will In shaa Allah maybe start a start up incubators this year and founded a cool internship and found a successfull teacher who is mentoring me giving me a lot of advices every thing seems to fall into place slowly proffessionaly . 

I realised that I may have everything in the future ( If God agree) I want a good career but I would probably not be able to appreciate all that because I feel empty . 
The fact that I stayed to long alone and lost my basic social network changed me in a way where I don't recognize myself . 
I don't need love I know it is not normal .
I am alone but I am not bother by it anymore because I feel empty . 
I lost my sense of attachment . 
I was holding every relationships I had in my life before very highly but now I just don't care because I am used to be this way . 
I was extremly extrovert befor very social always laughing goofing around with friends I could befriends or just maked a connection easily and now I am like a nerd always at home or at the library because I don't see the point in other things even praying feel empty, I am so introvert the only friends I kept from HS tald me that she didn't recognize me but thanks it doesn't bother her so we are still good friends .

 
I did miss her a bit this year but k
now I don't care to every things seems useless unless I am not being productive and when I am I think about how much I lack intimacy in my life .  
Before I could hug my friends speak deeply with them about my feelings I wanted to get married and have 4 kids ( 3 girls and a boy ) . 


And now I don't even understand why people have kids , I just don't get it If I had children I will probobly have no love to give them because staying to much alone maked me like a rock and I am a bit scared of how I am becoming .  
Sorry if it's to long . 
Anybody experienced this ?"

7atwzb,3,2017-11-04,My friend is struggling with mental health and I don’t know how to help,SkytossMasterRace,uwmentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwmentalhealth/comments/7atwzb/my_friend_is_struggling_with_mental_health_and_i/,"My friend of 4 years has been lying about his entire university life. In his current state, he has pretty much dropped out of university due to his refusal to accept help and address his mental health issues. He’s been getting along and hiding this from his friends by coming up with lies to convince everyone that everything is fine (it’s not). Recently, we discovered that he’s been lying about everything: his resume, his academic status, his jobs, his accomplishments, literally everything. This post will just detail the reasoning behind his fall, and how he’s progressively gotten worse over the course of our friendship.

In first year, I met William (not his real name of course). He lived in the same residence as I and we were in the same program. He was a quirky individual with some not-so-desirable personality traits. He’s the type of person to message you asking for something, to which you’d respond shortly after, and then he’d disappear for days. 

Anyways, we ended up joining the same club together shortly after the term started. I made some close friends at this club, and William just sort of joined as well. As the term progressed, I discovered he had a crush on a girl in one of our classes, Lydia. Lydia happened to be close friends with one of the members of the club, Richard, and she slowly integrated herself into our friendship circle.

At first things started off innocent and cute. William would walk her to classes, chat her up, and study with her after school. They would always be together, and we would tease him about her, asking when they’d become official, to which he’d vehemently deny any sort of romantic relationship with her. Over time, however, we realized that this innocent crush had devolved to a mild obsession. 

As she started to deny his offers to walk her to class, he’d camp outside her residence waiting for her to show up. He’d get all mopey and depressed when she ignored his messages and doubled his efforts to be around her as often as he could. He would wait for her after class (since we were all in the same program) and basically walk with her from class to class since we all had extremely similar schedules. His obsession with spending time with her got the point that whenever we wanted to find him, we’d just ask Lydia where she was (since he’d never reply). After some time, Lydia started hanging with us less and less and eventually just left the friend group.

Now, Lydia wasn’t very upfront in her relationship with him. Whether it was because she genuinely believed he just treated her as a very good friend, or because she just wanted to tool him around is something I’m still not too sure about. But we all knew that she had 0 interest in him, and to my friends and I, it seemed like she was just leading him on. My friends had tried many times to convince him to move on, to which he’d repeat the same line: “I just think of her as a really close friend.” At that point we realized that there was no point talking to someone who’s deluded themselves to this extent. He was obsessed with her, and wouldn’t stop until he had her.

In third year, William was still into Lydia. I had lived with him for 3 years now, and I’ve been very aware of the changes in his personal habits. His personal hygiene was literally at an all time low. What used to be a consistent, every-three-day showering routine (I know, still pretty gross), turned to a biweekly (that’s every other week) affair. I was literally in disbelief at how far he’d let himself go. He’d leave his laundry in the washing machine for hours, letting it sit and start smelling musky, before drying it in the dryer. His room smelt like something had died inside it, and he would make terrible messes in the kitchen. He would make protein shakes, drink half of it, and just leave it opened beside the sink for days. Literally a nightmare of a roommate.

Now, it was because of this deteriorating hygiene that I had decided that I needed to live with someone else. I was looking for a sublet for the following term, and found a very well priced suite with 4 rooms. Now the only problem was that I only had 2 friends with me, one of which was a girl who asked if we could look for a female 4th roommate so she wouldn’t rip her hair out from how annoying living with 3 guys would be. Lydia had posted in one of our group chats looking for roommates and our female roommate reached out to her as our fourth. When Lydia  messaged me asking to join our housing group, I gladly accepted and secured the sublet. It wasn’t till a couple months later that I realized that was a mistake.

Now I wanted to be straight up with William. I privately messaged him that my friends and I would be living with Lydia, and subsequently dug myself into the deepest shithole of my University-of-Waterloo-attending life. All Hell literally broke loose after I told him. He went on a social media rampage, followed by a blackout, in which he just deleted everyone off of his social media and retired his account. He started sending me passive-aggressive texts, saying things like, “Congrats bro, you can have her, you win.” I just want to clarify that at no point in our now-three year friendship had I shown any interest in Lydia. Literally none. I barely spoke to her.

Following the social media blackout, his behavior started getting very erratic. He stopped going to classes, and became super defensive with our group of friends. He would skip important lectures, group meetings, and even tests. He would lie and say things like he was there but we didn’t see him, or that he was enrolled in another section (there was no other section). His favourite excuse was that he “had to go take care of something”. We basically stopped pestering him about skipping classes, but we noticed something was up when he skipped multiple exams. We weren’t completely sure what was going on, but he ended up enrolled in the following term so we thought he had his shit figured out.

At this point, the lies started escalating in ridiculousness. William pulled us all aside one night and told us about a serious health issue he was having, to which he needed to undergo surgery. We were all concerned for him, but in the following weeks we noticed that he seemed to be perfectly fine and didn’t take any time off of from video games or hanging out (he insists he underwent surgery to this day). He told us about a friend of his, who was a previous girlfriend that was obsessed with him, and would buy him all kinds of things, who suddenly passed away when we asked to meet her. He later confessed that she wasn’t real.

At this point, all this information serves to provide some type of context and background into the type of person that William was to us. The rest of this story will now detail how we discovered his true personality and how dangerous his lies had become.

Last term, Richard and his friends decided to give William another chance at being a roommate and lived with him over the summer since it would be his last co-op term. However, at the same time, he claimed to be enrolled in Waterloo, and also claimed to be working part-time. It was more than a bit suspicious, especially when he seemed to only work this part-time job, and would do nothing else but play video games at home. He would claim to have morning classes and tutorials one week, just to magically have none the next week. Aside from this shifting schedule, he had time to go to Richard’s classes, as he would constantly ask if he could attend them. Ironically, he seemed to never go to his own classes and seemed to skip tests and midterms without a care in the world.

At this point we started getting really suspicious. Suspicion hit the roof when William asked Richard to edit his resume and accidently sent him a folder. The folder, aptly titled ‘resumes’, contained over twenty resumes, each with a different purpose, each with a different set of credentials. Some were resumes with his real educational background, while other resumes had him claiming to be a student at McGill (McGill is very close to his home). Some had work histories in fast food, some in business management internships (he is not in business), some were health-industry related co-op jobs that he was in no way qualified for or had worked for in the past. Does he even realize that employers can see his co-op history when he applies for the job as part of the package?

Finally, when we were talking about how disgusting his living habits were, we weren’t exaggerating. This picture is of a what used to be a piece of “cooked chicken”, which is now a breeding ground for mold. This “chicken” was in the fridge from the beginning of May to mid June. There were originally 8 of these containers, with the exact same contents. Four of them were eaten at the beginning of the term, 2 near the third week of May (after which he got diarrhea), and 1 at the beginning of June. This picture as taken in the middle of June and I kid you not, William was about to eat it until Richard stopped him.

The point of this story is just to get some help from him, help that he clearly needs. He compulsively lies, has no personal hygiene, and is still to this day, obsessed with Lydia. We’ve already tried many things to get him to see help. We’ve told him to go to a therapist, to which he lied about seeing (surprise), when Lydia straight up told us that he was “studying” with her the entire day.

At this point, I’m close to the point where I’m done with him forever. But I just wanted to make one last attempt to help him. /r/uwaterloo, what can I do?

I interviewed with two big tech companies, 1 startup, and a company who I fit very well with based on my old field of study.  I took the startup interview when I was sick and failed miserably.  I was also rejected from one big tech company after the interview despite the interviewer thinking I performed excellently and having been asked really easy questions (intro data structures or intro to cs level questions).  

So far, that leaves me in the final rounds for the other two companies.  


Since I am new to CS, can I still realistically apply for internships in Spring for this summer?  This whole semester kind of flew by fast."

7au182,1,2017-11-04,I feel like a failure,SadProgrammerRip,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7au182/i_feel_like_a_failure/,"I graduated this spring from a ""good"" university with a degree in Computer Science. I HAD been planning for over a year to move in with my lovely and wonderful girlfriend in Sweden while I go to grad school for Machine Learning and hopefully eventually find a job. Well hurray for me my ""great"" university had incorrect records in their system and I was rejected from ALL masters programs I applied for in the EU because it looked like I was submitting someone elses transcript. Due to my universities ridiculous data keeping system I had no idea this happened until it was too late. 

I already had tickets to leave after graduation, and I wanted to see my girlfriend again so I left for Sweden anyway. Except now I need to find a job and the stress of trying is absolutely destroying me. I feel like people in my field NEED to have done tons of open source work, spend time making apps and going to overnight competitions. I've only got some slightly dubious research experience which failed to get a paper due to the professor practically ignoring it until the last minute in favor of some more promising students I guess. The process of doing the research was so stressful for everyone that my professor actually said it made him WANT TO QUIT THE ENTIRE FIELD. I feel like nothing of worth was really produced and the reception of the presentation was lukewarm at best. And thats the only thing on my resume. 

Ive been applying, and applying, and applying everywhere I can and despite some interviews in the beginning (which I flunked terribly due to nerves) I haven't gotten a single response back in months. The end of the year is bearing down on me like a heavy weight, and its been getting harder and harder to to anything at all. I just want to retreat to play videogames and waste my time looking at cat photos or something online, but everytime I try I get this intense guilt that I should be working on something ""productive"" instead. 

I feel like I spend hours every day regretting my choices in life, for being too timid to show up to coding competitions, for being too naive and taking classes I'm interested in instead of ones that could be hireable, for not having enough passion or creativity to come up with things to code in my spare time. For not getting an internship because I wanted to study abroad and stay longer with someone who actually makes me feel happy. The future looms ahead of me, having to leave my girlfriend to go back to living with my abusive parents for a year or even worse, having to take a pity internship at their company just for the money to go back. No one is going to hire a newbie who is staying less than a year, and so many internships even in the US are only for current students. 

Intellectually I know that a lot of these won't be so big in the future, and that I will most likely be accepted into the program of my choice next year, but it just feels so terrible. I feel like I'm wasting days doing nothing while simultaneously barely being able to summon up the effort to look at job listings anymore. I think in the future, how would this year look on a resume? And there would just be nothing. I did nothing. 

TL;DR scared of the future, angry at the past, and frozen right the fuck now. "

I started working in retail as a PT cashier in 2012. I moved around a few stores in different cities mostly because I was starting university. Moving around isn't a bad thing by the way.

At one point in my college career the career fair came to my school and Publix was there. Ironically it was my store manager for the retail side (he was an awesome guy, been with Publix like 37 years), and the Lakeland staffing specialist from corporate.

I told her I was interested in the internship program over summer and she got me going in the right direction.

**Internship Process**

So I applied to an internship, which was a very very easy process. Basically a 15-30 minute phone interview after a cover letter I submitted. By the way, when I was an intern, there were like 2000 applicants for 35 jobs.  That being said, they HIGHLY value you if you already work for Publix. For me, it was down to the last two candidates, and my team chose me because I worked for Publix already. The only requirement for the internship is that you still be a student and not graduating before the internship is over.

Most people who get an internship usually get offered positions permanently or to come back for another internship (due to graduation/finishing school). I know of around 10 or so of the 35 in my year who stayed on in some capacity.

If it was not for the internship, what people who work in retail need to realize is that to get to corporate, unless one holds a masters or experience elsewhere, it will be hard to get some of the positions that require 3+ years in different categories.

Instead, there are a ton of hourly positions available. The most basic are around $12/hr, but can range upwards of $26ish dollars an hour, (approximately $50k yearly, for the more skilled positions that there are fewer of).

**How to Apply**

To apply for these jobs, simply go to the current job search, and LOG IN. Most positions get posted internal only (meaning a current Publix associate). That's your chance! And to explain why, is because most of the entry level positions are around the same pay, so there is no reason for an HS4 (hourly support) to apply for a HS3 position. HS2 is usually the lowest for most departments. But when the position is posted internally, there are VERY few applications in the pool at this point. But if you are LOGGED IN using your passport login, you get to see jobs that may not be posted to someone not with the company! Usually the applicant pool sizes for these are less than 10! 

**Application Process**

The application process usually starts with a test for the position if you are not dismissed based on your resume or cover letter. The tests can vary greatly based on the position. Entry level tests are usually word, excel, and access related. As well as some graphs and business logic work problems. My tests included IQ tests and they are VERY VERY hard, but intentionally so. I also had the basic graphs and word problems one, (super easy but I hold a business degree), and personality questions.

After the test, if your scores are decent they will move onto an interview, for me they were in person so I had to drive to Lakeland, but that can vary. Basically they interview less than 10 or so candidates depending on how many opening there are. Afterwards they will either call you with a job or likely send you an email stating you are no longer under consideration. (Don't take not getting a call to say you did not get the job personally, that is why we have brassring to make the process more streamlined). 

A side note on that, don't apply for every job imaginable on there, I've worked with the hiring system some and it will show all the jobs you've applied for and when. So don't apply for the senior business analyst position that pays $80k and then apply for the one that pays $13/hr....

**Requirements**

If the requirements list 1 year of experience in say, excel, and you don't believe you have that, think again. Have you done excel things for your church or an organization some? That counts. Even if its less than a year, say a month, put you have a year. Don't think of it as lying, the past two jobs I've held I don't think I even met the requirements.... even though I excelling in them.

**Speak to Recruiters**

To get in touch with a recruiter, go to Facebook - Publix Careers! [Link here.](https://www.facebook.com/publixcareers/)

Just like the regular Publix Facebook, people get assigned to monitor the posts, and they can initiate a call with you to engage more personally. Be professional on there, and make yourself sound intelligible. I would not recommend to email them as the emails go straight to the junk mail as its not from a Publix email address, and most people usually delete them as we are over cautious with external emails, especially ones with attachments."

7av981,1,2017-11-04,I don't feel like I fit in or belong at my university,cscqthwy,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/7av981/i_dont_feel_like_i_fit_in_or_belong_at_my/,"Hey, I'm a Junior at a university that's known mainly for partying and football, two of my least favorite things. I'm a pretty geeky, mellow, introverted dude. I like playing PC games and am currently interested in developing them. I knew that I probably wouldn't enjoy it here before I even got here, but due to a lack of planning and knowledge by both myself and my parents, I ended up here anyway. I constantly fantasize about what it would have been like to have gone to a different school, or what it would be like to transfer now. I'm in Computer Science, and our department is very small and unknown. We have a small CS club that only meets when I have class.

I understand that partying, football, and greek life can hypothetically be avoided at any college, but I feel that this school attracts very different people from myself because of its reputation regarding those things. People tell me to go to clubs that interest me, but I've found that there aren't a lot of clubs for stuff I actually care to invest time in, and even if I went and met people, they'll still be very ""different"" from myself. I also can't really go to parties--I'm not in a frat and don't get invited to them. Even if I went to a party, I would be very self-conscious about being surrounded by huge brodudes and sorority girls, neither of which I can hold a conversation with. Without giving away too much, even the location of this school is not at all ideal for someone like me, and one of the main activities to do in town is clubbing. I've tried it, and it was a pretty shitty experience. I generally think that a lot of my social issues would be minimal or nonexistent had I gone elsewhere.

One of my biggest problems because of all of this is that I end up blaming a lot of my problems on this school. Can't find friends that I can actually relate to? Blame the school. Can't find a girlfriend? Blame the school. Difficulty getting internships? Blame the school. Feel inadequate at programming? Blame the school. This is not a minor problem--it's made me feel isolated, and given me a lot of depression and self-hatred because I could have chosen to go somewhere else--or transferred sooner.

I know that I only have a year and a half left, but that's part of the problem. I feel like I've squandered my chance at a great college experience. I've never had a girlfriend or even a hookup, and I don't feel like I've made many lasting friendships here. With the exception of a few people, I can't really relate to most of my friends here the same way I did with my friends from high school, because they are usually very different ""types"" of people than myself.

I may take a gap semester in the future for unrelated reasons. Should I apply to different schools then? Of course if I transfer, it will make everything harder. I'll probably have to trudge through more classes than I would if I just stayed here. I won't have any friends initially. My grades and credits may not transfer completely. It seems silly at this point. I could try, but I don't think it's a realistic goal, really.

So how do I cope with being here? How do I not get depressed like I generally do every year here? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing?"

Harvey and Brett don't appreciate the ""prank"" as much as Kevin does so they call their buddy Jeremy Piven to pick them up. The three head to an open-bathrobe party at Ben Affleck's house

Meanwhile, Kevin is stuck in the ""bar"" but Peyton Manning is too old for him. So he orders a time machine from France, expedited shipping courtesy of Roman Polanski. The time machine arrives and he sets the year to 1991 and initializes the warp, but it malfunctions and Kevin Spacey finds himself in Dustin Hoffman's trailer on the set of Hook. Hoffman is reading his lines in the nude while hair and make-up try not to notice the fact he is furiously masturbating while doing so. Kevin Spacey leaves before things get sticky, and wanders out onto the set. He finds Bryan Singer and Jared Fogle hiding in the bushes eating Subway sandwiches. They are looking over a stolen copy of the script, excited about the fact there are so many child actors playing the lost boys in the film.

Steven Spielberg and Robin Williams show up on set and hear rustling in the bushes. To their horror they find Jared, Kevin and Bryan jerking each other off.. Their arms interlinked in the shape of a pentagram. All three men ejaculate onto the script before Steven and Robin can stop them, and the script bursts into flames while the three morph into giant demons. The pedophile demons begin to destroy the set looking for the lost boys while Robin does some quick thinking.. He gets an idea.. He drags Steven to his trailer... The two consume all of Robin Williams' supply of cocaine in 10 seconds. They actually do so much blow, [that they can literally fucking fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkdqePJA1N4)

They battle the three horny horned perverts from hell, Shadow of the Colossus style while the sky turns red and the earth begins to split open. The apocalypse has come. Robin Williams flys his sword right up Jared Fogle's ass and knocks him down the crevice, back to hell. Bryan Singer is no match for the coked out duo and his dick is sliced off by Steven Spielberg in a glorious cinematic ""schiiiiing."" But Spacey is the final boss. They hack away at his junk to no avail.. It has metamorphasised into an Academy Award!

They finally hack it off.. Best supporting actor for Ususal Suspects my ass! But he.. He sprouts another one. Even bigger and shinier! For Best Actor this time.. For 1999's American Beauty! FUCK 

""We can't.. fight him... He's from the future! We don't ...have any academy awards yet!"" Steve Spielberg and Robin shout at each other

The struggle continues until something remarkable happens. Dustin Hoffman's trailer explodes as he grows to 100 feet tall. His giant golden balls clanging together. TWO BEST ACTOR AWARDS! Kramer vs Kramer and Rain man! Oh fuck!!!

He's locked and loaded and been thinking about interns all day, and now he's taking aim at Spacey. ""Whomst interrupted my fap?"" he bellows

""Let's get the fuck out of here!"" Spielberg shouts as he and Robin Willaims fly away. Dustin then unloads a sperm-tsunami that drowns Kevin Spacey, destroying the earth and all of humanity.

But lo and behold, Kevin pulled another Keyser Soze on us, as he floats through the cosmos as celestial pedo-dust.

Extraterrestrial beings pick up the Kevdust via their tractor beam and run him through their materialization lab. They construct a holochemographic version of Kevin Spacey and bring him to their supreme leaders.

""So uhm, do you mind explaining what the fuck happened to earth?"" they ask him.

Kevin Spacey takes a long deep, breath.

""I'm gay."""

7avw7t,1,2017-11-05,Should I study abroad if I'm already doing my degree 'abroad' ?,memomelo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7avw7t/should_i_study_abroad_if_im_already_doing_my/,"TL;DR : 

- Doing degree in Tokyo, planning a year abroad in London, UK (where I had briefly lived in before)

- Scared splitting time between 2 cities would do me more harm than good since haven't really experience all that Japan have to offer just yet.

- Also scared that I won't make lasting friendship since I have only recently made friends in Japan in my 2nd year if I were to leave next year and graduate at different time compared to them.



For some context, I'm currently a 2nd year student studying in 
Tokyo, Japan planning to go abroad in my 3rd year (specifically London) but...well abroad isn't really abroad because I have lived in London before but I want to return since most of my friends based in London would be graduating + different courses selection, easier access to internships and opportunities to travel around Europe.

But on the other hand, I have also been reconsidering my decision lately since I honestly haven't been in Japan for that long + I spent most of my first year here not being very social so I have only recently made more friends to enjoy the ""real college life"". Not to mention, my Japanese is passable but not by any mean stellar so staying would probably be better if I want to improve. I have also been holding back on joining clubs or taking up part time jobs since I have the mindset that I might leave in the 4th semester.

So now I have to make the choice between fully committing to my current abroad experience in Japan or just go to London anyway. I'm honestly excited to live in London again on one hand but also afraid that I haven't made enough ties or learn all I wanted to learn in Tokyo + since post-study abroad I would be graduating at a different time than my friends in Japan right now.
I'm scared that if I split my times between the two cities, I'd end up with no close friends in the long run(of course this really depends but people tend to be closer if you're around physically for longer ya know...) + might come out of my 4 years with sub-par Japanese. 

There's just a lot of things to consider and I don't expect most people to have similar experience but... thoughts ?"
7aw5ng,0,2017-11-05,Question to IT / computer science workers as a graduate AI student at Japanese university,NumesSanguis,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/7aw5ng/question_to_it_computer_science_workers_as_a/,"By following this forum, I discovered that actually a lot of people here work in IT, hence this question.

**How did you find your job in Japan and do you have any advice?**

I'm a 2nd year master student at a top university in Japan studying **AI**. I'll **graduate September 2018**, hence my first problem that I cannot follow traditional 就活 (job hunting), except if I want to wait half a year.

My self-assessed **Japanese** ability is somewhat like: Listing N2, Speaking N3, Reading N3, writing N4. I manage daily conversations (I've done an internship in a Japanese company), but it's not enough for say Japanese clients. My aim is to reach N2 by the time I graduate (+1 year), but that's not really helpful for job-hunting now.

My interest is not into making as much money as possible (as long as it is decent), and I (still) like Japan (been here for 2 years). My priority is **improving my skills**, such as programming / data analysis / deep learning. I'm not too much interested in  life-time employment, as I would feel more comfortable having a strong skill-set, so I can always find another job. I have a stronger Psychology background than most ITers, but weaker mathematically, therefore I'm interested in working with more human interaction. I was thinking of consultancy, such as Accenture or Recruit.

The Boston career forum (Japanese-English Bilinguals) 2017 is coming up (Nov 17-19), but is it worth it to spend 9万 for a return flight ticket?

TL;DR: Please tell me how you got your IT/AI job and what advice you have to an AI student that graduates masters in September 2018.

**Edit**: I feel like I gave a bit of a wrong impression. I would like to hear more of your stories how you got in the IT position you are now. I gave such an elaborate background to give an idea in what kinds of stories I'm interested. I still have to do more research for what works best for me, but I thought it would be nice to hear your stories, so that I know in what direction to look. So **please share your stories** :) Although I also appreciate all the advise."
7aw7q3,1,2017-11-05,Not really sure what's going on with my life. Advice please?,walking-segfault,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7aw7q3/not_really_sure_whats_going_on_with_my_life/,"Throwaway account here. I could really use some life advice. 

When I was in high school, I was incredibly depressed. I remember days where I couldn't even get out of bed, or when I would skip school to go sit in my car, just to be away from everybody. There are a couple of really unique reasons for this. The first was that I had a bit of memory damage, and forgot most of my childhood and early life, which was just bizarre. The second is that my older brother is brilliant. It would always wear me down when people would hear that we were related, and increase their expectations for me purely off of that. It drove me a bit nuts, and I never really tried to study because I didn't think it was worth it. 

This all changed in my senior year when one of my teachers that had taught both my brother and I pulled me aside, just to let me know that she would always be willing to help me academically, and that I could do anything that he could if I put the time in. This had a pretty astounding impact on me, and I started studying incredibly hard that year. I'm in my senior year of college now, and have done pretty spectacularly in undergrad considering where I was at in high school. I've kept a 4.0 in computer engineering, published multiple papers, completed internships working on stuff like self-driving cars and cognitive robotics, and a lot of other neat stuff. I have so many more friends to support me than I did back then, and have really branched out into more productive hobbies like piano and rock climbing.

Here's the thing, and this may sound a little ridiculous. The kinds of jobs that I want really require a Ph. D or Master's + extensive experience. Lots of people tell me that based off of what I've done, I should be able to get a job, and that's true; but not the ones that I want. There's a difference between being capable and being qualified. The most qualified undergrad in the world wouldn't be able to get a job asking for a Ph. D, simply because it's almost impossible to get an interview due to automatic filtering on applications, etc.

With what I've produced in undergrad, I really have a good shot at going to a school like MIT, Stanford, or Berkeley. But my parents really won't support me on it (I understand not wanting to pay for my master's, but Ph. Ds are typically funded). They really are incredible people, and always try to be supportive, but it's not hard to see what they want me to do when they call me every couple of days to ask how interviews are going, etc.

I don't want to worry my parents by going against them on this, but I guess it just feels like everything I've worked for in undergrad has been for such a weak payoff that I'm really burning out in a terrible way. I guess it's because computer engineering is incredibly difficult to ace, and now my motivation is pretty much gone. For the first time since high school, I'll wake up in the middle of the night having panic attacks. There'll be days that I'll skip class because I just can't wake up, because it took me such a long time to fall asleep. 

Please, if anyone could offer any sort of advice, either specific to handling my situation, or just relaxing a little bit, I would really appreciate it. It honestly feels like I'm always on the verge of crying, and if this goes on for much longer, it could really hurt my future."
7aw8n5,26,2017-11-05,"My mother is starting to realize that I [23, M] am not heterosexual, and it angers me how she's handling it.",thewhitemasque,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7aw8n5/my_mother_is_starting_to_realize_that_i_23_m_am/,"Hi. I'm a 23 year old man living at home with my parents while I finish grad school. I've always known I've been into men from a very young age, but I consider myself bisexual. I've never told any of my family and few of my close friends know. Some were able to intuit it. 

Anyway, I started exploring my sexuality with men when I got into college at 18 and have steadily developed it through the present day. I am more easily attracted to other men physically and sexually, but I feel like I can connect with women more emotionally. 

Regardless, two nights ago this guy [21, M] I've been talking to asks me if I want to come over to his place. I said okay. He said he's running errands first and then he can pick me up. I waited over an hour and I almost end up falling asleep. He texts me after midnight saying that he is arrived, so I leave the house. I'm wearing pajama bottoms. We are together at his house, in his bedroom, until about 2:30am. I ask him to take me back home and he does so. I walk through the door at about 2:45. Mother, as luck would have it, is a long time insomniac, so of course she was awake, getting coffee or something from the kitchen and very groggy. As she's walking up the stairs she asks me what I'm doing. I said I was at a friend's. She asks, ""In your pajamas?"" I said yes. She mumbles something and continues upstairs to her room. I take my coat off and do the same.

 I sleep until about 11am the next day, get up, take a shower, and eat breakfast. Father is at work and Mother is running errands. Just me and the dog. I'm still very tired so I go back in my bed around noonish and sleep until 2:40. I spend the next couple hours in my room doing homework on my laptop. Mother is getting ready to go out to dinner with Father when he comes home from work. At about 6pm I go downstairs for a drink. Since this is the first time she's seen me all day, she's a little verbal. ""You went out in your PJs last night and got home very late. Is everything alright?"" What an odd question. Why would something be wrong? I told her yes, I was just hanging out with a friend. She asked what we were doing together. I said just hanging out (a lie). She started doing something else so I went back up to my room. 

Father comes home and I can hear them talking from the stairwell. I come from a religious conservative family, and I myself am a non-denominational Christian. My parents are bigoted. Particularly Mother. That's the long and short of it. Of course I love her, but hearing her speak about politics and religion makes me want to rip my hair out she's so fucking ignorant. 

After some idle chatting, I overhear Mother voicing her concerns to Father, which went something like this: ""So Jacob went out to see some friend last night and came home really late in his pajamas. I honestly have so much shit going through my head right now. I think your son might be a little ipsy-doodle (whatever the shit that means)...I swear, I will send him to shock therapy."" Shock therapy, she said. I can't fucking believe it, but at the same time it's so like her to say something needlessly radical. Also, note how she said to Father ""your son"" instead of ""our son,"" like she couldn't even be associated with non-heterosexual offspring. 

I suppose I couldn't keep this a secret from the family forever, especially if I still live with my parents. However, I now know exactly how I'll be welcomed if I for some ridiculous reason decide to come out to my parents. With disbelief and attempted rectification. I have the suspicion that Mother will start asking me some questions soon. The thing is, I'm 23. I'm an adult now. I'm hoping to move the fuck out within a year if I get a good offer for a school psychology internship. Why should I have to explain to my parents anything about my life, who's in it, and what I choose to do with them? Especially to the likes of one as bigoted as Mother, who could not bear the embarrassment of having a non-heterosexual son. I'd honestly be perfectly happy not talking to either of my parents until I move out, until I'm fully free to be my own person. 

I truthfully have the suspicion that if I were to come out to my parents, we'd have an unnecessarily heated argument that would end with me being kicked out and unable to finish school. To be honest it seems easier to be secretive and, if necessary, lie about my sexuality until I can get out rather than go through the hassle of explaining things to rigidly conservative parents

I was honestly so upset about what Mother said that I didn't do anything the rest of the night. I was a zombie
 The guy asked me if we could see each other that evening, but I told him no; I wanted to be alone. He got quite upset and it's my fault. 
I guess I wanted to ask the community for advice on next steps, should any even be necessary.

TL;DR My mom said she'd send me to shock therapy if she found out I was gay. Like seriously, wtf"

1. I'll get a degree from ""University of Washington"", for which I'm a huge fan. It's funny that I just figured out UW is multi-campus university unlike UC or UT schools, which are totally independent.

2. UW-Tacoma CSS program is no comparable to UW-Seattle CSE, which is in the same league with MIT/Berkeley/Stanford programs; but looks already quite good to me, or at least way better than I used to think. I went through their course slides and homework assignments, and I do think that's UW-level, and nothing less challenging than those big name school (I'm also taking online MSCS from Georgia Tech). Also, students accepted into their Master program I've known so far all have very strong backgrounds, which is surprising for me. Maybe this is due to UW-Seattle CS is soooooo impossible to get in.....

3. I've visited Seattle, which is so cool, and much more lovely place for me and my spouse to settle down. I don't like Bay Area with unbelievably expensive housing price and huge crowds.

4. Most important reason: I guess Seattle is offering lots of SDE jobs, and to some extent would prefer local students, esp. UW students?  During my trip to Seattle, I heard people say Seattle economy is booming, expanding, because many IT companies flooding in and establishing their office in Seattle. Is that true? Also, greater Seattle region doesn't have that many schools like other regions, say Boston; thus UW students would have a very high chance to find a job? But would UW-Tacoma CS student be counted as UW students by HR?

Also, I'm new grad, eager to find intern. It's getting tougher and tougher for new grad, as many people are transferring to CS major. So maybe Silicon Valley is still the best place for new grad to secure the first job?

Eager to listen to any comments or suggestions. Many thanks!"

How hard/demanding does a coding challenge have to be to have you say ""fuck it I'm out.""

also, if someone could give their own perspective; i was under the impression that most coding challenges had a couple of questions that you code a solution to, but my most recent coding challenge involved deploying a web app that functioned as a chatroom (allow users to login, start private conversations with other users online, etc.). Now, I'm unfamiliar with whatever modules and libraries they want me to use, but I'm pretty sure I could do it in another language so I think I could bruteforce it if necessary, but I don't know if this coding challenge is asking a lot and I don't particularly feel like wasting a weekend doing free labor."

Sorry if this is the wrong place, but anyways. 

Quick about me: GPA: 3.66, research experience X 3, completed exchange at Top 50 school (1 semester), 2 side projects. Finishing my second degree (major in CS). Because i already possessed a degree, I was able to fast-track this one (2 years instead of 3.5). Downside is that I only had one summer to complete an internship and was by no-means ready to do so. 


** Option A: Internship over the summer (if I manage to get one), delay graduation by 4 months. ** 

- pros: work experience and dollars (we all love those). 

- Cons: Home school is O.K for its computer science rankings (somewhere in the top 250) probably not as well known. 

** Option B: Finish my degree over the summer by taking courses at a top university in Canada. Graduate, and then begin looking for internships/jobs. ** 

- pros: Resume contains two top 50 CS schools, as well as home school (top 250). Able to work on side projects for longer which may be more helpful into obtaining the job in the field that I want. Graduate end of summer, can do internships then or find a job. 

- cons: would graduate with zero internship experience (although I have 3 different research experiences all in CS and side projects), and No dollars :(


Suggestions? 

Thanks in advance!

7axiu9,4,2017-11-05,I think my Crohn's is back and I need to rant...,JumpingPoppy,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/7axiu9/i_think_my_crohns_is_back_and_i_need_to_rant/,"Hey, guys. I thought I'd come on here to rant for a bit, as I'm feeling really down on myself today.

I was officially diagnosed with Crohn's in January this year. I got started on medication two months later and, by late August, my blood tests had come back with no signs of inflammation at all. Most of my symptoms had gone away entirely and both my GP and my GI were very confident in calling this ""biochemical remission"". My GI said I should get another colonoscopy in January/February 2018 to make sure I truly was in remission, but she was pretty sure the results would be great. I was ecstatic, obviously. I know from reading on forums and all that that things rarely happen this fast for other Crohnies, so I felt immensely lucky. Flashforward to October, where I started being pretty sure my Crohn's is back. 

Now, a bit about me. I'm a senior in college and, for the last year of our program, we have to spend most of the year on placement. It's pretty much an internship, but it's mandatory and unpaid. I currently work for about 8-9 hours a day on my placement, then I also have to create reports and case studies to hand over at school, and then I also need to get things done for my freelancing job that pays my bills. It's been hell. When it was just classes and my job, things were great. With all the placement work, though, it's been really wearing me out. Fortunately, my Crohn's fatigue was over so I legitimately thought I could do all of this, but about 2-3 weeks into my placement, I started feeling it all over again. First it was the fatigue, then it was random cramps, now it's fatigue + random cramps + an almost everpresent pain in my abdomen and far more frequent visits to the bathroom.

When I went to show my blood tests to my doctor (the ones that showed biochemical remission), he only told me two things: keep taking your medication and avoid stress. I've been taking all my medication alright, but as for stress? Well, that's been all my life has consisted of since my placement started. And the shitty thing is - I can't do anything to avoid it. I need my placement to graduate, I need to do schoolwork to graduate, I need my freelancing job. I literally can't give up any of these, so I have no choice other than sacrificing my health in order to have a chance of graduating. 

I'm feeling like crap right now. Thanks for reading my rant, guys :("

She even approved of Asher like an older sister would do!

She is of course an hard worker but ... she seems a good person. 

Now my question is ... is she really good or she is gonna be revelead as a new enemy for the K4 and Annalise ?

She works for the Castillo family but just as a lawyer of she is aware of the murders and the other bad things Mr Castillo does ?

And so is she acting the part of the good boss or she is really good and ... that in the series would mean that she'll probably die!

7axnz6,9,2017-11-05,I am unable to get along with strangers,slightlydazed_,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7axnz6/i_am_unable_to_get_along_with_strangers/,"This is my first time writing about this and asking for advice on this platform in general. 
So, I just started uni a few weeks ago. I'm studying law. I live in Berlin, Germany and have lived here for about 3 or 4 years. I am 18, almost 19 years old. 

In summer I broke up with my long-term partner. We'd been best friends for years and went through a lot of shit together as a couple. I recognized that I didn't feel the same things for them as they did for me and that I didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. We parted without fighting and in the beginning, I took it okay - I felt like a huge burden was lifted from me and was hopeful for the future. Since I wanted to give them time to process everything and get over me, we didn't stay in contact up until last week. 
After the breakup I was on holiday with my family and back at my internship at a theater immediately after. Only when my internship ended and the semester began I realized just how truly FUCKED I was regarding my social life: I have no friends. I had been relying on my partner so much that now they were gone, there was no one left whom I really trusted. I still have my twin sister and my family but I just feel that the relationship to a friend is something very different from the relationship to a sister, especially since we have starkly different personalities. 

I really wanted to make friends in Uni but somehow I fucked up every opportunity. I figured out that talking to strangers for no apparent reason besides wanting to socialize is something I cannot do. Standing in a room with several hundred others whom I don't know and just walking up to someone seemed do-able in my head but when I was in the situation I just panicked. When we went drinking in small groups I got so dead drunk immediately that I left before getting to know anyone (I was that nervous). 
Now I'm a few weeks into the semester. I didn't make even one aquaintance. 

I don't get this - after all, I'm not a shy person. I can easily hold presentations, ask questions in front of many people or participate in discussions. If I know someone, I can talk their damn ear off. The problem is: I'm fine, when there's a REASON to talk or when I am SUPPOSED or ALLOWED to talk. Asking someone for their name or just iniciating a conversation with a stranger bc I find them attractive doesn't have an actual reason. I get so scared that I'd be embarassing myself or that people wouldn't want me to talk to them or be annoyed that I can't bring myself to even try. I found that just accepting the fact that I can't do this makes it a lot easier to survive social events and my classes because desperately trying to do this and failing everytime gets me terrified and depressed during and after the event. 

The biggest problem is: this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I'm already struggling with depression and I'm on medication. I don't have a therapist atm and for various reason I really don't want to get one. Usually, I'd just wait until time and luck makes me find new friends but right now I'm desperate for contact to another person, if I don't solve this somehow I'm just going to get more and more depressed and suicidal, I really don't want that to happen.

I feel like I'm a failure of a human being, I don't know if I'm actually ABLE to be normal around others. I get so tense and scared, also people never approach me on their own - probably because you can literally see how bad I feel on my face. I'll just stare at someone while fighting in my head about wether I should talk to them and that probably terrifies people!! Damn.

Whenever I'm somewhere with others I feel like I need to leave immediately or they'll think I'm weird and obtrusive. But normal people probably don't do that, right? Is it fine to linger around? Is it normal to initiate conversations? I don't get this. Can someone please explain the rules of socializing in college? I really don't want to bother anyone or make anyone uncomfortable.

TL;DR: After breaking up with my long-term partner, I found myself having no friends. I struggle in pursuing new people and at this point my non-existent social life is taking a toll on my mental health. How can I solve this? "

TL:DR: GPA is below a 3.00, can't find any internships, scared for future.


I know tese types of posts are a dime a dozen, but I need a venting outlet as much as I need the advice. I'm an aerospace engineering student currently in my junior year. Over the summer I failed a course, which brought my GPA below a 3.00, to a 2.94. I'm currently retaking the course, and doing much better, (On track to get an A-) but I can't shake the feeling that I've screwed myself out of internship opportunities for the summer by failing the course instead of just dropping it.


I've applied to around 20 internships, and so far, absolutely no response of any kind from anyone. I've seen people on the sub say they've applied to 50-60 internships, and only get a handful of interviews/offers, but with each application I fill out I feel it's more and more pointless, ESPECIALLY when I hear my classmates talk constantly about their next interview.


I've been to career fairs and events, and have been told by recruiters ""You have great experience, but your GPA is too low for us"" which only further demoralizes me. I've been trying to pursue opportunities with smaller companies, but with aerospace, I find it difficult to find any. I suppose my biggest fear is that I won't be a viable candidate academically until the summer after I graduate, at which point, recruiters/employers will question why I haven't had any professional experience."

All of that happened within the past three years. I stopped using drugs about four years ago. I also had an eating disorder, EDNOS...a mix of calorie restriction, binging, purging, fasting, excessive exercise, diet pills, extreme weight fluctuations etc.


I stopped using drugs, and my eating balanced out for awhile, but I never worked on anything. I never worked on my coping skills, my depression, anxiety, etc. Now, very slowly, over the past several months I've been spiraling out of control.

At first I'd just take half a benadryl to help me sleep. Now I might take three benadryl, take a large ""sip"" of Nyquil, have a few beers or a few shots...""for sleep."" But it's ""okay"" because my kid is asleep.


Or I might have a beer or a shot while taking a bath in the middle of the day...because, ""one beer isn't going to affect anything."" Or I might have a couple beers before a class, because goddamnit, I'm almost 30 and if I want to have a couple beers with dinner, I will.


Or if I have a headache, I might take four ibuprofen and drink some Dayquil. I've started to secretly throw out the bottles.

During the day I've been drinking half a pot of coffee, an energy drink or two, and taking ECA stacks. (Ephedra, caffeine, aspirin.)


If I have a stressful day, I might whip up a couple dozen cookies and eat them all while studying.

I've been thinking about heroin. I'm not actually considering buying it, but I'm having the same type of intrusive, intense thoughts I had right after I quit. 


I don't have insurance, and I don't have much time or money. I've been getting very little sleep due to how busy I've been. There are counseling services at my university, but I've been advised not to go there. I'm wanting to get an internship there (yes, doing counseling) and one of the student counselors might be in my Ph.D. program. Or the person supervising might end up being one of my instructors.

I'm gaining a tremendous amount of weight, I physically feel like garbage and my anxiety is at an all time high. I just don't know what to do at this point.

7aymhr,15,2017-11-05,My METOO STORY- PLEASE READ,tactical-moustache,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7aymhr/my_metoo_story_please_read/,"Over the past few weeks, I've struggled with what medium is correct for sharing this story. I don't know how to get the feelings out, and I'm so scared people are going to tell me I'm lying because of just how fantastical it is. So maybe I should start by saying however crazy, this happened to me, and I've been carrying it around with me for far too long. For years I believed the lies he told me, how he had proof that everything was consensual, not realizing that i was just falling into his trap again and again. Let’s call my boss “ Bill”. I was a young male of 18, fresh off the mom and dad boat and making my way into the real world. By some miracle ( at 22 the miracle is now more apparent to me) I scored a job at a traveling zoo that runs a course from virginia to georgia, stopping at county fairgrounds and community festivals, sometimes doing college lectures and rescue efforts as well. I thought I was happy as can be, feeding and caring for monkeys and kangaroos and even a big tiger. I was a dumb fucking kid. Over the course of six months from october 2013 to march 2014 bill raped me 5 times. When I came back to the establishment in 2015 to false promises he raped me again. He convinced me that it was all consensual and he promised me things, but when i didn’t want to do it, he would coerce me harder and harder until I gave in. he drugged me on three separate occasions with opiates to have his way more easily. He insisted on not using protection because he was allergic to latex. It started early on, when I first arrived to work at the zoo, although for him, the planning probably started when he picked up the telephone and heard easy prey on the other line. The funny thing is, when i called him to ask about the job, i was suspicious of his establishment. Something didn’t add up. I called him out on it, said his pitch sounded like bait, he got upset and hung up. I called my mother to tell her about the job prospect and how it sounded weird and together we looked online. This man was famous. He had animals on the today show. His monkeys were in movies and perched on actor’s shoulders. I fucked up. I called him back apologizing. And of course he accepted. The next week I was on a bus down to the zoo and there we were, in the midst of a carnival, training monkeys and riding camels and horses and all was well for a few days. So i thought. The first night i got shitfaced at a party the fair was throwing. Bill noted my attraction to alcohol. The first weekend, Bill saw the flirty attention I was taking to look at a gentleman in the crowd. But Bill also saw the same flirty attention I was giving to a female in the crowd. Bill took note of my sexual confusion. I remember the first night we drove together in the main semi, after the fair was over and we were packed heading to the next location. His tone got more and more sly as we talked through the night, I remember him telling me stories i would one day find out were lies, but at the time, I trusted him and they awed me. I was a sheltered kid and i didn’t know any better. And then i heard him say “ who don’t you give it a little wiggle”. I looked over and he had his fucking cock out. I’m 18, alone in a semi with a guy who’s bigger than me, away from all known family and friends, traveling to god knows where in the middle of the night. The situation has delved into creepy as hell and it’s all my fault, but I do it, because, what the hell, it’s only a cock and i can’t lose this job and be dumped in the middle of the road. I wish I had made him pull over then. I can’t fucking BELIEVE i didn’t realize how BAD that situation was. I had no idea how hard it would traumatize me. Time number one. In november we made our way to savannah georgia, for an annual festival at a racetrack. Bill had a partnership with a hotel there and they paid a contract to stay on the racetrack/golf course for the entire month, bringing our animal activities to the public attending. Of course, with that contract came hotel rooms, and that’s when my hell really started. The first time, Brian brought all of us to the hotel to sleep (didn’t happen very often,because usually we had to stay with the animals and make sure they were ok) and at the last second, pulled a switcheroo and told me I’d be staying with him. Him asking me to give him a back massage ( which, again, far away from my family or friends) ended up with him being naked, and that turned into him coercing me to take my clothes off, because he just wanted to see, and before i know it I’m in the middle of his fucked up fantasy. Another man using you in that way without your permission is probably the worst feeling i can describe, and that time fucking hurt. I can remember how it felt to this second. I thought about leaving that night, but where the hell was i going to go. And then that happened again. And again. He made me send him text messages “telling him what i wanted him to do to me” and i would just make stuff up because i didn’t know what else to say. This was the clincher. I knew the second i’d try to tell someone these messages would come out and nobody would ever believe me. He’d had other interns before me and I’m pretty sure he did this with all of them. The third time he brought a bottle of pills and told me to take one. It was oxycontin and it made things a little bit easier. This whole time he convinced me if i told anyone, my life would be over, he’d out me to my family, he’d tell them all the nasty things we did together. On the fourth time, I finally had the strength to leave. I waited til night,I made it as far as the hotel itself from the racetrack before I realized it was cold and HE realized I was gone. I think he knew I was going to tell the police so he begged me to come back. He bought me a plane ticket home to my parents that night and he told me to take a vacation. I don’t think he was thinking very clearly. I never got on the return flight. I never wanted to see him again. In 2015 I began to miss my animals, badly, and the trauma from the previous events hadn’t fully taken over my life. Like the dumb kid i was, I decided to give Bill another try. I rang him up and he told me everyone out there missed me, and if I came on down, We would talk about how things were better (there were other problems I was having beyond the obvious one with Bill). I made my bed on the couch at his place when i drove down, because someone was in the spare room, and i thought that would be sufficient enough to keep things pg. I was wrong. I hadn’t even been in the house for 5 hours when Bill decided to pull his shit again. I told him I was going to yell out and he still put his hands down my pants. I should have yelled. I left again that night, drove all the way back to my home in california, and i told myself that that was the end of bill. I couldn’t prove he raped me, so i needed to move on with my life. I can’t move on. This tears at me almost daily. I’ve literally never typed it out before, and I’m sorry that details are so sparse, but actually reading it like this, I can’t believe how fucked up it sounds. Any questions that might clear up an inconsistency I’m happy to answer. I’m not looking for sympathy, but I want to be able to share this with someone, ANYONE before it eats me alive. This man is still my facebook friend and every day I see him with another success i will never have, because of the things he’s done to my body and head. The fact that i let him get away with doing something like this to a young adult makes me want to kill myself."
7ayn34,48,2017-11-05,Reading through the posts of people fresh out of college looking for jobs is terrifying. What can I do during my senior year to prep myself for post-grad?,stressed_cs_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ayn34/reading_through_the_posts_of_people_fresh_out_of/,"I recently discovered this subreddit and have read through the sidebar and top posts. Using a throwaway since there will be some personal info here and I don't need my Reddit history info attached to that.

I'm expected to graduate at the end of Summer 2018  (about August). I've applied to a few internships so far. My degree is a B.A. in Computer Systems. My college isn't anything special, it doesn't show up on any top lists. I'll be looking for internships and work in the southern California, Orange County area and beyond.

I know my resume isn't as impressive as some people I've seen here. I put some languages I know and have used in school like C++, Java, HTML, and CSS, but I'm not sure how good I need to be to say I'm proficient, you know? I've used C++ the most, but I haven't in a long time. If you asked me to write a terminal program right now, I'd be googling a lot of things to refresh my memory. What do employers expect when you say you know a language? Or are ""proficient"" in it?

As far as projects go, for class I've done a LAMP server with different user level logins, as well as a DevOps project. Both I only have pages of extensive, detailed documentation with code, no online example. Other than that, over summer I was making a game in GameMaker 1.4 (which uses a priority GML language) for an independent study class. It looks impressive as far as the hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code, as well as considering I did all the art and music, but it's incomplete and GameMaker has no real job applications. How are these projects? Once again, if you asked me right now to build a LAMP server, for example, I'm going to refer to my documentation and google things. If you asked questions about it, my memory is hazy. Is that expected?

Other than that, my main hobby is music and I've produced plenty of albums in plenty genres, played shows, work with local bands, and stuff like that. I have thousands of plays. I just don't really put that on my resume too much. Is this something worth noting?

So, with all that information, what should I be doing to prep myself for graduation? What kind of projects should I be working on? What languages should I be learning? Basically, how should I be spending my time? Especially considering right now is the time to apply for summer internships.

I'm seeing a lot of posts here of people with seemingly better resumes than me who have said they've applied to 200+ jobs with no luck which is terrifying for me. At least I can say I believe I'm a good interviewer and personable. I've had good success applying and getting part time jobs over the years.

One last quick aside (sorry for the long post), my name is foreign. It isn't too clear where from unless you're from there. The pronunciation isn't easy but is very memorable once you know. People usually get a kick out of it and crack a joke since it is kind of funny. English is my first language and I was born and raised here, though. How should I tackle this issue on my resume and applications?

Thank you so much for any and all responses."

Ferencváros (abbreviated as FTC) ultras are well known all over Europe. Back in 2004 FTC played a UEFA cup match vs. Millwall, which is notorious for having violent hool fans. After the match in Budapest even the Millwall fans were shocked how brutal and violent FTC ultras are: [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/02/newsstory.sport3); [random blog](http://footballfanaticos.blogspot.hu/2004/10/ferencvaros-millwall.htm)

Three (or four) british fans were stabbed, a lot injured and the match was remembered for the racist chants against black Millwall players. Seemed like it was a wake up call to to do something against for football violence and hooliganism in Hungary. Spoiler alert: It only became worse since then.

This is where politics come in. Bear with me, it is actually relevant. In 2006 we had a leftist government and the ""right to far-right"" opposition (=Fidesz) tried everything to illegitimise them. The leftist prime minister had a non-public speech with the coalition which was leaked, in that speech he admitted it was impossible to govern properly (because of the external and internal opposition) and he used swearwords concerning the country. It is known as the [Öszöd speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%90sz%C3%B6d_speech). Obviously the really ""patriotic"" ultras and right wing fanatics didnt like to hear things like ""this whore country"" from the PM so [riots started](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_Hungary) all over Budapest. 

Fidesz had a politician called [Gábor Kubatov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A1bor_Kubatov). You can see the wiki page has two fun facts about him: 1. he only gave one speech in parliament in 11 years. 2. There are two footages about him when he tells interns to actively violate the law (even having a list of voters were illegal back then). To be honest noone knows what this guy does, officially he is in charge of mobilizing the supporters of Fidesz. 

Fidesz won the elections in 2010 (and 2014). There were quite a few rumors back in 2006 about Kubatov orchestrating the ultras and hooligans during the 2006 protests. These rumors were indirectly confirmed when Kubatov bought the security firm involved in protecting the FTC stadium during matches a few months after Fidesz won. A year later Kubatov became the president of FTC, the club were purchased by a shady offshore group in the meantime. 

The connection between Kubatov and the right wing hools is obvious for anyone living in Hungary. There was a really sad case when the opposition tried to have a national vote about sunday business hours. The opposition politician had to give the document to the Election Comitee, but as you can see on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slWgnKqothM) the office of the election comitee was blocked by bald thugs, who are indirectly linked to FTC hooligans. TLDR: Kubatov, the head of FTC is a gangster. 

Meanwhile Fidesz politicians bought a dozen of clubs. We have 12 clubs in hungarian first league, among them Videoton, Ferencváros, Mezőkövesd, Paks, Puskás academy, Haladás is owned by a fidesz politician. 

Here is the fun part. After Kubatov bought FTC he found the club in a mess. No capita, no income, no fans just the hools. FTC was fined each matchday because of the ultras. Kubatov couldn't avoid bankrupcy while keeping the hooligans. So after 2-3 years, he introduced a [vein scanning system](http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_i/video-igy-mukodik-a-venaszkenneles-a-fradi-uj-arenajanal-2348991) to identify ultras who cause the team damages. Obviously the ultras were against this. But since Fidesz won at the elections by a landslide in 2014 there is no need for ultras anymore. Also there is no need for matchday revenues, ticket sales because the Fidesz' football clubs are financed by the budget via [shady and borderline illegal deals](https://444.hu/2017/10/05/veszitett-a-fradi-ki-kell-adnia-mire-koltotte-2011-es-2016-kozott-a-tao-penzeket). (Article is about the court ruling which forces FTC to make public what they spent the money they recived from the budget indirectly. They havent made it public yet, just like the rest of Fidesz owned clubs).

FTC ultras decided they wont go to matches anymore and so they didnt. They missed every match in the last 3 years, the stadium was basically empty but noone cares since ticket revenues are irrelevant here. 3 Years passed without fines and without incidents (if we dont count the Hungary -Romania match where the hungarian hools destroyed part of Budapest for no apparent reason). A new ultra group emerged to power in the FTC stadium called Immortals. They were in charge of chanting and organising support in the stadium. And everything was fine until this week.

There is an election coming and Fidesz is not exactly confident. They need everyone and everything they can mobilize. Since the original FTC ultras began to turn to another party, the right wing Jobbik party, Fidesz and Kubatov decided that they wont let Jobbik have this big slice of the cake. The 10-20.000 hools in Hungary are a group with influence, they needed to get them back.

After 3 years, Kubatov asked them about a truce. They agreed that only the ""management"" of the ultra group should use the vein scanner, the rest can enter the stadium without it. So now we have two ultra groups supporting the same club at the same stadium. Seems like there is no problem, or is there? Well the two groups started provoking each other in the media, on facebook and their websites.  Started with an interview of the old ultra group, in which they said the new group should shut up and fuck off. Then the new group replied on fb ""if you come here for a beating a beating you shall have"". 

Yesterday was the first match where the old ultra group could enter the stadium for the first time in 3 years. They immediately started using [pyros](http://galeria.index.hu/sport/futball/2017/11/04/visszatert_a_fradi-tabor_az_ulloi_uti_stadionba/). It turns out the old group organised an attack on the head of the new group. In half time they went to the toilets, changed clothes and 20+ of them tried to [attack](https://streamable.com/vhwdi) the new group and its leader. The leader of Immortals ""defended himself"" with a knife, [sending two in hospital](https://444.hu/2017/11/04/verekedes-keses-tamadas-a-fradi-meccsen-ketten-sulyosan-megserultek) with serious wounds. The guy was lynched by a dozen people, my friends tell me he lost one of his eye and might live his life in a wheelchair.

Statement by FTC:

„Az FTC, a rendőrséggel együttműködve mindent megtesz az ügy tisztázása érdekében. Az eljárás befejezésééig felfüggeszti az összes érintett szurkoló kártyáját. Nagyon sajnáljuk, ami történt. Az elmúlt három évben, amióta átadtuk a stadiont, ilyen még nem fordult elő.”

""FTC cooperating with the police tries everything to clear up what happened. Until the investigation is over the club suspends the fan-card of every involved individual. We are very sorry for what happened. Since the new stadium is built, since 3 years nothing of this sort has happened.""

Something might actually happen now. Kubatov wants to win an election, he doesnt want to be on the tabloids next to bloody hooligans. Well one thing is certain, I am still now willing to go to a FTC match. Fuck these guys.

7az1ns,1,2017-11-05,"m4f friends, family, neighbors, and more!",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7az1ns/m4f_friends_family_neighbors_and_more/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.

2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.

5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.

I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way."

I went to a SUNY school with a direct funnel to the Big 4. I got my masters and bachelors and am on track for a CPA. I got work at one of the Big 4 and worked there for about a year. After a year, I was laid off due to over-staffing in the department. Officially, I am registered as mutually separated, as per the company's terms on lay-offs. 

I am an eagle scout, I have run a small business out of my dorm room, I had an internship in a small local firm at the beginning of college, I've worked as a consultant for a public company during college for a project, and the such.

Despite this, I cannot find work. I have been out of work since July. I was aware of the upcoming lay-off since March. I was warned from a partner that lay-offs were going to happen and my position was a likely candidate since I had a masters and was thus paid more than other people doing the same work. I was also given 6 weeks severance where I was allowed to say I was still employed. It was technically a ""twilight employment"" if you would.

Despite all those advantages, I am still out of work.

I am working with some staffing companies. I mostly post to job boards like indeed, ziprecruiter, careerbuilder, etc. I live on Long Island and look for work either in NYC, upstate, or LI. I keep all my social media profiles clean as hell and made sure my linkedin had 500+ connections. I have had my resume looked over many times and cleaned up. I have references from my old job as I left on good terms, even gave them some wine on my last day. 

Yet, all I've gotten is two phone interviews (one from a friend of mine's referral) and one face-to-face interview and no offers. 

What am I doing wrong?"
7azlif,5,2017-11-05,Starting a new job after an awkward internship,PseudoscientificCube,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7azlif/starting_a_new_job_after_an_awkward_internship/,"I did a month of internship at this IT company and I feel really bad about it. 

On the first day I was shown to my desk in this huge 20 people open space office and told to wait for the senior that will give me assignments. No one introduced me to the collective nor did i have a chance to do so.

Senior showed up after an hour or so of me just sitting at the computer browsing stuff. No one seemed to care much who I was or what I was doing there. I introduced myself, we shook hands, talked about the project and I started doing the assignment.

The assignments were pretty much individual so I didn't have the chance to cooperate with anyone from the team, besides the two seniors who were supervising me. 

During the month i was there, I didn't even once go into the break room and I always ate lunch alone. I was the only intern plus this was my first work experience(i am a student in my 20s) so I was really terrified. My social awkwardness didn't help much. 

Only two people, from the team, approached me during work, because they were curious what I was doing there, and if i was their new colleague. I introduced myself, smiled, explained i was an intern and that was about all the social interaction i had with the whole team for the whole month. 

Anyway, I got the offer for the job at the end of the internship, was praised for my independence(haha). I was really thinking of declining, because of the whole social experience I had, but at the end I accepted, since my financial situation isn't best and I could really use the work experience on the resume.

A month has passed since the end of the internship, and my first day is tomorrow. I am really terrified/anxious of how its going to go. I really hope I at least get a proper tour and chance to introduce myself now. 

But i am afraid I am going to be shown to the desk again, and left there doing assignments. I could really use few tips or a game plan for tomorrow, so I don't find myself cut out from the team in a month or two.

Should i march into the break room and start introducing myself or should i ask for the lunch invitation(who can i even ask) or how would i even approach the whole ""quiet guy from the internship"" situation.

I don't mind working alone but the awkwardness is killing me. Hope you guys can help me. Thanks.

**TL;DR:** Had an awkward internship, didn't interact socially with the team, got the full time job at the said team, need tips on how to amend myself."

**Job B**:

I can't decide which career characteristics (team/project, salary, location) should be a priority for me. Socially I feel like I'd fit better in the latter with the more interesting location (Job B), but am worried I'm losing out on learning/career opportunities (Job A). Conversely, I'm worried I might hate the team &amp; culture at Job A -- I know certainly I would hate the location. 

If it makes a difference, it's an internship decision, and both companies offer high intern conversion rate so I'm kind of treating it as a full-time decision as well.

7b0292,12,2017-11-05,Should I quit or keep going?-live in nanny advice,Peanutbutter__13,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/7b0292/should_i_quit_or_keep_goinglive_in_nanny_advice/,"I've been a live in nanny for a family since June for two boys ages 10 &amp; 8. A little background knowledge is that tis family had a nanny before me for 4 years before I was hired. My tasks include laundry for the entire family, cooking diner mon-fri, light cleaning, picking the kids up from school, preparing lunches for school, helping the kids with there HW, and buying groceries for the house. Personally, I think it's a lot to get done in 4hrs, and seriously don't know how the past nanny would do it all. That they don't have a back up sitter and constantly ask me to work late, but normally I have HW that needs to get done or rehearsals, so I can't. On top of this job I'm a full time college student, have an internship at a theatre, and take acting classes whenever I can (because I'm majoring in theatre). I moved out of state to get a college degree and take more theatre classes, I didn't move to bend over backwards for my part time job to help me get through school. 
Anyway, the MB expects me to have dinner done by the time the boys get home from school so I can micro manage them with their homework, but they're pretty self sufficient and can get most of the work done on their own, but I'm always willing to help them if they have any questions. 
So this past week was crazy, Monday MB called me and said that the oldest kid was sick at school and needed to be picked up early, luckily I was finished with my classes. So I picked up the kid, who had thrown up 2 times already and still looked pretty pale, so when I brought the kid home I was only concerned about his well being, not the laundry, or dinner, or his HW, because he looked sick so I let him lay down and watch a movie while I gave him a banana and some water. So this day was pretty crazy to begin with and I was a little late getting started on my household duties, naturally when the parents came home I was still finishing up dinner and packing the school lunches. 
MB is a lawyer and her job is pretty stressful, which I understand, and she had to go out of town the next day so she had a lot on her mind. I guess coming home and seeing me making lunches while the boys did their HW made her really mad because she immediately started yelling at me because dinner wasn't ready and the boys needed attention for HW. She went off she was cursing and screaming. I've never been yelled at like that before not even by my own mother, I wanted to cry but held it in until my shift was over. After she yelled she just went up stairs and I finished making dinner. 
I understand that her job is stressful but I think that yelling at me was unprofessional and I'm still an employee, not only that but I still feel hurt. 
This past week has been difficult because the energy in the house has changed and she only apologized for the stress in the house not for yelling at me. I also apologized for not helping the kids with their HW. 
I'm seriously thinking I should find a new job even though its almost the holidays and I've only been there since June, but I don't need more stress in my life and I can't juggle all of the tasks she gives me because I'm part time and only one person. 
I just need help, does this happen a lot? or is this a red flag that I should leave and find a different job? I'm new to the nanny business, but have babysat since I was 12 so I know how to take care of kids. I think this job is asking more than what I am capable of. 
I'm still pretty hurt after she yelled at me. 
Any advice will help! and thanks for reading. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the advice, this is my first true live-in nanny job so I am still learning, and I'm only 19 so I still am trying to learn how to live on my own and grow up. I've decided to start doing weekly emails to the MB/DB to keep them informed of what I do everyday with the kids, so they stay in the loop and feel more in control. I also asked to set up a time to meet with the parents to try to work out the situation, but have not received a text back. "

Met the Dr. Friday: 5'9""/315 lbs./42 y.o. and strongly suggested considering gastric sleeve surgery, and this is the first time seriously considering it.

I believe most recent gain was due in part to working FT while also fulfilling a 16/hr a week internship. Lack of planning resulted in eating bad food at bad times and not much time to work any of it off. 

Here's what different about now. I recently left the full time job to work part time in the field that I am in school for. Pro: more time to plan food prep, more time to move. Con: less money for food, no real money for diet plans/gym memberships. 

So, I guess I'm looking for low cost means of exercise, not that I don't like running/walking but would like to know other things to help metabolism too. Also, suggestions for healthier eating for weight loss that doesn't solely rely on shakes or bars. 

Part of me blames myself, and right now it's all I can think about. I also know that I am capable of so much more. Thanks for reading and any help you can think of. "

I hadn’t really planned on writing a lot of these or anything, but I received so much kind feedback (and a surprising lack of dick pics! Go you!) that I figured what the hell, I could write more :) So here goes. This is a story about the best sex I've ever had. Sorry for the length, and I hope you guys enjoy!
______________________________

This is a story from my sophomore year of college, probably second semester? I’d been really busy with school and this internship I was doing, so I hadn’t even gone out in like three weeks. At that point, I’d also been single for around four months, and only had one hookup in all of that time, just because I had so much else going on. So Friday night rolls around, and I’m just sitting in bed in my pajamas doing some homework when my roommate and best friend Erin walks into the apartment with three of our friends and a very much not-hidden bottle of vodka. I laughed and greeted them, asking what their plans were for the night.

“Our plans? Don’t you mean… *our* plans?” Erin said, with a wicked grin. I decided not to point out that that was just the same word twice.

“How drunk are you guys?” I asked, more amused than anything else.

“Drunk enough to go party!” Erin yelled. Yeah, she gets real basic when she’s drunk, but I love her anyway :)

I hopped out of bed to go say hi to everyone else, when Erin suddenly plopped a shot glass down in front of me.

“Drink, bitch! You’re gonna come with us!”

I smiled and said no, but she grabbed my hand and looked at me, eyes as earnest as a child’s.

“Listen, Rachel, you have been cooped up in here working for months!” *Weeks.* “I know it’s been really busy, but come on, look me in the eyes and tell me that you don’t want to go out tonight.”

I looked at her then, about to say something, when my words caught in my throat. To be honest I did want to go out, and this homework wasn’t due until Monday anyway… I could tell she saw me considering it, because that was when she pounced.

“Plus you haven’t even kissed a guy in like, a year.” *A couple months.* ""I know you’re too busy and important for that kind of stuff, of course, but you gotta admit, it would be nice to just let off some steam, wouldn’t it?”

She was right, of course. Fast-forward through a few more minutes of convincing and I was in the shower, getting ready to go out while Erin and our other friends sat laughing at dumb reality TV. After committing to going out, it was like a switch had been flipped in my head – suddenly I was ready, and feeling pretty racy. I put on these matching lacy teal panties and bra, thinking almost subconsciously that, if I was going to slut it up tonight, I may as well dress the part! I decided on some short white shorts and a rather low-cut teal tank top (guess my favorite color guys!!1!), once again reminded of how much warmer LA was than San Francisco where I grew up. I wore my hair longer back then, and I remember looking at the auburn curls flowing down in this contrast with the teal that I thought was quite pretty, if I do say so myself :P

I step out of my room to immediate ‘oh shit!’s from the girls in the living room, which of course did nothing but help my growing confidence for the night. Erin told me I was an ‘absolute panty-dropper,’ to which I replied, ‘guys don’t wear panties.’ She just game me a look and said that she meant what she said. We took one last pregame shot and then Erin called an Uber to take us to Frat Row.

To be honest, I don’t remember what frat we went to, I just know that it was full of douchey-looking guys who practically smelled like daddy’s money. But they had good music, free alcohol, and everyone was dancing, so I joined in the fun, hanging out pretty close with just my group of girlfriends. One girl’s boyfriend came and took her upstairs, and then another girl got approached by some dude and they started making out like, fifteen seconds after meeting each other, tops. So yeah, pretty good atmosphere.

Erin and I went to the bar when this guy came up next to me, asking if he could get me a drink. It’s not exactly the best move when the drinks are free, but I guess it was still a conversation starter! I turned to face him and was surprised to see that he didn’t really look the fratty type; dressed in skinny jeans and a denim jacket, he looked like some Burbank hipster who’d just kind of accidentally shown up. I learned that he was, in fact, a brother at the fraternity, but he didn’t really come around that much. I couldn’t really blame him. Not that the brothers I had met weren’t nice people or anything, he just really didn’t seem to fit.

His name was Ziad. We ended up talking by the bar for quite a while, and it was only several minutes in that I realized Erin had surreptitiously slunk away. She certainly didn’t make her plans for me a secret! 

Ziad and I ended up leaving the party together, under some pretext that it was ‘too crowded’ or something like that. He asked me if I wanted to come hang out at his apartment for a bit, a little hesitantly and awkwardly which was, to be honest, pretty cute. I know what you’re thinking, and yes, looking back, it was incredibly stupid, but he had come off as nothing but sweet all night and I felt safe enough getting in the Uber with him. Luckily it was a great night, but a word of advice, girls: don’t go to strangers’ apartments! You should always have an easy way to escape.

Anyway, I went home with him, and by halfway there we were pretty much on top of each other, making out furiously and intensely. Sorry Uber driver! We reached his building and walked up a few flights of stairs to get to his door – I was glad I’d gone for casual and was wearing vans instead of heels.

We sat down on the couch, his arm around mine, bodies pressed up next to each other. I reveled in the warmth. He kissed me again, just once, slow and passionate and soft and intense all at once, and then pulled back and smiled.

“What?” I asked, smiling back.

“Oh, nothing… It’s just, you might be the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”

I almost rolled my eyes right there. “Do you say that to all the girls?” I said, now grinning wide.

He shrugged. “I mean, yes, I’m not gonna lie to you. But I don’t mean it with all the girls,” he said, grinning equally mischievously. When had this cocky smooth-talker replaced the awkward boy from earlier? I loved that; it felt like he was coming out of his shell because of me, like I was making him more comfortable just by being there.

“I’ll take that, I guess,” I said, before placing my hand on the side of his face and kissing him deeply. He fell backwards, allowing me to crawl on top of him, our bodies intertwined and connected by the mouth. He placed a thigh between my legs and simply held it there, applying subtle pressure that made me intensely aware of the heat, the warmth in my pussy. I ran my fingers through his long hair.

Ziad slid his hands down my body, first at my chest, then at my sides, then at my waist, his touch gentle and strong like the beginnings of a wave in deep water. I remember that metaphor actually popping into my head at the time; I told him that was how he felt and he grinned, telling me he hadn’t realized he was hooking up with Shakespeare. I don’t know why, but somehow that little offhand compliment turned me on more than anything he’d said before. I nearly tore off my top, even taking off my own bra rather than letting him do it. I have sensitive nipples - when he touched them I felt the world shake, my breath becoming shorter and tighter, soft gasps escaping my throat without permission.

He pushed me up and onto my back, then started kissing down my body while pulling off my shorts. He kissed my forehead. My nose. My cheek. My lips. My neck. My collarbone. Both breasts. It went on and on, he paid almost loving attention to every piece of my body as I lay there, breathing soft, fluttery breaths, feeling like the most attractive girl in the world.

When he kissed my clit, I knew instantly that I would come that night. I don’t know how I knew, but something about the way he touched me made it clear; he knew what he was doing. He started to eat me out in earnest, licking and kissing and fingering me into a messy puddle of a person, barely able to think straight. I started rubbing my own nipples, running my hands through his hair, grasping the couch, anything to ground myself while he worked magic with his tongue. I moaned and gasped so loud that they probably heard me all the way back at the frat house. After some time, which could’ve been two minutes or two hundred, I came shuddering to an intense orgasm, a feeling of release spreading through my whole body as I came. He crawled on top of me and kissed me softly as I lay there, utterly breathless.

I kissed him back insistently, pulling his jacket off of him and then tugging at his T-shirt until he detached from me just long enough to take that off too. He kind of hopped his way out of his skinny jeans, which I would’ve laughed at had I the breath left to laugh, and then pulled a condom from a nearby drawer (how does this guy have condoms in the living room?) before coming back to his place above me. 

As he entered me, it was like everything else faded from the world. All I could feel was his dick inside me, throbbing and pumping with determined intensity. He kissed me and I kissed him, running our hands all over each other’s bodies as he thrust into me deep and strong. I could barely breathe, it was so good.

I’m not really sure how to describe the sex; it wasn’t very interesting on the surface, all we did was basic missionary. But the way it *felt!* There was more to it. The perfect rhythm with which he pushed in and out, filling me, like our bodies were built for one another. The way he held me, tight and strong, but not forceful. He held me how tree roots hold the earth. The way he kissed me, all soft and tender and romantic while still filled with this primal energy, like he was holding back from just becoming this beast, and somehow that reservation made it all feel so perfect.

When he came, I felt it through the condom, a burst of warmth as he let out a gasping breath. We lay there for a while, just basking in it, him still deep inside me, holding me tight. When we eventually detached, it was like I’d lost a part of myself. We cuddled, tight, unwilling to let go, until we both fell asleep on his couch.

Ziad and I ended up dating for almost the rest of the semester. That was a pretty fun time, full of amazing, adventurous sex, but sadly the rest of the relationship was nowhere near either of those two things, so it faded away in time. But on that first night, the sex just felt totally, completely *right.* It was as if our bodies were meant for each other, built by some sex-loving god who wanted to give us the perfect physical match. I'll never, ever forget that night."

Unfortunately, I do not get co-op during my first summer so I am planning on applying to lots of companies for internships directly. I have a few questions:

- Have you ever felt that having a ""double degree"" set you apart from other competing applicants?
- Did you guys gravitate towards CS/Math internships or business internships? Was it out of genuine interest or was it simply easier to get an internship in one area over the other?
- When should I start applying for summer internships? I have heard from some people that I'm kind of late for applying to US internships but people generally apply to Canadian internships around January. How accurate is this?
- How successful were you guys finding a co-op or internship during your first year? Do you think I have a chance of getting at least a couple of interviews if I apply to over 200 companies? I plan on having a pretty mediocre average (75 maybe?) and decent extracurriculars (exec positions, side-projects, hackathons).

Any answers will be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I'm in my second year of college, I study IT management and am currently in an internship for 4 days a week + 1 day of class. 

I dropped from the highest level of education to the lowest level because I've been 'depressed' (as I said, I don't know whether I am but I think I am) for 8-9 years always felt this way never figured out what caused it or how to stop it and this has caused my entire family to question me as they know I have a way above average IQ yet I'm in the lowest level of education . Over the years I learnt to adapt, to 'fake' feelings to make it seem like I was just like everyone else so I'd be accepted as generally I consider myself a horrible person and have since performed my 'act' so to speak to fit in with other students.

I have been to a doctor for this a couple years back and because of the doctor who was so positive I completely shut off and just dropped it as I didn't feel like they were the right person to talk to but I now figured out that that may have been my only option as I have severe trust issues (I trust literally nobody, I question everything and don't keep people around for long) this goes for family, 'friends' or anyone else.

Now I'm 2 years into college, on an internship for 6 months (3 months still left) and it's getting worse. I'm dealing with issues at my internship (this being: I can't walk a lot, yet for the internship I have to walk a lot). I'm scared to talk to my boss about it as he's known to not care and is known to kick people out, causing me to completely hate going there fearing every day I do. I'm scared I'll break down completely as I can sense that I will if it keeps going like this. 

This all lead me to become more sad and lead to me losing more and more motivation every day, this internship is a hell for me, and next year I'll have another. I don't know what to do and I don't know what to do about it, I'd like some advice before I sink even deeper."

I am pretty sure my resume is solid too because I have had it critiqued plenty of times.  It is very frustrating because I have applied to jobs that I meet like 90% or more of the qualifications and I basically tailored my resume to getting those jobs and... nothing.  I also applied to small companies that hopefully wouldn't have highly competitive selection processes and... still nothing.

The professor I do research for also sent out my resume to many of his friends.  He even told me that he had people who wanted to talk to me and told me that they were supposed to reach out to me, but guess what?  They didn't and that was weeks ago!  

I know there technically is still some time left, but many companies have already filled their positions especially many of the ones I applied to (defense/aerospace).  

Is anyone else having a similar experience right now?  What are your current plans?

On the bright side, I should be able to just work with my current research group full-time over the summer if I can't find anything, but that wouldn't be ideal because I did that last summer and am trying to diversify my experience.  I also might try and get an REU if nothing in industry works out.

7b1xsm,33,2017-11-05,Made $12.5K this summer and Maxed out my Roth IRA at 18. Where to put the extra money to match inflation?,CUDAcores89,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7b1xsm/made_125k_this_summer_and_maxed_out_my_roth_ira/,"Hello fellow redditors, I have a question that few teenagers my age end up asking, I've got a bunch of money and I don't really know what to do with it.

Where I got this money:

Over the summer at 17 I got a job at a computer recycling center. My job was to dig computer parts out of the recycling bins there that still had resale value beyond scrap price,and list and sell them on ebay or craigslist for Larger items. Corporations would frequently bring in pallets of 50-100 dell and HP desktops containing sandy-bridge core i5 and i7 CPUs along with 4GB of RAM, all of which are worth well over 10x more on the used market vs scrap. My job was to get this stuff listed, packed, shipped and sold to customers around the US. Because companies constantly brought in these ""old"" computers that were still worth money, I made $12.5K after commissions and taxes were all accounted for. 

My family background:


I come from a well off family. My dad is an investment manager and my mom work as a Market research analyst for UnitedHealth. I know my parents both make over 6 figures guessing by their jobs, but I have never been given a hard number. 


Since my Dad is an investment manager, he opened a Roth IRA for me. At the time I was 17, so I contributed $2500 and he was able to do a match contribution of another $2500 (because I was a minor) meaning my Roth IRA was close maxed out for the year.


Currently I am in college, all paid for by my parents. I have one of the lucky few individuals who has parents that can afford to fund my college entirely out of their salary, so 
i would be an idiot to not take advantage of getting a college education. I currently have a vehicle, but it sits at my parents house. I Do not use the car as I live on campus and I use public transit, so there is no need to own one (and have to pay insurance on it, which in Michigan is super expensive at 18). I also have no debts whatsoever.


I now have 10K left over. I worked really hard to make that money, and I don't see anything I would want to use it for in the next 3-4 years or so. Maybe when I graduate college and enter the workforce, it could be used to pay rent, but that's about it. 


Since I started working, I have been incredibly frugal. I would say well over 95% of the money I made from my job I diligently saved (I lived with my parents at the time, so I had $0 in living expenses). Of course in our low interest environments of today, my 10K is sitting in a savings account at Goldman Sachs, earning 1.3% a year.


I've decided to designate this money as A future emergency fund at least for now. But there's a problem. Inflation is at 3% a year average, and I am earning 1.3%, meaning that inflation is eating away the buying power of my money by about 1.7% a year. I want liquidity with my money, but I also want to have the same buying power years from now as I had when I made the money, so I don't want to see inflation eat away at my hard work.


If I leave my money in a savings account, I lose money in a low-interest environment, but do well in a high-interest environment. If I put my money in bond funds to try to earn a better return while keeping it out of high-risk stocks, then I run the risk of a high interest environment tanking the performance of any bond fund.


Here is what I was thinking: Leave 5K of it in the savings account, but place the other 5K in a vanguard short-term bond fund like the VFSTX bond-fund. In a low inflation environment, the 5K in savings will perform poorly, but the other 5K in the bond fund will perform better, thus helping to hedge against inflation. If interest rates rose, the bond fund will perform poorly, but the savings account interest rate will go up, again, helping to protect against inflation. Is this a good plan?

Other options:

I could put the money in CD-ladders, I-bonds, or other funds that requires your money to be locked up before it can redeemed. The reason I have strayed away from those is because the money cannot be redeemed at any time, and that really isn't the point of an emergency fund. All the money needs to be accessible in a 1-week time period, and these funds require you to tie your money up for a specified amount of time, so I don't want to use them.


At least this is a good problem to have. I have a bunch of money and I don't know what to do with it lol. I have never really had a lot of ""wants"". Give me food, water, shelter and internet and I am happy, so there's nothing I want to buy at the moment.

TL:DR: I have 10K and I want to match inflation while still have immediate access to the full amount, what do I do?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT:

thanks for the advice everyone, here is what I decided to do. I may or may not need this money in the next 3-4 years to pay for something like a car/a house, so I need to keep it relatively low-risk (fluctuations of 10-20% should be okay). But with a 3-4-year time period, I can invest some of it in bond funds to get a safe return. Here is the breakdown:

I am splitting up the 10K into stocks, bonds, and keeping some in my savings account. Here is the breakdown:

1. 2.5K is going to stay in my savings account earning me 1.3%

2. 2.5K is going to be used to buy I-bonds. I-bonds as of November 2017 currently have an APY of ~2.5%, so better than savings. 

3. 5K I am placing in a vangard Intermediate-term bond-fund like the VBIIX. It's more risky then the above choices, but safer than all stocks.

More to add:

My college major is engineering, so I have plans to get an internship over the summer and make even more money. This money will go directly into my Roth IRA. I don't know how much money I will make, but I talked to the recycling center and they said I can pop in anytime I want over the summer and sell more computers (so I could do that while having an internship). Doing this I could conceivably max-out my Roth IRA again next year.

* I'm an undergraduate student in Data Analytics

* Currently interning in IT Business Intelligence at a medium size company

* My goal is to become  a data scientist/machine learning scientist in the future. I hope to achieve this by progressing through industry, obviously, and perhaps with the help of a Masters in Statistics as that is my primary interest.

I have two internship offers on the table: Software Engineering @ Target, or Data Analytics @ Ford.

For someone who wants to become a data scientist, does it serve me better to take the software engineering position to diversify my skill-set and hone my competency in writing industry level code (especially since I'd have something to show for software engineering w/ a relatively short time commitment) while supporting my statistics and data processing knowledge through my coursework and current internship.

OR is it the case that if I want to become a data scientist that software engineering is only semi-related and that I simply keep going down the path of data analytics and continue to increase my experience with tools like Qlikview, Hadoop, R, Python Alteryx, etc. that an experience at Ford might afford? (no pun intended :P)

So I work at a coffee shop as a barista and a few months ago a girl moved back to our town from an internship and is now also a barista. We work together pretty often. This is the first time we have gotten to know each other over the past few months. She’s awesome. We get along great and are actually roommates as of recently. We have very similar style, sense of humor, and have a great time working together. I’m straight and she is straight, but I cannot shake the desire to kiss her.

She’s beautiful, hilarious, fun, and just freaking adorable. She touches my arm and back a lot, but I think she’s just more prone to friendly contact. Of course, it gives me goose bumps.

She has shared some very personal issues with me. In fact, I’m one of the few people that know 100% about her personal struggles and because of that, I have a very strong emotional bond with her. I am beginning to believe that I am heterosexual/biromantic. I don’t usually find any girls attractive at all. I keep playing out a perfect scenario in my head: us alone in our apartment, probably watching Stranger Things, drinking wine, making out and holding each other and her not having a weird reaction but actually welcoming and reciprocating it. She has experienced a lot of sadness in the last year and I just want to kiss her profusely and let her talk about what she won’t with anyone else. 

Which is great and all but it only leaves me with more questions on how to press on from here...

Is it fair game to tell her?
Will it freak her out and ruin our friendship?
Should I wait until we are both a little drunk and just try to kiss her and see what her reaction is?
How can I tell if she would welcome it at all?
Should I try to thoroughly explain all of these feelings?
Is it okay for us as two straight friends to make out for fun?
And lastly, is this a normal feeling for someone to experience?"

I am an MS in CS student focusing more on systems and networks.  I am most likely pursuing a software engineering internship over the summer, but I do have some interest in machine learning and data science as well.  


Should I target more data science oriented internships, pursue more mathematical coursework, or can I later break into data science after gaining some experience as a software engineer?"
7b2shn,1,2017-11-05,Is developing a portfolio the single most important aspect of getting hired?,browat,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7b2shn/is_developing_a_portfolio_the_single_most/,"Hey guys, I'm a economics student at my university. I struggled my entire college life trying to figure out what I wanted my career to be. I picked economics because it seemed practical, thats it.

It wasn't until recently that I fully realized I'm actually great at math, love building stuff, and have always had a passion for computers and gaming. So I started to pursue programming in my spare time.

Thats my life story out of the way..

I really want to become a programmer as a full time job. Is the best possible way to get hired by creating a portfolio of good projects? 

I'm kind of in a limbo, I don't know what I should pursue exactly. I've been learning swift and xcode so I can develop a handful of apps for my portfolio. But, I also want to learn C# or C++, so I can apply for an internship at a gaming studio or something. Then, I also see tons of people suggesting to learn python...etc 

I'm just not exactly sure what I should be doing. Should I just put my head down and continue learning swift, develop apps, and move on to c++?

Sorry if I sound like a complete novice, and stupid as hell. That's because I am. I just want to learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible, to make up for all the time I wasted."
7b313p,4,2017-11-06,Mental Health thoughts,GTopinions_throwaway,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/7b313p/mental_health_thoughts/,"**TLDR** Action Team's mental health report focuses almost entirely on how to better react to issues rather than how to prevent the issues. Abrupt ending after realizing either this is preaching to the choir, or worse, to those who actually care but won't do anything. 

So the Action Team produced a report on [mental health...](http://www.president.gatech.edu/student-mental-health) And after going through it briefly (there sure is a lot of words, in true GT style), focusing on the recommendations, it's rather disappointing. Of the 10 general recommendations, only #7 is proactive (maybe #8 too), meaning we're going to make sure we can address all of these problems with the best tool set we can have!...that's all good, I'll spare you the sarcastic remarks about implementation, but I won't spare you my thoughts on the focus of reacting instead of being more proactive about stopping the need to have all of this. 
We* are a school that conducts an enormous amount of research into many fields, including in the relevant fields of education/teaching/psychology/health/wellness/etc. But the school that produces it, doesn't even care to implement/embody those theories it so touts/celebrates as coming from some of the best minds in the fields! _insert recruiting jargon here_
I have had a laughable time trying to figure out the required classes for graduation (MS in one of the Engineering fields). It's so frustrating watching everyone struggle with just simply understanding the logistics of their degrees. What if we were to grade some of these syllabi or degree guidelines produced by the schools/departments? How many of them would get a passing grade? 
Speaking of grades, it's so miserable watching people so frantically struggling to achieve goals that are varying/confusing/poorly set. Let's stop to think for one minute, if you assign a report+15 minute presentation a week before it's due, is that healthy? Is it even necessary? It's incredibly frustrating and deflating to watch TAs grade work you've poured hours into in just 2min because they've got 50 more to go. Why don't we take the time to help each other? Not ""well, you can come to office hours to get more help"", but ""here's what you did wrong, here's what you did not understand""...this is hand holding but it's the clearest example I can come up with. The intent of school is not busy work, it is to understanding difficult subject matter. 

I'll take a quick break and try to give myself a bit of credibility here...My undergrad was done through 4 different schools over 6 years. I've taught undergrad and grad classes as a student. I've worked in the industry, and have interviewed potential new hires (FYI, an industry tid-bit, KSU students are currently more valued in my particular engineering field than GT students. Hadn't even bothered with GT recruiting until I came along, and the last effort resulted in exactly 1 applicant from the entire department for a nearly no-matter-what-you're-hired intern position with a competitive starting pay...go figure).

Back to what's now turned into a rant unfortunately...We know the problems, we know what stresses us out. So do the professors, not hard to figure it out. Deadlines that are too short for the amount of work requested. Material that's not covered/explained well enough, or worse yet, not at all because of poor planning and class time running out. Professor's who are disconnected with their current industry practices (unless GT is only set on producing researcher scientists). Expensive class materials. Confusing grading systems...let's expand on this one. Every student is pushed to get the best grades. An A is 90 or above. Well, if you get a 5 question test and get one wrong, there goes that A. If that was worth 20% of your grade, there go any hopes of recovery. And thus, you're understanding of the subject matter explained to you over 16 weeks is based on those 5 questions. 

I apologize for the lengthy rant, I'll stop here, never saw anything good come from trying to solve an actual problem, it's too much hard work, easier to figure out how to improve the band-aids...

*I say ""we"" cautiously, I don't have any school pride because I feel let down by GT and the stereotypical ""number in the system"", no hard feelings, just don't expect me to have any school pride. I assume that's fair.

**TLDR** Action Team's mental health report focuses almost entirely on how to better react to issues rather than how to prevent the issues. Abrupt ending after realizing either this is preaching to the choir, or worse, to those who actually care but won't do anything. "

Intern kommt es darauf an, die eigene Ernsthaftigkeit zu bestätigen: Man verbiegt sich, um dem potentiellen Koalitionspartner entgegen zukommen, stellt aber auch klar, wo die eigenen Grenzen liegen. Das übergeordnete Ziel einer Regierungsbeteiligung immer fest im Blick, tauscht man die eigenen Inhalte, gegen die der Anderen.

Nach Außen: Dabei ist es wichtig, fest den Standpunkt zu vertreten, dann einem an der Regierungsbeteiligung bei Weiten nicht so gelegen sein, wie es intern verkündet wird. Nur auf die inhaltlichen Positionen kommt es an, dem Publikum wird Standfestigkeit und das Festhalten an den eigenen Werten vorgeführt.

Insgesamt gilt es auszutarieren, wie man im Falle einer Koalitionsvereinbarung dasteht und andererseits ein mögliches Scheitern schadenfrei übersteht und in Neuwahlen gehen kann.

Diesen Spagat schaffen die Parteien gerade mit Ach und Krach und wer immer im Publikum ernsthaft annimmt, hier würde um Positionen gerungen (statt um Posten), hat nicht viel aus vorhergegangenen Verhandlungen gelernt.

In Wirklichkeit wollen alle Beteiligten regieren, inhaltlich sind ihnen die Positionen egal, so lange sie diesen ihren Wählern verkaufen können.

Dazu muss man sich als harter Verhandler aufführen und so tun, als wolle man das Scheitern der Verhandlungen in Kauf nehmen, wenn denn die eigenen Positionen nicht ausreichend Berücksichtigung finden.

Selig, wer's glaubt."

7b51sx,20,2017-11-06,Unpacking my Mother Pt. 1,nonbinaryunicorn,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7b51sx/unpacking_my_mother_pt_1/,"I’ve been thinking a lot since I posted my [earlier] (https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7ajamu/friends_are_worried_about_my_mom/) questioning of my mother. I’m still not 100% sure if I agree that my mom is actively malicious or not, but I wanted to address some common themes that were brought up. I also wanted to delve more into how she treated me growing up vs. now. 

First off, I am in therapy. I finally got the nerve to go again in September, after my friend pointed out that I was swinging pretty wildly emotionally and was draining them by being too dependent on them while they’re trying to finish school. I’d been pretty bad the past few months, and I value our friendship, so I agreed. I had my first session in October, and I have another this Thursday. I plan on discussing my mother with my therapist. She actually knows my family dynamic fairly well, especially my mom, which is why I chose her. I do trust her not to share with my mother. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have gone to her in the first place. I just grew up in a fairly small town, so people knowing each other is pretty common.

Here’s what I know of my mom’s past: she was in an abusive household, including sexually. My grandmother, whom I absolutely believe is a narcissist or at least an extreme version of learned helplessness these days, was not a good mother. My mom ended up marrying and leaving for Denver when she was still young (just graduated from a tiny Christian private school), where she met my dad. I know she’s emotionally, perhaps physically cheated on him after I was born and they were separated a couple of times before my dad was stationed in Japan to their separation and divorce in 2015. 

My earliest memories are of my mom, from when I was between 5 and 6. Riding without training wheels, being terrified of *Goosebumps*, accidentally melting a dryer sheet to my thumbs with a candle (ok I was setting it on fire on purpose. I didn’t mean to have it melt on myself!). A pertinent one to this situation is when I was in first grade.

We lived in Camp Kinser, a Marine Corps base in Okinawa, Japan. I was allowed to walk from school to home with the other kids because it was fairly safe. There was a ditch, the mother of all ditches. I swear it was ten feet deep and five feet wide, poured concrete, with blocks strategically inserted for the ultimate rock climb for kids ages 5-8. Where the ditch went under the road, there were iron crossbars barring entry. I played with the other kids, and my mom panicked when I didn’t come home in a timely manner. She found me, took me home, and both my parents discussed with me why I wasn’t allowed to play in the ditch. They tried to scare me straight, claiming that if it rained elsewhere, water could come rushing through and I’d be diced on the crossbars mentioned earlier. Their words, not mine. 

So what do I do? I don’t go into the ditch, but I do play on the side, “balancing” on the half a foot strip of concrete that ran along its side. Once again, it appeared I took too long, as my mom made another appearance, dragging me home and confiscating the little Charmander I’d been playing with. I never saw the figurine again.

There are other little things pre-puberty, after we moved to the States. She had the TV turned on to the 9/11 footage when my sister and I got home. That led to me having a ton of nightmares, not sure about my little sister, who was 5 at the time. My favorite has to be how she dragged me to see the first *Harry Potter* movie with the family. I did not want to see it. I was a voracious reader of the *American Girl* books (which I still highly recommend the originals + Kaya to anyone who wants their kids to read), as well as pet and how-to manuals. But I was a tiny 8 year old hipster and found myself unable to read past the first page of Harry Potter. Of course, I saw the first movie, realized it wasn’t about a man and his drills, and devoured the first four books in a matter of a month. My mom now denies she forced me to see the first movie and says that I insisted on going. 

In 2002, I tried to commit suicide for the first time. I don’t know why I didn’t tell my mom that I was having friend trouble, with a new girl turning my few female friends against me, but I was a very… dramatic 8 year old. I tried to turn my dresser into my deathbed instead of my actual bed, wrote a will, and asked my little sister to get the knife off the wall next to my room. She went upstairs instead, told Mom, and when I went to find her, was confronted by Mom instead.

She took me to a therapist. Kudos to her. At this point, she had just finished college and was working at DHR as a sort of intern with the intent on being hired as a CPS worker after she had the necessary experience, so I guess she was doing what she thought was right from her studies and her own past. I know I went to a couple sessions, where they had me draw pictures, and I played with a dollhouse and legos. I also know my mom withdrew me, and when I asked why when I was older, she explained they wanted to put me on medication. This really fucked with my relationship to medicine and therapy later on.

I also remember in this time period that Mom was approached by my teacher about putting me in gifted classes. This was the first time it was brought up that I may have a social disorder, as my mom refused to do it. I am still upset by this to this day, as specialized attention may have drawn out the truth I’m currently seeking much earlier (ie, what exactly is wrong with my head).

We ended up moving for Mom’s work shortly afterwards, and this is where I experienced puberty. I grew up in a place where I knew of LG, in high school I met two B, T was never even properly explained to me, and anything other than this didn’t exist. For those who haven’t read my last post, I currently identify as asexual and non-binary, though male-leaning, and I plan on eventually partially transitioning to help with my body dysmorphia. This is important because I *hated* puberty. Where before, the cute dresses and crap didn’t bother me because my body was fine, now I was gaining weight and boobs and my body was absolutely betraying me. It was horrifying, but I didn’t have the vocabulary to explain why.

Mom didn’t help. When I hit thirteen, she started teaching me to use makeup. I hated makeup and would go without it as much as possible, but my mom spends about an hour to look like she put on some eyeshadow and lipstick (to be fair, she has rosacea and it’s pre-dominantly on her face. She’s also admitted that this is partially a result of her own upbringing, as was the constant critique of my weight.). She would not believe me when I said the eyeshadow made my eyes heavy and had me dress uncomfortably for church and school events. 

This is also when the anti-porn shit started in church, and I was blissfully unaware of the struggle to not put part A into slot B on the parts of my fellow hormone-addled teens. Being asexual, I don’t experience sexual attraction. I don’t look at a person and say to myself “I want them naked in my bed” or however it works for people. I’ve also got no sex drive, at all, so there was no need of masturbation or porn as a kid. I watch porn now, but for different reasons. The relationship I have with sex is… weird to say the least. I’m a 24 year old virgin who likes to make fantasy and art history inspired dildos and write gay erotica, but I’m terrified of the actual act. I’m convinced the way that my church and mother treated sex is part of why. But that’s a story for a different time.

I wasn’t the best kid. I had and still have a habit of overeating on sweets, and there was a time where I was caught with a pillowcase full of Little Debbie wrappers. I was also a compulsive liar, but that stopped around 6th grade, after my dad broke that wooden spoon over my backside. Around that time, but especially in high school, my mom began to ask me if I was high instead when I was in trouble. I also had a bit of an explosive temper, and would sometimes take it out on my sister. One time I hit her in the face with a softball. On purpose. It’s the only time I was grounded from being outside.

But, in a nutshell, those were the big dramatic moments of my childhood in regards to my mom. There’s a whole different thing about when I was 8 wishing my dad (who had walked out) wouldn’t come back, but that belongs elsewhere. I was already considered a bright kid, with a fairly intense interest in reading over people. I made a lot of typical mistakes kids do (spilling a gallon of koolaid, getting ‘slime’ on the carpet, et al) and was punished appropriately (grounded from reading typically lol). But there were a few things I suppose my mom struggled with in regards to me - my social awkwardness, my inability to communicate properly how I felt about my body, therapy and medication, to give broad strokes. 

This is already getting long, so I’m going to cut it short and add a part 2 tomorrow. That way I’m not spamming the sub-reddit. Depending on response, I’ll delve deeper into the hole that began in late middle school/high school, also known as “when unicorn got his first female crush and didn’t know how to handle it” to “when unicorn wrote a book dealing with his fear of sex and Mom actually read it”.

Last summer, I interned as a Data Engineer at an awesome company and really enjoyed the work. It involved some Data Science with the way we analyzed the data and presented trends, as well as some engineering/developing large-scale ETL processes, dataflow pipelines, and optimizing Spark clusters.

I did accept a Data Engineering Internship at a Big N company this summer, but part of me is wondering how difficult it will be to get back into Software Engineering. The fields are pretty different and I feel like the more I follow this Data Engineering path, the less I will be prepared if I ever want to switch back to Software Engineering (and vice versa).

I met her and my entire friend group through a mutual friend, and the lot of us have been inseparable ever since.


Let me give background info. This friend lives in a dormitory with another member of our group, who I'll call A. They're the same age. They're closest with each other, and I'm closest with both my other critical friend (who we'll call S) and my other friend C [22M].


I hope this isn't too confusing.


But anyway. Since I'd met her we'd bonded over the fact that we were both attracted to women. She's bi, I'm gay. She has had a long-distance boyfriend since I had met her, and would often receive calls from him while we are hanging out.


We've also flirted around a lot since we've met. I found out later she'd been slightly attracted to me since before we'd met, but had always been too intimidated by my resting bitch face to start a friendship, lol. 


The flirting wasn't a lot. Just the usual teasing that comes with female friendships. I knew perfectly well she had a boyfriend, and I'm a huge anti-cheating person. 


I had a birthday party last year and we both got pretty drunk. Unfortunately for me I always retain a bit of clarity no matter how drunk I get. 


M always insisted that she always get randomly approached by girls out in public asking if she's gay, and then having that girl hit on her. Apparently this happens at least once a week.


During this party I sat her down since she was pretty drunk and she said she'd broken up with her LDR boyfriend two weeks ago. I immediately asked her why she didn't tell me, and she said she was shy. She also asked me if I'd gotten my first kiss from a girl yet, and I said no. And then she kissed me.


It was no big deal. Our whole friend group thought it was hilarious, especially since my parents were there. 


Later on she was doing an overseas internship (course requirment) over the summer and we chatted constantly. 


She admitted she had a crush on me, and I told her I was attracted to her too. I asked if I could take her out on a date, and she refused. Okay. I wasn't hurt at all, I was expecting the rejection since she's Muslim (veeeery liberal family, she doesn't even wear a hijab or clothing that could be considered even slightly modest lol).


Two days later she sends me a pic of this cute girl who sat across her in the office. Said she was gay. I was amused, since I found her cute too. I jokingly told her I was jealous. 


Over the next few days she tells me stories of this girl coming over to her apartment to make out, her cooking her food, and even one instance where they'd made out in her car on the way to work and I had to teach M how to cover up hickies using makeup over chat.


A couple weeks after she comes back home, she then tells me she lost her PiV virginity to her ex boyfriend (they were still friends) when he had come back to the city briefly. This is memorable since I lectured her over not using protection, and she told me that A had also given her that talk.


A few months ago, all of us girls of the group were out together and couldn't decide where to go. I was leading the conversation and said that I was going to pick a direction and start walking towards it to find a hangout place. Everyone laughed and said ok. 

Apparently I didn't hear it, but M had responded to my statement saying ""Bitch, you better figure out where to go or else I'm gonna...""

A and S both heard her say this. A and S later told me they had a conversation about this, and S had said M was lucky she had said that to me and not to S. S is known to be quite aggressive and confrontational, which brings us to today.


A talked to me earlier today about M, with S in the room. The three of us were alone, and A started telling me about how condescending and aggressive M had been acting, and it was really getting on her nerves but she didn't know what to do since they're so close. During the conversation S would randomly yell out ""She's CONDESCENDING! She's RUDE! DISRESPECTFUL!"" etc etc. 

A then talked to me a few hours after that, this time with our friend C present. C is a psychology major who deals with depression, and has had counseling training. He's very experienced with dealing with people's problems since he's an extremely good listener and also gives out excellent advice. He's my best friend, too. 


A told me she wanted to tell me this away from S, because she knew S would freak out. Everything M had told us was a lie.


One of their roommates reverse searched the picture of the LDR BF and found it on some photographer's IG account. The model's name didn't even match the BF's name. 


I was skeptical and told A about M receiving calls from him when we were together, and she said she had caught M actually opening her phone to the homescreen and pretending to be answering a call. In other instances, she had actually used that photo as the contact photo of some family members, and would talk after the call had ended. 


I told her about the losing virginity story, and A agreed and said she had pretended to go along with it and gave her a safe sex talk... but according to her, the story she was told was that M had lost it to some guy named Will during her overseas internship. I didn't bother correcting her with my story. But she said she knew for a fact that she hadn't had sex with **any** guy since too many inconsistencies were in the story and M kept deflecting questions by saying ""Eh, you know. Leave it alone"" and stuff like that. Also, her mom was actually living with her the entire time during this timeframe, which we only found out after investigating a bit more.


Apparently she's been looking into these stories of M's for a long time. According to her, the girl she was hooking up with overseas was just a girl that she admired and sat across from her, and that was the extent of their interactions. She immediately clued in on this fact after asking her to talk to the girl while they were Facetiming, she would always make an excuse not to. 

She said she had first realized it after a fight with M, after which M apologized and said she was just upset because one of her friends from Dubai died. I knew about this friend and was confused, because to my knowledge this friend had died a couple months ago, not last year. To date five of her friends from Dubai have died, one of whom has died twice.


I also realized she had suddenly broken up with her boyfriend before she had kissed me at that party. I, for some reason, didn't think it suspicious that not even A, her best friend who lives with her and has access to her phone, knew about it. 


Meanwhile we've been dealing with S being overly critical over her. We figured that it's a coping mechanism of M's to make up stories to relate to us better- for example, A is quite open about her sex life and she quickly realized the virginity thing and the boyfriend thing were to relate to her. Me, the girls hitting on her constantly, etc. 


She had already suffered a private breakdown one night that was witnessed by one of their roommates when M thought they were all asleep. She's been extremely stressed over not being with her family (they have codependency issues) and the load of her internships and her thesis.


I'm pretty hurt. I would have accepted her as she was. But this leaves us in an awkward position.


C is adamant we don't confront her, or hold an intervention. We agreed on that, we know she would immediately go on the defensive and it wold be a huge fight. We decided if such an intervention would happen, A should do it because she's her closest friend.


But A refuses to. She's extremely non-confrontational, and says it's okay since M is graduating this semester anyway. But this leaves the rest of in an awkward position, since we already know most of her stories are lies. 


In the meantime, S is extremely vocal about ""spilling the tea"" on her. 


What on earth do I do??


----


  **tl;dr**: Friend lied about pretty much everything, other friend is talking shit about her, and the rest of us are just left in an awkward situation. What to do????"

We both promised that it wasn't the end. On the last day, which was my birthday, she brought me a cake she made. Did a little birthday celebration with some co workers. Gave me a card. She wrote how thankful she was for all the times that I helped her.

 After she left, I started my internship and started another semester. I called her we spoke a bit about our jobs. She said she was enjoying her new job and she was just studying for her nursing exam. A week later she messages me, saying she became an RN. She got her license. Told her congratulations. Told her we should go out and celebrate. She said she was down. 
So we havent planned what to do yet. But meanwhile I figured, since Thursdays I go to my internship for just 4 hrs, I pass by downtown where she works. So I tell her on monday we should have lunch. She agrees. So thursday comes. That morning she messaged me saying she could not make it since she had to run errands. I reply with ""Aw man, maybe next time"".

No reply. But that was no big deal.

Monday comes, I message her saying ""hey, forgot my lunch, I guess today would be a 4hr day. Down to just get a coffee?"". I expected that she couldn't but nothing. No answer. Disappointed, but I Shrugged it off.

 A month passes, I try calling her but it goes straight to voicemail. I left her a message. Didn't get anything back.

 On saturday, a co worker. An old Filipino man who works with both of us asks me how ""Amy""(not her real name) is. Told him ""not sure, havent spoken to her a while. He was surprised, mainly because we were always close. 

 He says ""I'm gonna call her, just to say hi"". 
He calls, but no answer, leaves a voicemail with just a friendly greeting. 

Sunday, he tells me that she called him back. She said she misses working with him and she likes her new job etc. 

 So later that day, I try again. I call her, no answer. I leave a voicemail. But it's been a month and a half already.

Overall I know I gotta move on. But it's killing me because I'm confused. It just feels fucked up and I miss her. I would have understood if she told me she wanted to move on.

 What bugs me even more is that a few people at my job opened up about her and started talking shit and saying she was rude and crazy. One worry that I have is that she is associating me with those people and that she decided to cut me off because of it.

Heard she is quitting her current job now. Apparently she is becoming a nurse. But no idea. Just hope it's something good. And I'm not gonna stop at her job because that would be creepy as fuck lol. So no."

Will this negatively affect me in any way?

With my grades, UC Berkeley Computer Science won't let me into the major. I don't even know what I might have to major in. I don't even know how likely it is I'll get accepted back in, I can't make an advising appointment since I'm not as high priority as the currently enrolled students and I can't afford to live on campus.

I am a Senior and just landed an interview as a Staff Accountant at a F500 company for next Monday.

Next off, I'll say that it is 100% my own fault that I wasn't as proactive with this...

The company is asking for 2 letters of recommendation to turn in at the time of the interview.

I currently have one from an old boss, but do not have a second letter, which I would want to come from my current boss at my industry internship.

The issue is that it is way too short of notice to ask for a full blown letter of rec from him at this point, asking 6 days (4 business) before I'd need it is absolutely terrible.

My boss at my industry internship seems to like me, I consistently get projects done early, and have saved the company a lot of money since I joined the company back in May. I interned full-time over the summer, and work part-time during the semester. 

If you were in this situation, how annoyed would you be if someone asked you for a letter of rec with 4 days to do it?

Also, I could bring up what I've seen online a bit.... Where I would write the letter myself, then give it to him for him to edit and approve of it. That would save him a lot of time, which could make him more willing to do so on such short notice. It is a very slow time of year, but still, it is a very short amount of time.

7b93p7,1,2017-11-06,Bad optics in hiring?,bigdaveyl,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7b93p7/bad_optics_in_hiring/,"This post is a bit of a vent and observations about something that happened during my latest job search.

So, I applied for a programmer/analyst job at my alma mater which is a state school.  They were hiring for two positions and ended up bringing in six people for an on site interview.  

After a 4+ month process, they decided to only offer one of the six a position, and re-post the job to find the second person.

I had decided after fourteen years doing statistical type programming (which included a bit of programming in industry specific languages/packages) to move into something more mainstream. I tend to have more luck applying to more ""junior"" roles since I can't say I'm a ""senior java guy"" or whatever but have programming experience.

I was browsing Linkedin the other day and it looks like they hired a woman, only a year out from graduation, had no relevant internships and was working in retail for the last year.  She had a decent GPA, better than mine as an undergrad but I went to grad school and basically had straight A's there.

Of course, the only feedback (yes I asked) was ""better fit.""

I completely understand that there are people that could fit their organization better than I could, it just seems like on the surface this is bad optics that the one person you hire seemed really green and that no one seems to ever be completely honest on what exactly they are looking for or how candidates are graded out.  I hear complaints from HR/Hiring managers that they get candidates that argue with them or that if they say too much, that could open them up to liability.  How does this situation exactly diffuse any of that?  I mean, they won't share how I compared to the person they hired, so what am I to assume?  If I were three years older, I could threaten to sue, but I shouldn't have to sue them to figure out why I wasn't hired?  And I would pose that this sort of thing would actually make candidates more apt to argue and/or sue."

I recently got admitted as an Upper Division Transfer for Spring 2018. How is the Computer Science program here? How are the internship and career opportunities? Are the rumors true that the Computer Science dept is impacted with many students? How is life here in general I'm thinking of applying for housing since I live pretty far from here.  Also, are there any quirks that you like or dislike about attending CSUS.  Anyways thanks in advance for all your replies!"
7b9i39,2,2017-11-06,How do you motivate students to work and to pass?,abstractquatsch,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/7b9i39/how_do_you_motivate_students_to_work_and_to_pass/,"As an intern, I co-teach a remedial pre-algebra class for junior high students who have fallen behind in math. It's based on the ALEKS program, so every student is going at a different pace. The students have to work in silence the entire class period. 

We have a lot of issues getting them to do their work. My mentor teacher just tells them, ""I know this sucks, but if you don't want to do this next semester you have to work."" He's also tried letting them make teams to earn points based on how many topics they complete (this was the students' idea), but the students can't get it together and turn in team names, so that's not working either.

I know it's boring to stare at a computer for an hour doing math, and I would love to find a way to motivate them to work and to pass. So many are failing. My mentor teacher just lets them, because ""they're responsible for the education."" I agree to an extent, but I think they're kids who fell behind for a reason, and this can't be the best nor only way to motivate them. What should I do? Does anyone have a similar story?"

7b9rg2,7,2017-11-06,How I discovered my catfish after 2 1/2 years,saracha_ssauce,catfishstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfishstories/comments/7b9rg2/how_i_discovered_my_catfish_after_2_12_years/,"It all started in 2015 when I joined a random group skype call with people I met on a game called Wizard101. While I was in this group chat, one of the guys in the call messaged me and we started talking. Eventually we moved over to talking on Kik and it was a pretty innocent conversation about astological signs and such. About a month passes and I've learned a bunch about this guy, good and bad. He claimed to be bipolar, have chronic insomnia, that his mother ended her life, he was rich and lived in San Jose, that he was a junior in high school, and that he loved me. I had been wary of his rush to be in a relationship with me because  of the dark sides of him, but I was at low point in my life too, so we basically ended up dating. Our relationship really kicked off in summer of 2015. (I should probably mention the name he identified with, Seth Gareth Beckenbauer.) He was always extremely reluctant to show pictures of himself because he didn't like how he looked. When he finally did send me pictures, he turned out to be extremely attractive. This should have been a red flag to me, but my innocence and optimism got the best of me. So throughout the summer of 2015, we got along really well about 90% of the time, talking for hours in a call on skype almost everyday. Sometimes he even turned his video on to show me his dog, but he refused to turn the camera on himself. Again, I dismissed this because of my sympathy for the fragile person that he said he was, given his past. I also sympathized with him because my father suffers from bipolar depression as well, so I saw parallels among their behavior. At one point we even talked on the phone with with my dad and that went pretty well. But never any video chat. No matter how much I asked. Sometimes I threatened to break up with him because I couldnt dismiss the suspicion, but I never did. Once school started for him, communication became really sparse, and as the months went on, it became virtually nonexistant. I gave him leeway because he was a senior in high school and was busy with college apps and homework. The school year passes and its June of 2016. We havent skyped since October of 2015 and finally we have a conversation which goes really well. We communicate from time to time throughout the summer and skype again on August 2, 2016. Despite the lack of communication, I stayed with him because I grew a very strong attraction to him. He was smart, funny, handsome, sweet, had goals.. Etc. He treasured me and made me feel a way I never felt before. I allowed him to live in my mind even through his absence because I had such a vivid imagination and hope. He also sent me tons of videos of him walking around his fancy neighborhood, at the mall, playing with his dogs, around his house on a daily basis back in 2015, so i had a good reason to believe the claims he set forth. And they may have been based on truth, but a large part of his identity was still missing. The last time he ever messaged me himself was September 20ish, 2016, around the time I got my first job. We talked about that, but I could tell he didnt was drifting off. Then I got no messages again untl the end of December 2016, in which it read that ""Seth was sorry he hasn't been on skype, he's doing an internship and his phone fell in water and he got a new laptop,"" from his brother. Why I believed this at all makes me angry because it didnt make sense that he wouldnt just message me on his new electronics or for crying out loud tell me himself. Again my vivid imagination took hold because I didnt want to let go, but I had doubts in the back of my mind that grew overtime. Today, Im a freshman in college and his memory still lurks with me everyday. About 5 weeks ago, on September 29, 2017, I used google image search on every photo I had of his face until I found something. A connection of one photo as a smaller image, linked to a profile on twitter. I came to find that this twitter account was under the name of his  cousin and uncle (they have the same name), Artie. Eventually, after a few hours of digging on instagram, I discovered that the pictures he sent me were of his cousin Artie, not himself. I also found that ""Seth"" was really a younger guy named Carlos J (currently a junior in high school living in CA) . I requested to follow him and sent him a DM. He answered and much was said, including him denying that he knows who I am and saying that the picture of  the guy was his cousin, Artie and that I should go talk to him. I was adamant that it was him and sent him a picture he had sent me years ago of his sister holding his dog. I thought for some reason this would make him admit because how else would I have that picture. He basically said wtf and blocked me. So, that is about where I stand. I feel pretty torn because I was basically manipulated and lied to, and Im not entirely sure what he told me was real and what was fake. He actually did tell me the real first name of his mom and he is pretty wealthy, just not as much. He also plays football at a Catholic all boys high school like he said..I left out loads of information because its just such a long story, but if you would like to know more, ask questions. Thank you for reading!

7ba3m6,9,2017-11-06,Middle and High School Should be Replaced,yodarocks1,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ba3m6/middle_and_high_school_should_be_replaced/,"Yes, basic math, reading, note-taking, and basic history should be taught, but right now, everything is based on brute memorization. I mean, you need to be able to remember some things, but when that is all that you do, the people who succeed in life because of great rhetoric, critical thinking, and application are totally left in the dust. 
Before, just knowing and remembering how to do something was important when working in factories, but now we have the internet and are working in situations where high-level thinking is valued. Fields like Computer Science have realized that having a high school diploma or even a college degree is beginning to mean nothing, and hold 3 month highly concentrated programs that you can take, which, if you do not like the program, you can get partially refunded. Then, you can go and get an internship with most any company (which now accept these programs as meeting the requirement, if the concentration is applicable), and have a 90-day probation period, during which you can be fired for any reason, though it must be disclosed, and then you get the job if you are a hard-working, intelligent person.
That is how it should be with any profession. No unneeded waste of time and money. The programs cover everything that would normally need to be learned in High School, whether you are going into Engineering, Medicine, Plumbing, Teaching, Construction, Law, or even Cosmetology, with a few electives thrown in, while Middle School is replaced with finding out what you want to do. Maybe you take a test that shows you what you like, and then do a 3- or 6-week job shadow to learn what they do, and if you find it unappealing, then you can easily switch to another job shadow until you find what you want and do a longer 8-week job shadow or a 3-week internship before going into the 3 month program (which could be longer or shorter, depending on the major), maybe finishing at 14 and then take starter jobs to develop a strong work ethic and a reputation, maybe finding a company you like, until you leave home (likely around 18), and then apply for a real job.
This would prevent people ending up in jobs that they do not like and giving a specialized education to anyone who wants it.


Your feedback is greatly appreciated as I just recently came up with this idea, and have yet to refine it."

I plan on transferring in Fall 2018 to SDSU, assuming I get accepted. I've been focusing more on school than working in order to get the best grades so I can get accepted. 

I've taken out two $5,500 Stafford loans from my community college. Both are fixed, one is @ 3.76% and one @ 4.45%.

I've spent $1200 on books and classes. 

This leaves me with about $7050 left. 

SDSU offers the Perkins loans and I plan on taking the maximum I can out ($12,500 I think, my parents are not eligible for PLUS loans). This leaves me with $19,550 to pay for SDSU and living there. 

I created a budget containing Rent, Tuition, Groceries, Gas, Books, Subscriptions (just spotify), and personal expenses. It came out to be ~$22000 for the year.

My summer job should make me ~$3600 and I'll also be working during the semester until summer. I've estimated this to be around a total of $7,500 to be made by the time I hit college. 

This leaves me with ~$5,000 by the summer after my 3rd year of college, assuming I don't work at all during the school year (although I will).

I'm trying to avoid private loans as much as possible, although during my 4th year I will dip into them if I need to. 

**My biggest concerns: Am I doing this right? It seems like this is my only option to be able to pay for school. Is taking out maximum federal loans and working a lot (and the stress of possibly overspending during the year) worth not taking out any private loans?

7ba7vg,1,2017-11-06,Questions about my situation/general questions.,xXragemonsterXx,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/7ba7vg/questions_about_my_situationgeneral_questions/,"Hello, r/aerospaceengineering, 

I am a high school senior from Oregon looking into becoming an aerospace engineer. As of right now, I am going to go to attend Oregon State University (Hopefully the Honors College) to major in Mechanical engineering and minor in aerospace engineering as OSU does not have an aerospace program. 

I know that mechanical engineers can get jobs in the aerospace industry, but it is under my understanding that they need some background in aerospace engineering from an internship. As far as I know, Oregon does not have any aerospace companies (besides Lockheed Martin) so it would be very difficult for me to secure an aerospace internship. 

Here are my questions:

1. Despite the lack of internships available, is it possible to secure a job at a company like SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or Airbus?

2. What can I do to make it more likely that I secure a job in the aerospace industry? (What clubs can I join/create, what additional classes should I take alongside the default course outline, and what personal projects can I do?)

3. Let's say I do secure a job in the industry, would I (Mechanical engineer) be able to work on both aircraft and spacecraft?

4. Would it be better for me to go to a university that has an actual aerospace engineering major despite the added costs of attending a college out of state? (I applied to the University of Washington, the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities, San Diego State University, and Virginia Tech)---&gt; I am considering applying to CU Boulder to open up another option.

5. A spin-off question similar to 4 I have is: Would it be smart to get my Pre-engineering courses done at OSU and then transfer to a school with aerospace engineering?

6. I heard that I need to learn how to code and plan to over the summer. What programming languages should I learn? Are there any specific programs that I should dabble in?

7. How much studying do I realistically need to do while in college to obtain a high GPA? Do you have any personal rules that you follow in order to get your studying done efficiently? 

Thanks so much for answering these questions! I really appreciate it!"

I feel like there is a stigma (especially in my area) where interns either 1. don’t really do much work 2. have only like 1 project the entire 4 months etc.

Thank you if you read this far into my post. Should I put analyst (contractor) or analyst (temp) to differentiate from an internship? Would that be ok/ethical? Or is there another way.. I want to exemplify to recruiters (even before the initial interview) that I was doing full-time employee work / real world work after my graduation from my resume. Also, if I put “contractor” vs “internship” will it affect background check?

Thank you so much!"

If I take 12 credits of 400-level math, I get a math Minor. 
If I take 12 credits of 400-level stat, I get a stat minor.
If I take 26 credits of economics courses, I get a economics major, but I'm not really sure if it counts because it's through the college of liberal arts. 

I'm also looking to do a semester abroad, and will probably extend my college experience out to 5 years.

Need some help differentiating my “post-graduate summer internship.” So essentially, I graduated in June 2017 and was immediately employed as an analyst intern. It was kind of strange, because typically at tech firms you can’t intern after graduation.

It was an summer internship that was supposed to be converted to full-time. Kinda like a contractor position/temp. I didn’t accept the full-time offer b/c of my own personal things. I did everything that a full time employee normally does, because at the time, I even thought I wanted to go through with the conversion. There was another intern there that was actually still in college; she had less responsibilities and projects.  It was more of a “summer intern.” My responsibilities and the things I were being taught was “full-time” stuff.

I am a 22M who is pursuing a BS in Computer Networking and Cyber Security. I chose this path because it became a growing field within the area, and a lot of people told me to follow it because thats where the ""money"" is. I currently do not have any job experience within the IT field, neither have I been an intern, OR have any certifications. I am currently working on getting my A+,Security+, and possibly my Network+ within the next year. I am not too confident in my skills within the field and I am afraid that I am working towards failure. This, would be a job for money.

Another option that I am considering is, switching majors and schools, and pursing culinary arts. I always dreamed about being a chef, and I LOVE to cook. I am currently a member of a group, where we would sell food, and where I would cook for it. I also cook a lot at home, and for several friends and have had several compliments about my cooking. The only issue is that I am afraid of the cost to go, and the outcome (money made back after paying debt of going). I have also heard that being a chef requires a lot of working hours. I normally cook for maybe 3 hours MAX a day and at least 12 hours a week. I cant imagine doing 12 hour shifts or anything. Though, thats only me assuming. I havent really talked to any chefs or researched much about it. Though, I should because I just love food so much. I have imagined myself opening/being a chef at a steakhouse or maybe a sushi chef. 

I really dont know what path I should take, but suggestions and advice would help!"

Hey J! 

Its been a long time since I've posted on this account, and to be honest I've some incredible reservations with posting here anymore. Forced myself to wait yet another day, another day, and another day, making sure I wanted to send this. Well I want to send it.

I'm so happy right now. Life fucking took so much away from me, kicked me while I was down, and had me seriously considering suicide for the longest time. Cuts, blood, thoughts of getting hit by cars were the only constants I had for months. 

And I'm getting so much better. So much happier than I think I've ever been in life. Works sucks even if it is only 30 hours a week, but I enjoy it to a certain degree as well. My life is not perfect by any means, in fact its really fucking difficult sometimes. But its calm. I've made a couple new friends here and a lot of my doubts have been alleviated. A couple dates here and there too, but none of those have amounted to anything really. It has upped my self confidence a bit though! I'm glad I can at least find other people that think I'm attractive.

New hobbies too! I'm getting slowly better at guitar, and I sometimes practice the piano as well. Flute I'm still at odds with, as its my best instrument, but I have no idea how to improve myself without a proper teacher. I'm also getting in to archery! Fired a few arrows for the first time, and I'm getting a bow sometime this October! Then I'm probably going to get a private fencing instructor as well. The funny cherry on top here is my moms willing to pay for me to go to the gym, but on the condition that I consistently go 3 times a week, and she'll cancel it if I don't. Which is kind of a hilarious win-lose situation, but whatever forces me out of the house I guess when I'm not slaving away at work. Also getting my 1300 dollar gaming PC soon! That's gonna be fun.

Life's so nice now. I'll go back to a school eventually (not sure where, certainly not back to ours). I'm really not sure if I'm going back next semester, or maybe next year. I know what I want to do as a job in the future now. Even though its really difficult, at least its a goal. I've met so many people recently, with degrees and without, and they really haven't any ambitions. At least I have a dream. 

I love myself. I wouldn't trade being me for being the people I've blocked off, regardless of their college or current internships. They know nothing of loyalty, of love, of empathy. I'm better. I'm real. And none of them - NONE of them, have had a relationship like we had. That, I am sure of. I hold that fact very near and dear to my heart, petty as it may be.

I fucking needed this. I had so much pent up stress and depression accumlating over the years, and I feel like I finally have a fucking break. And I owe so much to you, J. Even after our falling out, you've provided this gift for me. You being the final nail in my coffin at the time - THAT finally started the death I needed to experience. With no money, hungry, desolate, alone every day- those are my reminders. I had fucking nothing, and now I have something.

I should let you know though. I feel like you and I share the same sentiment, that we should never contact one another again. That's been going on for so many months now, and I don't have the number of months of exile stapled at the back of my mind anymore. But we're on different paths now, and should stay on those.

Thank you. I can't express that deeply enough. Thank you, thank you so fucking much, for at least letting me have a taste of what love is like. I've been so miserable for so long, and while your loss left me devastated, it gave me a chance to look at all the cuts I've been carrying, forcing me to heal. You've made me feel the extremity of every single emotion there is to feel. 

To tell you the truth, I'm saddened that you'll never see the person I'm slowly becoming right now. Even now I sometimes wish things worked out between us. But I'm free of that constant wish for the most part. I'll find someone eventually. I'm pretty cool tbh. 

I really do love you, you know. I think I'll name something after you, not sure what though! Perhaps my bow? A fencing foil/sabre/epee(not sure which sword I'm going to commit to)? Or I'm planning on getting a balisong soon as well! You have such a pretty name, that carries weight and history to my heart.

7bc6ma,2,2017-11-07,"Cover letter/advice for someone who's been on disability for 10 years, now trying to find a job.",PurpleJokerGas,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/7bc6ma/cover_letteradvice_for_someone_whos_been_on/,"I finished a BA in economics with a low GPA, 2.3, in 2006. 

What I didn't know at the time was that a severe chronic anxiety disorder, and mild/moderate ADHD were the primary reasons I couldn't focus and absorb things in classes, and sometimes was unable to finish entire exams. Severe anxiety also affected my ability to socialize.

I tried applying to jobs back then, like financial analyst, cost analyst, pricing, budget analyst, etc. - But they quickly denied me, or asked over the phone what my experience and GPA was. I couldn't get internships because of the GPA, and I'd freeze up in interviews because of severe anxiety. 

I've had a few very brief jobs - two were sales-based, and one was making phone calls to aggregate/update data. With sales, I'd freeze up, hyperventilate/stutter, and not be able to sound convincing at all. I quit both those within a week. I don't have the personality for sales anyways, and don't like lying to people/trying to sell them stuff they don't need.

With the phone job, the same thing almost: Even though we had a script of questions to go through, I got super nervous again, lost my place, and a couple times panicked and hung up in the middle of the call. I left that job after 2 days.

I've been to numerous career fairs and been denied almost immediately or get no reply. I've applied to government positions too. I even got my doctor to write a Schedule A letter for gov't. jobs for preference for people with disabilities. A few hiring coordinators asked me to send it, then I never heard anything back from them. I also went to a couple temp agencies who did brief interviews, took my resume, then never did anything else for me. Bender Consulting Services (for people with disabilities) did the same thing - I talked with a guy on the phone, sent him my resume, and never heard anything else. That was over a year ago.

For some years I took a detour into geology and other science courses, but then got scared off of that when I thought I'd have to live in a trailer for weeks at a time in the middle of nowhere. Also, geology is so cyclical that people get laid off all the time. 

So then I started taking more accounting courses, and now have enough courses to be eligible for the CPA. But I don't think I want to do accounting long-term. I think I'd rather look into an MBA, MPA, or something else. I thought if I had ""eligible for the CPA"" on my resume, that might be as good as a degree in accounting or finance, and might be able to get something now.

In addition to accounting, I looked at what jobs people with economics degrees typically get. Marketing research, operations research, data analysis, and others came up. So I looked at what skills were offered, and earned certifications in Tableau, Google Analytics, and SPSS. I also thought about SAS, SAP, and some others. 

But I think the 3 is enough - I just want a job already. Adding an MS Excel cert might be the only other I'd consider - but who hasn't used Excel in business classes? That cert seems like a waste of money. I haven't applied much yet with the new certifications and associates, but I think it will be the same thing when I apply again: ""what was your GPA, when did you graduate?"" (even though it was over 10 years ago, and I'm an entirely different person now), and ""what's your experience?"" (same problem I was in before, but now I've overcome the problem that caused it)

Now I'm in my mid 30s and think every day about the time my disability has wasted. All the people I met in college now ignore me, so no help there - they likely think I'm lazy, or just a loser.

I'm aiming this post at professional career advisers or counselors. If you come on here to insult me, it won't do anything. I've heard it all before.

Thanks for reading, thanks in advance for your suggestions."

The second boss gets my weekly updates on progress and so far, I have been able to deliver most of my milestones at or above expectations. 

The third boss, is basically the founder. He is not involved in my day to day and, while he has asked for a few items directly from me, may not have a good sense of my capabilities.  

What is the best strategy to approach this? Go directly to the top decision maker or speak more frankly with my immediate boss to get a feel first?

I would like to embark upon this venture through the Master's program offered by the Computer Science Department at Arizona State University.
I was twelve years old when I first had the experience with the computer while using Logo commands in school for drawing various shapes from a little turtle. I loved it because while working on it I was able to experiment with my creativity. I would often ponder on how e-mails are sent instantly and how games are developed on computers. Then, I learned C++ in junior high school. In the final years of my schooling, I was especially most drawn towards computers as I learned a lot about programming. Furthermore, I was introduced to logical, creative and “behind the scenes” side of applications. With the accomplishment of the school project, “Examination Management system” I had the epiphany that with lines of code a lot can be achieved. Since my project was awarded as the best, my confidence was greatly reinforced. In hindsight, I can say from a “hello world” program to every complex program, from every #include to getch() and simple command to an intricate one, my passion for computer science has boosted. These small moments of revelation led me to figure out my deep penchant for computer science engineering and hence to the decision to pursue under graduation in it. 

During my first half of the undergraduate program, I learned about various programming languages such as C++, C#, and Python. These gave me a perception of the fascinating virtual world of computing characterized by miraculous lines of codes. This understanding and fascination led me to program the Game of Tetris in C++. This little project, not only helped me to implement my knowledge, but it also enhanced my creative side.

Over the course of first half of my undergraduate program, I participated in various programming contests, as well as headed the technical society of my college. I was always into the practical side of my studies which that is why I created various applications for my college such as online attendance, online class schedule, and others. I also created an online examination system for specific subjects which stored marks of different students in the Computer Science department.

By this time, Cloud Computing was on a rise. Every newspaper, science journal, scholar, the engineer was called “Cloud” as the future of science and technology. With a limited number of resources available, it was difficult to gain knowledge about it. But I was lucky, as IBM collaborated with our university to provide us with specialization in “Cloud Computing and Virtualization”. I studied various Cloud Computing models, Business Intelligence tools, and Cloud Service providers. 

The work I did during my summer internship at IGATE, an IT company in India, helped me to gain deep insight into how “Cloud” has made our lives so easy and how it is slowly coming up with solutions to data storage problems. During this internship, and because of my academic project, in which I created a public and private cloud on the LAMP, WAMP and XAMP servers, I developed a keen interest in this technology. 

Along with Cloud Computing, I was introduced to another technology, Artificial Intelligence. During my semester of fall 2015, I studied this new age of evolution. Artificial Intelligence, which lies at the confluence of human intelligence and technology, captivated me. With the knowledge of programming languages, as well as Artificial Intelligence, I always tried experimenting with them together. This experimentation led me to program an implementation of various aspects of Genetic Algorithm in JAVA, as well as, the creation of chatbot framework in Python.

During my final year of my undergraduate degree, I carried out research on “Security issues in cloud” in which I delved deep into measures and tools that could be used to enhance security. I created a system where we could send and download any file only through a keypair and extensively researched on the intricacies faced in private and public cloud. With my focused efforts, I gained insights into the many layers that exist in private cloud and how on each level and layer we can create a system which can ensure security. 

With a goal to sharpen my skills and to experience the ways a company works and to implement my knowledge in real life, I started working as a Project Engineer and later as Associate Analyst for WIPRO Technologies in 2016. I worked on Wipro and Salesforce project “Ventiv”, in which I had to carefully monitor the Cloud Resources and the Services provided. 

While working on “Ventiv”, I learned about how to build and manage Cloud resources and how to efficiently use Cloud services as a software, application and business processes. I was also actively involved in finding and solving bugs and errors. At Wipro, I created various reports of resources available and was also involved in the pricing of resources. Also, while working on this project I studied about the view control technology and also about various tools such as Salesforce Lightning App Builder.

It was during my time at Wipro, I learned about the immense power “Cloud Computing” holds. Aligned with my interest and motivation, I am eager to explore the domains of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. It would be fascinating to see what will happen if we combine both these technologies. The grooming at Arizona State University will endow me with tools I need to attain these goals. At your university, I will gain the chance to engage myself in research under the guidance of distinguished professors.The best academic resources and facilities at avant-garde labs will be useful to upgrade my knowledge and prepare myself for aspirations centered on research.

As an intern I'm supposed to be helping out with the Helpdesk, Imaging computers, AD management and a few other things. 

But then..... A few hours after my interview I received a call from a company I had applied about a month ago wanting to set up a phone interview (the position is as an Entry Level Helpdesk in a call center, paid holydays, PTO, vacation time, you could say it's a great package?! and the other thing is the salary ranges from $10-$12 I hadn't heard back from the Intern position yet, so I said what the heck what can I lose, well I did pretty well in the interview and I'm supposed to be going in for a 2nd one in a few hours.  

Pause, I hope you're able to understand the dilemma I'm going through right now, I can't choose which company I'd rather work for. As an Intern i'll be exposed to different roles, which is something I'm interested in, but there aren't any benefits, no holidays off, no vacation, nothing.

Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Need advice on how to proceed.",throwawaynamingshard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bdvkc/my_25f_friends_29f_husband_29m_has_been_sending/,"Hey, Relationships! I could really use some outside perspective, here. Thanks so much.


I became friends with Sarah (now 29f) about 5 years ago, in college. This is the same time I became friends with Michael (now 29m). They hit it off and began dating, and also became part of my regular friend group. They seemed super happy. But a little while later, Michael broke up with Sarah. 


After they broke up, I began working as an intern with Sarah (in the same cube, even!), and she became one of my very best friends. This is when I learned more about their breakup. It wasn't pretty. He was really mean to her. He refused to give her back a sentimental locket she had. He called her all sorts of terrible things. A good example is once he heard her laugh from across the room in class and sent her a text that said ""Shut your fucking mouth. I hate the sound of your fucking annoying laugh."" I read some of the the texts. It was really sad stuff. She was heartbroken and confused.


About two years later, our senior year, they got back together. This was after Michael had slept his way around the department, which hurt Sarah, but she really loves him and took him back. I was skeptical, of course, but what are you gonna do? She's a super private person, and basically refused to discuss anything but the happy stuff with us.


About two years after getting back together, they got married. It was partially so Sarah could stay in the country (she's from another country), but they were elated about it. They had been really happy every time we all hung out together-- usually they were so mushy and touchy it was kind of sickening. My boyfriend, Camillo, (now 25m), also one of their best friends, officiated their tiny wedding on top of a hill. I gave a speech and signed the witness papers. That was it. They were married. And they were so so so so happy.


Okay. Now we're here at current day.


Michael sends me weird text messages. The first one came about a year ago. It said ""You're so pretty it makes me want to punch a giraffe."" Okay? I figured Sarah was in on it and I sent back some dumb giraffe gif.


A few months later, after all hanging out together, he texted me, ""You looked so cute tonight I wanted to give Camillo a swirly."" I think I reacted the wrong way here. I just said something like ""But Camillo is too beautiful for a toilet!"" Probably should have been more forthcoming with this making me uncomfortable, but the thing is, he makes comments about me all the time when we're all together. He'll make a comment about my butt or my looks in general and Sarah always laughs or agrees and it's kind of weird but also light hearted. I just wasn't totally sure if he was being really weird of it I was overreacting.


About half a year went by with nothing weird. Then he texted me about some apocalyptic dream he had where he was trying to find a gun so he could end his life on his terms but wanted to kiss me first so was looking everywhere for me. He told me he missed me. What? We've never spoken to each other like that. I just completely ignored it. I showed Camillo. He thought it was weird, but not a big deal. So I left it at that.


One one occasion, we all hung out together at my family's house. He spent the whole night making jokes about strangling me. I was freaked out by it, but Steph and Camillo both said that's just his sense of humor. Which is true. It is. But I feel I am often singled out for these kind of ""jokes."" I felt really alone and confused. My gut was telling me this is not okay. Everyone else was telling me it is.


Then, 2 months ago, HE SENT ME A PICTURE OF HIM HOLDING SARAH'S BOOB IN HIS HAND. He wrote ""So fucking big."" I immediately wrote back ""What the fuck?"" I knew Sarah wouldn't be okay with this. I texted her immediately. Her reaction was ""Ugh, stupid Michael. He's so weird."" And then she changed the subject. Camillo was finally starting to see that this is not okay, as was our other friend, Steph (25) who has been hanging out with us all this whole time and knows about everything as well.


About a month after this, I got a text from him with a picture of a mannequin wearing a lacy lingerie teddy. He said ""I'm sorry I want to buy you this."" I was absolutely pissed. Camillo and Steph agreed this was really not okay behavior. I was glad they were finally seeing he's being really messed up. I didn't respond. He continued to text me other strange but not sexual things, and i didn't respond.


Here's why: We were all going on vacation to another country together in 2 weeks. For their anniversary, no less! I didn't want to start something now. I wanted to get through the vacation, and then make up my mind on what to do. 


On vacation, I told Camillo and Steph I didn't want to be left alone with him. I guess he made some sexual comment about me to everyone while I was in the shower once. This is all that happened of that nature, and I feel relieved for that.


However, he said something to Sarah that really bothered me. I didn't hear it, only Steph did. Apparently Sarah was poking him, being cutesy, and he snapped ""Can you stop? It makes me want to push you over so you fall on your face.""


This was devastating for me to hear. I'm worried he's going to be mean to her again, if he isn't already. What is also worrisome is that he gets all pissy and worked up about nothing, and the way she diffuses/dismisses/caters to him in these times is really concerning to me. We'd all be happy and having fun and he would just bring down the mood by snapping at us or at someone, and she would completely justify it. 


So now I need to figure out how to proceed. I want to tell Sarah everything. I feel terrible that I haven't. But she's so starry-eyed over him that I doubt she'll do anything about it. I can even see her getting mad at me for blowing things out of proportion. Also, I have this gut feeling that he shouldn't know that I told her everything. I am afraid of what he might do. I really am a bit afraid of him at this point.


I don't want to lose Sarah's friendship. She is a caring, wonderful person who I love working with (outside of work, we work for different companies now but work on side projects together and it's always great). We do our best work together. I really love her. I'm also scared that she won't have anyone when their relationship goes South. Again, she's VERY private.


But I can't deal with Michael anymore. Relationships, please tell me how to proceed from here. Thank you so much.

---   
**tl;dr**: Best friend is married to a dude who creeps me out, and also seems to be being mean to her again. I don't want him to be a part of my life anymore, but I don't want to lose her. I want to be honest with her, but I'm afraid of what he'll do. Help!

7bdw9h,307,2017-11-07,My Experiences: Fucked in the Gym Shower by a Muscle Daddy,gaythrowaway4444,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7bdw9h/my_experiences_fucked_in_the_gym_shower_by_a/,"Hey bros, been a while since I've last posted so I'll give my description real quickly: 22, white, light brown hair in an Ivy League cut, dark brown eyes, build somewhere between twink and athletic. My body's best feature is my muscular, round bubble butt, the product of years of squats and deadlifts. 

While I was interning in New York this summer, I joined a gym close to the office. I got a discount for working where I did, and the facility was enormous and full of every type of equipment you could want, including a swimming pool, sauna, and steam room.   I didn't realize when I joined, but this gym is overwhelmingly patronized by gay men, which I was thrilled to discover. Who wouldn't love a gym full of muscular, lean hunks who don't mind if you sneak a peek in the locker room? I went every day before work, and one day a few months ago, I found myself in the pool, wearing a tight white bikini that left next to nothing to the imagination. Besides the lifeguard, with whom I had a flirty relationship with, even though unfortunately nothing happened between us, there was only one other person in the pool that early in the morning. He was in the pool when I arrived, and I admired his form, as well as his powerful looking hairy legs leading up to his bright red bikini. I hopped in the pool and did my laps for the day, then went to the adjoining steam room to relax for a bit, as was my habit on days that I swam.

I sat on the long bench in the steam room, legs spread, allowing as much of my skin as possible to soak up the steam, when I heard the door open. The other guy from the pool came in with his towel around his neck, and my jaw nearly dropped. This guy was the definition of a muscle daddy. Salt and pepper hair and beard, massive pecs and arms, beautifully defined abs, and legs as thick as tree trucks, all coated with a layer of thick black hair. Looking at his bikini, I saw that he had plenty to offer downstairs as well. I looked back up to his face, and blushed when he winked at me. I'd definitely been caught and quickly leaned back and closed my eyes again. About a minute later, I glanced over at him on the other end of the bench. He was openly rubbing his bulging crotch, and watching him was getting me incredibly hard. I slowly slid down the bench towards him.

When I reached his end of the bench I put my hand on his Lycra wrapped cock and whispered ""want some help with that daddy?"" He smiled and pulled my lean body into his muscular one and kissed me roughly ""what took you so long boy?""

He pushed me to his knees in front of him and roughly ground his crotch into my face. Loving the rough treatment, I moaned as I licked his shaft through his swimwear while he stuck his hand down the back of my bikini and played with my hole. I tried using my teeth to pull the front of his suit down, but he cut me off and stood me up ""5 minutes. Last shower on the left"" then stood up and walked out, not even attempting to hide his massive erection.

I waited a beat then followed. This gym had a staircase from the pool that led directly to the men's locker room, which had several enclosed shower stalls with doors. I quickly went to my locker and stripped off my suit, grabbing a towel as I walked towards the shower corridor. My erection was out for all to see before I wrapped in my towel, but erections in the locker room were commonplace in this gym, with all the gay men and testosterone around, so nobody gave me a second look. The last shower on the left was the most private in the place, and the door was cracked. I let the towel fall as I slid through the door, and the daddy tossed it over the door and slammed my naked body against the wall, hand around my throat and cock pressed against my smooth hairless bubble butt. I still hadn't seen daddy's tool, but I could feel it was big, and definitely hairy like the rest of him. After grinding against my ass and leaving a slimy trail of precum in my crack, he shoved me to the ground and without waiting jammed his cock all the way into the back of my mouth. I gagged and choked, which only served to make daddy smile and start my first true skullfucking. His cock was over 8 inches long, and thick. It was the first time a man had been so blatant about using my body for his pleasure alone, and it made me feel like such a sexy slut. My cock was drooling a thick strand of precum on the shower floor.

After several minutes of the roughest blowjob I've ever given, daddy Yanked me to my feet, ran his hand over my cock to collect my precum, and smeared it on my crack and in my hole. While he fingered me, his tongue was in my mouth and his other hand around my throat, and my legs were going weak from pleasure. He whispered in my ear ""I don't have any condoms, but I'm neg and on prep if you're interested"".  I moaned back that I was also negative and on prep, and daddy grinned and shoved my face to the shower floor, kneeling behind me while he held up my hips. Every man I'd ever been with before who was his size had taken his time entering me. Not daddy. He just clapped a hand over my mouth and plowed in. I tried to yelp, to moan my pain and my pleasure, but couldn't past his thick, rough man hand. He held his hand there the first few minutes of his assault on my boihole, before I had sufficiently stretched that the only noises I was making were quiet moans.

The next twenty minutes were amongst the most pleasurable I'd ever had. Daddy knew how to fuck like no man I'd ever been with before. Each long stroke he took ran his thick slab of meat against my prostate, and finally had to moan ""I'm so close daddy"". He stood me up, still thrusting inside me, and started fisting my cock. A few strokes later he aimed my cock at my face and I let loose a massive series of strings of cum, plastering my face and chest with it. My ass clenching around him must have brought him close, as he pulled out, pushed me to my knees, and jammed his cock, wet with my anal juices, into my mouth for a few strokes before unloading a massive man load all over my face.

Suddenly he was tender. He pulled me into an embrace, gently cupping my ass, and told me how sexy I looked covered in both of our cumshots. He then washed me and told me not to leave without getting his card, then sent me back out into the locker room with a light slap on my well used ass. My still hard cock led the way as I walked to my locker and started dressing for work. A few minutes later, daddy walked over, talking for benefit of the guys around us how he had enjoyed our steam room conversation on the bond market and I should call him about that internship. I don't think anyone bought it, as we were both just wearing tight Andrew christian briefs and I was definitely walking a little crooked, but like I said, it was a gay gym. On the back of the card he had written that he wanted to make me his boy and I should get tested and bring the results to dinner the next Saturday night, where he would do the same and we could talk about ""how it'd work"". That'll be my next few stories though ;).

Thanks for reading bros, I hope you enjoyed!  I've only got a few more story-worthy true stories to write on, so I was thinking I could start writing some fiction if people were interested. If you have an idea of something you'd like me to write on, dm me! As always, comments and dms on this story are always appreciated!"

Although I just graduated 6 months ago, I have a decent amount of experience: school and GPA is not impressive BUT many impressive projects, 2 internships, and started new grad job this past summer all with large, very well-known tech companies. I've been given interviews with G and Bill Gates in the past. Would it be safe for her to choose the bay area under the assumption that I could find a good job?

I was an HVAC mechanic &amp; service tech until an injury ended that career. I healed up and went to college looking for a new one. 

All the googling I've done told me a that today a resume longer than a page is the kiss of death, so I've done my damnedest to stick to one page, the heck with the margins.

Recently &amp; especially today i identified some subconscious triggers. My mother called me today telling me i should apply to jobs. Ever since i have an immense resistance towards doing thus. ( i am doing an internship currently and have another job with a psychiatrist, currently doing my last semester as a psychology student). And no matter if i should really keep looking or not, i would like to apply to jobs but for the love of god, it feels goddamn aweful to start. 

Same thing is happening with my masters thesis, the more my mother asks about it, the more resistance i feel to actually get started. 


When i was little, my mother used to force me to do extra homework for school, homework that was not even requested by my school. I just was forced to do double the amount of work that was actually assigned. 

So today i sit in my room, and think to myself i want to be productive. I want to have a sucessful life, i want to be able to work on my passions...and realize my potention..but i cant start. This is causing me stress, and i can even see the escapes from those feelings i attempt. For instance =&gt; Desire to eat candy &amp; to drink coffee rises. Just to not fucking feel the repressed shit.


So theory time for things that keep me back from actually executing my own desires &amp; passions: 

* Doing productive stuff is coupled with a lot of negative feelings from my childhood, so everytime i try to start my subconcious is reactivating these feelings (to a degree) and putting resistance on it...so i do not have to re experience the same bad feelings. 

* I might be subconsciously identified with the motive to break free of the chains of oppression, so giving in to my mothers wishes, would mean staying in oppression. 


I feel both is true to an extend. But how the fuck can i break free from this and change my subconscious? 
I could just go power through by force. HOWEVER...this was my solution until now....and i can suceed like this to a degree...but it is like having boulders chained to my feet that keep me from running towards where i want to go.

I believe it is now the point to apply for full-time positions. However, I am having trouble deciding what positions to apply to.

Throughout my seven years study (four at community college, remaining three at university ), I have participated in three notable internships (Project Management, Process Engineering, and Systems Engineering) and various engineering projects. Most of these experiences had mechanical design (CAD) components to them. So, yes, I can apply to positions that I know for sure I CAN DO... but do I really want to design?

What really struck my passion string was what I did for my last internship. It was a project that required me to take an objective and, on my own with some inputs from others, design, develop, present, fabricate, integrate, and test. For this project, I have developed the mechanical design of the test fixture, the electrical system, and the automation software control and test interface (LabVIEW). The LabVIEW code was comprised of SEVERAL queue messaging handlers controlled by one master event loop. This fixture had to control the actuation, communicate to the SCARA robot, and acquire data at the right time. Although I would have liked to use Python, I was able to get the test fixture up and running faster. I would like to say that I have successfully accomplished this project.

Even though mechanical designing is my backbone, I want to branch out into software development. However, every time I look for jobs online, all I see is mobile/app/web positions. I am not interested in these.

Please advise me on what CS positions I should narrow my job search to and, if you have any, suggest companies that might have positions that I would be interested in. Here are some project examples that I have in the pipeline (just waiting on facilities,  funding, and time): robotic hexapod, quadcopter, AR video game, etc. Also, most of my experiences on my resume is related to mechanical engineering, please advise on how I should revise or improve my resume for CS job opportunities.

Some more information:

I live in the Bay Area so I know there are a lot of tech opportunities. I am open to relocating (namely... Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles, Vietnam, Japan...!).

I program mostly in Java... Scala most recently... And am learning Python. I have used C++ before, but I would not call myself an expert. I have DSA and OOP checked."

I've been living with my girlfriend for 3 and a half years, and recently we moved to a new city where she's starting her post-graduate degree. We both graduated together back in September, and I'm currently unemployed, having just finished off a summer internship. I had planned to take a short break before looking for work again around Jan/Feb next year, but just got an unexpected offer for my dream job, to start in 2 weeks. The problem is that job is based in our original city, 500 miles away, and I now need to make a call on whether to move back there for it without my girlfriend.

We would definitely want to stay together, but it would be quite a strain, both emotionally and financially. I'd hate to be away from her for too long, especially if she needs me around. My girlfriend suffers from mental illness, and can occasionally depend on me for taking care of her, sometimes for a couple of days at a time. The journey between cities is at least 5 hours, so I could realistically come back for weekends if I can cope with that journey time every week/two weeks. That said, tickets are expensive, not to mention that I would have to pay rent for 2 different places at once. My salary would cover it, but I would only just be breaking even.

How can I possibly make a decision here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Other info:
* My girlfriend's Ph.D lasts at least 4 years, and she has no intention to drop out
* We eventually plan to move back to our original city once she's graduated
* The job is in quite a niche field, and there are no similar companies in our current city
* The job is with the international leaders for this field, so would be the best start to my career regardless
* My background isn't quite the same area as the job - I got an interview by chance through a lucky connection, but otherwise would struggle a lot to get my foot in the door at other companies due to my lacking experience
* My girlfriend would greatly prefer me to be around to support her through her Ph.D, but also thinks I should accept the job, and doesn't want to me the deciding factor


**tl;dr**: I've been cohabiting with my girlfriend for the past 3+ years, but I've just been offered my dream job in a city 500 miles away, and my girlfriend is unable to move with me. How can I make a decision on whether to accept it?"

I applied for two internship positions at a large CPG company in NYC. I was able to pass their first two rounds of online tests, which involved logical reasoning and personal questionnaires. After that, I received an automated email saying I've been moved forward in the process and should hear back within the coming weeks. That was towards the end of September.

My contact at the company did all she could in terms of seeing where I am in the process. I am now sending out cold emails to contacts listed on my Universities career page, as well as trying to make connections through mutual contacts on LinkedIn. At this point, I'm just trying to see where I am.

The Two positions were Marketing and Sales. The status of the Marketing position says the last update was September 15th. The Sales status says October 8th. Both just say ""completed"".
Very aggravated, as getting an opportunity with this company would be a dream.

Aside from this company, I've been extremely aggressive with applying for Internships and reaching out to people. My father is well connected and I've been getting help all around. Just hope I'm not being too aggressive here.

If anyone has any insight on my situation, I would love to hear what you have to say. I know sometimes that no news is good news but..."

There's two companies, let's say A and B. I'll lay out the situation on both below as briefly as possible. Bit about me first.

* Canadian. So I need a visa to work in the US. 
* Will not have my undergrad CS degree completed until April 2018. Looking at going to Master's for September 2018.

Company A

* Coop'd there 8 months in Canada office in 2015
* Interned 3 months at US HQ in Bay Area for Summer 2016
  * Received a return offer - full-time or intern
* Was due last Friday, got extended till this Friday
* Recruiter is saying they only give internships of ~3 months, I need January - August 2018. Likely can't do full time since I won't have a degree by January and US gov't checks before granting TN visa.
* Manager told me during summer to extend my degree (which I did till April 2018, could have graduated December 2017) so as to be eligible for internship. Said something 8 months is possible. Now, not as confident. Slow to respond. Said we may have to wait until I'm there to figure it out, which is issue with visa and my sanity.
* I have not even seen what sort of offer (basically $/hr compensation, rest of perks same as 2016) I would be getting on internship here. I have seen the full time offer and know that it is lower than others/should be increased. Expecting a lowball as I have been there a long time, having a B offer would allow me to counter.

Company B

* 1st Round telephone on Oct. 27
* Same recruiter whole time. On Monday Oct 30, tells me they want 2nd and final telephone round. I give times and say my deadline is that Friday. I email a 2nd time on Wednesday. He responds Friday. 
* I extend my Company A offer by a week. Still last Friday, the original Company A deadline. I send my availability for this week by end of business last Friday, mentioning again the new deadline of end of next week/7 days and that I would prefer Mon or Tues interview.
* It's now Tuesday, haven't heard back about even when the 2nd round would be happening.

**What do I do?** 

I would totally rather go with Company B if offered a choice. **I assume I should email the B recruiter ASAP?** I don't have a phone number for him. I haven't double emailed him yet since his last communication. **Should I ask A for another extension, and explain why?** When I phoned last time, she phrased it like ""for right now, we are only extending one week"". **In any case, I want time to negotiate both/any offers and need enough time to allow for that.**

UPDATE: Asked for an extension on Company A offer via email. I am waiting on B, as was the reason for the first extension, seems valid to extend again."

I'm a mechanical engineering student and have received a really great opportunity during the spring semester, but am really on the fence on whether to take it or not.  I'll outline my situation below and appreciate any thoughts from you folks with more career guiding experience!

1). It's in another state and I would have to relocate for the semester.

This is a big deal to me.  I would be away from my friends and girlfriend of 3 years for not only the 4 spring months, but also during the summer (I have accepted a summer internship already).  With this, I will also have to pay double rent because I live in a fraternity house near campus and they won't allow subleases from random other people.  This double rent isn't absurd by any means but it's a bit of a financial downer.  I'm mostly in it for the experience.

2). It is a great experience, but maybe not what I want to do for a living.

I'm looking to go more into something like product development as a career.  This co-op is focused on manufacturing engineering/industrial engineering work.  Now, the job sounds exciting, and a great way to enhance my engineering skills.  I have never worked in this field and may end up completely loving it or hating it. Either way, I think the experience would pay off big time.

3). There are other co-op's that I have yet to hear back from

The are many co-op's that I applied for where I haven't heard back from yet and may be a better fit.  I have had interviews with other companies for more local co-ops and while they are conveniently local, these experiences SEEM like they would be slightly less involving (the companies are lesser known companies) and product they produce is less exciting to me.  There is another job that I feel I have a good shot at in product development, and while that job is also out of the state, it's a bit more up my alley in what I was looking for - I would take it in a heartbeat.  I just don't know if I should take the chance of waiting for this opportunity, however.

4). I would have to go an extra semester.

This isn't that big of a deal to me, but watching my friends graduate before me would be a little sad.


The points of these different factors that affect me the most are actually the fact that I would be away from my friends and girlfriend for so long.  All of my friends and I were really excited to go through our later design classes together and if I took the job I would never get to experience that with them because I would be a semester behind.  My girlfriend has a hard time dealing with distance, but encourages me to take the job if it wish.  

For those with more career experience, are these silly things to worry about when it's literally only a tiny slice of my life?  Do you recommend taking a risk with a job like this now while I'm still young?  What are your thoughts on rejecting the offer I have now for other offers?

My decision for the position on the co-op I've already been accepted into is soon (days) so unfortunately I can't wait and see how the other companies pan out.

TL;DR I have a good co-op opportunity that's out of the state, but would have to leave my friends and long term girlfriend for 9 months.  This job is a completely new experience to me and would be good to have, but I'm very insure on if I would like it or not.  I have other opportunities available to me, but I don't know if it is wise to deny this offer and wait on others.

Thanks for getting through all that, I appreciate any feedback :)."
7bg7p5,1,2017-11-07,Me [21F] and my father [74M]: I'm considering going no contact after abuse issues with my mother [52F]. Am I selfish?,pr92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bg7p5/me_21f_and_my_father_74m_im_considering_going_no/,"Hi, reddit. This is a throwaway account. 

My parents were together for 29 years and my childhood was mainly happy. I had no ill feelings against my father, who worked long shifts most of my childhood before retiring, and I was and continue to be very close with my mother. They started the process of divorce around Thanksgiving of last year. 

Skip to the bolded line if you don't want way too many details.

The divorce feels somewhat like my fault, despite the fact that I know they are adults and it is their decision to separate. See, last summer, when I was getting ready for an internship, my father was researching clothing to buy me for this endeavor. It was outdoors and he loves hunting, has all sorts of credit cards to different outdoor outfitters, and just loves shopping in general. I was always thankful for this--since I was a kid, my dad always got me things for the hiking and camping that I love so much. 

My dad ordered me a pair of shorts that I liked a lot. I wanted to know what the exact specs were, and I had long since cut off the tags and tossed them. I logged onto our family computer (a desktop bought for him/us since our family computer prior had suddenly gotten very slow) and opened up the browser history. I scrolled back a month to find it. Note that we all use the same account on the computer and all have the passcode.

I never found the link to the shorts because what I discovered made me throw up. Tons of links to porn sites like x hamster etc. I have always been uneasy with adult male sexuality (I think I may have been abused sexually as a child, but that's another story), so even just knowing my dad was consuming tons of porn in our family office made me ill. But it wasn't just normal porn. It was beastiality videos. Dogs and horses, with super detailed descriptions. I saw enough to know it wasn't just one or two miss-clicks. There were also links to adult discreet dating sites.

My parents were both, at the time, relatively heavy drinkers. I am a numbers and facts person, and ever since I had learned about what it means to be an alcoholic in high school I had been hyper-aware of their drinking habits. Three or four gin and tonics for my mother, and 5 or 6 whiskey and Sprites for my dad. They poured drinks for me too--orange juice and Sprite, what we dubbed an Orange Jubilee. Every night we imbibed and ate popcorn, all in separate rooms 9 out of 10 times. Some occasions became violent, most were normal nights. Some of the only times I saw them be happy was when he brought her a drink. It was just a normal part of our existence that sometimes they argued vehemently with me, each other, or my brother (28M). Sometimes things would be thrown or violence would happen between my mom/me/my dad. During my teenage years, I never took into account that they were drunk, and really felt this was all normal. The worst account was when my dad attacked my mother, I went to call 911, and he smashed the phone into my ear, resulting in me bleeding and many headaches for days. That was around when I was 16 or 17. 

Things were a bit better for a few years as my mom struggled with severe Crohn's disease. With a misdiagnosis at first, it grew so serious as she dropped to 80 pounds and went into septic shock. She was put into a medical coma and given her last rites. Through the miracle of medicine and some amazing doctors, she fully recovered, and I helped her learn to walk again, adjust to the new diet and lifestyle she had to follow, and even helped with her ostomy bag. 

She later returned to drinking heavily (my dad gave her the drinks). As I got older, I connected the issues with drinking and violence, and I became very passive aggressive to my mother about it (I am not claiming to be a perfect person). She gained way too much weight, gaining 50 or 60 pounds above her set weight.

I word vomited on my mother the day after finding the links. I told her how much I hated their drinking, how unhealthy it was, especially considering her sickness, and just cried and cried. I asked her she was drinking because of my father and said that he was an awful person. She got very defensive, and I felt awful. We had one of our big fights, and she snapped at me and asked what was so bad about my dad. I told her about his web history. She immediately got quiet, went to bed, and I never spoke to her, or anyone other than my boyfriend (23 M) about it ever again.

Things were clearly falling apart, though. My mother became more secretive and distant to me. She would have constant appointments and cancel on plans. She had this weird friend Anna [?F] constantly texting her and hanging out with her. My dad seemed much the same and I just avoided seeing him. Apparently she offered up counseling as a solution, but he refused to even see a counselor. I guess the one time they went he got so emotional and angry that the counselor made him leave.

Eventually, as divorce seemed to be the answer, he became sadder and sadder. He would guilt trip me every time I came over and my mother was at work. Saying he was going to die alone, had lost everyone, talked about my half siblings with drug issues, etc. He was really quite sad and while I felt bad, I didn't appreciate being his counselor and just generally felt less than comfortable around him. I also found out from my mother that he had thousands of dollars in credit card debt that she hadn't known about.

For Thanksgiving 2016, I went to my half sister's (40s F) house a few hundred miles away. My other half sister (40s F) was there as well, along with their husbands (40s MM), my niece (18F) and my boyfriend. It was a great time, although I was quite put off by the fact that no one was bringing up the separation to me. in general, not just that week, no one ever spoke to me about it, asked how I was doing, etc. This is still the same now. My mother was disappointed in me, leaving my father alone on Thanksgiving, but she worked the holiday and I wanted to be in a happier place.

My parents were still living together at Christmas time, and I finished my semester in mid December, and returned home for the holidays. When I asked when we were getting a Christmas tree, my dad freaked out and said we were never going to get one again, we were not celebrating Christmas ever again, and I was stupid to ask. My mom and I went to Home Depot and got an artificial tree, our first one ever. We named him Alex. I begged my parents for a normal Christmas since I was feeling so alone and like a child. They agreed we'd have one last normal Christmas as a family.

Christmas came and it was awful. I still woke up at 6am, the youngest in the house, and usually went to wake everyone up. Instead I laid in bed. My brother didn't get there until 9 am, and we opened presents. My dad went through the motions, but did an awful job of pretending to be happy. He hid his stocking so my mother couldn't give him anything. I received far fewer presents than usual, which my mom warned me of, and all of the ones I did receive were practical. The biggest present I got was an electric toothbrush, since my dentist recommended one. I was very sincerely thankful, but I felt awful about everything, I felt empty. I cried in the bathroom, my mom came in, she asked what was wrong, I said ""I wanted better presents."" Yes, petty, selfish, childish--and my mom still saw the truth that this was the ""last normal Christmas"" for me and still not normal at all. She consoled me and promised she'd make it up to me. The extended family from my father's side still came over from brunch, and my mom left for work.

January came, and I went back to school. One weekday I had off, I went home and my mom wasn't there--another strange appointment. I sat in my bed playing Sims. Headlights beamed into my room--strange, since I live on a dead end. My mom texted me ""Do you want to come with me, your uncle (50s M), and Brie (his girlfiend, 30sF)?"" I said sure, since I was extremely bored. 

It turned out we were touring houses with a realtor, my mom's ""friend"" Anna. I was completely taken aback, despite the fact that...well obviously she had to move out at one point. 

I eventually helped her to find more houses to look into, and we picked her new house together. It also turns out my mom had stopped drinking and was seeing a counselor. She hasn't drank since that conversation with her last fall. My dad became sadder and sadder and I felt more and more guilty. He kept talking about dying alone, and has kept up the drinking.

**SKIP TO HERE**

My mom now has two jobs which she has gotten promotions in, a new house, lost 50 pounds, and is extremely healthy. My dad is miserable still, and tries to use me as leverage. He thinks I have conspired everything with my mother and everyone is abandoning him. Yes, I had been visiting less, but he never had anything to say to me other than increasingly creepy conspiracy theories, sexist remarks, guilt tripping, and hatred toward my mother. I had moved on from the history I found on his computer, mainly pushing it out of my mind, and felt I owed him affection since he is my only father. My mom still goes over to his house occasionally and vacuums, cleans out the fridge, etc. They are mostly on very sterilized speaking terms. My dad still stocks the fridge with orange juice for me, and tonic for her. He leaves popcorn bowls out every night for us. When my mom house and dog sat when he went on vacation, he left her a big pint of an ice cream called ""Bad Breakup"". Hah.

He texted me about a month ago out of nowhere and said ""Hi :) How are you? Oh and TELL YOUR MOTHER THAT IF SHE CONTINUES ON THE PATH SHE IS ON, I WILL NEVER BE IN THE SAME PLACE AS HER."" I texted him back telling him that my mother does not involve me in the divorce, and I'd appreciate it if he didn't either. He said okay.

When I visited my childhood home, where he still lives, about two weeks ago, it was a mess. There were general messes everywhere, he has been stockpiling magazines on guns and hunting (normal to have, but just stockpiling more and leaving them in piles around the house), and worst of all, my cats were nowhere to be seen. He apparently has been locking them in the basement all day, all night. 

My dad adores my dog, a two year old mix we got him for Father's Day 2016. I have been so wary of him having her because of his porn interests, but she is always genuinely happy and seems healthy. But when I went over, she was covered in fleas. My dad was refusing to buy flea meds for my dog and the two cats, and my house was infested. I was bit several times in the few minutes I was over.

My dog has been spending weekends at my mom's, and she has been giving her flea medication. We bathed her on Sunday and she seems free of fleas. My cats, I don't know what to do about, and I don't really even like thinking about it.

I also found a Viagara knock off in our medicine cabinet, front and center. Great. I left my house feeling sick to my stomach once again, and I knew I would visit my childhood home less and less.

My parents had a meeting yesterday at court. I don't know specifics, but apparently my mom's lawyer said something to my dad's lawyer and it set him off. They left and did whatever court thing was happening. When my mom met him in a parking lot to switch the dog to him, he verbally berated her. I don't know what he said, but it was nasty enough that she took the night off of work. My mom warned me that my dad may get meaner and meaner and involve me more.

I just want to be done with him. He gave me a good childhood, and lots of stuff, but I no longer feel love towards him. I feel selfish and at odds with myself, but I just want nothing to do with him. I'm tired.

7bg9dl,47,2017-11-07,How to tease a woman respectfully,Tomato91,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7bg9dl/how_to_tease_a_woman_respectfully/,"When it comes to teasing, too many dating advice gurus and pickup artists will tell you to “neg” her by giving her a backhanded compliment so that you lower her self-esteem until she decides to go out with you.

Ugh! It grinds my gears that this type of advice even exists.

The most important thing to remember when it comes to teasing is to do it respectfully.

Respectful teasing **is**: playfully insulting her without intending to hurt her feelings

Respectful teasing is **not**: insulting her with the intention of actually hurting her feelings

Only jerks tease women by belittling her and trying to undermine her self-confidence. Instead, you want to tease her respectfully. Always be conscious of her feelings. A respectful tease involves saying something slightly edgy or irreverent that will catch her off guard, but without making her feel uncomfortable or offended.

The way I like to think about it is that respectful teasing is similar to the way you might “trash-talk” your friends when you’re being competitive towards them. My friends and I are typically fairly polite when we interact with each other. However, every once in a while we all get together to play *Wii Sports* or *Uno* and when we do—that’s when the kid gloves come off. We’ll freely hurl insults at each other and call each other words that are spelled similar to “pansy” or that mean “homosexual person”.

It’s all in good fun, though. We never intend to actually hurt each other’s feelings. Quite the opposite. We would never behave this way towards someone unless we weren’t friends with them first. By throwing these types of insults at each other, we’re really showing that we’re cool with one another. Thus, by teasing a woman respectfully, you’re playfully signaling to her “Hey, I think you’re a cool person.”

Cool, huh?

Teasing can be separated into “light” teases and “daring” teases. The type of tease that is appropriate depends on several factors. If she has a more conservative attitude, or if she’s just a friend, or if you’re in a place where proper manners are expected then you may only be able to do a “light” tease. On the other hand, if you’re romantically involved with her or you’re in a setting with a lot of alcohol involved such as a bar or club then you may be able to get away with a more “daring” tease.

**How to do a “light” tease**

Once upon a time, I was waiting in line at Starbucks and a woman was coming in behind me to get in line as well. As she gets in behind me, she stumbles over her feet, takes a couple of clumsy steps forward, and almost falls over before finally regaining her balance.

I watch her make a spectacle of herself. She regains her balance and looks at me. I don’t say anything but I give her a confused look like…

o_O

She looks up at me sheepishly and says, “I tripped. It happens.”

I wait a couple of seconds, sigh, and shake my head. Finally, I respond:

“Really? Does it happen to everyone? Or just you?”

Since I didn’t even know her at all and we were in a coffee shop, I used a light tease. I didn’t say anything offensive or sexual, but I still poked fun at the fact that she almost tripped and fell over. Also, what I said was pretty darned clever if I do say so myself!

Recently, I want to a gala with a female friend of mine. She started to drink and asked me to stop her before she drank too much. After a few drinks, she decided that she had enough and I noticed that she had a little trouble keeping her balance throughout the night.

“Are you drunk?” I asked her.

“No, just a little tipsy” she responded. “It’s hard to walk in high heels.”

“I think you’re drunk” I insisted.

We started interacting with another guest at the gala. After breaking the ice with the usual introductions, the three of us got to talking a little bit. Suddenly, I blurted out to the group,

“Please excuse my friend here. She’s a little drunk.”

She turns towards me and replies, “I am not drunk!”

I shake my head while rolling my eyes and let out a slow sigh. Then I respond, “That’s exactly what a drunk person would say.”

The guest we were talking to started laughing and agreed with me. For a moment, I think I was able to convince my female friend that she actually was drunk (even though I knew full well that she wasn’t).

This is an example of a slightly more “daring” tease than the story from the coffee shop. It’s still a “light” tease because it doesn’t involve anything offensive or sexual, but I figured that I could be a little bit more daring because she’s my friend and I knew she wouldn’t hold it against me.

Finally, I was recently the victim of a “light” tease myself. A few days ago, I ran into one of my close female friends near the building that I work in. Later, I heard from my circle of friends that she had been telling everyone I looked “dumb cute” when she saw me. I texted her about it and she replied that I looked ”no cute, only dumb”.

Ouch! Clever girl.

We’re close friends, so she knows that she can get away with insulting me outright and I won’t get upset at her. And honestly, I can’t help but admire how clever her tease was.

**How to do a “daring” tease**

The last few examples were “light” teases, which are appropriate in a variety of social situations. On the other hand, “daring” teases should be used with caution. The only time I’ll use a “daring” tease is if I’m already romantically involved with her or if I know that she’s romantically interested in me. “Daring” teases can sometimes be appropriate in bars or clubs where there’s a lot of drinking involved. Also, if she starts using a “daring” tease on you first then it’s safe to assume that you can use a “daring” tease on her as well without offending her.

A few years ago, I was going out with a woman and we had gone on a few dates before but hadn’t done anything physical up to that point yet. We hadn’t even kissed yet. That Friday night after I get home from work, I take a shower and then I call her up to ask her out on our next date.

She answers her phone, “Hey Steve! What’s up? How are you doing?”

I respond, “Not much. I just got out of my shower.” (Notice that I said I just got out of *my* shower.)

She says, “Oh yeah! Me too.”

Whoops! I knew exactly what she meant, but what she said was something completely different and I wasn’t about to let that go without embarrassing her about it. I replied,

“You just got out of my shower? Were you showering with me? How come I didn’t see you?”

This type of “daring” tease pushes the boundaries sexually. We were romantically involved with each other but we hadn’t done anything physical yet, so when she made her little slip-of-the-tongue I took the opportunity to innocently make the conversation more sexual than anything we had done before.

Several years ago when I was still in college, I was working at my first internship and I had a crush on one of the other interns there. There was always some tension between the two of us and I knew that she liked me too. One day, we were on our lunch break and the two of us head out to a restaurant to get something to eat. We sit across from each other at a table and we ended up talking about tattoos. I ask her if she has any tattoos and she tells me that she has one in the shape of a star.

I pause and think for a second. At this point, I’ve worked with her for almost a year and I’ve never seen this tattoo anywhere before. It’s not on her arms, face, neck, or legs. I realize that her tattoo is probably in a very personal place. Here’s an opportunity for me to do a “daring” tease.

I lean in across the table towards her so that my face is only a few inches away from hers. Looking straight into her eyes, I ask her,

“Where is your tattoo? Can I…see it?”

She suddenly looks sheepish. My instincts were correct. Her tattoo was in a private place on her body, and now I’ve got her thinking about her own sexual areas. The best part was that I’ve maintained plausible deniability. Was I really trying to make the conversation more risqué? Or was I just asking an innocent question?

**Teasing with care**

When it comes to teasing, you always want to do it respectfully. Always be mindful of her feelings when doing a tease. This means taking into consideration: the environment, her attitudes, how close you are to her romantically, etc.

“Light” teases are generally okay to use in a variety of social situations. Keep in mind that “light” teases usually doesn’t imply any romantic or sexual intent. It’s merely a fun way to break the ice. As we’ve seen above, I use “light” teases on my friends all the time and it’s not inappropriate at all.

“Daring” teases push the boundaries more than “light” teases. This type of tease typically implies sexual intent—but not romantic intent. I’m personally not a fan of casual sex and I’d much rather be intimate with someone that I really care about. Thus, I won’t try to do a “daring” tease unless I like her or I’m already romantically involved with her.

Finally, always be your best authentic self when interacting with her. There are a lot of dating gurus who will tell you that you absolutely, positively need to tease her when you talk to her or else she will see you as a friend and nothing more. Really, though, it’s not the end-all-be-all that they make it out to be.

Don’t tease her in a way that makes you feel sleazy or uncomfortable. The most important thing to remember is that she should be comfortable with the way you tease her and that you should also be comfortable with the way you tease her.

That’s how you tease a woman respectfully.

Instead, I’ve only had offers and interviews from HVAC and Manufacturing industries. When I’ve talked to the companies that deal with my interests they ignore me and go with Electrical Engineers instead.

7bgk70,35,2017-11-07,[Discussion] Arrow's fail at skill progression on its characters,ForeverInADay,arrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/7bgk70/discussion_arrows_fail_at_skill_progression_on/,"Isn't weird that almost every character feels like it has had a very inconsistent skill progression level?. The thought came to me from Laurel and Felicity, but it pretty much applies to every character in some way, even Oliver. Some criticism, with some ideas of how things could have gone differently, for fun I guess.

**Oliver**: Not so much in present day -where the problem is the inconsistency of his skill level- but on the flashbacks, where his learning curve in seasons 3 to 4 goes way off the rails. We still don't know where/how he learned all he knows? I feel season 5 gets there, but it's way too late in a way, like the previus 4 years it was him just running around surviving, and only was the last one he actually got most of his training, which makes all his tenure as a vigilante suspect.

*How it could have been done better* It would have been far more interesting if each season Oliver had a new teacher on his flashbacks. First season was Yao Fei, Second Slade and Shado. Third season should have been actually centered at Waller purposefully training Oliver to be her agent (for whatever reason) with the Yamashiros, with the fourth season giving him practice and well, an ""internship"" on his time undercover. Each season a small but pointed increment, of how all these people served as Oliver's teachers, even the evil ones.

**Felicity**: I think she might be the most egregious example, not because it is a failure of the narrative to potray her progression in a beliebable manner, but because her ridiculous skill level (she's going toe to toe with the best hacker in the world basically) was retconned out of nowhere. She was an IT girl, a very smart one, but instead of actually getting to see the progression of her skill, it was all just retconned in a flashback. For all the deserved shit season 4 Felicity gets, it's the 3rd season the worst for her character. She gets stuck as the love interest, given a temporary love interest with Ray, a bunch of access and influence just thrown her way through him. Everything about season 3 about her feels unearned, and not because the writing failed at the progression, but because it never even attempted it and just wrote everything into her.

(Sidenote: I really disliked the ""sexy office girl"" aesthetic that solidified for her that season, and it still linked to characterization that feels out of nowhere. Why does Felicity is always dressed as if she's gonna go for drinks? It's just an aesthetic choice that feels rooted in so little, but this is an Arrow problem overall; the costume design for characters is shite, specially for the women. It does little to inform the character and it feels more like a fashion catalogue.

*How it could have been done better* Make the flashback about the potential she had and she squandered on her aimless rebellion. Have her reunion with her ex being a wake up call to make her think about what she wants to be and what she has to give to the team. There's always compromises to be done for the mission, and team Arrow is bankrupt. She she takes ray's offer not to work for him *per se* but to help him investigate at the corruption on his own company, being paid handsomely for her hacking skills. Have her struggle with the fact that Ray only hired her because she's good enough, but not good enough to be known as more than Oliver Queen's secretary. Instead of a pointless romance with Ray, actually giving her a plot of upping her game learning, reaching her potential (also adding some infiltration to her arsenal. make her good at sneaking into places) make her bold and confident and ditch the costume, reconciling her Rebellious persona with her current one, and showcasing that through the costuming. So no tight dresses and high heels, practical stuff instead! Stuff that a woman that works in a desk for most of the day would feel confortable in. 

**Laurel** Her season 3 arc was not well handled, because yeah, no matter how much we think around it, the idea of someone who 6 months ago got beaten by basically a mugger ending up fighting training assassins is sketchy at best; SPECIALLY when you don't make a point to actually showcase how rigorous a training regimen of that magnitude would be. (seriously even one episode of a B plot could had been given to Nyssa training Laurel, with no holding back) And the worst thing it wasn't even necessary because in season one we already had Laurel with self defense training kicking mooks and being badass with a shotgun. At least motivation wise this season laurel was consistent, if perhaps questionable with her decision to hide Sara's death from Quentin, but at least that was framed as a questionable choice that caused a rift between them. Still, Laurel's skill level required a lot of suspension of disbelief.

*How it could have been done better* Personally I liked Laurel's season 2 arc, yet even I admit that it serves little purpose on the narrative whole. Let's keep the thematic depth though, which is all about grief, anger and self-destruction. This is a superhero show, this is the part you don't have to be subtle. Add fighting to the booze and pills (start the season pointing out she has been really hitting the self defense class), make her seek the danger (that's like the number one Laurel trait) make her go to bars like Quentin. A scene of her getting apparently fucked up in a bar and a guy attempting to take advantage of her on an alley. Maybe even have Sara looking from afar, ready to save her, but reveal that this is all Laurel's plan to get in a fight and just *hurt* someone else, someone that deserves it. Maybe even have her face the Canary for some reason (perhaps Sara tries to intervene, because what Laurel has been doing is dangerous as fuck) and Laurel lashing out against her. Obviously Sara wins and subdues her, but we get to see the total recklessness that Laurel has, how her anger fuels her and how she even gets one or two good shots against Sara, which surprises her, and makes her feel proud. After Laurel get's her shit together, we know she still is going to self defense classes, because even if she can manage her addictions, she still has to deal with her anger. That's what defines Laurel, her anger.

Season 3 would stay pretty much the same, but we already hale Laurel's skill level way higher. Sara's death is more involved though; after they meet in the roof, Sara senses there is danger. Laurel asks if she thinks it's the league, but Sara says no. It appear just to be some random mooks/goons, and Sara asks Laurel if she wants to help. We actually get a scene of the sisters fighting side to side. When it all seems to be a fun romp, an archer appears (we just see the bow being raised) and Sara's faint recognition. She get's shot just as Laurel finishes the last mook, just to discover Sara bleeding to death. She attempts to say ""Thea"" but it is unintelligibly with the blood pouring from her mouth. The next episode starts with Laurel crying as she holds Sara, the mooks coming back to consciousness and attempting to flee. Then Laurel turns her head, hate in her eyes. Once Oliver arrives to the scene, one mook is unconscious and tied up again, and another is dead (he wasn't before) back on the arrow cave, as Felicity and Diggle prepare the body, Oliver and Laurel interrogate the mook. Laurel urges Oliver to do ""what he has to do"" to get any info, and Oliver obliges, but the mook doesn't know anything, except they given a tip that the Canary was back in starling (they were some goons with a grudge against Sara for a season 2 beating) Oliver steps out, and when he gets back, the mook is dead. Laurel says nothing, and just walks away. Through this Laurel takes up training with Wildcat, and it is hardcore. Her epsiode when she gets beat up is different; mostly the same stuff, but there's also a connection with the gang that jumped her and Sara. She tracks the abusive boyfriend one, but he is with a friend, and Laurel fights the both of them and loses, and the friend recognizes her from that night. After Laurel heals enough, she goes after the second guy, and manages to get a bit more of information. The whole point is that Laurel eventually learns that Malcolm is behind this, even though she doesn't know he sent Thea for the deed itself.

But yeah, the whole thing is about Laurel struggling to keep her anger in check, to do something about it. She's brutal, she doesn't quit, and she doesn't care about killing people. It's only when she decides to continue Sara's legacy in Oliver's absence (after she realizes she can't get her revenge on Thea) is when she finds a bit of meaning, turning that anger into righteousness.

**Thea** This is a tricky one, because even if it was a cheap way to make it work, it worked. Her training happening entirely offscreen is kind of a cop out, but hey, it DOES work. Sadly, Thea is one of the best examples, and only because they didn't even attempted a progression.

*How it could have been done better* Honestly this could have been a twist into itself really. We don't know Thea has training until close to the reveal she killed Sara, but there are some hints she is not as defenseless as she was. We get her full training montage as a flashback, but things remain pretty much the same.

**The Recruits** They kinda work? the whole point is that they are being trained. Although with Dinah eventually they end with the same problem of having her come with a pre-baked set of skills, but this late in the game is more forgivable.

**Roy** Sweet baby boy Roy. Who get shoot up in Mirakuru. Honestly I think he just works, he had some mad parkour skills, he wanted to join the hood, he trained under him, in the field, then the whole mirakuru thing, then back in the field. It was not perfect, but overall his was the best character skill progression.

**Mr. Terrific** He's like the opposite, but not in a bad way; he kinda just sucks at hand to hand combat, and he has finally realized that he's the gadget guy. "

7bgzdi,1,2017-11-07,"Me [22 M] doubting if I should pursue my girlfriend [23 F] , after a 6 months relationship, 1 year NC, recently back together and apart",kulaliu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bgzdi/me_22_m_doubting_if_i_should_pursue_my_girlfriend/,"Last year, I (22 M), met a girl from my study and hooked up. After a month we wanted a relationship and fell rapidly in fiery love. I told her I never had proper relationship before and that I just want to purely love someone, no games no nothing just love.
Summer holiday came and she came for 2 weeks to my country and spend all summer till end of October in the relationship. By then I could see she was taking a liking to her room mate(M), who she started sleeping from November till mid December, when she left. I just got a - its not you its me - speech. But the love was real. She was my first and my heart was in pieces.

The new year came and she left to her country and then for exchange in South East Asia, where she met a guy(M) who she spend the entire 6 months with. Needless to say they had an amazing time in an amazing country. 

She came back from exchange, where her room mate was waiting. She did come back and started sleeping with her room mate, not for long tho because her friend from exchange came to visit for 4 days. Her room mate felt betrayed they had arguments and spoke it trough since they had to live together. This is all I could put together, I do not know the details, but I know they stopped sleeping together after. 

In September, after 1 year NC( half of which I was energy less), she came at my place and we told stories and cuddled, one week later we hooked up after a party. All the feelings came back but she was constantly telling me about her exchange friend which was a turn down. We never talked what we were doing, relationship? Friends with benefits? After a month of sleeping at each other places every night, study week(free week) comes and she tells me that she is going to her home country and then to the her friend to visit him. We spoke mid way trough the week and that was it. She texted me once at the end of the week and took two days to answer back because she stayed longer and missed school for 2 days. I do not get any message so i text her after a week on a friday asking her to come over but she refused and I requested to meet just to hang out for a bit during the weekend, not sleep over. She accepted saying it would be nice. We never got to and tuesday i randomly met her at university where she told me booked a flight ticket to go see him again at the end of the week. I asked again for a meeting in private and she said yes. Wednesday night i text her, because thrusday morning she was leaving. I basically implied that I want to split and after an argument over whats app she came to my place after work. She argues that the feelings she expresses are in the moment and proceeded to tell me she shared her love for the people she felt, something like that. Basically it boiled down to: ME: you are not attracted anymore to me now lets just break up. Her: I love you just not know.We randomly met again at university, yesterday and had a short normal boring conversation and a hug. On Instagram she posts about him and is clearly in love. 

I know the feelings for me are there too but after a month of being together again , every night, she just goes away.
To be clear, I am not mad at her for having loved her guy, I am mad at her for just leaving and not texting anymore without saying anything and leaving me behind.

I love her but this drains the life out of me, I do not know what to do, I would like to end it, to know not to want anything more from her, or just wait for her to come back. When I met her she told me she is going to text me to go with a viewing party to a movie but she probably will not. This weekend I will text her to come over and we will talked about it, if she refuses I will text her good luck and not text again.  

In January she has internship and will leave, she does not know where and there might be a chance she will stay here.
 In summer she comes back and theoretically she finished university. I would wish for a couple weeks of being with her before I will probably never see her again. I do not really know what to do.. 

Do I just ask her to come over and ""break up"" for good or talk more about it? or wait till she texts me? or just ignore for good?

If you have any advice or suggestion please let me know. I hope you enjoyed my story. Thank You!!

This is my first reddit post so I apologize in advance if I broke any rule or anything of such sort.

I'm a junior in a CS-Related undergrad program, and I work as a web developer on my campus part time. I've been there long enough and was doing enough public-facing front end work that it landed me a couple new part time/full time if I want. 

Basically went out for beers one night and had an interview the next week, super low key, friend of a friends startup. For now I go into an office but in the future I'll be able  to work fully remote. The second gig is through a family friends-brother in law in finance and is working fully remote for a cryptocurrency startup. 

Problem is, I'm 25 and school's paid for (100% tuition, most my housing) by grants, so I'm not desperate for cash. The other problem is even 10 hours a week at each job is 20 hours a week and I'm taking 15 credit hours already and I'm really falling behind in my courses since I said ok to the new gigs. 

The reason I'm in school is to land a decent paying job, but I don't want to sell myself short. In my head all I was thinking was I wanted to start applying for summer internships but when they offered the flexibility of working remote along with double my current pay it was hard to say no. 

But now I'm working one of the two new jobs while finishing a project at the old job before I'm done there, and those hours are taking up when I would normally be doing homework. I'm still holding down an A and A- in my other classes but I'm getting a D in a required math course. 

Once I'm done with my old job im sure the load of the in person work will be fine with courses but I'm worried about having time for the cryptocurrency startup. In an ideal world though I'd almost prefer to not work at all right now so I can do my best in class. How do I go about cutting out some commitments without burning bridges here?

And even then, it just helps to write this down, so thanks for bearing with me.

----------

For your sake reader, I will try and make this quick. I met her in my senior year of college, we were both in the marching band together, and I fell head over heels for this woman. We connected on a lot and she just caught me at the right time. A little background, she grew up religious as Mormon, however she didn't necessarily follow her religion strictly, it was more of a family thing she was a part of.



As a side note, she was not a fan of any substances, even caffeine. And while I did enjoy beer and smoking weed, I never really took it too far, not a big partier, and I kept my limits in check. I never minded her not doing those things, never forced her. But she couldn't stand it, and while she didn't say anything, I could tell anytime I drank or smoked with my friends, I could tell she was silently judging me.



Her situation when we met was she had family who lived in the college town where we both went, and she was living with them understandably to avoid the high cost of student and regular housing until she finished college. She had done so all through college, so her mother and step-dad were pretty close to her at all times.



I confessed my love to her four months into our relationship. She agreed, and needless to say, I was ecstatic, my relationships in the past had never felt so intimate or deep, it was incredibly refreshing. She stayed over every night instead of her parents and we ended up getting closer and closer until I graduated after an extra fall semester. It was at this point that things started getting a little difficult.



It was a little over a year of us dating, I had just graduated in December of 2015. I worked two restaurant jobs right out the gate until I found an job that was better, wanting to remain independent.  I found a basic office job after about four months, and it was right around April of 16 that this girl's parents, who I will just point out never really liked me that much, never knew why, indicated that they were interested in moving to North Carolina in order for the step-father to pursue his dream job. 



However, the girl I was with still had another year and a half of college left. Obviously, she was counting on living with her parents rent free to avoid living expenses, but she was very close to her family, much more than me, so she was willing to make the sacrifice. That being said, she obviously didn't have a place to live, and with us being so intimately and romantically close, I stepped up, wanting to help the woman I loved however I could.



The lease on the place I was living in with two other friends was to run through to about August 2016. She moved in in April of 2016, after I helped her parent's move out, I was excited to take this plunge, even if I was a little nervous, I trusted her. I paid for all the rent and utilities while she stayed with me for 4 months so she could get on her feet. She never offered to help pay for it, but I knew her income was limited since she was a student barely working part-time, I just wanted to help her, so I said nothing of it and did everything I could to make her feel at home as the closest family she had near her had moved halfway across the country. Not to mention the rest of her family lived out in Georgia.



During this period of time, we looked for another place together. She felt bad, saying that she didn't want me to stick around for her as I was ready to move on from my college town. However, I was committed to her (probably more than I should have been) and I didn't hesitate to find a cheap place she and I could move in together for. She had paid for all of college on her own through working and scholarships, so her goal was to graduate debt free (which she did), and I was more than happy to find the cheapest possible place that was local so she could finish her last year of college worry free. We eventually settled on a super cheap place near campus with two other roommates.



Not even two months into us moving into our first place together, she dropped a bomb that she wanted to take a break. Obviously I was devastated, especially when I found out later from her that her mother encouraged the decision, but we eventually made up and kept pushing forward. Despite us getting over this hiccup, that was the first red flag I should have noticed.



We kept moving forward, with good moments still in our relationship. Her senior year was incredibly busy.... she had two part time jobs, an internship, and a full course load, so time for us together was relatively limited. She withdrew physically and emotionally, and the first time I brought it up to her and that I was concerned, not only for her but that my needs weren't really being fulfilled. She cried once I told her how I was feeling and it was dropped. We never really could have normal conversations when it came to what I wanted from her.... but like I said I was a fool in love, ugh.



As some of you know, post-grad life is incredibly stressful and difficult, so obviously my mental health, which I already struggle with anxiety and depression, was waning from the strains of day to day work life that I was still adjusting to. I really needed some support, however as I said she was so busy, and the last conversation we had like that was ugly...so I just did what I could to make sure her needs were being met. I'd cook her meals before she got home, clean her dishes, take her out, and I ALWAYS made time for her. I wanted her to feel loved and safe. However, it didn't seem to do anything at all.



It got to a point though where with how busy she was, she kept drifting further and further away. She would get aggravated with me for the most remedial things, and whenever I asked for physical intimacy or to do something with her, she would always make excuses with me. The best example I can think of to exemplify her apathy to our relationship near the beginning of 2017 was that she wouldn't even come hang out with me and my best friends (with whom I am closer to than my family) on my birthday weekend in February. They had all planned a surprise party for me too.... and even though I eventually convinced her to go, she ended spending most of the time on her own in our room we were staying in for the night not really wanting to be around me or my friends.



Eventually, she graduated, I was so proud, however, my mental health and self-care was at an all time low.... my depression was, and still is a major struggle in my life, but I was excited to be able to spend more time with her, she really was the best thing I had going for me it felt like. We got dinner with all of her family, and everyone, especially her mother and step-dad, were treating me very strangely. I wouldn't go as far to say disrespectful, but I definitely felt like they didn't want me there, especially with their dismissive comments. I let it go though, and just focused on her.



We started looking for new places now that we had both graduated, and honestly, I was really excited. I felt that now that she was done with school, even though she was planning on grad school, we could finally have more time for each other. Things were really.....tense at this point, roughly June 2017. The estrangement from her didn't get much better, and whenever we looked for places we ended up arguing or she would just shut down due to stress.



Anyway, I was set on living with her, and after months and months of taking care of her, I was ready to really get to be with her. Then, she told me she didn't want to live with me anymore and still wanted to be together. At first I told her that wouldn't work.... then I came back and was willing to try. However at that point it felt like I was literally sharing a bed with a stranger, and after a lot of incitement from friends and family, I called her and told her I was done in July 2017. ""Oh, ok. I have to go now."" she said as she hung up.



Since I was counting on living with her, I didn't have my shitty bed anymore, excess furniture I thought I wouldn't need, I even found my dog a new (granted better) home because she was allergic. I only had a month to find a place to live, and afford it too (I had to take out a loan to afford all this), but I managed to find a place, even though she had already planned out everything. Hindsight is always 20/20, but I was blind anyway so fuck it.



We spent the last month in the old house we shared together since I had nowhere else to go, and for anyone who has experienced sharing a space with an ex, I really fucking feel for you, it's terrible. She moved out on her own, even got herself a car from her family friends in our college town, and I never saw her again. I didn't cry until the day she moved all her shit out, and that was horrible, I got so drunk... regrettably, and drank heavily for at least a week after... 



I was so confused, originally feeling okay since I cut it off, but something didn't seem right to me. Her neglecting me and putting me in a position like she did really didn't seem to be a hard decision for her. She knew all I needed to find a new place for myself on such short notice, and yet she did it anyway. I brooded on this for a while, and while I was doing okay for the first month on my own in August, she still plagued my thoughts. I texted her occasionally, asking the how's and why's of all of the shit that happened before I pulled the plug. It felt fair considering how out of the blue her request to live apart from me was, especially after all I did to make sure she felt at home. 



I never really got an answer that made sense to me. It always came down to us being ""too different"", and that was the most I really heard of it in the entire time of us dating. I tried to let it go, but it was too hard to see her face still.... so I blocked her on Facebook, then she message me asking why, and I explained in the most honest detail in the entirety of our relationship all I did for her and how I felt betrayed with how she could so easily walk away from our relationship and all I had sacrificed for her. And at this point I was PISSED because I realized how shitty she was to me near the end, so I just needed sometime, and told her I would talk to her when she was ready.



""I understand and realize it's not fair for me to want to talk to you. I only wish you the best."" Paraphrasing, but essentially what she texted back to me. And then we didn't talk for another month.



My depression has been really bad since mid September, and I wanted to talk to her about it since I knew she understood and cared in the past. I had previously confided greatly in her about my depression, including the suicidal thoughts I had, and she always seemed like she understood. But when I told her how all of this was making me feel super depressed, and I definitely lost my sanity a bit here, but I was so keen on dying, and I told her that. She then listed my number to the suicide hotline who called me the next day, but she never responded. I told her I wanted to talk to her because she was part of the reason I was feeling this way, but got no response, only the same response as last time.



Finally, in a drunken stupor I texted her, asking similar questions, just missing her wanting to talk to her, as being ignored fucking sucks, and I let my anger get the best of me. I dropped a few bitches and fuck yous, and obviously that wasn't right, but I was hurt, and I never felt like she really heard what I was saying. After enough badgering, her stepfather emailed me back threatening to file a restraining order and to have his cop buddy in the college town I am still stuck in hunt me down. I stopped talking to her after that until I sent her a long apology for what I said this past weekend. 



I feel like a fucking psycho after hassling her for an answer on this to the point of restraining order threats, but realized that I didn't even know where she lived, what car she drove, and I never threatened her well being or life directly nor intentionally.  So those claims were baseless, but still, very hurtful from someone I almost spent three years with....



And now, I am sitting here at my computer typing this sob story and trying to piece together how and why she could just walk away the way she did. I don't know if I will ever get an answer, she doesn't even talk to me anymore. I deleted her number, but I just want to talk with someone I thought I knew so closely....it's agonizing that they can walk away so easily, or at the very least with saying so little. I loved her more than anyone else in my entire life, and I mean that wholeheartedly.



Needless to say, the timing of her graduating and then breaking up with me after all I did for her to help her push through makes me feel used, and while I feel like I have a right to be mad, I still want some outside perspective. Did I fuck up? How did I not see this coming? How do I move on from this? What can I learn? I just want to know what I did wrong, what do you guys think? I am sorry for the whining, this shit is literally eating me alive. Going back to therapy... new track of anti-depressants soon. 



PS: Can confirm her parent's hated me, might be paranoid, but I feel like they definitely egged her on to do this considering the last break up scare... idk.



If you read all of this, holy shit you're kick ass, thank you for reading it, and any advice about the above questions would helpful.



And yeah this is not the best post, so sorry for that too, much love &lt;3

tl;dr:



Support college girlfriend through her remaining years of school after I graduate by letting her live with me for free and making a lot of sacrifices from my life for her. She tells me a month and a half before we move in that she didn't want to live together anymore right after she graduates. Now that I broke up with her and told her why I was mad she threatened a restraining order on me and won't even acknowledge my existence :) Primarily, what went wrong? What did I do wrong? Should I blame myself for this? How the hell do I leave that behind?  And how should I feel about someone like that? Am I missing something here?


Also that is a really shitty tl;dr, but I have trouble surmising this to just a sentence."

I'm hoping to get into computer engineering co-op in 2nd year. Anyway I was wondering if the job prospects for engineers are really as bad as people make it out to be. Do most people struggle with finding jobs? Like I'd love to do internships at big companies like Google but it seems like those jobs only go to Waterloo/UofT students. I was wondering if anyone in the program could give some insight to the quality of the co-op program and full time job prospects. Is it rare for UofA engineers to land internships/full time positions at these large companies?

And yes I realize that side projects are important and the jobs won't be handed to you."

I am in a very unique situation with no one to turn to for advice so here I am.

Having just graduated from a top private US college with a degree in Economics, I am currently studying a masters in data science in a European university with a strong Econ and data science program. I had very little background in coding before the program started in September but I am working on strengthening them right now. The program has a strong theoretical focus but at the same time we are learning and using R, Python, SQL, Hadoop and some other data science-related software. I am a fast learner when it comes to quantitative subjects so I am doing pretty well so far. Together with the masters thesis and industrial practicum I have to complete next semester, I am confident that I will have the necessary skills to apply for and obtain junior/entry-level data scientist roles. 

The catch is that I am on a government scholarship which requires me to return to my country after one year of work overseas. This scholarship is also the reason why I am pursuing my masters in Europe instead of the US (sponsorship for a masters is only available if you pursue it on a different continent to your undergrad). This is a major issue because I need to find a job/internship by the end of February (another stipulation for being allowed to work overseas for a year). This is a huge problem because at this point in time, I don't have any work experience or possess any past projects or experience in computer science. Despite a 4.0 GPA in college, I've been told by recruiters of a few big companies I've had a referral to that I lack the requisite experience and qualifications to interview for a job in data science. Being in Europe might also be a factor as I am not a US citizen although US work permits are significantly easier to obtain  for nationals from my country compared to others. I have a friend from the same major and same year in college who is currently pursuing his masters in data science at the same college who's already had an interview with Palantir while my online application was rejected within a day because ""do not have a position which currently matches (my) background and experience at this time"".

Despite my interest in quantitative subjects in school, I'd never actually done an internship or projects related to data science or computer science. I've also never recruited because I was guaranteed a job from my scholarship. As such I'm completely clueless as to what I should do it at this point in time. One option, could possibly work out, is to stall for time so that I can apply for internships and jobs in summer next year although I would not bet on it. Assuming that that is not an option, what would be your job-seeking advice to me? What kind of company would be interested in hiring me as an intern/full-time worker? Any general comments are also welcome!"

7bjdf6,33,2017-11-08,Advice for non-seniors - academic and otherwise.,KappaNabla,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7bjdf6/advice_for_nonseniors_academic_and_otherwise/,"As a senior this year, I finally ended up caving to my misgivings/insecurities and made a reddit account to browse A2C and chanceme. Overall, I think I made excellent use of my time in high school insofar as academics, but the pressure/toxicity of this time gets to everyone. I've seen a lot of people on this reddit asking what they can do to make the most of their time in HS (improving ECs/resume mostly), so I thought I'd try posting some of my own thoughts.

1. Have as much fun as you can junior year (especially during summer...). If you're taking the standard ""rigorous"" senior schedule of 4-6 APs, first semester will be the most bullshit, busywork filled, toxic time of your life. This is coming from someone who normally can't wait to go to school in the morning. 
2. For the scientifically inclined - the olympiads (bio, chem, physics, math) are a fantastic way to add some awards to your resume that many people don't take advantage of. The truth is that most people focus heavily on ECs instead of awards. That's why you see lots of people listing ""national merit, ap scholar, csf, etc."" on their resumes when obviously none of those mean much. As a general rule of thumb, if an admissions committee can infer an award based on other parts of your app, it's meaningless. If you did well in your AP Bio/Chem class, it's definitely worth it to put in the &lt;50 hours you'll need to get semifinalist status. I'd also encourage everyone to sign up for the AMC (math) - while you will probably not make USAMO by starting to study in sophomore year, making AIME is within reach for almost anyone given sufficient prep. One of the most efficient time investments you can make in high school if STEM is your thing.
3. Drop everything that you can't commit to 100%. Don't waste your time. 
4. Starting a club is great, but to be entirely honest, it means literally nothing unless you can demonstrate that it wasn't done for the sole purpose of signaling to colleges that you possess ""initiative"" or ""leadership"" (the club has a measurable impact, isn't just you and five friends, makes sense in the context of your applicant profile/narrative). I see a lot of people wasting time starting a club (sometimes even 2 to 3!) so they can put ""founder"" on their application. 
4. Sleep more. Everything will improve as a result.
5. If you're feeling dismayed about a lack of local opportunity, create your own opportunity. And go hard. Commit. Trying to be one of thousands of teens that start a ""nonprofit""? If you really want to impress, file with the IRS to become a 501(c)(3). The process, while tenuous, can 100% be done by a motivated teen with a parent to sign onto certain legal stuff. And once you have that 501(c)(3) status, start soliciting corporate sponsorships. Demonstrate impact. Source: people at my school, including myself, have done this.
7. If you're doing research, take the time to submit to science fairs. Even if you don't win, you'll probably learn a lot of valuable presentation skills. And if you do win big, so will your college apps. Another very time-efficient investment for the STEM applicant. If you've poured in 100+ hours into an internship, why not put in 20 more for the chance to hook your app?
8. Look out for your friends. Having someone close to you who you can confide in and trust during the application process is invaluable. 
9. Ask him/her out. Go to homecoming, especially if you haven't done so already. Stay off reddit once in a while.
10. Read. Reading is the best hobby in the world. A genuinely well-read high school student is rare, and stands out.

I might add more as I think of stuff, but hopefully that helped a bit. For the seniors reading this post, best of luck - we all need it :)."

7bjoqc,4,2017-11-08,Time to Quit?,Kdoterin,starbucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/7bjoqc/time_to_quit/,"Been with sbux for nearly three years and just had terrible luck getting promoted. I did really well in my original store but the week my SM asked me if I was interested in being a shift, our store got closed down. 
Moved to a large high volume cafe and had my whole world changed. But eventually I was able to get noticed  by volunteering to help and learn more, and tried to take on extra responsibility but my cafe had old partners who had been around for years and overzealous partners around my age who were ready to sabotage me (blatantly do things I was assigned to do like new boards and A frames and the green apron board). But I was sure eventually we’d have some shifts quit or move on and being the oldest partner and most reliable. I thought I had a chance. I never call out, am always calm, got regular compliments on my customer service and how I go above and beyond. Won POQ every year and was deadest on being at Sbux for the next 4-6 years while getting my degrees. I pick up everyone’s shift when there too drunk to give a damn, Ive done what’s asked of me beyond my job description, constantly am trying to improve store morale and no ones said a bad word about me to me as far as I can tell. I had glowing reccomendations from all my SMs except one who liked to make black woman jokes at my expense (harassment but whatever). My DMs were always impressed with my drink quality and my ability to stay calm on bar. 


Until shit hit the fan with my ex and I relocated to SoCal where everyone’s an ass, every store is over staffed so no one gets more than 20 hours, the minimum wage isn’t livable, my raises weren’t transferred, my store and others around me are always between managers/DMs,  and I can’t fucking deal with it. 

Im likeable and my standing SM is really down to earth and really seemed like she was going to help me out. Then we got a new ASM who’s taking over, and I think my new ASM likes me but I’m only part time while I’m doing an internship and in that time, she’s already trying to promote the other baristas who work as often as I did. 

Funny thing is they all sucked and they learned a lot from me because we worked together often before I was so part time and they’re all 231s or something’s, about eighteen and have shitty attitudes about customers in general lol. I also object to my ASM and shifts having these barista do shift work like counts pulls and orders without proper credit and no promise of promotion, especially when we have ppl who just started as shifts transferring to our store. I did that too at my first store thinking to help but I think it’s just fucking wrong and exploitative. 

I tried being proactive about doing a PDP, making sure my performance at work is constantly improving, asking for feedback (getting none) and trying to make this little kiosk mostly functional.  My ASM said she can’t have new shifts start during holiday but we just had three shifts quit and then got two from others stores transferred who just started and are barely out of high school and had to ask me about doing their job cause they weren’t fully trained. I’m not even a barista trainer and the one we got is trash and better baristas are constantly retraining the green beans. No one knows any expiration date, I always catch them putting shots in chai tea and green tea lattes and shit like that, it’s insane. 

I’m nearly 27 with no managerial cash handling experience outside of sbux and being a cashier before hand but I have three years of a degree, and two and half years of volunteer management positions for non profits.  I’m starting school next semester to finish my bachelors for public relations and marketing with hopes of moving up to corporate at Starbucks or working with event venues, and one day eventually starting my own coffee shop + used book store. I love coffee and have been trying to be a coffee master for years. I also like baking and books and it’s a dying business but with the right niche it could be profitable for a while. 

But I just feel like my times being wasted honestly. It feels like this store has filled all the slots of where I wanted to help our store grow with really mediocre ppl and my enthusiasm is met with disregard or “oh we got it, no need to worry” mostly. I feel like my age is holding me back now, like people see my resume and assume I must be broken or something since I haven’t got promoted yet and I keep moving due to family or relationship stuff. 

I can’t tell if I’m terrible and I’m blind as fuck to it or if I keep running into racists, assholes and people who already know who they’re promoting??? 

I know the way sbux is ran here versus the community feel of the Midwest where I came from is turning me off super fast even though I love the brand. I also have a crew who are all under 20 and just don’t have any life experience so it’s hard to bond and be friends. They’re all in extended adolescence and I don’t blame them for it but at the same time. They don’t know how to talk to people and don’t ever give anyone the benefit of the doubt and don’t care about keeping customers happy. Theyre good ppl but inexperienced and mostly mediocre. 

Either way I can’t live off less than 11 bucks an hour and I’ve been looking for new coffee jobs that pay more and a big girl job too maybe. I’m nervous finding local things because the hipsterdom is real and Starbucks is the least hipster you can get when it comes to coffee lol

I just don’t know if I should transfer to a smaller cafe store that feels more like home than a fucking Coffee McDonald’s, or if I should just stick around and have four bossy ass kids as my shifts and hope one of them can’t take the heat and gtfo or step down. I’m not a mean aggressive person who has the balls to undermine others or step on other ppl to make two more dollars per hour for a lot of work and being a scape goat to the higher ups. 

But kk I’m done  ranting but I’m wondering if anyone else is stuck as a barista and tired of working real hard just to get regularly  benignly overlooked because you don’t know someone or you don’t have a loud ass bitchy personality which is what a lot of people see as good management characteristics.

Honestly I typed all this and I’ve more or less made up my mind to quit after holidays, so my ASM doesn’t black list me for leaving her during Xmas lol

&amp;nbsp;  
**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
Anna appeared on the show as a plus-sized model on America’s Next Top Model, Cycle 2, and was one of the 12 girls chosen to compete in the finals. During her brief stay in the show, her fellow Top Model finalist, Xiomara Frans, gave Anna the pet name “Momma” because of her maternal nature toward the girls. Anna was the first to be eliminated from the show after she refused to do the first photo shoot with Nigel Barker. The challenge was to pose as “Eve,” therefore requiring the girls to strip down. The girls would be posing alongside a male model (who is supposed to play “Adam”), whom would be naked as well. Even though each girl would be painted from head to toe, Anna felt that only her husband has the right to see her with no clothes, thus, she refused to do the nude photo shoot.
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
After Cycle 2, Anna has done print work for Erin London, Forshe Boutique, Robin Callender, Anthony R. Lloyd, The Cotrice Collection, Lila couture bridal gowns, La Bella Vie Boutique, Nicci Hou Afrique Collection, Ruffs &amp; Cuffs, Belk, Salon Next, Bernhardt Huntington Collection Catalogue, Aveva Activewear, and has been featured on MyLittleSecretsOnline.com.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
She has appeared in spreads for in the Spring 2011 issue of Hopelessly Romantic Magazine, Runway Magazine, the Oct/Nov 2011 issue of Oz Magazine, the March 2012 issue of Jezebel Magazine, and has appeared in ads for Fevour cosmetics, Goldilox Hair House, Bashinski Fine Gems &amp; Jewelry, Cadieux Interiors: The Salon Collection, and Body Design Personal Training. 

&amp;nbsp;  
She is currently raising 2 boys. Aside from modeling, she is currently practicing as a registered dental hygienist. She was allegedly also featured in a few Tyler Perry films, but I’ve yet to come across any proof of these.

&amp;nbsp;  
**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
On Cycle 2, she was the most well-endowed model out of the ten girls, but her heavy chest was not the reason why Bethany was the second to go home from the show. Her photos were strong, but her performance in front of the camera didn’t impress the judges as the competition progressed. The judges felt that Bethany lacked the versatility that all models need in order to succeed in the fashion industry. Furthermore, she was criticized for not being able to look ‘high fashion’ enough in her photos.  
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
After the show, Bethany has remained relatively mum. She was featured in Totally Texas Calendar, but that seems to be the end of her modeling career. Her facebook says that she was the former Event Director the Good Company Armadillo Palace in Houston, Texas from 2007 until 2016. The ANTM Cycle 2 wikipedia states that she was married, however, I believe that the relationship the page is referring MAY have ended. There are photos on her facebook which show that that she was recently married to Chris Jacob in 2016, and by the time this is posted, she must’ve given birth to their first child together (her facebook lists her as 7 months and 1 week pregnant as of September 2017). EDIT: Bethany has given birth to twin girls.

**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
When Heather became a finalist on America’s Next Top Model, Cycle 2, she was known for her upbeat personality and perky behavior. Even though she had such a likeable personality, Heather had a hard time becoming friends with the other girls and often felt like an outcast. Even though Heather maintained strong performance, she became the third contestant to be eliminated from the show. The judges really felt Heather looked too much like a teenager to have a professional career in the industry.
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
And I thought Bethany was off the grid. Heather was even more difficult to find on social media. It seems that she has abandoned modeling and is working as a full time Nurse. Since the show, she has gotten married and now goes by Heather McClure. Her husband, Jeff McClure, is a realtor in California. They have no children yet, however, they own a yorkshire who goes by the name Princess Fiona. Not much is known about Heather post-*Top Model*, though her last instagram update shows that she has had lash extensions.

**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
Standing 5 feet, 7 inches, Jenascia was the shortest among the 12 Finalists in America’s Next Top Model, Cycle 2. For the first photo, Jenascia arrived three hours late because the other models did not wake her up when it was time to leave. She felt betrayed by all of them, especially by fellow Top Model finalist, April, whom she had helped the day before. She was not eliminated for being tardy, but was cut out off the show on the fourth week after failing to compensate for her lack of height.  
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
After the show, Jenascia returned to her job at Hooters and gave birth to a child in 2007. She has appeared in a few Seattle calendars and taken some test shots. She appeared in the Feb 2009 issue of DList Magazine. In January of 2010, Jenascia appeared as a contestant on Wheel of Fortune, where she won just under $50,000. In 2013, she was featured as a stylist in a [BTS video of DList magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i8V0hkgHW0) shoot starring Cycle 23 winner, India Gants. In the same year, she also modeled for the Spring 2013 collection of the Rich Kids Brand. Nowadays, she works as an esthetician in SET, a Seattle based Waxing Salon, where she is known as [The Vagine Queen of Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/VQueenofSeattle/). She has also worked as a Fashion Director for DList Magazine from 2009 up until 2013. She married her boyfriend, Evan Lee Carter, in July 2017.

**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
As a finalist for America’s Next Top Model Cycle 2, Xiomara showed a lot of potential during the first few challenges in the show, but come the fifth week, was eliminated when her photos from the underwater photo shoot failed to impress the judges. Her walk was also criticized, having done so with her eyes unconventionally “bugging out.” Despite not being able to captivate the judges for a long time, her great personality and kindness won the hearts of the other girls in the finals.  
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
After her stint on ANTM, Xiomara (who goes by the name *Xiomi* these days) signed with New York’s Boss Model Management and has modeled for the likes of Carmen Marc Valvo, Terani Couture, and has also appeared in the New York Post Latino Issue, the 5th issue of TDInk Magazine, Lucier Magazine, as well as grace the cover and pages in the May/Jun 2016 issue of STS Luxury Style Magazine. She has appeared in the 2017 horror film *Terrifier* and will appear in the film *Rounded* in 2018.  
  
&amp;nbsp;   
She chose to put a pause on her modeling career to focus on school. After obtaining her degree, the New Jersey native is currently pursuing her Masters’ Degree as a Nurse Practitioner and also works alongside her husband, Dr. Shain Cuber, one of NY/NJ’s busiest plastic surgeons. Xiomi has worked as an aesthetic and dermatologic nurse, and it was then that she realized that she wanted to concentrate on coaching women in order to achieve their best self from the inside out. She has a [website](http://donteversaynever.com/), which focus on beauty, health, lifestyle, and wellness. “The website is based around me giving advice to women about different things. It incorporates both my clinical and beauty expertise; so you get the health tips and resources, as well as beauty tips, because I have the qualifications,” says Xiomara, “For me, it is important to be authentic because there are some others that claim to be health and beauty experts, but don’t really have the credentials. I’d like to be a resource for these women that wouldn’t go online and search for evidence based research articles, or have the time to read books on health, nutrition, beauty and wellness.”

As a finalist for America’s Next Top Model Cycle 2, many people thought that Catie would become the second winner of the show, but she ended up being the sixth contestant eliminated because she failed to produce a good black and white photograph. In addition, her emotional instability served as a hindrance to her growth.
  
&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
Catie is another one of those girls who have kept a relatively low online profile since the show ended in 2004.

&amp;nbsp;  
**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
As a finalist on Cycle 2, Camille was not exactly well-liked by the other girls in the Top 12. Both Yoanna and Bethany confronted her because of her bad attitude, and even the judges grew increasingly tired of her arrogant behavior. Before she was eliminated from the show on the eighth week, she and Yoanna patched up their differences, but when Camille hinted to the judges about Yoanna’s eating disorder, Camille and Yoanna’s friendship quickly dissolved. Camille McDonald is known for the quote “This is my signature walk and this is what’s going to make me famous”, which she said during their go-sees in Milan. Camille was invited back in 2011 to participate in the All-Star cycle.  

&amp;nbsp;  
**ANTM CYCLE 17**  
During All Stars, Camille got a weird edit. She was given the “Older Model” edit. Leading up to their elimination, when the girls would receive care packages from home, Camille’s mail was mostly bills. She was eliminated during the 4th week, after the Express photo shoot, due to a weak photo.  

&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
Camille later moved to Europe and signed with the prominent Modeling Agency Major Model Management (Milan), shooting editorials, signature walking down runways for designers such as Escada, Caroline Hedaya, Bikini Under The Bridge, Zam Barett, Victor Hou, Korto Momolu, Ice Blue, Byron Lars, and lingerie giant Wolfords of London to name a few.

She quickly became one of the 12 Finalists, but during the fashion show on the first week, April accidentally wore the wrong dress. Jenascia, another Finalist, was quick to rescue her. However, the following day, April failed to wake Jenascia up for their first photo shoot, causing their relationship to sour for awhile. She was eliminated on the ninth week because the judges thought she was too robotic and self-critical.

**ANTM CYCLE 2**  
As a finalist on the second season of the show, Shandi’s warm and kind personality gained the approval of not just her fellow finalists, but the viewers as well. She started off as one of the weakest models in the bunch, but gradually worked her way up to the Top 3. Her popularity intensified when she passed out due to her low blood sugar level during the third week. She is not without mistakes, however, as she slept with an Italian boy during a photo shoot in Milan. Shandi came clean to her boyfriend about her infidelity, but the guilt and emotional burden were enough to spoil her performance, and on the tenth week, she was eliminated from the competition.


&amp;nbsp;   
**POST-TOP MODEL**  
Since appearing on the show, Shandi reportedly has gone back to working as a DJ in New York. Shandi was signed with Trump Model Management but has left the industry. She has taken test shots and done some print work. She appeared in the April 2007 issue of Cover Magazine with fellow cycle 2 model, April Wilkner. She has also been featured in *Nigel Barker’s Beauty Equation*. In 2009, she appeared in a documentary called *Best Worst Movie*.

&amp;nbsp;   
The Tyra Banks show held the first (and only) *Fiercee Awards* for moments from ANTM’s first nine seasons. Shandi was nominated for craziest phone call and ugliest cry but lost both. She later won the award for the Most Dramatic Change. 

&amp;nbsp;   
Shandi has modeled for different brands and designers such as Donna L’oren, Fred Flare, Arrojo Studio, DDRej, and Debora Francis. She has walked the runway for designers such as Lily Samii (San Francisco Fashion Week 2004), Gen Art New York (Spring 2005),  and ELLEGirl Presents: Dare To Be You. These days, she manages Kennaland, a hair salon based in Manhattan. She also worked as a DJ in the early 2000s (post-ANTM), but I don’t think she does so anymore. TBH there isn’t much on her instagram about her personal life (except her boyfriend).

So naturally I posted my résumé the other day in the résumé thread (Here's a look if you'd like to take a look: https://imgur.com/a/IqdAg I haven't gotten anything back with it yet but still a ways to go with applying for summer 2018).

One of the replies mentioned tailoring it based on the jobs I'm applying for.


How should I go about doing that if this is all I pretty much have going on? (I'm a Junior in CS at a small state school, my only other project really right now is a text editor in C I'm working on). I was just going to mass apply to places with it.

Assuming approximately equal offers (in terms of pay, interestingness, company recognition, etc), what are thoughts on APM vs SWE internships? How does one figure out if they want to be a PM or a software engineer? What are the factors that went into your decisions one way or another? (Obviously, it seems like the better internship would be for the role you want full time, but if you aren't sure...)"

Who am I to deny the public?

Check [Part Three Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/7cweon/came_on_my_coworkers_face_at_a_convention_part_3/)

Part 1 TL;DR - Me (6' bearded guy) and my coworker Samantha (think Christina Hendricks with a bunch of tattoos and not, you know, the most beautiful woman alive) are working an extremely stressful corporate convention where I handle all the day-to-day and she's an AV squad of one. Late night text about how awesome our hotel robes are turns into sending noods and eventually mutual masturbation with me cumming all over her face. Fun!

Part 2: The Convention

Setup is always brutal, but execution is always worse. No matter how much we prepared, dealing with the egos of tech bros is never pretty. The first day of the convention was crazy, I barely had time to think about how I had shot a huge load all over my (extremely competent and hardworking) AV assistant's face and neither, I assumed, had she. We were guns blazing from 4:30AM to well after midnight. I wish I could say something fun happened that night but we just downed shots from a bottle of bourbon I make sure to keep close at hand for times when the hotel bar is closed by the time we are wrapped and crashed.

The next day was one of the worst conference days I've ever worked in a decently long career of doing so. A high-profile guest speaker had been added last minute, failed to provide any of the assets we needed to set up and also had rolled in roughly 15 minutes before it was time for him to speak. Samantha and I scrambled our asses off to push, prod and outright berate people, computers, cameras and lights in order to pull it off. As I mentioned before though, Samantha's a fucking rock star and by the time this hoodie-wearing doofus made it to the stage everything was right as rain. I was running cues for this presentation but was also prepping an intern to take over the duty after our high-profile speaker's presentation was over. My phone buzzed.

Samantha: ""Can you believe this idiot?""

Me: ""Tell me about it. I think he's inventing half of the words he's saying on the spot.""

Samantha: ""When he asked if we could recreate those middle slides in Photoshop my head just about exploded.""

Me: ""Haha, do you think he even knows what Photoshop is?""

Samantha: ""Is that bourbon still in your bag in the storage room?""

Me: ""Duh. Never leave home without it. Why?""

Radio silence. I was still at least half-focused on tech-douche's presentation so I didn't really think anything of it. A few minutes later my phone buzzes again.

Samantha: ""Guess what?""

Me: ""You've taken up drinking in the middle of the day because of this ass clown?""

To that, Samantha responded with one of the most incredible photos I've ever seen. Usually when we're doing setups, Samantha is rocking jeans, flannels and boots. She's no-nonsense, get shit done. However once the conference actually starts we require everyone to wear business attire. We're professionals god damn it. That day, Samantha was wearing a gray blazer and tight slacks combo with a dark red blouse underneath that was clearly struggling, straining and basically failing to hold in her fabulous tits. In the photo she had unbuttoned the blazer and most of the blouse and had the whiskey bottle placed between her breasts, her tongue licking the cap.

Samantha: ""Close...""

The tech-douche's presentation was almost over. I could barely focus on the instructions I was giving to the intern about transitions and cues.  The next presentation had been rehearsed several times and was going to be a cake walk for the kid so, in a minor daze, I handed over the keys to the hotrod and slipped out the back of the room.

My phone buzzed again. Another picture. Her tits were out of her bra and she had taken a significant portion of the neck of the whiskey bottle down her throat.

Me: On my way! (I hate that OMW autocorrects to the exclamation point)

When I got to the storage room, Samantha had strategically hidden herself behind a large pile of swag bag boxes. She was a sight though. Her jacket and blouse were still undone, her tits were out of her bra and she was sitting in a chair rubbing her pussy under her unzipped slacks.

""I can't stop thinking about your cock,"" she said.

I was already hard as a fucking diamond by this point. This beautiful, lustful creature craving my manhood. I pulled my cock out and she immediately took it in her warm, wet mouth. For a fleeting moment I thought about how insanely irresponsible all of this was, not only was I her superior but also if anyone from the convention found out we'd all get fired and probably blackballed from this type of thing in a part of the country where you can really make good money doing it. Then she put my balls in her mouth and any reservations I had were gone. 

I'm not going to lie, I didn't last long. Samantha was groaning around my cock, still rubbing her pussy with her hand down her pants and switching between playing with my balls and her tits with her other hand. I felt my balls start to tighten. In the heat of the moment I grabbed a handful of Samantha's firey red hair and started fucking her throat. She groaned even harder and shuddered with ecstasy.

Slamming my cock as far into her mouth as it would go, I shot a huge, hot load directly down her throat. She moaned so loud that if someone had been passing by in the hallway they would have definitely noticed. I pulled my cock out of her mouth, my heart thundering in my chest. Samantha sighed, looked up at me with her eyes lined by running mascara and smiled.

""See you in there in ten. Now get the fuck out of here or we're gonna get caught,"" she said."

I am currently the operations manager for a music studio (at 40k a year...), and I realize the part of my job that excites me the most is the financial aspect: create budgets, fill budgets, create invoices, look at gigantic list of royalties and find the one mistake that makes the whole spreadsheet incorrect. I've always been a numbers nerd and I am almost OCD organized so the idea of looking at spreadsheets all day actually excites me, believe it or not!

Anyway long story short, I am thinking in getting into accounting to be more specialized. From my understanding I would need to:

- take a certificate in accounting or take a bunch of classes at a university (2 to 3 years, about 7,000$ in QC)
- do 30 months of supervised practical experience via the CPA PEP
- take the CFE

I assume if I start next Sept, I'll be accountant within 7-10 years, so at almost 40 yo.

Two questions for you current/future accountants:

1) Is it worth it?
2) For those of you who have done the supervised practical experience, how much approximately were you paid? The CPA website does mention these ""internships"" as they call it are paid but I can't really find an actual number anywhere....

So as many of us students here at GSU (especially us taking upper level major courses) know, students can do an internship in most majors I believe for credit. I believe the maximum is 3 credit hours. 

I'm in Economics, if thats relevant. 

Anyways, I plan on doing this possibly for Summer 2018. I have a potential opportunity for an internship that may fulfill the requirements, but it is stay-at-home based. I am worried that because of that element alone it may not meet the requirement. 

The reason it is stay at home based is A) It is a non-profit social development organization where most of the work is on the computer - for my tasks. 

So do you guys think it'll be approved? 

Many thanks"

1. How is the traditional and computer animation there? How are the professors? Are they competent? How is the student teacher ratio?

3. Is the hefty amount of money I will be paying worth it? Will I need to get additional materials and supplies? ( Currently have the Macbook Pro 2013 and an Wacom Intuos Pro tablet)

4. How hard is it to get the scholarship? Can you get both academic and portfolio based scholarship? How much did you guys receive? Any recommendation of stuff I should put in my portfolio? Or stuff I should avoid putting in? 

5. How are you guys doing now in terms financial situation? Are you guys still paying off your loans years after graduation? 

6. Will SVA give me the connections I need for my future career? Is the career fair useful? Is it possible to intern during my time at SVA?

7. How is the on-campus residence (dorms)? Is it recommended to stay on campus at their dorms or is it better to stay off campus for an international student entering as a freshmen?

I'm currently enrolled in a reputable university in the Middle East, I'm majoring in Computer Science. I have a 2.995/4 GPA which I will try to increase next semester (which will also be my last semester). My degree is bloated with general education courses which lowered my GP, however, I do have a 3.5/4 major GPA though. 


I'm looking to enroll in the University of Edinburgh for a MSc in Data Science however I'm concerned that my GPA will ruin my chances of admission. 


Other information:

1. I have a year of work experience
2. I did two internships as well
3. I am currently working on two research projects with my professors
4. A lot of extra-curricular activities (if that matters?)
5. I can definitely get 2 or more letters of recommendation


I do have a good score on my IELTS and TOEFL.


Apart from that, I contacted a counselor who suggested that I apply ASAP and perhaps get a conditional offer, however, she said that I cannot apply again in case of a rejection. Should I wait until I graduate with a better GPA to apply or go ahead and apply now and in case of a rejection apply again upon graduation?


Thoughts?"

I was given an offer today (after just the one phone interview) for $20/hr and was told the position was in the finance and accounting department but haven't gotten details on what exactly I'd be doing yet, probably something with software and databases (im studying computer hardware engineering so not really in my area of focus but i'm qualified and have experience with that stuff). The commute would end up being about an hour each way as well. 

Here's my problem. I want an internship so it would make sense to take this since its good pay and well, I got the offer. On the other hand an hour commute is a bit much and if it is doing something that isn't my area of focus but still in my major, I'd rather be doing robotics or automation. Here's the kicker, my resume is pretty good and I have already had an internship last year but I applied to 42 internships so far this year and only got this one interview (which I got because I knew someone in management). So the question is should I skip on this offer if it doesn't suit me and hope that I get an interview and later an offer from someone else or just take the safe way out and accept this?"

I'm currently a senior electrical and computer engineering student (pursuing both degrees at the cost of one extra semester) with minors in both computer science and mathematics. I should note that my focus is in embedded systems, however I have not been able to take a course relevant to the subject until *this* semester. After this semester, I will have two more remaining, with *one* Summer break in between (time for an internship). Up to this point, I have only worked in research labs over the Summers for various reasons. So, I've decided it's time to get an internship to make things a little bit easier once I graduate.

I have considered graduate school, however I think it would be best for me to go into industry with an employer that offers tuition reimbursement. If you have differing opinions, they are welcome.

Now then, my resume needs some updating, though I'm not quite sure where to start. I've considered replacing some of the outdated information with a ""Relevant Coursework"" section, but I'd like some input on that.

I was advised to repose this here from r/datascience so I'm hoping I could get some help here! I am in a very unique situation with no one to turn to for advice so here I am.

Having just graduated from a top private US college with a degree in Economics, I am currently studying a masters in data science in a European university with a strong Econ and data science program. I had very little background in coding before the program started in September but I am working on strengthening them right now. The program has a strong theoretical focus but at the same time we are learning and using R, Python, SQL, Hadoop and some other data science-related software. I am a fast learner when it comes to quantitative subjects so I am doing pretty well so far. Together with the masters thesis and industrial practicum I have to complete next semester, I am confident that I will have the necessary skills to apply for and obtain junior/entry-level data scientist roles.
The catch is that I am on a government scholarship which requires me to return to my country after one year of work overseas. This scholarship is also the reason why I am pursuing my masters in Europe instead of the US (sponsorship for a masters is only available if you pursue it on a different continent to your undergrad). This is a major issue because I need to find a job/internship by the end of February (another stipulation for being allowed to work overseas for a year). This is a huge problem because at this point in time, I don't have any work experience or possess any past projects or experience in computer science. Despite a 4.0 GPA in college, I've been told by recruiters of a few big companies I've had a referral to that I lack the requisite experience and qualifications to interview for a job in data science. Being in Europe might also be a factor as I am not a US citizen although US work permits are significantly easier to obtain for nationals from my country compared to others. I have a friend from the same major and same year in college who is currently pursuing his masters in data science at the same college who's already had an interview with Palantir while my online application was rejected within a day because ""do not have a position which currently matches (my) background and experience at this time"".

Despite my interest in quantitative subjects in school, I'd never actually done an internship or projects related to data science or computer science. I've also never recruited because I was guaranteed a job from my scholarship. As such I'm completely clueless as to what I should do it at this point in time. One option, could possibly work out, is to stall for time so that I can apply for internships and jobs in summer next year although I would not bet on it. Assuming that that is not an option, what would be your job-seeking advice to me? What kind of company would be interested in hiring me as an intern/full-time worker? Any general comments are also welcome!"

7bmy21,13,2017-11-08,Finally saw a geneticist - sharing my experiences,taylor-in-progress,ehlersdanlos,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/7bmy21/finally_saw_a_geneticist_sharing_my_experiences/,"I'm not entirely sure how I feel right now. I finally saw a geneticist yesterday. I saw someone at University Hospital in Cleveland, OH. It wasn't the doctor I thought I was scheduled with, but that's OK. My partner came with me, both because I don't drive on highways, and to be moral support in my appointment. I see a lot of people who are anxious about how these appointments go, so maybe this will help. It will probably be very long though.

I got called back to a room with a geneticist, a genetic counselor, and an intern. They went through a lot of family history stuff. There was definitely interest in the fact that my deceased aunt had to get a hysterectomy in her 30s or 40s because of uterine hemorrhage or ruptures, and her daughter was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in her teens. There are a lot of gaps in knowledge for me on that side of the family because there are a lot of people I don't have much contact with. The confusion came in with the fact that as far as I know, my mother hasn't had any major vascular complications and is in her 60s. Her symptoms line up more with hEDS, except it's impossible to tell if she is hypermobile due to osteoarthritis. It also doesn't help that my mom isn't always very open about her medical history. 

Anyway, they moved on to my own history, asking a bunch of questions about things like GI issues, other diagnoses, surgical issues, my medications, etc. They then began to run through the diagnostic criteria for hEDS. Checked my hypermobility (I got a 5/9 - everything but knees and elbows). They got my height / arm span ratio, checked my feet, looked at scars, etc. The geneticist asked about echo results, and said she would refer me to cardiology once I said I've never had an echo. I also explained that I have had some tachycardia issues and hypertension. 

At this point, she explained that statistically it would be very unlikely for me to have vEDS without my mom or I having any major vascular complications yet since I'm 30 and she's in her 60s. She said that testing could basically tell me ""yes"" or ""maybe"", but couldn't conclusively rule it out. She also added that it's unlikely that my insurance would cover testing without more family history. She did indicate I should contact the office if I manage to get more relevant family history information. (They also wanted me to let them know if anything relevant comes up in my cardiologist exam)

At that point, I asked something like ""so it's probably 99% chance that it's hypermobile and not vascular?"" And she agreed. She said with my current information and physical exam that there was probably enough that she could give me the hEDS diagnosis, but that having the official diagnosis wouldn't really change anything for treatment. She said something to the effect of ""there's definitely something different about your connective tissue though"". I wish I would have gotten more clarification on this, to be honest. Does that mean I can go back to my PCP and say that the geneticist agreed that I most likely have hEDS? 

They then gave me time to ask whatever questions I had left, and we talked some about treatment options. She mainly stressed protecting my joints and then using braces and such as needed, which I already do. She also suggested looking into aquatic therapy, which is something I plan on checking out. I did ask what would be done differently for someone who did test positive for vEDS and she said it was mostly avoidance of certain things like angiograms and colonoscopies (unless it's absolutely unavoidable.)

I have some conflicted feelings, but I'm glad I had the appointment. I got a cardiologist referral, which was one of my main goals to begin with. I'm a little hesitant because she basically said it's up to the cardiologist whether or not they think I need an echo. I'm hoping to also bring up my suspicions about hyperadrenaline version of POTS. My PCP was unwilling to write a referral because I ""didn't have a good enough reason"" to see a cardiologist. 

I feel some relief that it's very unlikely that I have vEDS, but I'm definitely going to try and press my mother for more information. I'm not really sure where I go from here though, I really wish I would have pushed for a more official diagnosis in case I need it when interacting with other doctors, but I don't know how much that will matter anyway. 

Anyway, thanks for reading (if anyone did).

So, as the title says, the flame is slowly fading away between me and my significant other. We're both students and been living together for a few months now.
We've known eachother for about 4 years, and at first, it was a lot of laughter, smiles, dreams and sweet talks.

But then, i moved abroad for an internship, which led to a 3-months long separation (we still talked everyday during that time). Before that, we saw each other very frequently and spent most of our free time together, we went on a few trips together (nothing too costly, nor too fancy) and everything was fine.

My significant other is not confident at all, and has trust issues, which led me to install an app called ""zenly"" so i was ""monitorable"" wherever i went, and so on. After an 8 months long relationship, i still couldn't earn my significant other's trust. I get stalked on every social media, and I barely have any privacy.

I always get tagged on facebook posts stating how i could end up decapitated, i could get my stuff burnt and so on if i cheat, and stuff like that happens on a daily basis.

In case of a text message, i should answer in the following 3 minutes or drama happens.

I was able to bear it at first, and then it got on my nerves, i confronted my significant other about it, it went better for a small duration, and then got back to how it was.

Since i'm back, we barely have sex, compared to what we were used to, most of our talks are about money and chores, we argue A LOT more, we just don't laugh like we used to.

I don't know if it's just because we're discovering how the other is while living together or if something really changed... and i just don't know what to do...

**TL:DR** : i still love my significant other and i'm afraid my relationship is about to end, even though i still feel a lot of love, i also get more and more pissed off whenever i get home because i know it'll be only critics about what i should and haven't done, what i did wrong today, etc...

I just need advice from whoever would take time, i can be more precise about stuff if needed, my mind is pretty confused so i might have forgotten some stuff."

7bn6oz,0,2017-11-08,New Server Recommendations,Spiral_Out_462,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7bn6oz/new_server_recommendations/,"Hello All,

(I posted this on r/HomeLab earlier but I thought this might be a better place for help so posting again.)

Quick disclaimer: I am still in University and have been working as the sole IT Personnel as an intern for the past year. I am not very knowledgeable on these topics so please bear with my relative stupidity.

My boss just asked me to submit a proposal for a new Server to replace our outdated Dell R620 and our ReadyNAS 4220 on very short notice (wants me to submit the proposal by 2:30 PM EST today). His only criteria were that: A) its capable of running Windows Server (not specific on what version), and B) that it increases our total storage capacity (not specific on by how much).
I was thinking of going with a Synology RS4017xs+ as it increases our drive bay number by 4 (an increase of ~20 TB of storage using a RAID 6 Array on 4 TB drives over our current 12 Bay ReadyNAS 4220). However I noticed it does not contain any slots for OS Drives (we are using 2 SAS OS Drives in the current R620 with 5 Intel SSD's in RAID 5) so I am not sure if we would see an increase in overall server performance.

Can you help me figure out what would be the best configuration to meet his criteria? Any help at all is appreciated and I will try to answer any questions as best I can.

Thanks In Advance,

Sucks, but it happened. So I was pretty late on my applications and was pretty rusty on my interview/LeetCode skills. Since then I've been on the grind and have a good amount of interviews coming up, but NONE from companies I actually want to work at. Nonetheless, I am going to try my best to get an offer on the table just to prepare for the worst case scenario.

My plan is to continue my Leetcode and studying grind, so that when Spring comes around, I can shoot out hundreds of applications and pass the top-tier tech interviews all the way down to the easy ones and find a good job in the NJ/NYC area.

My question is this: how active is recruiting for the Spring? The way everybody here makes it seem is that every position is already filled and good riddance to me. Anyone have any insight? "

The pub wants to hire me for next semester, and the job/duties sound good.

7boh9p,3,2017-11-08,Supply Chain Technology,SakeIsGr8,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/7boh9p/supply_chain_technology/,"Had a writing assignment for one of my SCM classes at the university I attend, posting to reddit as part of the assignment. Below are two examples of SCM technology I was exposed to during my internship this past summer.

Supply Chain Tech 1
This past summer, I interned with Bechtel Corporation as a procurement and contracts intern on the Digital Supply Chain Project, where I was assisting in implementing Oracle ERP system for Bechtel procurement functions. Previously, the company had designed and used their own system to manage this aspect of business, however, it was becoming outdated and required a lot of maintenance. It was thought best to move to a third-party application in this area, Oracle, which Bechtel had already implemented in other departments. 
My main responsibility entailed consolidating the number of proformas (there were 12 contract types in use), reviewing clause content, uploading the clauses into Oracle, and building new (and fewer) contract templates. 
The process I used for reviewing contract clauses involved going through all the different proformas currently used, singling out individual clauses within each contract, comparing the clauses side by side, and taking note of any discrepancies. It took a few attempts at determining the most effective and easily understandable way to display the clauses and the variations between them. What worked best was creating an Excel file that had the titles of all 178 clauses down the left most column, and listed the title of the contracts on the top row. I copied and pasted the content for each clause in the corresponding cell, and made the text that was different across clauses red, to be easily viewed. If the clauses were identical, I highlighted the cell in light green to indicate there were no discrepancies.

To make the comparison process easier, I used a program that allowed me to upload and compare two text documents side by side, which indicated the discrepancies for me. Sometimes the differences were as minor as a few words, or as substantial as the entire clause worded differently, but portraying the exact same message. 
Once the comparison was complete, with all discrepancies noted, the file was sent to Bechtel’s senior contract manager for legal review. We were able to consolidate the original 12 contract types into 5, which were: Construction, Technical Services, General Services, Services Order, and EPC. The clauses within each of these contracts had to be uploaded to Oracle.
When uploading a clause into Oracle, there are a number of sections that have to be filled out, such as: Clause Title, Display Name, Number, Description, and a number of other ‘attributes’ as Oracle called them. I created another Excel file that accounted for all these attributes, which was then converted into an XML data file, where the attributes were made to conform to the XML schema accepted by Oracle. The file was imported into the system, and uploaded all the clauses correctly at once. 
Once the clauses were uploaded, they had to be organized into the 5 contract templates mentioned above. Each contract varied in length, with the simplest being General Services and most complex being EPC. The templates provided a framework for contract managers to use, and were able to be edited during negotiations to fit the needs of the order or service.

Supply Chain Tech 1
In addition to this, another task I was responsible for on the Digital Supply Chain Project involved setting up functionality within Oracle that would allow a buyer to customize contracts with ease. The function ‘Contract Expert’ required the defining of rules that guide alternate clause selection based on specific contract requirements. When setting up a contract, a buyer or contract manager is prompted with a question such as ‘Who provides camp accommodation’, to which they could choose either ‘Subcontractor’ or ‘Bechtel’. Based on their selection, the appropriate clause will populate automatically within the contract. It was challenging getting this feature to work properly, as there were many other variables that were dependent on each other, which all had to be set up very precisely. Once set up and working, this function proved to be an incredibly useful and effective tool that helped make setting up individualized contracts seamless. 
Prior to this, contracts were stored on the company’s online server and downloaded as PDF documents for editing. Someone had to manually delete alternate clause options from the file, along with other notes that were not meant to be included in the final contract. This required a lot of manual work that was subsequently eliminated with the contract features offered through Oracle.

7bor95,30,2017-11-08,Hippie-crite and NC,unsaferaisin,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7bor95/hippiecrite_and_nc/,"So Hippie-crite has been a pretty mild JNMIL for most of the time Husband and I have been together (since college). She's selfish and prone to backstabbing, but she's never broken into our apartment or stolen our mail or tried to stab me, so I'll take it. She's also a person whose relationships are...transactional. Which is fine even if it's not my cup of tea; I understand that there are people who prize image and material success, and honestly after being broke during the recession, I kinda do get it. As long as everyone involved is being upfront about what they want, great.

Everyone could have lived without seeing the explicit pics of her new boobs and boob tattoos, though. That's maybe not something you send your son- a Girls Gone Wild-style pic with only your hands over your nipples. I didn't see it personally, but Husband's then-roommate, who was a childhood friend of Husband's who'd grown up spending a lot of time with Hippie-crite, did. They were both moderately scarred by that, go fucking figure. This is textbook Hippie-crite: she does stuff that is very likely to make people feel uncomfortable, then she judges them (Oh, she just feels so bad for them, that they are repressed and not a cool open free-spirited ""black sheep"" like her, it's just so sad), and uses the stories to tell her friends how cool and forward she is. I mean I'm all for a lack of body stigma, but maybe you wanna check in with people about their boundaries before you flash them? But that's Hippie-crite for you.

She's also maybe kinda faking being unable to work? Like her mom, Rosé Whine, she has legitimate health issues, but I suspect she plays them up. She's ""too ill"" to work, but mysteriously well enough to be going on vacations all over the world for most of the year. Having traveled with spoonie friends, I feel a little bit skeptical that, say, freelancing in her former field (A desk job, not to get too specific) is much more taxing than doing a walking tour of Italy, or camping in Mexico. Fortunately for dinner-table harmony, I care about very little and I have a lot of problems with late-stage capitalism, so I don't give a crap about this, it's just essential background for why her final stunts were so inappropriate.

I had a really hard time during and after the recession. We graduated right into it, and after I lost a wonderful paid internship, I was out of work for two and a half years. Which were fully covered by unemployment insurance, because it was that bad at the time, but which was really hard on me. I didn't have much experience, and I was competing with people my parents' age who'd have to take the same lousy wages. I applied to stretch jobs, I applied to basic clerical jobs, I applied to retail and foodservice, and...nothing. I was a nervous wreck for a long time and I honestly still kind of am. I worked in environmental protection for a year and a half before a reorg eliminated that position, I temped whenever I could, but it was hard. I had good grades and I've never been fired or even seriously reprimanded, but there wasn't much of a market for non-oil-and-gas jobs where we lived, and I didn't have any industry or family connections. When we became Rosé Whine's caretakers, I was still trying to find a steady job that would allow me to continue helping her. See BitchBot for how well *that* act of mercy went. Hippie-crite starts really getting digs in about her ""law of attraction: nonsense, implying that I must not really *want* a job, and that there's something badly wrong with my soul that is keeping me from getting a shift at Starbucks. Really blamey, passive-aggressive shit. I was frequently tempted to ask what that meant about her illnesses, but I was honestly too fried to be snarky. Mostly, this came at Husband, because none of the Whiners can say a damn thing to someone's face. Months of this person who dates her way into perpetual vacations calling me lazy, accusing me of being a grifter of some kind.

Right before the great escape from Rosé Whine, Husband was feeling really down and stressed, and we were in the same boat, so neither of us was doing that great at being supportive. He called Hippie-crite to try to talk it out, and he confided to her that he'd been very depressed and was struggling with suicidal thoughts (We both were, and we're both much better now). Hippie-crite's response? ""You should work harder to make your grandmother happy."" As if that bitch can be happy. As if Hippie-crite and her useless siblings ever do anything but antagonize Rosé Whine. As if Hippie-crite hadn't goaded Rosé Whine into another fake health emergency by talking about the drama she was having with her new rich boyfriend (who was tiring of her shit right quick) and the other swingers (Again with the boundaries: reasonably, a conservative elderly woman might be expected not to want to hear about her daughter's sex parties; this does not make her a repressed weirdo IMO). I still don't know, four years later, what else passed between them in that conversation, but it ended right after she called me a whore. After I'd helped her son keep a roof over his head since college, between my family's generosity and my unemployment payments and my miserable *but paying* jobs. After she'd done very little to help him out. I'm the whore in it for the money (Ah yes, those sweet sweet stacks of cash every college student has from delivering pizza, selling sporting goods, and ""donating"" plasma were what attracted me to him. Then I cleverly encouraged him to pursue his public-servant dreams as a perma-contractor, all for THOSE DUCATS Y'ALL!). He came home that night and said, shell-shocked, ""I think I need to not talk to my mom for a while."" Nothing more. I told him that that's probably a good idea, if he's feeling that way, and that I'd support him. The full story didn't come out until after we'd moved, and that was the point that NC became permanent. Not that we'd get clear of them *that* easily..."

I can learn excel and use it, I can prepare presentations, I can analyze clinical data etc. I just don't even know what types of jobs to apply for that would pay about 40-45k. I don't expect higher than that, but I don't even know where to start or whats out there currently. Any advice or guidance or similar situations would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance@"

I'm a mail handler and I want to get behind a computer.


(brand new alternate account, X-posting to /r/USPS, /r/cscareerquestions, /r/qualityassurance)


I eventually want to telecommute. I get about $33K right now in a very physical job and I can't dip lower, especially if there are no benefits. I am willing to work on-site if I'm building my value to ultimately work remotely. I am in no sense an expert. I have manual testing experience which makes me think learning to use Selenium would be the natural course for me. Would an Automation Tester be a good path for my needs? Is it common for automation people to telecommute? Is there another possible path for me that I'm not seeing? Thank you very much for any help you can provide.


Personal Experience:


I'm have good mathematical computation and working memory index (RAM).


I have installed and used several (~8) linux distros and I am thrilled by using the command line but I'm very much a beginner. Linux excites me but I spend a lot of time googling how to do stuff. If I have to remember all that stuff, I am screwed.


I have taken the beginning java course a couple times and some CCNA but no certificate.


California State University junior standing in Business Admin classes. I did an unpaid internship and was then hired as the full time wire operator for UBS (placing security trades on a couple different systems). I tried to juggle both and raise my daughter and basically crashed and burned the job and school. I haven't been back. My daughter is doing great!


Professional Experience:


2011-2015: $33K as a MANUAL QA testing contractor. My clients/projects included: software for a medi-tech device, a personal finance tool, a web-based investment platform, several others for shorter durations. We basically supplemented the clients' internal QA teams to help test new builds and roll out smaller changes daily.


I was a click monkey and I wasn't particularly good at writing tests but that's my experience. I was comfortable being online all day and on IM with my internal team and the client's QA team. I used the tools of the trade: JIRA and other collaborative environments and bug trackers, SalesForce and database to a lesser extent, and multiple other tools here and there. Morning meetings to plan out the day and evening progress reports.


2016-current: Mail handler for the U.S. Postal Service. About $33K currently with good benefits which is important because I support my daughter. This job is purely physical and I don't want to do it forever. x-posting to the USPS sub to see if anyone knows of any way to get behind a computer for them. I can transfer my job anywhere there is an opening starting in early Feb'18."
7bplzg,0,2017-11-08,Does going abroad kill my chances in dating?,Pseudo_pod,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7bplzg/does_going_abroad_kill_my_chances_in_dating/,"Hey guys,

Very happily, I got an internship for 6 months, starting in January, in a foreign country which has been a goal destination of mine for a very long time! Because the opportunity was such a good fit for me, I knew I had to take it, but it's left me wondering about other parts of my life.

Primarily, I've ever so slowly been putting myself out there so I can finally have my firsts - dates, sex, and relationships. I got on an app and went on a very short date, but I didn't feel much of anything so I didn't pursue it. Since then I've been engrossed in the visa process (and feeling badly about turning the guy down), so I haven't worked to find anyone else.

Now that I have a bit more time, I'm wondering if I should try again, but I'm concerned about the fact I'll be leaving in just a few months. I'm pretty nervous about these kinds of things so I've always imagined I'd like to be in a relationship before I experiment with intimacy, but if a long term relationship is my goal it feels dishonest that I would search for a guy and then leave him for longer than I've known him.

Moreover, the country I'm going to, while not anti-gay, is not openly gay friendly either. I think my chances of dating there are slim, and the prospect for long term stuff even worse, if I can never go back there, or meet another abroad student who hails from far away.

Therefore, am I doomed to wait another 8 months before I work on this part of my life? Should I just give it a go and try to find someone who would wait for me anyways (probably a rarity?)? Or is it best to try and get over my insecurities so that I don't need to plan everything around relationships, and try to get into hookups?

Lend me your wisdom!"
7bpuje,0,2017-11-08,The Truth About Cal Poly Computer Science,thankscalpoly,CalPoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/7bpuje/the_truth_about_cal_poly_computer_science/,"Hi there, bright-eyed and naive high school senior. If you're reading this post, that probably means that you're thinking about coming to Cal Poly to study computer science.   

Please, please, P L E A S E do not make the same mistake I did and click that accept button. No amount of learning by doing will mitigate the intense pain this computer science department will cause you. Really, the only thing I've ""learned by doing"" is how to waitlist 10+ classes per quarter and still not getting what I want. Since I can tell you don't believe me (trust me, the allure of Cal Poly was strong for me too, I get it), let me go into a little more detail.   

If you've heard about the struggle it is to get classes in the CSU system, its not true for Cal Poly CS - its much, much worse. Currently I am waitlisted for 5 different classes at positions greater than 20 (I've waitlisted 8 classes in total), and I am in the HIGHEST rotation! Yep, that's right, the vast majority of CS students have yet to register at the time of writing this post and I was still only able to officially enroll in 12 units.  

Now, at least I have 12 units, right? After all, its still full time. Well, for one, I am one of the luckier ones - a lot of students will have 4 or 8 students once registration is over, leaving their scholarships at the mercy of whether they can successfully grab another class. But, lets talk about these 12 units I have - all of them are technical electives, the classes you should have a choice in, and none of them were my first, second, or even third choice. Throw your wild ideas about control over the classes you take to the side, because you have to pick whatever class has an open seat, regardless of who teaches it or what it is about.  

Oh, and if you didn't know already, the CS department manages to regularly over enroll students, all the while knowing this is a major problem. In fact, they did it just this past year! Incompetent doesn't even begin to describe this administration. At this point, I consider their actions to be actively malicious - they WANT you to not get classes. After all, each quarter you're year is another couple grand for the university.   

The only, and I mean ONLY redeeming quality about going to this school for computer science is the professors. I honestly have never had a bad experience with any of them, and they really know how to make you successful in the real world (pretty much all the Cal Poly interns I know and myself have greatly outperformed other schools in industry). But, by the time you're reading this, they'll probably have gotten fed up with the bullshit from this school and left, and I don't blame them at all.

If you're a CS student still to register for Winter 2018, good luck. You'll need it.

If you're a high school student, don't fall for the same trap we did. Go somewhere else, you're obviously smart enough too if you made it in here.  

Thanks Cal Poly, I've truly enjoyed going deep into debt. I mean who wouldn't like to pay 25 grand a year to receive absolutely nothing in return!

Our personalities and humors meshed so well.

Within the first year we went off to our respective universities (1 hour drive apart). We visited each other nearly every weekend. We built so many good memories together and were surely in love. 

--fast forward 3 years--

January-August 2017 I worked an internship and we were living the furthest distance away from each other we ever had (four hour drive). We weren't visiting each other as often and communication via phone was bland.

In August a week before my internship ended, a week before our annual summer vacation, a week before we could begin visiting each other every weekend at school again, she told me that without realizing it, we had slipped into a state of being content with a mediocre relationship. And she was ready to be done. Admittedly, yes, we weren't in the honeymoon stage anymore. But we still got along and loved each other. 

She broke up with me and we didn't speak for 5 long days. On the 6th day she called and decided we should give it a chance. 

We tried moving on but things were not normal. I could see that she wanted to love me as much as I loved her, but it was obvious she couldn't and her head wasn't in it. After a month I told her (paraphrased) ""it is obvious that you want to move on, and it would be selfish of me to let you continue this knowing you are not emotionally/mentally in it. For your happiness we cannot keep this up. We need to part ways."" She knew it was true and accepted.

We didn't speak for 4 days and on the 5th she called and told me she couldn't take it and needed to be with me. I was overjoyed, since this exact phone call was all I fantasized about over that 4 day span.

A month passed, and you guessed it... She told me she couldn't love me as thoroughly and as passionately as she used to be able to and we are not speaking.

So here I am now, thinking I lost the best girl I could ever meet. I believe she knows deep down exactly what she wants, but is having difficulty following through with it because our relationship was so happy and neither of us hurt each other.

Finally my question: How do you end a relationship naturally, still having love for each other, without a catastrophic and hateful ending? And what do I do in this situation? Suggestions for moving on?

  tl;dr: Girlfriend of 4 years lost love for me, but is having trouble following through with her break up."

Right now I'm a CS major set to graduate in May.

I really love my sport and don't want to miss this opportunity while I'm still young and etc., but I'm worried about trying to find a job after being away from the field for so many years (no, I'm certainly not going to be making superstar money, so I will need a job after I'm done playing). What would the prospects look like for someone with no relevant work experience 6-8 years after graduating? I understand some sweet Big N gig will be out of the question, but I'm totally alright with some small-town, ""boring"" job. FWIW, I've got a pretty solid GPA (3.96) and two Big N internships, but I doubt that will matter much after so many years.

Flash forward two days later (Wednesday) I get a call from one of the interviewers asking, if i could you come in Friday, the finance manager (another interviewer) wants to ask a couple more questions. It’ll take no more than 30 minutes. Obviously I said of course I can.

So I’m curious, is this a common thing companies do? Spur of the moment 2nd interviews? Or is there maybe a chance I’m getting offered the position?

This is my Junior year internship so I want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success for a FTO out.  I have past internships at Exxon and SpaceX, but did not receive a return from SpaceX as my team ceased to exist as Elon decided to axe the project and it was determined that there was not a business need for people with my or my team's skillset.  Both past internships were in a specialized subfield of CS that isn't commonly used in general SE, and I want to make sure that I am doing an internship in something that will allow learn new skills.

Right now, I am trying to decide between Box , Quora and Intel, as they seem like relatively prestigious companies and I want to play it safe.  My concern about Intel is that upon graduation, I would be stuck in a predefined salary bracket of between $65k to $85k.    This is about half of what I would make in the Bay Area, but it is in Austin where the cost of living is a lot lower (as a side note, Intel's internship offer is $3k a month lower and doesn't provide housing, a car or any other perks than Box/Quora).  Another concern I have is that not working in the Bay Area would substantially limit my career growth.  My concern about Quora/Box is that the cost of living in the Bay Area is high, such that my salary would go a lot less than it would in Austin, TX.

Is working in the Bay Area that important?  I want to go to business school someday and would like to do project management or work in some sort of management eventually.  Also, how are Box/Quora viewed in regards to other mid-sized tech companies like Intuit?

If it matters, I am a female EECS student at MIT with a GPA that is pretty much exactly average."

I'm in a very difficult situation. The situation itself isn't difficult, but it's very hard to decide and I can't stop thinking about it, I get very stressed about major decision, so I really hope people can help. I'm thinking specially of people who have relevant experience (immigrants who lived in UK and Canada).

Basically, I have been in the UK for 7 years now. I have 3 more years to get citizenship here. I also have been accepted into Canada and earned a PR (Express Entry) and I'm considering moving there.

Here is my situation:

Myself:

- 26 years old
- BSc and MSc Computer science. BSc mid-tier university, MSc top-tier university (Oxford).
- Have a Moslem name (I suspect it is affecting my chances). I intend to change my name later once I earn citizenship in either place.


UK:

- 7 years in the UK. Did both BSc and MSc (computer science) here and was fortunate enough to go to one of the top schools.
- My job pays good money (65k + varying bonus) but I hate the industry (finance, but the company is only made up of tech people and researchers) and we don't do anything exciting (old technologies). Basically, it's alright but it's not a proper tech company. In the US, people make more money working for pure tech companies.
- **3 more years to get citizenship** (2 to get permanent residence then 1 more for citizenship).
- Just to give an idea about finding jobs here: during my MSc, I applied to 7 different banks (at the time, I thought they were good... I was wrong), only 3 of them gave me a phone interview and only 1 gave me an interview (also offer). Bear in mind I was a top candidate on paper (programming since early age, one of the top schools in the country, 1 year internship before). When I started working at that bank, I realised that banks actually take pretty low-quality people and honestly I should have been accepted into all of the ones I applied to. I truly believe there is no way this experience would have happened to a native person with the same credentials.
- London just has a great economy... despite the difficulties with the visa and all that, it's still a very very strong city if you want to make money. This was one of the main reasons that was holding me here.

Canada:

- Already have PR which gives me peace of mind. I hate the fact that I'm bound to my company in the UK (and will be the case for the next 2 years). Moving jobs here is hard, it took me three months after accepting an offer to move from old company to this one (they do market test, then visa application then 1 month notice).

- **3 years to get citizenship** (I wish I had left earlier, it would have been only 1.5 years left now but I wasn't sure and the requirement was 4 years then was reduced recently under Trudeau)

- I want to move into Machine Learning and leave pure Software Dev behind and Canada seems to be actually doing pretty well in that field. My very good professor (Nando de Freitas) was from UBC, there is Geoffrey Hinton (back propagation guy), read more [here](https://www.rdmag.com/article/2017/07/why-canada-becoming-hub-ai-research) and [this government initiative](http://vectorinstitute.ai/).

- I think people are more welcoming to immigrants. I spent some time in Toronto/Vancouver and I ""felt"" that people are more open to talk and socialise. Girls in the UK (natives) pretty much completely shun me, whereas in Canada I went to one bar (very limited anecdotal experience) and didn't get that feeling of being an outsider, some girls looked at me and an older couple (man and woman) started talking to me and my friend to play darts etc. I just felt like I could be one of them rather than here I feel like I'll always live in my own little bubble. My only good friends here are not native. English people just seem so cold, they always keep you at arm's length, it's like a professional relationship, not friendship. Let's also see the contrast between Brexit (UK) and Trudeau (very liberal guy).

-------------------------

I know this is full of anecdotes and ""feelings"". I hope people can give me some insights and share relevant experiences.

I appreciate every single response I get

7bsqgw,80,2017-11-09,Mistakes I've made searching for that dream agency gig.,ProjektProgram,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/7bsqgw/mistakes_ive_made_searching_for_that_dream_agency/,"Hello all, whether it's total frustration or total boredom with the job hunting process after college, I've decided to list a few of the mistakes I've made while applying so that hopefully other's can catch themselves before committing the same. 

**1. Assuming I am special -** Ya I did great in college, good internships and even a bunch of personal projects such as developing apps, websites and children's books but so what? This mentality lead to me denying good gigs early on simply because I thought I deserved either a better pay or better location. Chances are if you're just graduating like me that no matter how good you did in college there are better, more experienced people who'd be happy to take that job.

**2. Assuming I knew what they were looking for -** Coming off the high of graduating I thought companies would just love to hear how well I did in class, about my personal projects, or even my GPA. These companies only want employees that can help them solve problems and do better. They're not interested in your personal activities(not yet at least). Focus on learning specific marketing skills such as SEO, PPC, Social media, graphic design or analysis. DO NOT ASSUME COLLEGE WILL TEACH YOU THESE. 

**3. Being afraid to call -** Early in the search I flat-out moved on from companies requiring a phone call. Whether this was a personal issue or our generation's issue I left

**4. Re-using the same cover letter -** I thought I did a great job crafting a CV vague enough to cover all the basic entry level positions, and the result was coming off as a very vague candidate. Be specific. At least have 2 or 3 for each marketing niche, if not individual for every company. Not to mention I probably sent out about 30 with the wrong date and a typo just out of laziness.

**5. Spreading myself out over too many job boards -** I had accounts on monster, linkedin, angelco, linkup, and a bunch of others until the idea of starting applying for the day overwhelmed me. Focus on one or two. So far I've found indeed and directly applying to the company websites to be the most effective. 

**6. Constantly telling myself ""Just make your own company man.""** - This train of thought goes hand and hand with #1 and has left me constantly disappointing myself. Go entrepreneurship and go capitalism and all that but again, the chances of being ready for that venture that so many people fail at are slim. Even if you're destined to make your own company and will settle for nothing less, you should experience being an employee first.

I guess that's all for now, a bit of a rant but hopefully some lessons resonate with somebody. And of course I would love to hear some tips from people who have actually succeeded in their search!"

I'm in a very difficult situation. The situation itself isn't difficult, but it's very hard to decide and I can't stop thinking about it, I get very stressed about major decision, so I really hope people can help. I'm thinking specially of people who have relevant experience (immigrants who lived in UK and Canada).

Basically, I have been in the UK for 7 years now. I have 3 more years to get citizenship here. I also have been accepted into Canada and earned a PR (Express Entry) and I'm considering moving there.

Here is my situation:

Myself:

- 26 years old
- BSc and MSc Computer science. BSc mid-tier university, MSc top-tier university (Oxford).
- Have a Moslem name (I suspect it is affecting my chances). I intend to change my name later once I earn citizenship in either place.


UK:

- 7 years in the UK. Did both BSc and MSc (computer science) here and was fortunate enough to go to one of the top schools.
- My job pays good money (65k + varying bonus) but I hate the industry (finance, but the company is only made up of tech people and researchers) and we don't do anything exciting (old technologies). Basically, it's alright but it's not a proper tech company. In the US, people make more money working for pure tech companies.
- **3 more years to get citizenship** (2 to get permanent residence then 1 more for citizenship).
- Just to give an idea about finding jobs here: during my MSc, I applied to 7 different banks (at the time, I thought they were good... I was wrong), only 3 of them gave me a phone interview and only 1 gave me an interview (also offer). Bear in mind I was a top candidate on paper (programming since early age, one of the top schools in the country, 1 year internship before). When I started working at that bank, I realised that banks actually take pretty low-quality people and honestly I should have been accepted into all of the ones I applied to. I truly believe there is no way this experience would have happened to a native person with the same credentials.
- London just has a great economy... despite the difficulties with the visa and all that, it's still a very very strong city if you want to make money. This was one of the main reasons that was holding me here.

Canada:

- Already have PR which gives me peace of mind. I hate the fact that I'm bound to my company in the UK (and will be the case for the next 2 years). Moving jobs here is hard, it took me three months after accepting an offer to move from old company to this one (they do market test, then visa application then 1 month notice).

- **3 years to get citizenship** (I wish I had left earlier, it would have been only 1.5 years left now but I wasn't sure and the requirement was 4 years then was reduced recently under Trudeau)

- I want to move into Machine Learning and leave pure Software Dev behind and Canada seems to be actually doing pretty well in that field. My very good professor (Nando de Freitas) was from UBC, there is Geoffrey Hinton (back propagation guy), read more [here](https://www.rdmag.com/article/2017/07/why-canada-becoming-hub-ai-research) and [this government initiative](http://vectorinstitute.ai/).

- I think people are more welcoming to immigrants. I spent some time in Toronto/Vancouver and I ""felt"" that people are more open to talk and socialise. Girls in the UK (natives) pretty much completely shun me, whereas in Canada I went to one bar (very limited anecdotal experience) and didn't get that feeling of being an outsider, some girls looked at me and an older couple (man and woman) started talking to me and my friend to play darts etc. I just felt like I could be one of them rather than here I feel like I'll always live in my own little bubble. My only good friends here are not native. English people just seem so cold, they always keep you at arm's length, it's like a professional relationship, not friendship. Let's also see the contrast between Brexit (UK) and Trudeau (very liberal guy).

-------------------------

I know this is full of anecdotes and ""feelings"". I hope people can give me some insights and share relevant experiences.

I appreciate every single response I get

My friend seems to be hitting a brick wall and I'm trying to advise him.

Background:  He is over 40, was working in IT for years, but hit a plateau, and decided to go back to school for computer science. 

He is getting frustrated because it seems like he's getting passed over for significantly younger candidates, and from hearing things through the grape vine and on LinkedIN, don't have the same level of experience or passion for the subject matter that he has.  I.e. They hire some 24 year old that's a year out of school, and had no significant internship experience/side projects/etc. - i.e. they have only ever worked retail.

It does seem like is doing all the right things, getting job coaching, doing practice interviews, etc.

He completely understands that he's not sitting in on the interviews, so he doesn't know what is said.  But, it seems like employers aren't upfront/clear about what they are looking for and how candidates graded out.  We both have been on hiring teams before and we've given feedback to candidates on why they were unsuccessful and never really had problems.  I guess the question here is that why aren't companies more upfront?  Like, instead of saying ""we went with a better fit"" (duh), it doesn't necessarily look good when you hire someone 20 years younger with no significant experience.  What is the problem with saying ""We felt the person we hired scored better on the written programming quiz""

Oh, and I don't think over qualification is an issue, as is the salary he'd likely make would be the same (or more!) as he made before he went back to school.  But, he'd have a higher earning potential.  Also, he did programing as part of previous jobs but it wasn't the same types and it wasn't his primary responsibility."

The right tool for the right job!"" --Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott USS Enterprise NCC-1701 A (Star Trek V: The Shatner Disaster)  
  
First background: I've been doing IT support off and on for years with friends, family, friends of family members, etc.  Just last year I finally decided to get some formal training.  I'm just about done with my schooling (Internship in January and then home free!).  This just happened this morning as I got to the resource center (library) to do homework.  

A student asked for my help, she had made a pamphlet but when she prints it the second page doesn't print upside down.  I thought it was going to be an easy fix but then I saw what program she had used to make the pamphlet:  MS Word......WHY?!? WHY?!? WHY?!? don't they ever teach these students MS Publisher? I mean it sooo much easier to create and manipulate these things AND it takes care of making sure both pages are oriented correctly when printed.  So I bite my tongue and see if I can just rotate the content 180 degrees.  Nope.  Word won't let you rotate tables.  I think well if this were my printer at home I'd just print the two pages individually reinserting the paper to get the correct orientation, but this is a big laser copier/networked printer and I don't know how the paper gets oriented as it passes through.  So I think, well maybe I can save as a pdf and then manipulate the second page as a single object.  Nope, the school doesn't have the software to manipulate pdfs and I don't have the time to search for a cloud-based editor.  So I try bringing up the word document in publisher, only publisher f's up the formatting and spreads it out over 3 pages.  I'm starting to get frustrated.  Finally I have an epiphany (and believe me it hurt!):  Use the ""snipping"" tool to take a screen shot of the second page and save as a picture.  Word lets you rotate pics.  After making a copy of the document (don't want to screw up her hard work if it doesn't work).  I do this, delete all content on the second page, insert the pic, rotate it and viola it works!   Another satisfied customer, all in a day's work for IT MAN!  (Insert me in super hero pose)  
  
tl;dr Student tried to use word for desktop publishing and then ran into problems that would have been fixed either if they had used publisher instead."

7buu3h,2,2017-11-09,"Opportunity to study and intern abroad, few things to think about",NicksLife,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7buu3h/opportunity_to_study_and_intern_abroad_few_things/,"Hey guys, I'm a Management of Information Systems and International Business double major, with CS minor at a large (and well ranked) public university. I'm a third year, so it's about that time to start really thinking about internships and money in the long run. I have a question related to personal finance, and I’d like a few opinions. Here goes!

As I was just admitted into International Business as my second major, I was told about a few shortcuts that would allow me to graduate quicker. One of which, is studying abroad as I would earn a few credits and it would satisfy an ""Immersion Requirement"", which is equivalent to 3 other classes (9 credit hours).

I applied and was accepted into a two-month program in Shanghai, China, where I will be taking classes for two weeks and I will be placed in an internship for 6 weeks by a career-placement company.

Now, I am a little worried about taking part in this, and here's why:
The internship is unpaid. I will be receiving 3 separate credits which will go towards an elective, but I won't be making any money. On the other hand, I could get an internship in my state and earn a bit of money. The Internship in Shanghai will be in an English-speaking workplace, in the Management Information Systems specialty for sure and I am hoping for a big company based in the US, so it may or may not lead to a job offer which is unknown. On the other hand, working in Atlanta (my home city) would more likely lead to an offer after graduation.
The other worry I have is that the program costs $11,000 for everything. I have been applying for scholarships which should help with hopefully a bit over a quarter of the price, and I am saving. My parents said they will help with half if I can fund the other half, which is possible by working and getting a few scholarships by May. For the record, other study abroad programs offered at my university are about $7000-$8000 for 3 weeks, with no internship experience, or $4000 for a spring break (1 week) study abroad which only gives 3 credit hours.

Is this opportunity worth it? I feel like the chance is a once in a lifetime opportunity as seeing China would be a difficult endeavor outside of college once I start a career. I will also be getting experience working outside the US, which would open a few doors with my IB degree as I would be interested in working abroad in the future. I am worried though, it won't strain my parents a lot but it would cost me some money and I’d have a small opportunity cost as well. Is it better to save this money and work at home, or is it better to take this opportunity now?

Also to clarify, I will be earning 6 credit hours in a classroom setting and exempting out of 9 credit hours in the long run. In total, this is 15 credit hours, taking which at my university will cost me about $11,000 and postpones my graduation, adding living expenses for an extra semester. 

I know this is a little different than the regular questions posted here, but I am a little torn. On one hand, I would LOVE to partake in this, on the other hand, the price can’t be overlooked. This decision would affect my career outcomes in different ways, and I think it’s a fairly good experience. What do you guys/girls of r/personalfinance think?

Thank you very much in advance!!

7buve2,449,2017-11-09,Mr Pettigrew's Teddy Bear,Davi3s,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7buve2/mr_pettigrews_teddy_bear/,"Mr Pettigrew’s teddy bear was somewhat of a legend in my town.
Everybody knew Mr Pettigrew, and everybody knew about the small fluffy teddy bear that he kept in his classroom. 

I had first hand experience with the teddy bear when I first attended Montgomery Pre-School at the age of 6. I distinctly remember falling in love with the old bear as soon as I had been dropped off on my first day, just like every other kid. I had clung to my mother alot that morning, first in our front yard, then again in the car and most obviously, in the doorframe of Mr Pettigrew’s classroom. But once the old teacher had emerged for the first time, laying that soft bear into my arms, it was as though an untouchable safety net had been cast around me, protecting me from all evil and hurt.

Looking back now, I’m unsure how I warmed to it so much. The teddy bear itself was scruffy and looked extremely old fashioned. It was a rusty brown colour, with a small blue bow drawn on its left ear. Its right ear was always fraying to the point that it was barely even attached, and its mouth was simply an array of zigzags, courtesy of embarrassingly shoddy sewing. 

But the worst part were the eyes. Or should I say the two wide black buttons recklessly glued onto its face, mimicking eyes. They were far too large in proportion to the toy’s actual face, dominating atleast a third of its head. Even worse, it always felt as though there was a small red glow resting in one of them, almost as if a demonic presence was simmering within its body. Of course, this didn’t bother us much as kids, but the more we discussed it as we grew older, the more unsettling the idea became. 

Despite this, everybody loved Mr Pettigrew because of that teddy bear. 
So it came as a real shock when he passed away on a bitter December morning, only a few years after he had retired. 

By this time, I was fresh out of college, working as an intern at The Montgomery Police Academy. I specifically remember the moment I heard the news because I was filing some mind numbingly boring paperwork for my superior. 
I had overheard a conversation from across the room go something a little like this.

“You hear that old Pettigrew bit the bullet this morning.”

“You’re kidding me?”

“Nope, died in his sleep, poor sod. Hopefully that awful teddy bear died too?”

“Don’t be horrible! My youngest loved that man, said he was the kindest teacher she ever had.”

So that was that. 
Mr Pettigrew, Montgomery’s finest teacher had died suddenly in his sleep. The news spread quickly and that evening our local news company had even broadcasted a twenty minute memorandum remembering his ‘Immense teaching qualities’, ‘Dedication to Montgomery’ and his ‘Warm heart’.
It was lovely, really.
Although, I imagined we would mourn for a couple of days max, before resuming our lives as normal.

But that was not the case. In fact, the death of Mr Pettigrew would be nestled in our minds for much longer to come.

It was only a matter of days after he passed that the first death occured. Gina Randolph died on the 21st of December. She was found in her bedroom by her parents, her wrists slashed seventeen times. The cuts were so deep, they presumed that she had died of blood loss minutes after the first incision. The incident sent shockwaves across the local community.
Nobody could comprehend why a young girl who had everything going for her would just kill herself, only a few days before Christmas. 

Gina’s death was initially reported as a tragedy, just an unforgiving and terribly sad tragedy, and it wasn’t treated as suspicious. But just a few days later on Christmas Eve, it happened again.

Lee Salt, a young man who had graduated from law school the previous summer was found late in the morning, hanging from the door frame of his bedroom. He had used an old rusty bike chain that had lay forgotten among the junk in the families old shed at the bottom of their yard. Interestingly, It was revealed that somebody had desperately tried to break and enter the shed, evidenced by the broken window and unusual dents in the door. This was taken by the Salt family as clear evidence that Lee didn’t kill himself, that maybe he was murdered. But those suspicions were gently pushed aside and his death ruled as suicide just like Gina’s. Some agreed with his parents and petitioned for a curfew in Montgomery based on what his parents had said. Others nastily speculated that Lee was so desperately craving death, that he broke into his own shed just so he could end his life that much quicker.

But it wasn’t until the third and final death, the day after Christmas day that things started to get really strange. 

Clarissa Brookes had taken her car out late that night, telling her parents that she needed to get gas, but she never returned. Early the next morning a search party was employed and her body was found a few miles away. Clarissa was found slumped against her car on a small dusty backroad behind an isolated woodland area. She had stolen her father’s 9.1 millimetre and shot herself in the head three times. When she was discovered, her car’s engine was still chugging slowly. 

Much to the authorities’ surpise, Clarissa had driven in the opposite direction from the closest gas station, and there was nothing in her car that suggested she was trying to run away. However, there was one thing recovered from her car. Something that would eventually serve as the single most crucial piece of evidence throughout the whole investigation. 

From inside the passenger side’s glove compartment, a small crumpled piece of paper was recovered. Initially, the search party were confused. They simply couldn’t understand why Clarissa Brookes had left a blank piece of paper with nothing on it but a small sketch of a small brown teddy bear.

The discovery led to a lot of questions. But once a member of the search party joked that Mr Pettigrew’s teddy bear had killed her, an investigation was opened into a potential link between the loveable teacher and Clarissa’s tragic death.

This ridiculous investigation soon gathered speed until eventually poor Mr Pettigrew was posthumously being blamed for Lee’s death aswell, and sure enough by the new year, he had supposedly killed Gina too.

I refused to believe any of it, along with anybody else in Montgomery who had any ounce of decency and self respect.
And so naturally, the case went cold.
Of course it did. He was simply a scapegoat.

Until one day in late February when an unidentified person came forward purporting to have crucial information that the police simply had to know about. I overheard in the office one day that it involved critical evidence, evidence which would finally reveal the truth about absolutely everything from beginning to end, no exceptions.

But typically, the name of the person and what they had said was kept strictly confidential from the public, and the situation was no different for police interns like me. And this continued to be the case up until late June. When out of nowhere a meeting of ‘fundamental importance’ was scheduled by the Chief Inspector, requiring compulsory attendance with absolutely no exceptions.

So on the 23rd of June, the entirety of The Montgomery Police Force was bundled into one room. The boss, Chief Inspector Saunders stood up at the front of the room. He cleared his throat as the room breathed in anticipation. 

“Ladies and Gents… For the past few months we have been in the process of gathering crucial evidence in the case concerning the deaths of Gina Rudolph, Lee Salt and Clarissa Brookes. We are of course very grateful for your patience and concern. But the evidence we have been subject too is extremely sensitive, and we needed to make sure we had gone through absolutely everything before we jumped to any conclusions.”

He paused. 

“My friends, Mr Pettigrew was not the man may have known or heard about. Whether you believe it or not, he was a manipulative, evil and disgusting man.
As you might well recall, back in April, we had a young lady turn up at the station in an emotional wreck. She informed us that he had sexually assaulted her as a child, on multiple occasions.”

A collective gasp filled the room.

“She told us that she had put her childhood and Mr Pettigrew behind her, but when she heard his name in the news reports, it all came back to her. She was extremely scared, and she said that she deliberated for the longest time whether she even believed it herself. This took immense bravery, and since then we have received many more claims.
Currently, there are 54 individuals in the Montgomery area alone who claim to have been sexually harassed or assaulted by Mr Pettigrew during their time at Montgomery Pre-School. And we believe that list included Miss Rudolph, Miss Brookes and Mr Salt. We believe the guilt and suffering became too much for these three individuals when his name was introduced back into their lives, and they made the ultimate sacrifice.”

I was completely mesmerised, there had to be some kind of mistake. I saw a few others shaking their heads towards the front of the room

I think Saunders noticed this, because he subsequently turned and nodded at his colleague sat at a computer.

“Show them the tape.”

The lights were slowly dimmed and an old tape recording began to play on the whiteboard behind him.

The rustic recording was flakey and made a light crackling sound. But you could just about see the silhouette of a young child and hear muffled conversation between them and whoever was behind the camera.

“How are you today, [inaudible]?”

“Good.”

“I hope Mr Teddy Bear helped you with your math questions earlier?”

“Yes. Thanks Mr Teddy Bear.

“Good. Mr Teddy Bear thinks you look very handsome today. He likes your shiny red shoes.”

“Thanks.”

“Can Mr Teddy Bear see what’s under your shir-“

Saunders fumbled for the remote and quickly cut off the tape.

As the tape shut off, my mind began to scatter. An overwhelming sense of déjà vu lingered in my head. 

*What the fuck…*

I remembered having that exact conversation.

I remembered a how Mr Pettigrew had asked me to stay back at lunch one thursday because he said he was ‘lonely’ and ‘needed a friend’.

I remembered the shiny red shoes that I had begged my mom to buy me only a matter of days before.

The awful things that had happened that lunchtime.

No… There was no way… How the fuck did he film it? Even at that age I would have questioned it.

I felt sick to my stomach, and the room suddenly became a messy haze.

I groggily stood up, stumbling to the side and eventually collapsed onto the floor. People all around me began to comfort me, asking what was wrong. But I wasn’t paying any attention to them. I desperately scanned the room for a door, when my eyes met with a small security camera perched between the wall and ceiling. A small red glow slowly flickered where the lens was, almost as if a demonic presence was simmering within its body.

7bvb9w,10,2017-11-09,Why doesn't my Mother trust me?,MymajorisTrees,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7bvb9w/why_doesnt_my_mother_trust_me/,"I'm sorry, this is going to be long because I finally created a throwaway in which I feel comfortable sharing my story on. 

I am 20 years old in college and extremely happy with the prospects of my future and my current relationship. However, this past summer a lot of awful things happened that made me realize that I possibly have been raised by a narcissistic parent. 

My parents divorced when I was 4, and for my whole life my parents have been both amazing parents. My mother did occassionally pit my sister and I against our father when it came to his almost marriage when I was around 10 years old. That however, is besides the point. Ever since I've gone to college, thankfully 3 and half hours from home I haven't came home much due to a super busy college marching band schedule and being just a little too far from home to comfortably go home for just a weekend. The summer between my freshmen and sophomore year of college (this most recent summer) my life turned very stressful.

I was working a full time internship that I hated, my boss was a racist, horrible man who believed it was okay to send interns on job sites (I worked an engineering intern) who had no idea what they were doing and who had no training what so ever on the tasks assigned to them. During this time period my sister (8 years older) became pregnant. Through a series of crazy events it turned out at the time my sister found out she was pregnant, she was about 7 months pregnant. Yes. She had been pregnant for 7 months at the time SHE found out she was pregnant. She then gave birth the next month (a week before I was due back at school to start auditions for band camp). 

Because of the situation in my sister's life, the poor quality of living she and her husband were living in, I was moved out of my mother's house and all my stuff was moved to my father's house. My sister and her husband, and her child (who spent 3 weeks in the NICU) moved into the house while I started my sophomore year. 

I personally didn't cope well with being moved out of the house that I had lived in for 15 years. I felt very much like I was displaced from my own home. However, I have been conflicted over my own feelings because I know the situation that required my sister, brother in law and niece to move in was necessary. However, because of this situation, I feel I never got to properly say goodbye to my childhood room/life. 

Besides the above situation, my mother has struggled with money and spending for a very long time. To the point that when this situation occured, it pushed her finances to a very critical point. I, from a very young age have loaned my mother money. Even when I was just working a high school job she would need to borrow money from me and I even essentially bought a water heater when ours broke in the house. I personally save money fairly well, and have learned a lot from my father about how to be financially responsible. 

My mother leased a brand new car for me when I was a junior in high school, which I honestly didn't need at the time. I should have got a beater car like normal high school kids get. But, this car is my form of transportation. When I come home from school, going to school, around campus, groceries, post office, I need it to be able to succeed here on campus. In September I got a text from my mother asking me how much I use my car. I was honest and told her I used it frequently, but not always daily. She then tells me shes selling her car and needs to take my car leaving me suddenly carless and without a way home. This, coupled with the feeling of being removed from my home just a month earlier hurt me very hard emotionally. 

Weeks go by and she mentions nothing else of the car and then texts me just yesterday asking if ""I'd found the tracker in my car yet.""  Unbeknowst to me, or my father, she put a tracker in my car to keep tabs on me and make sure i'm not ""galavanting the state."" My freshmen year of college, despite being able to have my car on campus, she refused to let me bring my car on campus. I bummed rides from my roommate, from friends, or simply went without necessary items for a large portion of time. Because of not having my car on campus I was stuck on campus with no way home unless someone came and got me. I was isolated. Her reasoning for not letting me bring my car was because I would go and visit my friends at other universities (whom weren't ever close enough friends for me to ever want to visit). 

I was a 4.3 GPA student, valedictorian, scholarship student who had never ONCE done anything to give her a reason to think that I was a problem child. I never did drugs, drank, went places without telling her who I was with or where I was, or lied to her. Ever. And now, as a 20 year old adult, life on track, with a summer internship with a MAJOR production company for this next summer in Massachusetts,  she's tracking me. 

After what feels like her consistently trying to push me away, she continuously tries to control my life when its convenient for her. 

Don't even get me started on how she believes my tuition should be paid.

TLDR: My mother tracks my cars location, despite me never having ever done anything to make her think i'm not trustworthy. She moved me out of the house with only two weeks warning,  and has consistently asked me for money. "

So back in May of 2017 I was laid off from my job and began receiving unemployment benefits.  Almost exactly 1 month after the lay off I began a 2 year paid internship program (eligible for engineering students in their last 2 years of their major) that eventually turns to a full time egineering position upon graduation, allowed me to work on a flexible schedule due to my school course schedule. During these summer months I was still eligible for unemployment benefits but the amount was adjusted depending on the amount of hours I worked that week for the internship. As the summer semester ended and fall semester began I took a temporary leave of absence since my fall schedule did not allow me to work. Since unemployment services saw my hours worked per week went from 20 to 0 they thought i was terminated from work and denied my unemployment benefits from continuing. I appealed the decision because I was not fired but the appeal was denied because  you are not eligible for unemployment benefits if you mutually agree with your employee to take a leave of absence. Not trying to get into a sob story but I have a wife and kids and the unemployment benefits were helping us pay for bills and our apartment. I've been applying to jobs (its required to recieve unemployment benefits) but my school and this internship program are in high risk of being set aside. What are some options?"

7bwiff,2,2017-11-09,For Midwesterners: Do not attend SIUC for CS.,script_kiddie17,CSschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSschool/comments/7bwiff/for_midwesterners_do_not_attend_siuc_for_cs/,"Why you might ask?  There's a list of different reasons for not attending SIUC for CS.  One,  current chair would rather pass students that have no idea how to write code (even @ the 200 course lvl) instead of correct the curriculum for a more wholesome experience.  Second, profs. have little to no actual understanding of the material and will often times tell you ""it doesn't matter since it won't be on the test"" or give a totally asinine answer that is no where close to correct.  Third, profs./chair do anything and everything to keep their jobs which most of the time being in unethical ways (new chancellor is restructuring the university). Fourth, the Master's program...Oh don't get me started... tends to consist of individuals who have little to no understanding of the material, are habitual cheaters, and worst of all are the TAs for the courses.  I could probably keep going for a long time but want to end this rant/displeasure with good ole SIUC. 

P.S. A LOT of this I guess varies by student here.  Many don't mind (why would you when you get free As).  I have a lot of outside experience working internships, free-lance gigs, etc. so this is the view of someone outside looking in while also being on the inside seeing what industry wants vs. the education provided.

TL;DR:  SIUC's CS program is full of problems that prevent the program for actually being worth the time or the money. Such problems are pretty egregious and hard to not notice. "

I've just been shooting out applications that I find on LinkedIn, indeed, my school's handshake and companies from career fairs but nothing. Can't seem to find any in my state either so I'm at a further disadvantage when applying out of state. 

I feel like my GPA and school are holding me back when people look at my applications since they see a 2.7 and a school that's unknown in a state full of amazing universities. I mean I had recruiters at career fairs straight up end conversations when I told them my gpa and two mock my choice in projects.

I'm not sure what else I can do, my resume isn't getting any better content wise, my gpa is basically locked behind 3.0 despite my lowest grade being a B- in the past 2 years and my lack of out of school experience is probably holding me back as well since I'm a 5th year senior. I thought my projects were a good choice, showing a strong grasp of more advanced programming concepts earlier on plus working with and contributing to API's but they seem to have come off as childish. 

Is this experience common for other computer engineers or am I just fucked?

She sits there angrily picturing that slut sitting on her husband's lap, tight short skirt riding up, him too stupid, drunk and entranced to do anything but stare, and probably touch. That's when she notices the intern, [Luke](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/4f/d0/68/4fd068f40d6116b18a82c3b6a14b51e5--mens-sweater-outfits-skinny-ties.jpg), is the only other person in the office this late.

He's always tried it on with her. It'd be sweet if he wasn't so persistent. Typical cocky, college jock, privileged upbringing, well-educated, truly believes that even a married, successful, older woman like Rose is incapable of resisting his perfect cock.

That's when an evil grin comes over her face. A smart girl wouldn't sit here getting mad and jealous while he's out having fun, probably the of the worst kind, protected by the benefit of the doubt. No, she'd get even, and there's a sure thing right in front of her...

I'm currently a Sophomore in College studying Network Engineering, and I recently was invited to a second round of interviews with a bigger financial company. I'm very excited and I want to be sure I'm as well prepared as I can be.


I've just finished my first quarter at the school and am now completing my intro to networking course where we covered the OSI and TCP/IP models and their various layers.

I'm trying to prepare by going over the topics we learned so far which has generally been a brief overview of the TCP/IP stack and the common protocols concerning each layer. Subnetting was also covered but only in an IPV4 environment.

I wanted to ask the community here what I should expect in the technical interview. I was in the Army for 4 years and worked some customer positions but I've never been in an interview environment like this. So I'm not sure what to expect.

If anyone has some similar experiences that they can share that would be great. 

TLDR : Technical interview for Network Engineering Internship. What to expect?"
7bwwy9,18,2017-11-09,Computer science and my spiral into major depression,Blupoh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7bwwy9/computer_science_and_my_spiral_into_major/,"Hi Reddit; Internet. This should probably go in /r depression but oh well. I had a somewhat bad and peculiar day. I am writing this on a whim, as I have no one or any where else to turn to. I woke up today from a reoccurring nightmare I have had for many years. My depression medication makes my dreams very vivid, making it all feel real, and I find myself waking up in cold sweats when they occur, and all my energy is just gone. I will save you the details of these nightmares, but they share a similar theme: My friends (letting them down, disappointing someone, being abandoned) and school (missing a deadline, bad grade, big project, being trapped). 

I started university right out of High school 7 years ago at WWU. I wanted to study a natural science like biology, maybe a minor in music as I studied the violin and piano for 10 years prior. But nothing really fell into place. I ended up taking a lot of math classes just to have a foundation for my pursuit into a science. Then I took an introduction course to computer science, just to fill in some credits. Its not that I never had an interest in this subject because I do love video games, and play a wide variety because of the art and the technical craft behind it. At the back of my mind, this was the field of study that was hot and employers wanted. I had absolutely no programming knowledge going into this class, and I really struggled, but I passed it with hardwork and dedication, and I came out very fascinated by code itself so I pursued it. This excitement however, was short lived. The next course was a so called ""weed out"" class, and I found myself spending every school day in the lab, hammering out assignments after assignment, with  new road blocks and problems with each new deadline. Sometimes I wouldn't have a clue on how to even start to code something so seemingly simple. But again, through hard work and just the sheer amount of time put into it, I too passed this class. That was the end of the second year at WWU and that was only my second programming class just because the classes were very hard to get into due to demand. And so starts the 3rd year. This is supposedly the year which you declare your major, but I have only taken 2 CS classes, I took my third programming class, the one that focuses on object oriented programming. This was where everything truly started falling apart. First assignments were already difficult, supposedly really easy, but I didn't find them to be a breeze at all like all my classmates. Got a D- on my midterm, despite all my time spent in the lab and talking with the professor. I am a good student right? no. The third lab was just impossible for me, it is the lab where you fill in a rectangle of varying sizes with tetranomes with recursive calls, and despite my all my time in the lab and the effort put in to solve this thing, it will remain the only CS assignment I will have never completed to this day. I saw someone complete it in an hour time. Was I doing something wrong? What am I not understanding? Am I not smart? Fuck do I even belong in this class? In college? Around these people?  Despite this, I somehow passed. Maybe I pestered the professor too much. I took physical and noticeable tole on my body, from the sheer amount of stress it took to complete this course on top of another rigorous course. So I took a break from CS the next quarter, but I noticed this pain simply continued and never let up. Come spring, I was barred from registering for classes for the next fall quarter. Why? too many credits and no declared major. WELL FUCKING DUH IF ITS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CS COURSES WITHOUT ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE CLASS THAT IS THE PREREQ. So I transferred to UW CS program at the end of that year, with no real reason, direction or enthusiasm, just to get the hell out I guess, just to say my time was maybe worth a damn for something.

In fall 2014, a new school, new classes, same shit. At this point I have fallen deeper and deeper into my depression, I just haven't realized it yet. This next programming course was the  dreaded CS 305 at UW tacoma. Very rigorous, fast paced, programming intensive and the gateway to all the upper level courses for computer science students. This is where you make or break as a CS major, and guess what? I passed it. How? All my waking hours in the lab, in office, studying and programming. And I broke. Right after thanksgiving break, I saw the school health counselor. Something has been wrong with me this quarter, this last year, this last 4 years, 8 years, 11 years, since childhood. It was the first time I ever told anybody anything about how I felt. About my stress, anxiety and dread about being in school and how unfit I am to be a CS student, among my peers that are all extremely smart and can breeze through these courses easily. I dreaded being in school everyday. I wake up and go to class and stay into the evening at the lab, watching others be successful in their study or pursuit into internships and career opportunities. I truly did not belong here. Not among these people who are so smart. Them: check out this search engine I made and im presenting to Microsoft. Me: Help fix my null pointer exception. segmentation faults. Impostor syndrome? No. I really am the impostor. The following fall quarter of the next year I got an official diagnosis of depression. I was at an all time low. I would stay up to 6am doing nothing, wake up at 2 for my 3 oclock class crying, I was unable to complete any programming work to any degree of success at this point, I was unable to sit down and focus let alone a problem, but I pushed through lighter electives like I always have with the most bare minimum. I took a medical leave for winter and was on medication (zolaf). Even returning to school in Spring right after, I was still not all there, this field continued to be unrewarding as always. Remember why I had some interest in this field? For the art of the craft. UX design. Human interaction focus design. There is a grand total of 1 class. Everything else wants you to program first. The higher elective classes are group project based, and this is my chance in which I can show everybody how bad I am at programming. Great /s. And it really got to me to a point I just had to grit my teeth through every waking moment. I felt terrible when I just could not contribute. When all the work fell on others to pick up my sorry excuse as a student . I took another medical leave and break starting this summer, so I can  file hardship withdrawal on courses I had no capacity of even taking. And that brings me to today I have been out of school for 6 months and still on break as advised by my CS adviser to recover and get well. This morning, I get a call from a recruiter from Revature, a tech company. He said that he saw my linkedin account (which I haven't touched in 3 years) and noticed I finished my degree earlier this year. I told him I actually had 1 class left (which I do, Computer architecture), and he said to contact him again if I am interested after completing the degree. And that thought of completing school lingered and I just...started to cry, like I have simply forgotten why I am in this state and why I am here right now, and with this call and nightmare combined has simply reminded me of all these horrible things and trauma from school. These 6-7 years in college and still no degree, a feeling of lost and hopelessness in myself. Everything, yet nothing.

So I am here, and I don't know what to do. I am on this impasse, and my CS adviser is expecting to hear from me soon (she is aware of my problem) I thought I was getting better, but that really is not the case. Going back to school really scares me, and I'm just at a complete lost of what to do next.

Thanks for reading. "

Arizona - Stop pairing her up. Her best storylines happened when she wasn't in a romantic relationship. Her friendship with Nicole Hermann when she was learning foetal surgery was one of her best storylines. I hope this season with the the return of Sofia, we can see her focusing on being a mother, with some career development

Owen- Let him be okay with being alone. He's been picking women who are obviously a poor fit for him and then marrying them too quickly. He just seems toi insecure. If he's desperate to become a father, a storyline where he decides to go it alone and hire a surrogate could be good for him. I'd like to see him get a back bone and learn that sometimes he's better off alone instead of lurching from one disastrous relationship to another.

Katherine - give her a more hands on role in the department. At the moment, she just comes in and makes big decisions, rubs everyone up the wrong way before leaving again. Let her become part of the team, she could have her own urology department and that could pave the way for more storyline arcs with patients. One of the new interns could be her protégé. 

Alex - Let him have storylines that don't revolve around Jo or Meredith. He's a brilliant character in his own right. At the moment he seems more like a supporting character.

Elon is hailed by many on the left and right as the benevolent bourgeois, Elon is seen as the exception to the rule he provides jobs to american citizens while pushing american space travel to the next level. Or is he?

Shout out to Comrade u/risen2011 from r/socialism for showing me this link. This article details Elon Musks factory of the futures working conditions. Spoilers the conditions are horrible according to the article 911 has been called 100 times since its opening because of injury. Yikes!  this article is great 10/10 example of late stage capitalism in action ""Others described repetitive stress injuries they linked to working long hours. Before the company reduced the average time of a workday in October 2016, workers said they routinely worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week. Tesla said the change had been “a success”, and resulted in a 50% decline in overtime hours.""
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk

This is an article about a settlement he was forced to pay out money to american workers.
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/elon-musks-spacex-mistreated-its-workers-and-now-it-must-pay.html 

I wonder how he treats his interns. When employees described the work they frequently speak on being over worked, but that's just normal capitalism. What's not normal capitalism is the face that he's only paying Space X interns 4 thousand a month. Quote:""Tesla Motors interns make a median monthly pay of $4,480 and SpaceX interns make a median monthly pay of $4,080, according to jobs website Glassdoor. (Other Silicon Valley tech companies pay more. Facebook, for example, pays its interns an average of $8,000 per month.)

Before a liberal pms me about working hard please read the article this is my favorite quote:""Prospects of moving up are also very low. You will most likely be stuck in your current job unless there is a shakeup or your superior leaves.""

Next let's talk about Elon making the world a better place how will he do that? By privatizing Puerto Rico's power system apparently below is a link to fellow comrades post on this.

Comment by u/mysteriousdice ""there are several articles discussing unionization efforts at Tesla. The interesting thing is that the Tesla factory, previously called Nummi, was previously a Toyota/GM union factory, and one that had benefited from Toyota's management overhaul in the 1980s that greatly improved the factory's working conditions, quality and productivity. There is a great This American Life episode about the Nummi factory overhaul. Sidenote: Japan came to develop their management processes in the 1980s by borrowing many ideas from the American W. Edwards Deming (who is largely forgotten in the U.S.) but that's a story for another day.
When the Nummi factory shut down in 2010, Toyota claimed it wasn't the fault of the UAW union, but of rising costs due to location. Now that Elon Musk runs the factory, he is claiming that the UAW is working for big auto and just out to crush him. Now, there may or may not be some truth to this, but it doesn't really justify Elon's narrative that just because they are a small auto company against the big automakers that Tesla should somehow get a temporary pass to exploit workers or prevent them from organizing. He needs to improve his management practices ASAP -- he thinks that his own heroic self-sacrifice (working as hard or harder than any of his employees) and promises of a future vision is somehow supposed to inspire or motivate his workers, while also justify his present antagonism towards them, but he is ultimately paying a higher price due to bad management. The result is high turnover, a high rate of mistakes and injuries, and poor productivity/quality control. He needs to study W. Edwards Deming's Seven Deadly Diseases.""

Elon is not a hero he is greedy Bourgeois with a good image that he intends to keep don't let him comrades, we must expose his exploitation of the proletariat for the sake of our comrades. Elon's end goal is profits helping humanity is a second, Elon has dismantled unions that increased workers condition and overall happiness in order to further his own ends. We must spread the word comrades even under capitalism Elon's practices are corrupt and profit based, the short term solution? Resist his oppression by unionizing don't fight alone comrades. Long term? Crushing capitalism and end the oppression of the proletariat for the bourgeois gain.

Edit: reformatted abit this is my biggest Reddit post. The original was a pretty big wall of text added some spacing.

Edit 2: imagine this is the title Elon Musk is not a Hero, he's Bourgeois.

Edit 3: as advised by u/chreestay I added a quote. Sorry this post is abit rough, I mentioned this in the comment but its my first Reddit post of this magnitude. I did not expect it to become this big but Elon turned out to have a lot of dirt on him when I began researching. Originally this post was made after an Elon apologist responded to a comment I made. 

Edit 4: this post got more attention then I thought it would, so I am going to leave this link to r/debatecommunism they are much better at debates then I.

Edit 5: gave the post more of a purpose rather then just a hit expose on Elon. I don't have much time but the post should slowly get better unless someone comments at this point i'm just editing and reformatting

7bxk3f,3,2017-11-09,Negotiating salary when transitioning from intern to full time?,Jimisacun,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7bxk3f/negotiating_salary_when_transitioning_from_intern/,"Sorry if stuff like this is posted a lot- but wanted some advice specific to my situation

I've been at a small IT managed service provider as an intern for 5 months now. We run IT for about 40 small companies. I've been making $15/hour as an intern. I was the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happened to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I did mostly help desk work but also went to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 70% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week. 

I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians""

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000

As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"
7bxpjl,1,2017-11-09,Have to fight with employer for money? Want to rip my hair out...,menses_maiden,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7bxpjl/have_to_fight_with_employer_for_money_want_to_rip/,"So when I first started at my job, my employer said that we would revisit my contract every 3 months and give me a raise if I've succeeded in my role. It's been 7 months since then...in that time, we've moved towards a new service and he's been telling me that he needs time since he has to pay for new software/hire other people so I haven't brought it up. 

Just had a long talk recently with him about my position and he basically said until I accomplish goals including doing some tasks perfectly without his help (like making an analysis report for instance or deal with clients) he can't give me a raise. Basically he wants me to be an expert but is forgetting the fact that I just recently graduated college. I feel like I'm being set up to fail since I'm still learning--plus I've had to learn some tools/software that weren't even in the original contract and I've had to make him acknowledge that I've achieved tremendous progress. BTW- wasn't paid for learning those tools.  He has a habit of overpraising others and when it comes down to it, ripping them down. For example when I was working with other devs (again, not in my contract) he said I was doing a good job at ""project management"". When I included that in the reasons for why I should get a raise, he said it wasn't really ""project management"" but ""working with the team"". When I also started, he told us that he would give us benefits in September. 

Since this is my first job (at a startup), I don't really know what's normal/what's not but I feel like employees shouldn't have to fight to even have a discussion about progress and a raise. I feel like he wouldn't mind if I forgot about it and just kept slaving away...he doesn't like talking about money but does like talking about his expectations of me. I'm the one that has to remind him and sit him down to discuss my progress and when I do, he always has ""excuses"" about how I'm not up to the level of a ""real"" professional...aka someone with a few years under their belt. Of course I'm not! I've outperformed everyone he's hired before to learn these tools but I'm not at an expert level yet where I can do it at a very high level! 

I guess it all came to a head today when I told him clearly that I was expecting the raise....btw the raise is $2 more (my rate was $12 but supposed to be increased by $2 after every 3 months). I can't believe I'm fighting for an extra $2. He told me that ""We discussed a raise, it doesn't mean we can retroactively make the previous hours worked that raise. I'm happy to discuss with you those qualifications we talked about and work out when we can officially start the raise."" The fuck? I should've gotten a raise in July and again in October! I guess I should also mention that we just lost a few clients so he really doesn't HAVE the $$$ to pay me...and he doesn't think what I do is valuable enough to pay me that much which is why he's squirreling around the point. I should also mention that I worked 7 months unpaid as an internship to even get this job.  Should I even fight with him at this point?

7bxv2p,2,2017-11-09,advice needed on moving out,universe-one,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7bxv2p/advice_needed_on_moving_out/,"I have a dilemma. I'm a sophomore/jr in uni, and I live an hour away from campus. I'm looking to move out next semester and into the city, where I'll be closer to campus and possible internships. 

My first option is to move out near campus. The average rent would cost me around $500 including utilities, that is if I really find a small, cheap place to stay with a roommate. I would be in the city, closer to my university campus and internships, and it's the city- there's things to go, you know? The problem is, I've been struggling a lot with depression lately and I've had anxiety attacks at work and I'd either be sent home or my job would be kind enough to look the other way if I couldn't show up, or I show up late. I know I'd have to really push myself to make rent every month. I'm looking to move out with my best friend (as she's the only one I know who is actually looking to move out) but she's my only friend really and I worry that being around her all the time may ruin our friendship (i've heard stories about how it's not a good idea to move out with best friends). 

The second option is I move in with my friends. Rent would be about $300 in a really small house between 4 people. Moving out with them, I'd shave off about 15-20 minutes of driving, but that still leaves about 30-45 minutes every day for school. I wouldn't be too stressed or pressured to make rent because 300 is fairly solid, and I'd keep my job, who have been working with me due to my situation/home life/depression. The only downside is I'm still in the same town I've lived in all my life, and I sometimes wonder if this is a good idea, because moving out is supposed to be a fresh start for me. I'd still be pretty fair from campus, too. 

Any advice/experiences other people have with moving out/college experience would truly be helpful."

My co-op advisor is also aware. The co-op will last 6 months, and the internship will be 3 months. 

My instinct tells me I shouldn't renege, because it's much worse than politely declining an offer, not just for my career but also out of ethical reasons. I also would actually prefer a 6-month experience because I've never done any software engineering internship / job before and want the extra exposure. That being said, it's hard to ignore the LinkedIn name - I feel like it has a better reputation... I do not know where I will be happier or where I will learn the most, if anyone has had experience with either company, would love to hear your perspective.

I am fortunate enough to have two offers on the table. One from a large company that is willing to pay extremely well for an internship. And another from a small company that really wants me but I know probably can't match my other offer. I'll list relevant details below.

Big company:

- I worked for them last summer so while I would be working on a different project, it probably wouldn't round out my resume with new skills however it would show reliability(?)
- Would most likely be able to perform well again and have a full time offer. 80k-ish a year with the ability to reach 100k+ within 5-6 years.

Small company:

- Small company that really wants me and are willing to offer what they can
- Could grow rapidly however it is more risky
- Nice people that would promote a more free learning environment
- Unsure of the potential of a full-time offer because they really want me for their current needs (those needs could quickly change)
- Would allow me to focus more on personal projects

Things to note:

- I can enjoy working at either place, so it's a great decision to have to make
- I (hopefully) graduate college in the spring of 2019

Questions:

- Should I ask for the small company to match what the large company has or should I scale it down in order to not scare them away?
- Would the financial gain of working for the large company outweigh the potential of the small company? Personal examples would be great."
7bya91,4,2017-11-09,I don't care! (Nex sent email probably just to fuck with me),allwithoutgettingup,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/7bya91/i_dont_care_nex_sent_email_probably_just_to_fuck/,"So I figured out that he didn't put up much of a fight about me leaving because his stupid friend (the toxic misogynistic fuckface) was going to Colorado again and he wanted in on it so he could help sell it again and make extra money on top of smoking for free. I'm all for doing what you want, but atm I'm in this college program where none of this would fly. Like internship people will go through my friends list and the town is small and it's easy to see who is into what by who associates with who. Also, they are both abusive towards me for years. I may post on it later but I'm kind of embarrassed what I put up with.

I didn't want Nex to put up a fight or to try to come back. Tbh if you look in my post history he literally just did this exact same shit to me a couple months ago. And I know I became more trouble than my supply was worth and he never cared to begin with so.

Idk it sucks. I blocked his email because he was set on getting an answer for his buddy for legal issues because the idiot was stopped on his way back. He ended it ""I'm sure you enjoy hearing that."" Like he was half catching up by sharing gossip and even started it ""hey babe"" like nothing at all was wrong.

Fuck him. And no, I don't want to hear about the person that was always before me. No I don't want to talk to you. No I'm not gloating. Idc. Just want them both to go the fuck away.

Good luck there though because one year when Nex was the one who left they got on my fb and mocked me publicly."

I don't know if I am being greedy, but moving to America would mean 20+ years for a GC.

7bycnm,64,2017-11-09,Here's my technique for how I handle feeling overwhelmed with work,ravagedbanana,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7bycnm/heres_my_technique_for_how_i_handle_feeling/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share how I personally handle feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities. For context, I was only recently been diagnosed with ADHD this year, but I've been struggling with it for most of my life. As a third year college student at a highly competitive school, this technique has kept me from drowning in an endless river of responsibilities.

We've all been there: You have a research paper due in a week, and a project due tonight. Meanwhile, everyone else is applying for internships, and the pressure is slowly mounting. (Figuratively me right now) You feel paralyzed in a positive feedback loop of anxiety; you don't want to do your assignment because you know the paper that will take tons of time (and well, working sucks), but you don't want to start on the paper because you have more urgent responsibilities, and you *definitely* won't be prepping for interviews. What do you do instead? Whatever you do to procrastinate and get that instant dopamine fix until you finally crack under panic and shit out some half-assed work.

How do I avoid this? The technique's simple. ***Procrastinate on larger tasks by working on smaller tasks, and interest yourself in your work.*** [As somebody with ADHD, I've come to understand that I'm just fundamentally wired differently than other people.](http://www.oaktreecounselor.com/blog/adult-adhd-lazy) As somebody with ADHD, you crave dopamine in a way that others don't. Why don't you stop fighting who you are, and instead reframe your responsibilities in a way that appeals to your own desires for interest and novelty? This sounds counterintuitive, but I honestly believe that I find things boring not because they are intrinsically boring, but because they are *work*. Honestly, is browsing reddit for 5 hours really that much more exciting?

I guess when it comes down to it, the ""technique"" is just the same as the advice to [start with small items first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhFQA998WiA). However, this way of rephrasing the problem is much more personally relevant, because I find that it's near-impossible for me to work on the things that I *should* be doing, but when I'm procrastinating, I can hyperfocus on the same task for DAYS. In the end, I'm still procrastinating on something, but at least I'm getting *something* done. It's the lesser of two evils.

Take my example. Researching European literature for an afternoon sounds overwhelming, but in comparison, this computer science project is so much more fun. I'll put off the research paper and get my gratification by working on the easier, smaller project. Now that that's one, I know that I need to apply for internships and prep eventually, but that sounds like mind-numbingly boring work. Why not do some reading for the paper for the time being? After all, some old dude's ideology sounds way more interesting than filling out forms. Finally, once my paper is done, I can finally relax and work through some interview questions, knowing that I don't have any other responsibilities hanging over your head.

**TL;DR: Procrastinate by being productive, be productive by procrastinating.**"
7bydgl,289,2017-11-09,She Made Up A Song About Me,venusinchucks,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bydgl/she_made_up_a_song_about_me/,"This happened about a year ago, and honestly, I'd forgotten about it until another story on LNM brought it to the front of my mind.  

My educational and professional backgrounds are firmly rooted in government and public policy. My chosen field is generally thought of as useless, low-paying, and without many opportunities to actually practice or advance in it, so you can imagine how happy I was when I got an offer to be a legislative director for a very high-profile state legislator.  

Things were pretty interesting at first. We lost our chief of staff to a better-paying job in the private sector about two months in, so I took over the day-to-day operations of managing the office, managing my boss, and dealing  with every entitled constituent, pushy lobbyist, and haughty elected official under the sun. Even though my job was getting harder by the nanosecond, I was happy to be doing it. I am a wonk at heart, and I was in wonk heaven in that office. 

That is, until the crazy people started calling, writing, and worse, visiting the office. If you've never worked in an elected official's office, let me give you a little rundown. Most people who reach out are ""normal"", albeit, sometimes angry, frustrated, scared, or all of the above. That's okay. Those are the people you want to hear from and if you can, try to make happy. Conversely, there is a subset that will also make contact, and they will make you regret your decision to put off law/business/grad school for another year. 
 
It seems that every untreated depressed, bipolar, psychopathic, and schizophrenic adult within a fifty-mile radius will reach out to you about some crazy shit. They've seen your boss on television, mentioned in the newspaper, or attended a town hall meeting, and decided to push the limits of legislative responsibility/accountability as far as they will stretch. I had to reach out to the state troopers stationed in the Capitol for protection on multiple occasions. The legislative session wasn't too far away, and its approach was inspiring them to reach out.

I first encountered these people when I was interning in D.C. I was working in the personal office of a committee chairman whose name everyone would recognize if I mentioned it, and because of his visibility, everyone and their dog's dog would call. It was the fall of 2008. The economy had gone to shit, Obama was about to win the election, and I had motherfuckers calling me about the government using the ""emissions"" from microwaves to read the mind of every single American and saying that they represented ""multi-trillionaires"" who had every dime the government needed to get the country's finances back on track. 

That was the type of shit that I expected to encounter when I started this job, so naturally, I encountered something else. 

I went into the office super early one morning to get a jump start on my day. My boss had yelled at me for an hour the night before over something that wasn't my fault, and I was in a particularly bad mood because of it. I figured diving into my work early would help keep my attitude in check. 

As I sorted the mail and halfway listened to Robin Meade bantering away on the giant flatscreen we had in the office, I realized that I wasn't alone. A blonde, middle-aged woman was hovering over me at my desk, silently staring at me.  Normally, the interns sat in the outer office and managed the flow of visitors, but as I was there before the Capitol was officially open, it was just me and the four walls. Or at least, it was supposed to be. 

I don't know how long she'd been standing there, but she had clearly been waiting for me to notice her. When I asked how I could help her, her expression grew rather dark and agitated, as though someone had flipped a switch. She raised one arm and started tugging at her ratty hair and humming, but didn't respond to me. I felt every fiber in my body inwardly groan in exasperation as I realized that this woman wasn't all there. I'd recently had a crazy visitor who lived in the district, barely spoke English, and didn't understand anything about national or state government pull some next level fuckery the week before, so between that and how irritated I already was, I was not in the mood for more nonsense. 

I cleared my throat, put on my best ""I'm only pretending to be nice to you so you'll vote for my boss in November"" grin, and again asked her how I could help her. It was then that I realized that I'd left the front door unlocked, and was now paying the price. I also noticed that the woman had a child's backpack with her. It was pink, had some girly things printed on it, and it was stuffed beyond its natural capacity. I kept one eye on my visitor and the other on the hand holding this fuller-than-full backpack.

I was sitting there looking at her cockeyed when she finally stopped humming and spoke. ""Yeah, my mom is up in the legal department, can I sit here and wait for her?"" I blinked and told her that I'd misheard her. She tried again. ""My mom has an appointment up in the legal department on the second floor, can I wait for her in your office?"" 

This is when the alarms started going off in my head. First, the state legislature doesn't have a ""legal department"". There is a legal division that houses the general counsel and his team, but they're set up in a building three blocks away, not on the second floor of the Capitol. There's nothing but legislative offices and support offices on that floor. There's also the chief of staff I'd been cruising in the office  directly below mine. I knew every inch of the second floor, so that was strike one.

Secondly, the ""legal department"" wasn't open. It wasn't even 8:00 a.m. yet, and given that we weren't in session, few staffers were at work before 9:30. The legal division supported us for the most part, and kept a similar schedule. 

Third, the ""legal department"" doesn't take appointments with random individuals, or really anyone, for that matter. When they weren't doing legislative research, reconciling bill drafts with current state law , or defending the legislature against lawsuits and other legal actions, they weren't doing much of anything besides talking to their friends on the legislative side.

I knew that this woman was a bit off and lying, and I told her that there wasn't any ""legal department"". She started pulling her hair again and hummed even louder, and so help me, I've never been so frightened by humming in my life. There was something menacing about it, especially with the way she glared at me and yanked at her scalp. Some of her ratty, thinning hair was already falling onto my desk. It slowly dawned on me that this woman wasn't just off her rocker. She was potentially dangerous, and I'd upset her by exposing her explanation for being in the building as a lie.

I suddenly remembered that we had a panic button that summoned the state troopers somewhere in the office. I tried to think of where it was and how I could get to it as I asked her again how I could help her. Every hair on my neck was standing straight up. She repeated her story about waiting for her mother, but now wanted to use the phone to call her. Specifically, she wanted to use my phone, which was on my desk as usual. 

""It's not charged, ma'am"", I lied. Someone chose that moment to send me a text, and my phone lit up like a Christmas tree. I just ignored it and kept smiling at her. I put on an even more pretend helpful tone and suggested that she speak to the troopers at one of the entrances. It didn't work on her. She stopped humming but kept glaring at me she broke into song. I can't remember all of the words, but her song was along the lines of wicked people being punished and included my first name, which was on my nameplate. I know better than to show fear in these situations, so I pretended not to notice her demented song and simply said, ""I'm sure the troopers can help you find your mother. Our office isn't open yet, so you can't stay here."" I got up and offered to walk her down to where the troopers were. 

For some reason,  this worked on her. She was still unhappy and very crazy, but she slowly backed out of my office. I followed her out to make sure she left. She walked backwards all the way to the front door, glaring and pointing at me until she was standing in the hallway. 

I locked the door immediately, and called the troopers to my office. 

If you think she just left, you're wrong. Our door was partly made of frosted glass, with a design in it that has exposed regular glass. She stood there staring at me through the frosted part and hummed until two troopers showed up to escort her out of the building.

I found out later that the woman had pulled the same shit at the Governor's office and four other legislative offices. She sometimes had luggage with her instead of the little girl's backpack she'd brought with her to my office. She actually bit an intern on the face, which had gotten her banned from the building, but she still showed up super early to avoid being detected. 

TL; DR version: A crazy woman showed up at my job and I had to be nice to her until I could kick her out of my office.

So creepy crazy lady who made up a reason to be in my office and serenaded me with a threatening song, let's not meet again. 

Bonus: When I was interning in D.C., a certain former Grey's Anatomy actor  called to speak to the congressman for whom I worked. He told me his name and that he was calling from Los Angeles, but I didn't put two and two together until I asked for the purpose of his call (we were required to ask that of everyone). He lost his shit on me, and it was then that I realized why his name seemed familiar. "

7bylb0,53,2017-11-09,BEING A TRUMP VOTER IN NYC [AN ESSAY] - BRING THIS TO THE TOP PEDES!,svenez20,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7bylb0/being_a_trump_voter_in_nyc_an_essay_bring_this_to/,"“You know that he voted for Trump, right?” I heard an acquaintance whisper offhandedly to some mutual friends. “Yeah and now he’s a total Nazi” another person said. The conversation immediately peaked my interest, making me wonder who this Nazi was. As I continued to listen in discreetly, it quickly became clear that the alleged Nazi they were referring to was in fact me. Although it rubbed me the wrong way, I didn’t immediately feel the need to butt in and defend myself. To the best of my knowledge, I didn’t Zeig Heil the mailman or button up my brown shirt while lathering my shaved head with salve cream (I actually have a lustrous head of curly hair), I didn't pull on my doc martens, or start stomping Jews as I walked down Wyckoff Avenue. In fact, like most individuals with triple digit IQ's in the 21st century, I absolutely detest the idea of Nazis and fascists...although they have been the subject of some of my favorite punk songs (i.e “Nazi Punks Fuck Off” By The Dead Kennedys and “New Aryans” By Reagan Youth). But the fact of the matter was that I wasn't a Nazi, despite these people making me out to be one. My real crime, as I later learned, was being a twenty-something year old conservative living in New York City.
 
It didn’t take long for me to realize that not everything is acceptable in New York City. If you are a non-binary, trans, woman of color, there’s a parade for you, there’s a tax credit for you somewhere. If you’re a socialist or worse yet, a communist, there are community organizations, meetings, and backyard barbecues for you. Hell…you can piss on the street and people will just look the other way, but if you’re a conservative in NYC, you better keep your mouth shut and your head down, because as a friend of mine recently said “No one values your opinion white man!"". I know, I need new friends. It was always my understanding that people from all schools of thought should be able to share their ideas among one another, in fact, that’s how a society should function, a commingling of different ideas and thoughts to be discussed. But as a conservative, or even a libertarian; a term that I have learned is more acceptable in NYC because it sounds like liberty, your opinion is not valued, and not welcomed. I think that it’s about time that liberal New Yorkers allow us to share in the same freedoms that they have been allowed and garner the same level of acceptance that we have given to them over the years, because at the end of the day, we’re all just a bunch of schmucks changing our underwear the second we get off the train on a 95-degree day. It's a simple request really, that someday, I can openly say that I’ve voted Republican for three election cycles, that I read National Review on occasion; not often (older republicans are very stuffy), without being shunned, called a Nazi, or being in danger. Yes…you heard that right, danger.
 
In June of this year, a Trump supporter wearing a Make America Great Again hat was attacked at a Brooklyn bar, his face slashed with a broken beer bottle resulting in serious damage that required reconstructive surgery. A few months earlier from that, a man wearing the same hat was attacked on a subway platform here in Harlem. Their crimes? Voting republican in a presidential election and taking pride in that fact. Apparently, the MAGA hat looks something like a swastika to most liberals. In fact, the way that most people in the city talk about Nazis, you would think that the third Reich had risen from the dead and we are currently at war with Germany. Even if we seriously took into account actual hate groups in the U.S., they would attribute to essentially 0% of the 62 million Trump voters. Don’t believe me? According to The Southern Poverty Law Center, there is an estimated 5000 to 8000 KKK members currently active in the nation, that’s .00002% of the total population or .00012% of those said Trump voters. To put that into perspective, the Cleveland Browns, who went 1-15 during the 2016 NFL regular season, still had an average audience attendance eight times higher than the largest hate group in the country. But I digress, we’re talking about violence here, right? Well simply being a conservative puts you in a risk category that I don’t think my very expensive freelancer’s health care would even cover. Just the mention of being pro-trump or conservative at a bar or out in public, runs you the risk of being verbally berated or worse yet, physically assaulted. This is why my small group of conservative friends talk in hushed voices while out in public, discussing the latest news stories and current events. God forbid someone passes by and hears you state your stances about immigration or welfare, and you'll immediately be a target, an enemy of the free world. They’ll get in your face, they'll accuse you of being ignorant, hateful, and dangerous, while ironically threatening you with violence. Once again, I’m not against open discussion, in fact I would love nothing more than to talk about differing perspectives without instantly being labeled a Nazi. At the very least, maybe they could listen to me for 5 minutes and then call me a Nazi? At least then we would be working towards some sort of compromise. But that’s never what happens, it usually escalates quickly, the same insults used, that “you don’t care about this, this, and that, you ignorant fuck”. I’ve heard it all, I’ve been physically threatened, and if it’s not happening in public, it happens in the workplace.
 
The art industry has historically been very liberal, and so it was no surprise to me, that when I began working in 2012, that my views in the workplace would not be very popular. In fact, any mention of politics is usually a good indication for me to put on my headphones, or take an unnecessary bathroom break, but for those circumstances when I can’t avoid this discussion, I usually just say that ""I’m not interested in politics"", which results in the “How can you not care about…” discussion. To be honest, if I worked a normal 9-5 job at a big ad agency, I would probably be protected by HR or some clause that says they can’t fire me because of my beliefs. But I am a freelancer, and so I jump around from company to company, at the mercy of whoever’s in charge. In general, a freelancer’s life is very different from a normal person's work life, one simple mistake, or looking at someone the wrong way, and you can kiss future paychecks from that company goodbye. To make matters worse, freelancing is for a lack of a better word, tedious. You cold email people with no responses, you do free jobs to get into bigger companies, and a lot of it is thankless, but when you finally build that relationship with a company, you will say, do, or act however they want you to in order to pay the bills. So when politics come up, I know that keeping my mouth shut might mean the difference between losing that connection or not. Most would think that this is an isolated incident, that every company I worked for couldn’t be like this…how wrong you would be. Out of the fifty plus places I’ve worked, 100% of them have been run by die-hard liberals who openly talk about abortions as if it’s the weather.
 
 I distinctly remember my first internship where I was working at a very big company well known in the commercial world. It was during the 2012 election season and everyday as I scrubbed the floors and served food to company execs, they would talk about how they couldn’t believe that Romney was even close to winning, that there couldn’t possibly be that many idiots in this country, but none here in New York, not in their office, just some country bumpkins in the south. It was only when the execs asked me who I voted for on election day that I stuttered. Maybe they thought I was just some nervous intern, or maybe that I was stupid, either would have been better than saying the truth. And so, I lied. I felt bad, but I knew better than to risk a future career with that company. Can you imagine if those execs asked me something that wasn’t about my political beliefs? What if they asked about my sexual orientation, my religious beliefs, or my income? As Linus said it best “There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin”. Worse than just getting fired from a company, would be getting blacklisted…yes this is a thing in the art industry. You rub some higher up the wrong way at a company and suddenly people will stop answering your emails. It’s all very incestual, but you learn how to get by, even if that’s being pressured into talking about politics. Over time I have learned that it’s a new type of McCarthyism and that it’s solely against conservatives. You can’t be fired for being black, queer, or fat, but if you voted for Trump, you can easily be boned. I’m not the only person I know that has to deal with this though, in fact I know plenty of other conservatives who keep quiet in the art industry. Some of these people are at very high positions at their company, some are Hispanic, or women, or gay, but what they fear most of all, is being judged for their political beliefs. So as long as you avoid it in public and at work, you should be ok. Dating on the other hand…
 
Dating is nearly impossible for an openly pronounced conservative in the city. Just try and go on match.com, the #1 dating site in the world. You narrow down your category search to a 5 mile radius around NYC, search for a female between the ages of 18-28, and check conservative. You’ll find all of 4 matches. I fuck you not…I found four matches. Change that search to fifty miles, age 28-38, and you’ll start to find some options, as long as you’re cool with kids and can drive out to Paterson New Jersey…also no cats. Dating in the city if you voted for Trump, is like running the 100 meter dash with your legs and arms tied behind your back, blindfolded. You’ll get there, but you’re going to have to crawl and it’s going to be painful. Over the years, although it’s not the best policy, I have found out that its helpful to refrain from talking about my political beliefs with girl's I’m dating until at least six months. Why six months you might ask? Well I believe that after six months, they’re either too comfortable to jump ship, or they’re probably already yelling at me for any number of reasons, and this will be a deciding factor if things are to continue forward. To this day I have kept this practice up with every girl that I have ever dated, each one taller than me, liberal, and vegetarian. The height and the meat eating were never factors, but if you voted for John McCain in the 2008 general election, it’s like telling them you’ve cheated on them. I remember when my girlfriend in college found out. We were waiting in line for breakfast in the mess hall and for some reason, I decided that this moment was the absolute best time to tell her. Maybe it was the way her blue eyes glowed in the sunlight as she looked at me that day, or maybe it was just that I trusted her enough to be ok with whatever I had to tell her. I think her response was and I want to quote this properly “What the fuck is wrong with you, you fucking retard!”. I remember sitting still, absolutely terrified, the word ""retard"" still echoing throughout the room, everyone dead silent…staring. I can only imagine what they were all thinking, what horrible, awful thing, I must had done to that girl. For the record, I have never lied to any of them, I just avoided the subject under duress and scrutiny.
 
Just the other day, I was on an online dating app, and I messaged a girl with an opening line about a Chuck Klosterman book, a great ice breaker for people who enjoy reading, right? We both had similar interests and we were both in Brooklyn, not to mention that she had a very cute profile picture. After sending my message, I got a reply an hour later, her response was as followed: “I just saw that you identify as conservative. Sorry but Gay rights, women’s equality, and the environment are social issues near and dear to my heart”. First off, the environment is not a social issue, secondly, what does being conservative have anything to do with not caring about gays, women, or the planet? The next time some liberal messages me, I could just as easily respond with “I just saw that you identify as liberal. Sorry, racial equality and civil rights are near and dear to my heart”. For those of you who don’t already know this, the democrats; since their founding in 1829, have fought against every civil rights initiative and has a continued a long history of discrimination including but not limited to: defending slavery, opposing reconstruction, imposed segregation, and fought the civil rights acts. But I don’t hold it against this girl, the narrative is that there’s no way I could care about any of those things. It’s not like I’ve ever marched in the Gay Pride Parade, or donated money to the World Wildlife Foundation, because that would be against the narrative that I’m racist, homophobic, anti-woman scum, wouldn’t it? I’m not asking any of these girls to marry me, I’m not saying to change their political views radically in order to align with mine, I think what it comes down to is understanding and accepting other people’s opinions, that we don’t have to agree on everything. Her favorite band might be The Rolling Stones and mine might be The Beatles, but that shouldn’t dictate a person’s worth, because we both still like rock and roll, right?
 
Throughout my life I have always surrounded myself with a diverse group of friends, people from all different backgrounds, and all walks of life. To me, it was something wonderful, something where I could expose myself to different ideas, culture, and differing perspectives on social issues and politics. It might have been naïve, but I thought that this open dialogue would continue when I moved to New York, and while it does for the most part, conservatives have specifically been forced out of the conversation. No longer can we walk into a bar and have a discussion without someone calling us racist, bigoted, Nazis, or threatening us with violence. No longer can we go to work without having to sweat over saying the right answer to a political riddle. Dating is probably a lost cause, but hey, if Lena Dunham can write an episode of Girls where she dates a black conservative, then I think people can grab a cocktail with someone from the opposite political spectrum. Over the years, the greater national conscience has shifted towards being very open minded, but as of recent, this is only true if you're an open minded liberal, the enemy of their progressivism is a conjured up boogieman known as conservatism. At the end of the day, both of these political stances are just different approaches to making this country a better place. I might hate Chuck Schumer and they might hate Paul Ryan, but is that any reason to have things come this far? That republican congressmen are being shot, for the riots at Berkley, or the rise of ANTIFA; an actual fascist group. My approach is simple, urban liberals should try and act like the open-minded individuals they say they are and to take a moment and listen to their conservative counterparts. If we all do this, maybe the real Nazi Punks will fuck off."
7byq7n,2,2017-11-09,How do I proceed in my situation?,csadviceforme123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7byq7n/how_do_i_proceed_in_my_situation/,"I'm looking for some wisdom from this sub right now. I graduated a year ago with a sciences degree and pretty much decided that I actually wanted to be a software developer. So right after graduation, I enrolled for comp sci courses and up till this past summer I have completed most of the lower division requirements. However the thing is, I'm not a comp sci major yet (I'm in the certificate program though) - I didn't have the competitive GPA requirement to get in and would probably have to spend a semester or two grinding it up.

Rather than doing that, I instead went for a bootcamp to get some development experience and projects under my belt. Overall, I felt like it was a really good decision. I learned a lot and now have a few projects to show. Some of my cohort mates already landed junior positions right out of bootcamp.

I feel like I still want to go back and do CS, which means I can really only be applying for internships rather than full time. But the problem is, most companies looking for interns are only looking for those in a 4 year degree program. What should I do in this situation? I've applied to a few places and have either been rejected or ghosted. How can I stand out or convince them to even give me an interview? Or have any of you been in a similar situation where you got internships without a relevant degree? I should also mention, I'm in Canada and am willing to relocate within NA for a role.

Thanks!"

For the past few months since then I have been looking for jobs. Whether it be I.T, Computer Science related or just Game Design I have applied in all technical fields. Before graduating, I tried my hands on getting internships but that didn't prove fruitful either. I have worked on side projects throughout college too. However when it comes to getting a job and all, they all tell me that I don't have enough experience. 

I have submitted my resume for review as well, and most people tell me, that for my level it seems fine (even though they also point out the lack of experience). I am starting to run out of places to look (I'm currently looking at state and county jobs at the assistant I.T. levels and hoping it gets me a job at least).

How do I stay motivated?  It would be great if some of y'all shared stories of your struggles as well.

Thank you all."

As a freshman I am trying to figure out a game plan for the next 4 years and what goals I need to meet in the time to come. I want to start as early as possible so I can learn and expereince as much as I can. I've already gone to 3 different banking seminars/forums this semester that my university has hosted just to experience how top level finance guys operate. I also plan to rush a business fraternity for the networking oppurtunities in the future. 

Anyways, I was wondering what are some things that I should be focusing on right now? I joined my schools investment group which will help with internship oppurtunities. What can I do to increase my chances of landing an internship? 

Also I will be going to breakfast/lunch events with banks and firms in the future to practice networking. I have an idea how networking works but would love to hear some tips.

I feel like this post is kinda all over the place but just looking for tips on how I can succeed early on. Thanks. 

Also if you have any recommendations of books about IB/Finance/Networking I would love to hear them. Networking especiialy. "

If I perform well enough, then through the summer as well.

The problem arises with balancing school work with the internship, since I have class 4 days a week.  They specifically said 20-30 hours a week at Workiva would be optimal.I'm worried about being stretched too thing between school and now work.

Even if I left each class on campus and headed to work at every moment, I would be at 16 hours a week..

1.) Should I consider dropping a class (which ideally would not set me back a semester) so that I can spend more time at the internship this spring?

2.) Should I be worried that they will rescind the offer I signed if I can only work 16 hrs/week?

3.)What is the best way to ensure I get brought back on this summer full time as an intern?"
7bz7bi,8,2017-11-10,"Transitioning from intern to full time at my MSP, how to negotiate salary?",Jimisacun,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/7bz7bi/transitioning_from_intern_to_full_time_at_my_msp/,"Asked this over at /r/personalfinance but figured I'd ask here too

I've been an ""intern"" at a small MSP for about 5 months ago. We have about 40 company clients and are steadily growing. I've been making $15/hour as an intern, and I'm the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happen to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I do mostly help desk work but also go to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 75% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field, or at least for my MSP. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week.
I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians"". There is not really a set in stone L1, L2, etc. I do both kinds of work

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000

As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?

or is this a reasonable offer for an MSP?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including, or if I shouldn't bother asking for more

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

(long)",Nothingtonamehere,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7c0bay/il_adultmalei_was_attacked_but_i_was_the_one/,"I will give as much detail as possible as this is ongoing, but I need some advice. First off the story as concise and accurate as possible. I was choked after a verbal disagreement. No threats were made during the disagreement it was just a heated conversation that the other participant couldn't handle and got physical. Without warning I was being choked. Knowing the person I gave them a chance to let go after about 3-5 second of being choked. I did not retaliate and they let go as I showed open palms during this incident. After they let go, however they were stilled upset and began to gallop towards me. Now to lay some context in place this person has been convicted of a felony and has been arrested multiple times for being violent. Once coming towards me he looked as if he was going to swing with his fists raised. I had no choice but to defend myself as the nearest exit was far enough away that running wasn't a choice. I did not hit the other person super hard (at least within my own personal opinion of how hard I can hit). I struck them twice in the face, however it was not enough and I got pummeled pretty hard for not going any harder. I was bit multiple times and I sustained other injuries. I was humiliated during the altercation as they spit tobacco on me when I was down defenseless. Anyways after the altercation I was asked to leave by a third party person who owned the property. Then I was begged me not to call the police. I have known these people for a long time and they have hurt me before... I am used to not calling the police. I have been the victim of abuse in so many ways since I was a young child by this person and many others that not getting the police involved was normal for me. Also, it has always been put in perspective that if I called the police this person would go to prison again and it would be my fault not theirs. At the time I still listened to them. I believed that it was my fault for their wrong doing. Any time I've been hit or verbally abused I've been lead to believe that it is my fault for being who I am. So... once they begged me not to call the police I didn't. I gathered my things and left the property. I did go to the ER to get the bite marks checked out. The police questioned me, but I was told to go separate ways and let it go so i denied to comment. 24 hours later I received a phone call from their county police station. This county has an interesting way of getting the whole story. Apparently the other party went to the police after asking me not to, so now I had this ""local"" warrant out for my arrest. The warrant was only allowed to be carried out in that specific county, and I live far away so they couldn't arrest me. The person then filed a civil order of protection. Fast forward to recently I fought the O.P. and won. It was denied in my favor. (i have no criminal history and the burden of proof was not given by the petitioner properly). However, promptly afterwards I was arrested and thrown in jail... (even the judge seemed confused as to why I was being arrested as no one told them this was going to happen apparently.. I may be wrong on this as it's speculation). they were going to book me for three days since there was a holiday or something. Luckily someone was looking out for me and had a last second bond set for me and I did make it out. I had to spend every penny so far that I have defending myself and to pay bond. The police refused to let my attorney be present during the time they asked me questions (I refused to answer anything). They also refused to let me make a phone call when I was in the jail cell. How were they able to arrest me without knowing the full story? The charges are from the states attorney. The charge is also incorrect as it states I am being charged for strangulation... In court during the O.P. hearing it was given information that I was the one choked. Why isn't this information being used? Why do the have a false charge? I have a clean record as I have never gotten in trouble. In fact I am a late college student who is doing internships and doing well in school. The states attorney is going charging me with a felony for something I was a victim of, let alone for it being my first suspected offense ever. This states attorney states on their linkedin and their webpage how they have a 91% conviction rate for all violent felony charges.  I have a decent attorney, but I am worried they aren't taking this seriously enough and I need to do some outreach work on my own. Would it be appropriate to seek help from a senator or house member? any organizations? Is there anything I can do...? Or do I sit still and just gamble on a 9% change of charges being dropped... I have evidence of my defense and what happened.

SIDE NOTE: This does not pertain to the main story, but another question I have. When being booked I was mocked by one of the police officers. When I was being asked questions like ""am I a homosexual, do I have suicidal thoughts, do I have medical problems""... This police office was saying yes to things like suicide and that I had mental health issues and that I am homosexual. There isn't any problem with people who have those issues, but I said no as he would say yes and laugh. What the hell? Oh and I had to watch videos, and sign documents on prison rape.... I wasn't aware that I was in prison yet. Really a garbage situations and I am pretty upset. Keeping it together though.  Thank you to everyone who reads my convoluted story. 

edit: is there any way to bump this?"

Note that this is not the O365ProPlusRetail version. So my guess is that it should work using the Professional Plus 2016 key from the partner portal, the activation assistant however tells me that ""this is not a key for Microsoft Office 2016""...

Does anyone have the same problem?"

(Regional mid sized -Midwest),SeePeeEh,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7c0nyf/would_i_benefit_by_staying_another_busy_season/,"I have my CPA and I’m about to finish my 3rd year at the end of December (which makes 3 busy seasons full-time, and one additional busy season as an intern, if it counts).

I’m considering leaving, however, I have a few concerns.

My firm is pretty awesome, but I HATE forced networking, and have no desire to become a salesmen or sell work. 
I also am not a big fan of busy season (despite not being as bad as Big 4... ours are like 60-70 hrs).
My biggest concern is that I made a deptartment change after my first year (audit &gt; tax), and have not really done a busy season as the senior who owns the engagement. Would I still go after senior roles?
I’m starting a family soon, so busy season, after hours networking, travel, etc. are going to be a no-go in the future.

Bonus question, what type of salary increase should I expect when leaving at my level? (Midwest, 63k currently)

So with all of that, would I gain a benefit by sticking around for another busy season?"
7c0ova,0,2017-11-10,I'm [22 M] in love with a girl [22F] who lives in a different county and she is on love with me but is afraid of the long distance relationship.,nomad995,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7c0ova/im_22_m_in_love_with_a_girl_22f_who_lives_in_a/,"So I met this amazing girl on a conference in my town. We're both recent graduates and in the same field. I told a friend there that she is amazingly beautiful and it turned out he already had gotten to know her so he took me to her and wingmaned like a pro. I'm not shy and I know how to talk to people and girls so the introduction went great. This girl was so stunning my hands went cold, I went cold. didn't know where I was. Spent the remainder of the conference just thinking of ways to leave a nice impression but that was it. I had no further plans wih her. But we ended up going as a group for drinks and her and I ended up alone drinking and talking most of the night. She spent the night at my place afterwards and I was so goddamn happy. I didn't want her for sex, nor was that my plan, I was just so in love with her that I wanted to spend every minute I had next to her. The next morning I had to leave town for another conference so we said our goodbyes and that was it.

However, one day later I coulnd't stop thinkin about her so I texted her and we met up aand had the most amazing date ever and all we did was just walk around and did silly little things and talk. She went back to her country after that date and I escorted her to the airport. We said we shouldn't complicate things so we would remain friends. 

Ever since then we have been texting every day, all day long and skyping and calling. She has been texting me even though she hates it usually and hasn't done it with any of the exes for the previous seven years. It's amazing, she is a dream come true for me. In every possible form. I am so happy, like the thought of her makes the sun appear. 

We have a tone of plans together. I am coming to visit her and see her a bit next week..we made plans to go next month together with some friends of hers to visit a few cities during the winter and we're making plans of backpacking together during the summer etc. A very important thing to menton is we're both planning to move to Madrid. So this was her dream and she said it would be amazing having me also there. And to me this was an amazing kickstart because I had grown a bit lazy and this is exactly what I need in my professional life and also on a personal level. This iw what I've been craving my whole life! She has just all around become an amazing inspiration because she is very hard working and I keep on working and getting rid of the laziness i had so that I could match her level. She inspires me with her example to do more and do better for myself. I love it and her influence!

So this all happened within the space of ten days, very intense and very short ammount of time. So she just accidentally slipped and said that we were together and at that moment obviously got scared. She told me honestly the next day that she is just afraid we are moving too fast and that she is really scared as she is not ready for a long distance thing (she broke up two months ago with a guy after two years and they were long distance, she told me how hard it is. She broke up with him cause she just knew they werent right in the end for each other)I told that I agree we should take things slowly (cause I just came out of the relationship too but i also want to do this right and really really just get to know every bit of her. I like her so much I would spend the next 10 years just talking and getting to know each other)and that of course i understand but i just asked her one thing and that is not to pull out and she said that she wouldn't. I was afraid of her pulling back out of fear. I get her fear ofc but we're gonna be seeing each other (in Madrid it wont be long distance anymore) and we are serious about each other, I can speak for myself atleast. 

She has had a lot of obligations in the last two days and was feeling really bad and even though she texted me all the time and right away replied, I just notice that there is a bit of a difference. I know she is just preoccupied with that stuff and worried a lot cause the stuff is about internships and moving but I'm worried of losing this amazing thing with her and her losing the interest in me...How should i behave and what should I do to best aid this relationship between us. Please help ^^

  **tl;dr**: I'm [22 M] in love with a girl [22F] who lives in a different county and she is on love with me but is afraid of the long distance relationship and I'm afraid that she might pull out. How do I prevent that?"

My school was organised in a way such that electronics, computer, software didn't separate until 1.5 years before graduation. 

My strong point were and still are mathematics and software. I usually had difficulty with practical electronics (I could chew through all the equations on exams and some projects but any thing beyond that was difficult to me). 

Any who, I started playing factorio about a year ago but I only seriously started playing seriously about a 2 months ago. About 3 months ago, I also started my final internship in a research institute. I am supposed to Data analysis but there is a small electro-mechanical system that needed fixing, a bunch of Arduinos and motors and sensors and stuff. I was asked to check out the code of the Arduinos. I was hoping that there would be some to help with the electronics. 

So I fix the code. I do the proper test for each component and write a more robust code. During the testing, I do some basic circuiting. So time comes to put all together and I realise that people that were supposed to help are not there or were not on the same wavelength. So I set up to putting the things. Firstly I noticed I had an easier time setting up different components. 

After burning a few components, I made some modification to the initial output, put some protection around the places that needed it. As I did this, I felt like I was using the part of my brain that I used while playing factorio. "

I've spent so much time and money to get a degree in electrical engineering. I applied for 100+ internship last summer and just got one interview.

I've done everything that I could, volunteered at various organizations, acquired more related skills during my free time, did two years of SAE building a formula car, only to work in retail getting harassed by rude customers in the summer.

What should I do with my future? I couldn't sleep last night asking myself that question. I can't sleep often, because I always wonder where I will be 5 years from now. I feel like a loser, I avoid people that I know in real life because they have good jobs related to their degrees.

Life is unfair. Some people have no clue what to do in laboratories or projects, and managed to get an engineering job just because they know someone in that company. I've built a formula car from scratch and no one even wants to give me a chance to work.

I really regret choosing engineering, I regret to be born. Only if I could create a delete button that would remove my existence. I saw a picture of myself when I was a baby last month and I cried, why do I have to be born in such a cruel world."

Shonda probably knows how she wants to end the series: Zola watching Meredith's tapes while Meredith is suffering from Alzheimer's, and Zola is an intern and someone comments how Meredith was a god. Except, Zola is very close with Mer, and you see that parallels of how Mer turned out to be a great mom as opposed to her relationship with Ellis. 

We might get a few episodes of Zola making her way around Grey-Sloan, and we see the dynamics of Meredith's Alzheimers, and their relationship. 

I think last nights episode was a foreshadow of that happening. 

I also think it's foreshadowing something happening with Sofia... That scene left me feeling uneasy.

7c2goe,2,2017-11-10,Negotiating salary for transiting from intern to full time at an MSP?,Jimisacun,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7c2goe/negotiating_salary_for_transiting_from_intern_to/,"Asked this over at /r/personalfinance but figured I'd ask here too

I've been an ""intern"" at a small MSP for about 5 months ago. We have about 40 company clients and are steadily growing. I've been making $15/hour as an intern, and I'm the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happen to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I do mostly help desk work but also go to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 75% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field, or at least for my MSP. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week.
I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians"". There is not really a set in stone L1, L2, etc. I do both kinds of work

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000

As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?

or is this a reasonable offer for an MSP?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including, or if I shouldn't bother asking for more

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting. You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

7c3fb4,6,2017-11-10,Bedingt Mitsprachebereit,Frankonia,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/7c3fb4/bedingt_mitsprachebereit/,"Der Bundeswehr geht es nicht gut. Wer hinter die Kulisse der Hochglanzbroschüren schaut, kann es kaum übersehen: Die Einsatzbereitschaft des Großgeräts ist katastrophal niedrig, der zusammengeschrumpfte Personalbestand kann die stetig wachsenden Aufgaben kaum mehr erfüllen. 

Eine Armee, in der sich Soldaten zuweilen Teile ihrer Ausrüstung lieber selbst kaufen, weil der Dienstherr nur minderwertige Ware anbietet, kann nicht im Sinne des Erfinders sein. Bedingt abwehrbereit sind die Streitkräfte allenfalls noch. Doch der Duktus der Schlagzeile, die einst die Spiegel-Affäre auslöste, lockt heute kaum noch jemanden hinter dem Ofen hervor. Dabei dürfte es um die Einsatzbereitschaft der Bundeswehr momentan wohl noch schlechter stehen als 1962. 


**Die Bundeswehr als Fremdkörper in der Gesellschaft** 


Gewiss: Mittlerweile ist eine Trendwende in Sicht, der Verteidigungshaushalt steigt wieder und wird angesichts der amerikanischen Forderungen wohl weiter steigen müssen, wenn unterfinanzierte Streitkräfte außenpolitisch nicht zur Belastung werden sollen. Dass die Bundeswehr nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges personell und materiell verzwergte, mag angesichts der weltpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen nicht überraschend sein. 

Das eigentliche Skandalon ist freilich, dass dies so geräuschlos geschah. Wo blieb eigentlich der Protest der Bundeswehrführung gegen einen Spar- und Reformkurs, der ihrer Organisation den Boden unter den Füßen wegzog? Wo waren die Stimmen der Generalität, die zumindest aufklärten, die warnten, die deutlich machten, wie sehr die Streitkräfte zu einem Schatten ihrer selbst verkamen? Natürlich waren einzelne Stimmen immer mal wieder zu hören. Gert Gudera protestierte 2004 als Heeresinspekteur auch öffentlich so heftig, dass er in den vorzeitigen Ruhestand geschickt wurde. Doch sein Fall blieb die große Ausnahme. Intern wird es sicher Kritik und Widerstand gegeben haben. Nach außen drang aber wenig, weil die Generalität der Berliner Republik weder in der Politik noch im öffentlichen Diskurs nennenswert präsent ist. 

Dies war freilich von Anfang an so gewollt. Bei Gründung der Bundeswehr war die Skepsis gegenüber dem Militär groß. Es sollte eingehegt, kontrolliert und vor allem von jeder politischen Mitsprache ferngehalten werden, wurde behandelt wie ein Fremdkörper in der Gesellschaft. So ist es auch nicht weiter verwunderlich, dass kein General je Verteidigungsminister wurde und lediglich zwei – Karl Schnell 1977 und Jörg Schönbohm 1992 – es bis zum Staatssekretär im BMVg brachten. Ähnlich bescheiden sieht es mit anderen politischen Karrieren ehemaliger Generäle aus. 


**Aktive Generäle spielen sicherheitspolitisch keine Rolle** 


Die Einhegung funktioniert bis heute gut. Dabei geht es nicht nur um das Fernhalten von der Politik. Noch wichtiger ist vielleicht, dass die aktiven Generäle im außen- und sicherheitspolitischen Diskurs praktisch keine Rolle spielen. Gerade in Zeiten wie diesen, in denen Krisen und Konflikte die Weltordnung erschüttern und unsere liebgewonnenen Ordnungssysteme zunehmend infrage stehen, benötigen wir die Expertise der Generalität. Wir Zivilisten mögen mit historischem oder politischem Wissen die Konflikte dieser Zeit mehr oder minder intelligent kommentieren. Was wirklich in Syrien, im Irak oder in Mali vor sich geht, wie die militärische Stärke Russlands einzuschätzen ist, welche Fähigkeiten eine Bundeswehr der Zukunft benötigt, können militärische Experten naturgemäß viel besser beurteilen. Nur leider tauchen diese in den einschlägigen Medien nicht auf. Das Verteidigungsministerium zieht es vor, im Zweifelsfall den Bundeswehrverband vorzuschicken. Das wäre in etwa genauso, als ob Arbeitsministerin Andrea Nahles ihre Politik immer durch ver.di erklären ließe. Jedem ist bewusst, dass Militärs an Geheimhaltung und an die Loyalität zur politischen Führung gebunden sind. Die Mitwirkung an der öffentlichen Debatte muss daher sicher ihre Grenzen haben. Und dennoch: Die rund 200 hoch bezahlten Spitzenbeamten der Besoldungsgruppen B6 bis B10 sollten ihre Expertise in den öffentlichen sicherheitspolitischen Diskurs einbringen. Und dies auch deshalb, weil es andere Experten, die diese Rolle ausfüllen könnten, kaum gibt. 


**„Maulkorberlass“ des Verteidigungsministeriums** 


Konfrontiert man Generäle mit dieser Forderung, wird dies unter Verweis auf den Primat der Politik meist brüsk zurückgewiesen. Dies sei schließlich nicht ihre Aufgabe. Einen überbordenden Drang der militärischen Elite, ihre Stimme in einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit oder gar in der Politik zu erheben, wird man nicht attestieren können. Fairerweise muss man sagen, dass dies auch gar nicht gewollt ist. Der aktuelle „Maulkorberlass“ des Verteidigungsministeriums ist dafür ein beredtes Beispiel. Die Militärs sollen diszipliniert werden. Sie sollen sich eben nicht äußern. Das geht in der Praxis dann so weit, dass es in der Bundeswehr noch nicht einmal eine intellektuell anspruchsvolle Fachzeitschrift gibt, die dem Offizierskorps als Diskussionsforum dienen könnte. Die Schlussfolgerung aus dem Gesagten ist klar: Allen voran die Verteidigungsministerin sollte ihre Spitzenmilitärs nicht nur als Funktionselite begreifen, die schweigend Befehle ausführt, sondern deren Wissensund Erfahrungsschatz in einem vertretbaren Rahmen auch in wichtige gesellschaftliche Debatten einfließen müsste. Und den Generälen möchte man zurufen: Ihr seid die Experten und ihr habt als solche auch eine öffentliche Verantwortung!

7c41uy,7,2017-11-10,Projects for Computer Systems Analyst/Security Analyst positions,crackerjackshot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7c41uy/projects_for_computer_systems_analystsecurity/,"Hello all,
      I am an undergrad computer science major at CU Boulder.   I still have over a year and a half left for my degree to be finished but am already thinking about when I get out and the job search.   Something that I have come to realize from my schedule is that I will have little if any time for an internship which I know can be a big help in this field.   So I want to work on some individual projects before I graduate to have stuff to show people, and I think it could be fun.   

My question is what kind of projects would be the most relevant for somebody who is interested in going into either computer systems type of positions or hopefully(but possibly not straight out of school since they all want experience) security analysts or any kind of security positions?   What would appear valuable to these kinds of positions?   I know if you want to be a dev then building apps and programs is a good way to go but I don't believe this is really the most relevant here.  Also, it doesn't seem like many of the people around me like systems and aren't interested in going that route so I don't hear many ideas.   

What I'm hoping to get out of this post is just a list of either fun (and relevant) projects some of you might have done, or want to do.  Also, maybe a good starting point, and shove in the right direction towards the information I need to get started would be extremely helpful.   Thank you for everyone's time.

7c4fd7,90,2017-11-10,Something happened in the woods,HB_CamTech,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7c4fd7/something_happened_in_the_woods/,"Howdy Reddit, I work as a camera technician for a ghost hunters esque tv show yet to be released which is going to be centered around some supposedly haunted forest in Eastern Europe. I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t reveal the name of the program for legal reasons and of course I’ll change all the names, but I promise everything that happened in this post is from my own experience.

I would like to preface by saying that this story isn’t nearly as interesting as some of the others I’ve seen from my cursory glance of this subreddit, and yet I still don’t feel well at all thinking back on last week. I was originally planning on forgetting about this but after a quick long distance call to my therapist, I’ve learned that writing all this out may make me feel a bit better. Since I’m writing all this from a motel with god awful WiFi, sorry if this shows up at a real late hour, you know ‘cause of time zone differences and all that jazz. But I digress, let’s get to the juicy stuff. Let’s get to what you came here for.

On the first day of filming prep, Me and the crew arrived at a small, crowded airport. The shows producer, director, and star (we’ll call him Rob) decided to shove past me because he felt he had to be first to the luggage. I’m almost sure I heard him muttering something under his breath about how these are “untrustworthy people” and that he didn’t want any of them “swiping his luggage”. I personally felt a little embarrassed to be seen with this guy in public. Me and the rest of the film crew complacently waited for the luggage belt to become less congested and we were on our way.

The first order of business was to get some grub. We stopped off at a cute little cafe where an infuriatingly pleasant elderly couple made us some pretty tasty sandwiches. Our editor (I’ll name her Caroline), struck up a conversation with the couple which I understood pretty much none of. There I sat, thinking about how much work I had put into my high school Spanish classes all to be stuck in verbal darkness for what could possibly be the next 6 months of my life. It’s funny how things hardly ever turn out the way they need to, and nobody bats an eye at any of it, at how horrible things happen and we’re just expected to climb over the newly planted hurdle in our path.

Other than that lunch was nice.

By the time we finished eating it was around 5ish, and our sleep deprived selves were exhausted. After checking into the motel I’m currently writing from, we each trudged up to our respective rooms and got settled in for the night. I turned the radiator on and put my sheets over it to warm them up. While I waited I realized how close this motel actually was to the forest. The sun was beginning to set and in the distance I saw it’s iconic figure. I could see why locals were afraid of this place, a great sickly dark green mass of uncertainty where people feel just a hint of their primeval instincts, attempting to keep them safe and scared in the face of uncertainty. Why are places like this so innately terrifying. We fear lions because their ancestors were our enemies in humanities vulnerable stages, but there’s something so specially unnerving about these wooden spires, adorned with long, slender growths tipped with soft, fleshy green. 

The sheets were probably done. I was putting them back on the bed while spacing out into the forest. I noticed what I assume were the headlights of a car, bobbing between the trees. The lights were mesmerizing, and they were gone. That night, I dreamt.

I am stumbling 
out of the woods towards the town, 
it’s early morning. 
My stomach.
My belly was sick
Sick 
with someone else’s blood.
There is something 
I’m running from from
Something 
Oh god, I've misbehaved haven’t I

And I was in my bed again. Grateful I was free from that distress. Time to film.

We all crowded into our rental van and made our way it of town. Buildings fell away into farmland which itself eventually devolved into a simple, rural landscape. I looked ahead and saw it quickly approaching, that looming congregation of trees hiding anything and everything beyond their thick wooden mess. Thick, brown, calcified cylinders tangling their long fingers and reaching up into the cosmos.
We parked our car on the edge of the woods, grabbed our equipment from the trunk, and began our trek. First off, they had me set up some tripod cams. I began placing them in miscellaneous areas of our path. I set one next to our van looking in on the woods, one looking down a hiking trail, and the final camera placed in front of some old shack Rob would say is a “paranormal hotspot” to the audience. Along we these, all the actors carried cameras with them. By the time all that was done it was getting pretty dark and we decided it was time to get filming. Caroline retreated back to the van where she had equipment set up to watch all the camera feeds remotely. The rest of the group and I wandered deep inside.

“Rolling”
“Hey there all you paranormal enthusiasts! Tonight, we’re gonna make supernatural history!”
“A bold claim, Rob”, I muttered to myself from behind the camera, as the sun was slowly masticated by the gluttonous trees.

Filming went as planned for the next two hours or so, with Rob and his unpaid interns reacting  to the smallest snap of a branch like an underpaid B-horror movie actor. And then we found it, the clearing. Somewhere in the middle of the woods, this perfect circle with absolutely no trees, no foliage, not even any weeds. The treeline stopped abruptly at the edge. Maybe out of reverence, maybe out of fear.
Upon entering the clearing I immediately felt car sick. I had to focus on my footsteps solely to keep from throwing up. Even Rob wasn’t his charismatic self. No commentary. Just a wide eyed tension, as if he was walking through a minefield, and a foot in the wrong place could lead to instant, thoughtless, obliteration. We stopped in the middle of the circle. I waited for Rob to start back up with his talking, 

but he didn’t,
None of us did.

That's when the camera detected motion.
The camera.
The one I had set up looking in on the woods. The feed showed absolutely nothing and yet all of us were glued to the screen. Now cam two.
Again nothing. Nothing. Cam three. Nothing.

Wait.
My heart sank as I realized the camera was focused in now on a different location than before, on for figures huddled together around some lights in a clearing.
On us.
I hesitantly looked up into the woods, the sliver I still had of my primal self whispering for me not to. I made eye contact with the trees.
Silence.

*BWEEEEEE*

Oh god.

One of the interns tries to silence the feedback coming from their walkie-talkie.
EEEEEEEEEEE
Rob starts yelling at the intern to turn it off. He stands up quickly, accidentally unplugging and knocking over nearly all of our lights and equipment.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
My flashlight begins rolling along the ground and almost barely lighting up something in the distance.
An intern begins having an asthma attack.
What is it!
What the hell is it!


Pale

Then the earth swallowed Rob. 

I scrambled for the flashlight and shone it on where he stood. Just a hole. A perfectly circular hole. Shining the light down it, I found Rob, clinging to the edge with trembling white fingers. I helped him out and made sure he was doing alright while the intern finally just took the batteries out of the walkie-talkie. He had some minor scratches but other than that he was fine. The hole must have been nearly invisible to us in the dark. Rob managed to stutter out that he thinks he dropped his camera down there. I shone a light into the hole. The sides were completely smooth, definitely not made from the same material. The hole stretched so far down I couldn’t see the camera. Luckily we had a live feed going to Caroline’s Laptop in the van.

The walk back seemed to drag on for hours and we all gave a collective sigh of relief upon seeing the van through the trees. I explained everything that happened to Caroline who didn’t seem much up for discussion as she looked equally as pale as the rest of us.
The drive back to the motel was done in a solemn sort of silence. We all muttered our respective good nights to each other and went up to our rooms.
I was rather exhausted and managed to fall asleep without even talking my clothes off.
Yet another dream.

I’m in town
No one else
I’m guilty
I hear my mother 
call to me
It’s not her

I woke, rolling over to the alarm clock on the dresser.

4:00 AM

I tried to swallow and found my throat bone dry. I got up and walked out of my room to the ice machine at the end of the hall. I saw light streaming out from under Caroline’s door. She was reviewing and editing the footage. I made my drink and fell back to sleep. In the morning we all clamored into Caroline’s room to review the footage. She was obviously sleep deprived, after all she had been reviewing that footage all night. Caroline put her laptop on a small coffee table and we all gathered around it with food out chairs. She began clicking a pen nervously as she explained how some of the footage wasn’t usable because the data got corrupted. Rob grave her a dirty look as if it was her fault. She started pulling up the footage and we all began peering into the small screen. The clicking stopped and I noticed red in the corner of my eye.
A small circle of blood was pooling on the table around Caroline’s fidgeting hands.

“Um, Caroline, I think you’re bleeding.”
She looked down at her shaking hands. She had pushed the pencil about an inch into the palm of her left hand. I got a napkin and one of the interns got some bandages from downstairs as the blood began to drip off the table and onto the carpet.

We decided not to finish watching the footage.

I guess that takes us to me writing this right now. I hope you guys found my distress fun to read about and please let me know if you wanna hear what happens after we continue filming next week.

I am an IT intern doing basic desktop support. I've been an intern for 6 months now and they don't have any desire to let me leave, yet also no idea to when I transition from intern to employee. One of our main admins who dealt with the communication and phone systems left without notice and we have a bit knowledge hole in our department. People are tying to pick up where he left and take on more responsibilities, yet no one has touched any of the voip or phone systems he worked on. I was wondering if it would be alright if I asked my boss if I could help tackle some responsibilities in this area to help out. Some of our tech we use is Ice call center and plantronics phones/skype for business. I'm not asking to become the next communications admin, but just to help hold down the fort and get some new experience in till they can hire a new full time admin (their main plan at the moment). Would this be a bad thing to ask for and to have possible training as an intern? Thanks."
7c4ks0,8,2017-11-10,My drug addicted father is constantly taking advantage of me. I need some advice.,KTK_Pups,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7c4ks0/my_drug_addicted_father_is_constantly_taking/,"To give some background, my parents have been using drugs for the majority of their lives. When I was born, things slowed down until I was about 10, and then my grandmother moved out. She was their source of income to pay the bills in the house, so now it was up to my parents to become responsible human beings. Well, they failed me and themselves, because they continued to get deeper into heroin and prescription medication. I suffered with them for 8 years until I went to college in the fall of 2015.

Fast forward December of 2016. I had to move back in with them for a variety of reasons. They are in a completely different house than before. My dad kicked my boyfriend and I out onto the street with my dog as a scare tactic to get me to beg for his forgiveness. This happened in late May of this year. Boyfriend had moved in a month earlier to complete an internship at his college but soon realized how toxic the situation was and had to quit pursuing it. We went to a hotel and got our own place, which is where I am at now.

Dad is still trying to get me to come out there to rescue them from being homeless. After the charade he pulled in my car (he jerked the wheel while I was driving and almost got us killed because of an argument we were having, this is also why he kicked us out), I am scared of him, but I am also worried about my other dog and the two cats he has there.  I also have a decent relationship with my mother and i am worried about her too. I am worried I'm not doing the right thing.

I guess what I am asking for are some words of advice from people who are not involved. I feel responsible for them for some reason. I feel manipulated and taken advantage of. Everyone tells me to stay away, but some part of me is broken because I feel like I should help.

Tl;dr - parents are both drugs addicts and are constantly pulling me back in to help them after I've moved away several times. According to them, they are facing homelessness right now and need my help. I don't know what to do or how to feel.

EDIT: Thank you everyone who has replied so far. I really appreciate the advice to go to a support group. I have had counseling but it never seems to help, so I am wary of it. I don't know if cutting them out of my life really is the best option. I love my mom and she has always been there for me. No matter what I do to try to get her out of this situation, all efforts fail. But I feel like I shouldn't give up on her. My sociopathic father, yes, but what about her?"

One of the internship has minimum wage pay but the work seems interesting and their is a good social aspect to it (i.e weekly football, social outings, poker etc...). I have asked people who did the internship here before and they all enjoyed it and recommended it. 

The other offer is another place with interesting work. However the pay here is noticeably a lot more than the other internship. It is however further away, I have to get 2 buses to get to, so add another 20-30 mins to my trip as opposed to the first one. Not sure about the social aspect of it and havent found anybody who has done an internship here for a review.

So my question is what internship should I choose? I'm kind of torn between the two. Many thanks in advance"
7c5gmp,2,2017-11-10,Graduating on Time / More Internships,throwaway123cs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7c5gmp/graduating_on_time_more_internships/,"So a little background. I interned at a startup and a big-4 company already. I recently got an offer to work at a major and established unicorn / big N (that will IPO soon) and at another big-4 job (different one), and I'm having trouble deciding which one I should take. It was advised to me to take both (back-to-back in the summer and in the fall), but I feel like at this point I should just graduate and just choose one summer internship. I've already missed an entire school year doing internships during the school year, and taking another semester off to deal with mental-health issues, further delaying my graduation.  I also don't feel like my resume needs more padding, and I'm also afraid that I'll be missing out if I don't go full-time earlier. I also feel uncomfortable that it would delay my graduation again, and I would have graduated from a bachelor's six years after I started.

I guess I'm wondering what people's opinions are about taking a long time to graduate when you're already a year older than everybody else you came in with (I took a gap year), whether or not it's worth it to take an internship if the sole reason is that I'm not sure which company to work for and scared that I will regret a decision. I'm also seeking opinions on whether or not it matters if I started working full-time 4 months later than initially intended, and if a company will retract my offer if I do graduate 4 months later than initially mentioned"

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
7c5tyh,3,2017-11-10,Anyone know any SV companies that hire college grads as interns? Please help!,CS_deeznut,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7c5tyh/anyone_know_any_sv_companies_that_hire_college/,"Hey everyone,

I'm fairly new to reddit, but I've spent a good chunk of my past couple weeks on this sub and have gotten some great advice from you all. So thank you. My situation might be similar to those of you out there, so I thought I might share and hopefully others can also benefit from this. 

I originally studied Biology at mid-tier UC (UCSB, UCD, or UCI) before switching to CS at the end of my third year because I was unsure if I wanted to go the medical school route and my entire family lineage has never worked in an industry that is not engineering. 

Truth be told, I disliked CS with a passion because I wasn't used to having to actually produce results, where in bio, I just studied the night before and kept a 3.5, and I sucked because I didn't put the time into it. Fast forward, I finished all my CS courses to graduate by the end of my 5th year. Because I switched in late, I was taking a lot of classes out of order and did what I had to do to pass my classes without going insane (piggyback off my classmates for assignments - surprisingly I did better on the exams than classmates almost every time). I graduated this summer, and during my first round of applications, I only heard back from two companies, both of which were through referrals. I also knew I sucked ass at programming or anything technical/CS related and was applying because I was otherwise going to be sitting on my ass doing nothing. I was lucky to get a couple interviews but low and behold, I f***ed both of them up (one with Big N and another decent company). It sucks because those were good opportunities, but I also am thankful because I won't have any fear going into future interviews.

I have since turned things around, and I actually realllly enjoy computer science (it really has only been about a month/month and a half). I've attended a hackathon and learned JavaScript (and other stuff) because I want to make apps with ideas coming from ways I can improve my life that is not already offered or done in other apps (and to not only be proficient in python). 

I was wondering..do any of you know actual companies who are willing to take on graduates as interns who didn't have the opportunity to do internships while in school? I have a ton of leadership experience but no professional/tech experience.

Thanks in advance :)"

No Level System - NOC Tech for a midsized national microwave radio manufacturer and network provider for about 6 months. Heavy ticketing and customer support duties. 4. Advanced IT support/solutions tech for one of the world's leading multinational IT companies for about 1.5 years. Supported all PC platforms, all mobile, and many complicated internal systems. Three month rotation with security operations team. (This was an autonomous full time term-limited role with a purpose similar to an internship.)

The general saying is that, 


""The big 4s do not distinguish between positions! They will hire a Software Engineer; which by definition will mean they're smart enough to work in other fields also!""

Although there are various traditional methods available, today through this post, let's shed some more light on a well established form of therapy that is primarily used in Europe and U.S.A but is slowly but surely gaining importance in India.

Dance Movement Therapy.

Like any other expression based therapy, Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) is based on the idea that an individual will express himself/herself openly in an environment that is supportive and nurturing and this in turn will help promote healing. 

Dance Movement Therapy finds its origins through the work of Marian Chase. Chase is regarded as the pioneer of DMT and was professionally a dance instructor. It was in her dance school that she noticed the positive effects of dance on her students. She noticed that for her them, dancing was more than just a series of body movements combined together. It was more of an outlet for expressing themselves and their feelings. After further continuing her study at the Washington School of Psychiatry, Chase was able to lay the foundations of modern day Dance Movement Therapy. One of the most important contributions by Chase was the creation of the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA), an organization dedicated to the cause of DMT.

Dance Movement Therapy as it is known today started shaping into place towards the end of the 20th century when therapists began using dance as a means of therapy. It was at this time that Dance Movement Therapy gained acknowledgement as a method of psychotherapy.

SO WHAT IS DMT?

The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA), defines Dance Therapy as ""Psychotherapeutic use of movement to further the emotional, cognitive, physical and social integration of the individual based on the premisr that the body, mind and soul are connected.""

It is a form of therapy that uses body movements as a key factor to understand expressed and communicative behaviour. The basic premise of the therapy is to free the repressed emotions and feelings that are stuck inside the body and mind and are causing problems. When repressed emotions or unresolved trauma gets stuck inside the body, it leads to problems and DMT aims at targeting these emotions to form the basis of assessing the individual and coming up with a suitable intervention plan. There will often be certain barriers in verbal therapy sessions that prevent one from completely opening up and expressing, which is where DMT targets the underlying deep emotions, based on the idea that movements reflect an individual's pattern of thinking and feeling.

DMT therapists believe that the mind and body are interconnected and any change in the emotional state of an individual results in a positive or negative effect on the body. The negative effects can be seen through illnesses, negative expressions, unbalanced emotions, impaired movements etc.

A DMT session usually makes use of stages. Preparation is the first stage and it makes use of warming up the body to reduce risk of injury. Incubation is the next stage where the focus is on creating an internal environment through verbal instructions by the therapist. This helps to create a relaxed and comfortable session. The next stage is the Illumination stage where through talking to the individual, one learns what different movements mean and what they actually exhibit. It helps to showcase how the negative and positive effects are impacting the individual. The last and final stage is Evaluation which involves a share and feedback activity based on the occurrences of the session to share insights and move towards the end of the session.


WHAT DANCE STYLE DOES A DMT SESSION USE?

The dance style used in a sessions largely depends on the people participating in the session. Many dance styles such as freestyle, yoga based, Latin dance styles, ballroom dances, etc are used. The dance style depends largely on the needs of the individual or the group participating in the dance. Therapists can make use of improvised dancing along with having the participants follow a choreographed section.


WHO CAN GO FOR A DMT SESSION?

The answer to that is simple. Anyone can attend a DMT session. From adults to children, DMT can be beneficial for all. It is particularly useful for anyone facing emotional distress, unresolved trauma, victims of abuse, when dealing with loss or sudden acceptance of chance, prolonged health and mental problems, learning disabilities, speech disabilities , attention span deficits, depression, inability to express oneself verbally, bodily problems that restrict movement such as arthritis, ageing etc. It can also be useful for someone who wants to improve their self awareness and communication skills. It is also a helpful outlet for stress reduction and mode of relaxation.

DMT is practised at various set ups such as mental health care facilities, private nursing homes and clinical set ups, medical set ups, rehabilitation centres, education set up such as schools and colleges, residential treatment set ups etc.


WHAT ARE THE BENFITS OF DMT?

1. DMT makes use of complete integration of the mind and body through various brain functions and body movements to create a complete body and soul experience.

2. It combines usage of multiple areas of the brain simultaneously rather than only activating one part thereby increasing cognitive and physical recovery.

3. It helps in enhancing interpersonal relations through increasing self awareness, creating trust, reducing anxiety, establishing and enhancing boundaries etc.

4. Dmt helps in releasing repressed emotions and acts an outlet for the release without actually having to talk about it.

5. Anyone can take up DMT. This helps boost confidence and increase self-esteem and reduces complexes.

6. It is particularly helpful for children with various learning disabilities, memory related issues, slow development, hearing impaired, speech related issues, anxiety and trust issues, attention deficits etc,

7. It is an effective method of undercovering abuse and trauma, especually in children.

8. It helps increase the connection between thoughts, feelings and emotions.

9. It promotes mental and physical health by aiding in relaxation and stress reduction.

10. It helps in increasing not only psychological benefits but also physiological benefits such as flexibility, reduced body ailments, reduced muscle tension, increasing body circulation etc.

11. As it does not require any prior experience of dancing, and explicit coordination skills, it is advantageous to one and all.

12. It is particularly useful for anyone suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.

Although there are only a few advantages listed above, there are many more to Dance Movement Therapy.


SO CAN ANYONE CONDUCT A DMT SESSION?

As simple as the idea of dancing sound, it is actually not that easy to facilitate. One has to be a certified DMT therapist to be able to fully understand body movements, interpret the language of emotions and help form a structured intervention program that will actually benefit the individual. It is crucial to understand body movements, motions, emotions, non verbal gestures to help the individual achieve emotional, cognitive, physical and social integration. The therapist will also observe the individual as to how he/ she communicates and reacts to other individuals in a group setting. They will also observe how you sue and react to the various props that are used during the session.

There are two registered courses for a dance therapists.

The R-DMT, Registered Dance Mmovement Therapist has the basic level of training as put forward by the ADTA. They also require a masters degree and a minimum of 700 hours of supervised clinincal internship. They can conduct dance therapy sessions in a clinical or educational setting.

The BC-DMT, Board Certified Dance Therapist has completed the basic and advanced levels of training as put forward by the ADTA. They have also succesfully passed the qualifying examination and over 3000 hours of supervised clinical internship. They are qualified to conduct dance therapy in their own private practice setting along with acting as supervisory therapists that provide training.

Dance Therapy is one of the most advantageous therapies that is gaining importance in India as it is beneficial to one and all. It not only helps to aid in healing and promoting wellbeing but only helps in overall enhancement of the total physical and mental framework of an individual. Awareness and interest at a large scale level is needed today to propel DMT into the league of traditional mental health therapeutic methods followed in India but slowly but surely, the times are changing."

Here is a story about first “real” job after having finished my university degree within finance and management. 

Please comment and ask some critical questions to help me reflect on the situation I got into. 

Also I would like to know how to sell myself in the future. 

My entry to the company

In August 2016 I started to work in a larger European diary company and started in the Scandinavian headquarter in Stockholm that is responsible for the product milk. Julius and Romeo hired me as an intern. Julius is the CEO of the business unit and is a very confident man with a MBA from Harvard. In his unit he had Romeo to lead the project department, this for example entails to take ideas and make them market ready. 

A year ago, Romeo received the assignment to make one idea market ready and he hired me as an intern so support him in the process. In the beginning of my entry I felt very excited because Romeo enabled me to being an entrepreneur in larger conglomerate. He had an endless backlog of tasks and I received the mandate to solve them solely. By that I mean tasks such as developing a go-2-market strategy, developing product requirements, developing the value proposition and doing pricing. 

Also the supervision was extremely well organized. In the beginning Romeo and I had brief but very frequent talks in order to align. This was very helpful because we both needed to build trust. After a month or two I was so deep in the project that I did not require so much supervision anymore so Romeo trusted me to drive the business development of the product. Through Romeo I received great reputation in the business unit and Julius also started to give me some lightweight tasks that I mastered. 

My internship however was limited to a specific time period. Romeo and I had few good talks about my future, and he hoped that I would continue in the company. 

As such I was not reluctant to stay in the company as I had a great time and enjoyed the both Julius and Romeo as they were excellent boss’s. However I wanted to move to Copenhagen to go back to my friends and girlfriend. 

Luckily we had an operational site in Copenhagen, both Julius and Romeo talked with the local director in Copenhagen and they gave me the opportunity to start in Copenhagen.

The transfer to Copenhagen

In February 2017 Niklas the local director hired me.  I received the task to continue on the business development of the product that worked on in Stockholm and to work on some corporate development tasks. That meant that I closely with the sales department looked into sales targets and strategic partners. Together with one sales manager we created meetings with top clients and interesting partners for the product. 

Having talked to Romeo, he was very excited. He loved that the Danish operational site created a good outlook for his project. 
Furthermore, I started to work on the corporate development project. I have a finance degree that means I had the theory in place however I looked for some guidance from Niklas to get start this project.  

However a few months after I started Niklas started to neglect giving me the guidance and whenever he looked over it I received bad feedback. I checked with other financial analysts in the company and they actually liked my work. Additionally Niklas blocked any further development on the business development of the product even though Romeo and Julius loved the progress. 

8 months after I started at the Danish operational site I got fired due to mismatch between me and Niklas. I learned a few days afterwards that Romeo and Niklas hate each other and feels that I have been in the middle of a political battleground.

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to play an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

7c9jxw,14,2017-11-11,Taking a HackerRank assessment as part of the interview?,bert_cj,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/7c9jxw/taking_a_hackerrank_assessment_as_part_of_the/,"Hey guys I had an interview for a firmware engineering internship. After the hr screen they asked me to take a HackerRank assessment, in C. The position requires knowledge in Embedded programming and I was told the assessment would be modified based on what level of knowledge they think we should have based on the courses we have taken. 

My question is has anyone taken a programming test for an embedded programming position? Im not sure whether I should expect basic programming algorithm questions or embedded programming questions, both? I have only taken programming 1 &amp; 2 which were C and Java, C++ and data structures, and one Microcomputer Systems 1 course. What should I expect?

Oh and does anyone have experience with HackerRank assessments from a company? Thoughts on these? Thanks"

I'm not sure what the best option for me, I live in Canada and I've never went to university due to depression 


Like everyone else my dream has been to work for a big 4 or eventually move to the states.

And I know that without a degree, I can't work in the states ever.



I guess I'm also pretty tight on cash and I'm already 25, by the time I graduate, I'll be 30 and change 

My options if everything goes to plan.

Option 1: Bootcamp  &gt; work at mediocre job by next year earning 50~k and hopefully code day and night stuffing my portfolio to one day work at a big 4

Option 2: IF accepted, go to Waterloo for computer science, 5 yr program with co-op. Opportunity cost of 200k lost over the 5 years because of no job.


**The only reason I'm even fantasizing/considering the second option is because I have 2 very close relatives, one of them works as a team lead at FB and one at Amazon, they said they can put in a good word for an internship**

7c9xku,1,2017-11-11,"Insufficient credit, but overall account is in credit!?!?",T-ORR,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/7c9xku/insufficient_credit_but_overall_account_is_in/,"So I have a chase freedom card, and I'm currently traveling for work (I'm a 20 year old intern with a major company currently making ~7k/month post-tax). Since I'm traveling I have around 3k/month in hotel charges and food charges that I am ultimately reimbursed for, but which I want to put through my credit card (getting a travel card isn't an option for me, and besides I like the opportunity to get rewards and build a bigger history, so I don't want to put these on my debit card (which has ~8k on it).

My credit limit was originally 1200, and was increased to 1700 with a temporary increase since I'm traveling. 

I have no issue paying off the card. I'm actually constantly trying to make payments as quickly as I can, so my balance is currently -$950 (meaning I've overpaid and chase owes me).

However, a charge counts directly against available credit while it is pending, irregardless of current account balance. And the charges from my hotel remain ""pending"" for about a week. So currently I have a $1500 charge from my hotel which is pending, along with a few other charges. So in essence I have no available credit, an account balance of -$950, and no way to make additional payments to free up more credit. This sounds ridiculous. Chase owes me $950, I have racked up $1700 in charges. If credit represents the amount chase is willing to owe me, I should have an available credit of $950 (1700 limit minus 1700 in charges plus $950 they already have from me in overpaying off the account). The rep confirms that this would be the case once the charges clear, but that may take a week, and this situation comes up every 2 weeks or so.

What can I do? They suggested I try for a credit increase, but I don't want the hard pull (they tried two weeks ago to increase my credit and I was denied). I've hard the card only 4 months. Is there any way to show Chase a copy of my paycheck or have someone physically review my account history? 

I know I shouldn't be complaining, but it really frustrates me a lot right now."

I'm a current undergrad sophomore studying computer engineering at Northwestern University and my dream is to get in Harvard Law. They have a JDP program that I'm going try to apply to next year but I don't know if I should take the LSATs, the GRE, or take a stab at both. I'm going to intern next summer so won't have a whole ton of time to study, but I'll make the best out of it.

Current Plan: Study/take the GRE this winter. Study for LSATs summer of 2018 and take it in September. Then apply for the JDP.

Stats: Will have around a low 3.7 by the time I apply. These are ballpark predictions but I think I can realistically score around 334 for GRE and around 172 for LSATs. 

What are my chances looking like? And should I ditch the GRE and just focus on LSATs?"

She said that she needed to be alone and that we are in different places right now. I haven't contacted her in a few days.

My ex and I met when we were 16 in high school. We quickly fell in love and had a pretty solid relationship. We often talked about getting married and stuff like that. 

Things got tough when she went away to college. I live in NJ and she goes to school in Philadelphia. She also joined a lot of extra-curriculars and had very little free time. That put a lot of strain on our relationship mainly on my end. I was very sad that I did not get to see her very often.

 I think that over time I made her feel guilty about doing these things she wanted to do. I didn't intend to but I would often share my feelings of loneliness and I could tell it upset her. I was a fool, I let my attachment to her get in the way of my love for her.

I want her to know that I am her biggest fan. That I don't care if she moves to the other side of the planet, as long as we are together. 

I did not see this coming, it came out of the blue for me. Last year in college we had a much harder time than this year. I was able to visit her more often this year. However, as college progressed she got more opportunities for internships. She had one that was in Philadelphia that would take up the summer. I was upset about it and cried but told her I was proud of her and wanted her to do it. I don't think she could handle the guilt of doing something that made me feel that way. I think the last straw for her is when she was offered an internship in California and she figured it wouldn't work out with me.    

I really want her to know that I know how much of an idiot I was. I really did let my attachment to her get in the way of my love for her.

She said she is willing/would like to meet up in person over Thanksgiving Break for a kiss/hug/talk. I am hoping that I can still show her that I know where I went wrong and that I hate how I made her feel guilty. I know she still loves me, maybe not in the same way, but she still loves me because that is what she told her mom when she broke up with me. (her mom and I were close so I contacted her the day after)
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. Says she needs to be alone. I am fairly confident that I made her feel guilty about getting internships far away from me and not seeing me often. I want her back, I know where I went wrong, and I'm willing to try anything."
7caa2j,2,2017-11-11,Cram within 3 years or take an extra semester?,MessiLegend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7caa2j/cram_within_3_years_or_take_an_extra_semester/,"I changed my majors and schools after freshman year and now as a sophomore i'm a little behind in CS credits. I still regret not starting out with CS but at least now I know what I want to do. So now I have to do what had to be done in 4 years within 3 years. I spoke to my advisor and she created a plan for me, and although she thinks it is doable, she said that it is stupid for me to do so. She said I will not be able to work on projects, look for internships, etc. I have asked around and it seems that she is the most respected member in the CS dept and has been doing this for years, so her opinion is pretty solid. 

Basically, I'll have to take 3-4 CS classes every semester, and take some classes without their pre-requisites. My other option is to take an extra semester, and spread my schedule out. If I do that, I will graduate fall 2020. The pro is I'll have more breathing space, can work on projects, network, etc. The con is my family will have to pay for an extra semester, something I have not talked to them about yet. Anyone have experience with a similar situation? Is it worth cramming it all within 3 years, or should I just try to take an extra semester? Are there any other drawbacks to graduating in the fall?

7cac3l,0,2017-11-11,Negotiating salary when transitioning from intern to full time at an MSP?,Jimisacun,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7cac3l/negotiating_salary_when_transitioning_from_intern/,"(Asking a second time before making a decision)

I've been an ""intern"" at a small MSP for about 5 months ago. We have about 40 company clients and are steadily growing. I've been making $15/hour as an intern, and I'm the type of intern who does exactly what the full timers do, I just happen to work a few less hours and got paid hourly. I do mostly help desk work but also go to clients to do onsite IT work. The original plan was that if they liked my performance, they would offer me a full time position when I graduated. I graduate in a month and they just gave me an offer for $40,000, with $500 quarterly bonus possible. Another guy who started with me makes 38,000, so I know they upped their starting offer for me

This was my first job/experience in the IT field, but the bosses were extremely impressed by me- not only by overall performance but willingly to do whatever they needed(travel, stay late, etc). I also end up billing for over 75% of my hours, which I'm told is good for my field, or at least for my MSP. They know I'm always working on something in order to bill as much as possible. I also went full time over the summer when they asked, even though the original plan was for 24 hours/week. Even though I'm back in school now, I always stay late and end up with closer to 30 hours/week. I'm pretty sure we charge close to $100 for an hour of work, so me taking home about $19.23 an hour seems a bit low for someone who bills a lot

As a full timer I will be doing both help desk and actual onsite support/project work. Keep in mind this is a small company with about 6 of us ""IT Technicians"". There is not really a set in stone L1, L2, etc. I do both kinds of work

I understand that I'm still new to the field and straight out of college, but I was hoping to aim more towards $45,000
As a complete beginner to negotiating salary, where do I start? What angle do I take? I know that I want to highlight that I bill a ton of hours, extremely reliable, they know the type of worker I am, that my value is more than what they offered me, that I did a ton of work as an intern on less pay etc etc. Do I say that if I only get $40,000 I'll be throwing my resume everywhere to try to get more than that? Say I'm looking at better offers elsewhere?
or is this a reasonable offer for an MSP?

Just not sure how to articulate this into a negotiation, or if theres anything else I should be including, or if I shouldn't bother asking for more because this is a good entry level IT offer

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

In that time I've distracted myself with work, working out (I've lost 50 lbs since then and counting), and hanging out with friends.  A few months back I finally sold the engagement ring I spent an entire summers' internship earnings on.  The one thing I have lost that I don't know how to regain is my confidence.  When it comes to interacting with women on a professional or friendly basis, I'm totally fine.  But the instant romance becomes a prospect, all systems shut down and I retreat into obscurity, thinking always about what could be but never having the confidence to actually try.  She was the only girl I've ever been in a relationship with, and we had been together a while, so the limited experience I had interacting with women on that kind of a basis was far out of practice.

I'm just not sure how I will regain my confidence, if ever.  Any tips on how to overcome this barrier?  I'm naturally an introvert so I'm already behind the 8 ball here."

7cc4q3,29,2017-11-11,The loneliness of temping (vent); would like to hear from other temps if you're out there and feel the same,sewdeficient,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cc4q3/the_loneliness_of_temping_vent_would_like_to_hear/,"This is a long vent about the nature of temping and the last year of my life as someone who has only been able to get employment through temping. Obviously, there are probably a lot of temps or former temps here that don't relate; humor me. I don't need to be reminded how well life works out for other people but not for me. 

If you *can* relate, I'd love to hear from you. 

In five years, I have applied to easily twenty or thirty temps and interviewed with them. Many would bring me in, take my resume, and never call again; some probably don't even exist anymore. That's the nature of recruiting, I guess, people get paid for having any candidates at all. 

I left childhood teaching in 2014, worked as an ""intern"" unpaid at a not for profit for about a year, and have temped since September of 2016, recruited from an Excel class. I'm 30. The only job experience I had was assistant teaching and babysitting and a lot of freelance work, maybe three years' worth - a whole lotta nothin', to interviewers. So I had to start from scratch, at a time all my friends were settled in their careers. 

I realized the calendar date and am horrified at...how little I've accomplished.

Yes, it's gotten me some experience. But I've never been on an assignment that lasted longer than two months. Most have been much shorter - two weeks here, four weeks there. Three months in a seasonal position. All shitty, low level jobs. The one I was best paid at, I was fired from. My supervisor just didn't like me, even though I tried my best. They already had students to hire for cheaper who knew the office better (it was at a university).

Most recently I lost an offer to work an administrative job at a music label for a few months (my literal dream job - because it's in a big, fun environment, big enough to absorb me and pay well, and the sort of setting I'd like to work in permanently...even three months would be valuable) because I had already done two weeks at an accounting office that gave me the impression they would need me three months, and the Dream Job recruiter was someone who had fucking ignored my emails and pleas for a YEAR. A *YEAR*. That was the first conversation I'd had with him in that time; the first time I spoke to him, he said he had no work for me. The staffing agency is horrible; I worked with two other recruiters there who never called me again, after placing me at a job I was fired from in nine days (the school job).

I didn't want to leave this latest assignment so abruptly, asked for a later start date a week later so my current staffing agency could find someone else - Dream Job passed on me, of course. I feel more stupid and ashamed of myself - for cowardice, for being in such a horrible position with these terrible options - than words can describe. 

Especially considering, now my boss at this accounting office is going on a trip to their London office and letting me go this week, something he failed to tell the recruiter that got me this job. It just adds insult to injury, makes the stupidity of my choices so much worse. In the beginning he was so nice, and I felt like I'd be doing him a huge disservice if I bailed after two weeks there into an assignment that was supposed to last 8 weeks. *I probably would have inconvenienced him a few days.* I had been such a long time since a supervisor was nice to me. 

I cannot describe the cruelty of realizing the idiocy of that sort of loyalty for an opportunity like this. And granted, I would have been sad for leaving no matter what, and I dreaded bailing, then getting fired. It's happened before.

I was also afraid of burning bridges with my current agency, of course, and the real possibility I would have left job 1 and been fired from job 1 quickly -I didn't trust the recruiter who brought me the job.

But as it turned not, not only did he cut me loose early - I sat on my hands most of the day and just try not to bother him after he made it clear I mostly just get in the way, requesting tasks to do while he does his work. I spend the two hours after I finish imagining him resenting me where I sit for having to pay me, this useless, unskilled dumbass, and thinking of how unspeakably stupid I was to pass up the other job. How *furious* I am at myself, and him. A million ways I could have foreseen this happening to me. 

In the end, it doesn't matter - it changes how horribly these jobs always turn out or feel when they end. It's never that one ending or loss - I relive all I them. I relive the last ten years that led me here *every. single. day*, pore over horrible snapshots of being a massive depressed fuck up in a useless degree in college, aimless grad school (even worse degree - teaching)...I tick down the list of friends who left me behind years ago. 

 I wanted to scream at my supervisor here, for telling my recruiter he'd need me for eight weeks, when he was letting me go after three to travel; for not giving my recruiter or myself a realistic picture of how much work there'd actually be; for his ""tricking"" me into being loyal and feeling I'd rather finish this assignment and get a reference from someone who made me feel so good that first week than leave with a day turnaround for a new office I could just as easily be fired from quickly (but one I would have loved, LOVED to work for). Of course, I'm angriest at myself. For cowardice; for dumbness. For being disposable in many ways (stupid; awkward; anxious; half the time I'm 20 minutes late, which makes me ashamed for the rest of the day and scared to talk to anyone. I stay late, I've tried setting my alarm clock earlier; no matter what, due to health problems or train problems...I end up coming at exactly the same time.) I know that's a big ""no duh"". Trust me. 

Having options like this in front of me is a punishment, I tell myself, for bad choices, bad character, being stupid - on and on and on and on, for hours, every day. I'm angry at the mistakes I made to get here, to be so worthless and faceless a labor unit I can't fucking get an employer to delay a start date a few day for me. Of course I can't - *I'm just a worthless temp*. 

Fire me three weeks earlier than I was told this job would last, *after I turn down an offer I've been waiting five years for?* Sure - I'm just a stupid fucking useless temp! 
 

It's not just the horrible pay, and living at he mercy of recruiters who are ten years younger than me; so many of them have the same useless liberal arts degree I do, and escaped poverty by headhunting, an apt colloquialism if there ever was one.

It's the loneliness and shame. The very nature of temping at this stage at this age is underwritten by a little voice that reminds me never to get comfortable or feel valued; I wear a smile, I ask questions, I'm enthusiastic and try to make the most out of each job, but that little voice tells me how silly it all is, how **embarrassing,** *because the companies I'm working for would never hire me to to stay and more likely resent having to hire some imbecile doing tasks an ape could do and that a machine might in six months. There's no point getting to like people, as I will inevitably, given that a job becomes most of your social contact.

It's affected my social life, of course, much in the same way being unemployed at this age would. I don't really feel like I can answer the question, ""So what do you do?"". In a room full of people who will inevitably love their careers, have been at their jobs for years, and have some relationships between their life outcomes and the value others have placed on them, my answer is embarrassing. I'm not a marketing consultant, or a teacher, or an administrative assistant. I'm not an *employee*, with years of experience in one office, one industry,admired and groomed by colleagues and superiors of my field. I'm a worthless, disposable temp doing work they'd never hire someone to do full time and would prefer to get a machine to do, for wages or duties more befitting teenagers; the few times I've been sent to temp with others, they're between the ages of 23 and 25, if that.


I have never actually felt I could be hired in the setting or for the sort of office I'd really, really like to work for. I apply to big companies (e.g., makeup companies, studios, huge food conglomerates) that are also well reviewed for work culture and pay. I never get responses, naturally. Their average employee probably has five years of specialized executive experience. As a temp, I have to take the work when it's offered, where it's offered, at the wage is offered, for the time period it's offered. In this case, I didn't even get that - and I'm furious.

I've come to feel like sort of a tumor in offices or a strange ill-fitting piece of furniture that supervisors tolerate but want to remove as quickly possible.  The people around me have the skills, experience, and other assets that make them *employees* - in my case, I'll be there for a month (if that), a money hole, lucky to make 15 an hour, terrified the whole time of fucking up that office's systems, their tasks...something. Making work for people. Doing additional work in an attempt to be thorough and because no one will explain what's useful to them or not, and it's a given I don't *really* know about this office or what they do at the level a hired employee does. 

On top of that, my friends' experiences with temps were different and led to longer, higher paying assignments and eventual permanent employment. Three and five years ago, my friends both got permanent jobs eventually at decent companies through the same temps that now send *me* to month long gigs where I can expect to make 14/hour and seemed to have completely changed in the five years I begged them to take me on (temps only started placing me a year ago, as noted). The awfulness of the jobs makes me think, they're only taking me because these staffing agencies are now terrible and are useless to me in this job market. I've asked for temp to perm work. They won't give it to me, and I have never interviewed for a paid job and not been passed over, even when round 1 (e.g., phone interview) goes ok. Every interview for a permanent job these temps send me on is for horrible positions (I don't behave that way of course) or positions I'm unqualified for. The one job I was of course did not hire me - I lacked the not for profit experience they wanted. 

All my temp positions are data entry, usually in tasks an administrative assistant would actually do, but somehow it never counts as worthwhile experience to the customer service jobs and admin jobs I apply to on my own. For every 25-50 I apply to by myself, I might get an interview that goes so so and where I won't even get a rejection email in response to my thank you note. I've never actually been placed as a long term administrative assistant or receptionist, even though I have the experience through seasonal jobs I found myself (that paid...11 dollars an hour). 

I can't divorce the two, the worthlessness I feel going on interviews for jobs I apply to independently, and these temp assignments at companies that would never, ever hire me as a full time employee (something I try to ignore while I'm there, but it eats away at me and makes me hate myself for being so unskilled at this age). I'm really trying; I research the companies and my supervisors, ask questions at my temp jobs so I can figure out how to make what I do sound purposeful on a resume, leave my contact info with thank you notes, make sure to ask if I can add them as a reference later, list each gig on my resume as best I can and flesh out what I contributed to and software I used, and try to be professional. 

But this month - getting cut loose early, from a shitty job i stayed for after passing up the sort of opportunity I'll never have again - forced to choose between a horrible recruiter I have no relationships with, and a firm that's placed me the last year but for terrible pay, and short-term jobs - all of it, all of it makes me feel horrible. 

I really liked my boss at this job. I feel like I'm bound to disappoint people that offer goodwill - the worst fucking thing on earth - no matter what, either due to incompetence, lateness, or the hesitance that comes with being in an office of strangers when I know I shouldn't. I feel betrayed, and then berate myself for being stupid enough to feel that - you're not a person owed anything if you're a temp. 

After a year of really mean, snide, unprofessional, indifferent, and condescending bosses and some truly toxic offices (another fun perk of being a temp - I have had more than a few supervisors that treat me like garbage and are very clear they do not respect or like me as a person nor think my work is important, in an office of actual perm employees they've interviewed, hired and gotten to know over time), I can honestly say I would have been very sad leaving, but the way this turned out...was a fucking slap in the face. I want to yell and scream at him, and tell him I turned down on offer for a job I might have been suited for; how could he make me feel needed that first week? 

You're a temp - don't get attached to people emotionally, don't expect anyone to be nice to you or find out you who you are, because *you're not supposed to be there*.

I know one solution, to go back to school - but I will still have a resume seen as garbage when I get out, I'm broke, and right now, I don't even know the path to follow. Realistically, the ones I have in mind are all pretty boring and difficult to turn into career if they're not among your natural talents, with a strong performance record or portfolio- probably finance or data/marketing analysis, since those are the settings where I'm hired to do very low level work).  When I was in college I unquestionably would have flunked out of the higher-level, more-employable arenas I do low skill data entry work for now, and there's no guarantee I wouldn't do terribly pursuing an MBA (with no valued job experience or contacts, in this time - who would care)? I feel trapped. 

I just wanted to talk about what I know about my life today and now. All the options ahead of me are horrible. This latest humiliation caps off a year of terror about the future and bottomless self-hatred - for the person I am every day, for the past that led me here. I'm not a young enough person to comfort myself with the idea I still have time to alter the course I'm on easily and find what I want sooner than later - on office that pays me a living wage where I feel respected (maybe even liked!) and valued. All of my friends have that. All my acquintances have that. I'm the only one that still has as much clout of as a teenager fresh out of college - or even less, since that fresh grad is younger and likely has more desired skills than I do. The expectations have gotten worse in the years since I've graduated; even with the continual sitting in on workshops, they don't really help, so I fall short of what's expected of me in this labor market and for my age cohort, and I'm ashamed. 

Unemployment is terribly lonely; being disposable is lonely; being a temp is disempowering, but I have only ever had success finding even shitty wages, finding any work at all, through temps. 

I have no financial future, realistically, just based on my age. Or it's at that much more risk. I spend every check I earn on rent, food, odd consumable items, and metrocards. I have no savings. I have no investments. 

I have less financial security than the average college freshman who has taken a single decent accounting class. 


The fact that I'm such an unnattractive candidate to employers seeking permanent employees is all making me feel like garbage today; I do not know what to do. 

I'm sorry this is a book. 

I don't have anything; I'm feeling so fucking old and trapped; you get to an age where eventually, if you have a problem you can't fix....and whether or not you think you deserve a way out is beside the point. I have no identity apart from this and the things that make me suffer; every working day I revisit the failures and shortcomings of a feckless, stupid, weak-willed, sheltered, and ostensibly lazy (I don't think so - but stupid, yes) person, paying for the same. Office by office; horrible, horrible moment where I simply cannot do even the simple, short-term task I am expected to; employer for employer; team for team. They are an audience of people living an adulthood I can't imagine. "

7ccmvz,4,2017-11-11,a story about depression,LuckIsntOnMySide,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ccmvz/a_story_about_depression/,"hello, people that are reading this you probably don't know me and that may be for the better.
My name is lucky i have a big issue that i want to address and that is depression with teens and young adults. There is a reason why i made this post. and that reason is that it is a serious issue and one that isn't addressed very often. In recent times there came some attention thanks to logic and his song but that blew off rather quick. 

let me just start with a note just saying i don't do this for any attention or anything like that i don't want sympathy i just want to make people will think different about depression. 

I'll tell you my story later

Mostly of the time depression is something that is seen as weak and something you cant talk about or is something you shouldn't talk about. And that is something that is strong with teens is that its weird to talk about it or search for help. But let me tell you right now that it something you have to do to get over it and fight the depression. It's not weak or anything like that it doesn't matter who you are a male or female or what your believes are in no way is it bad to search for help and talk about it.and i highly advise you to do that find help talk to people that can help you.

my story
It all began April 10th when i started an internship for my education and that went great and all.
But first some background info. I never really was skinny in any form i was always the fat kid.
I weight about 120 kg and that never bothered me in and kind of way. It wasn't that. i had some
good friends at school i met them 3 years ago and we really became a good group of friends 
we went to the same classes and we were all in the same age group. But let me get back to the story so it was in April that i started my internship and that i didn't go to school anymore so there where 2 friends i didn't saw anymore but we chatted and skyped each other so that was all cool and 1 friend of mine that left school that year worked where i was doing my internship so i saw my friends quite often. And from that start that worked out all fine. So 4 weeks into my internship
its the 1st of may and we had another intern coming in and the first moment i met the other intern i fell in love with her and so that weeks advances and on the 5th of may her bus didn't come for an hour so i offered here a ride and she took it we talked a little bit and we exchanged numbers the same day.
And everything went well i had lots of contact with her with my friend and thanks to her i started to exercise asked her out on a date and she said yes so that was a huge motivation. Skip 2 weeks and there is where it turned bad i acted like an ass in front of her not my self and whe had some fights nothing mayor but in between fights i felt really depressed but i still had my friend who was there for me and looked after me. 2 weeks later and i didnt get any better more fights she now blocked me from every mode of talking to her from whatsapp to text and it took me hard that day i was certain i didnt want to live anymore i dont want to be here and i feel bad because it is my fault. I had my friends with me who stopped me that day they talked me out of it when they noticed i wanted to shoot my self or drive into a wall and i thank them for that. So i didn't get any better over time 4 weeks later my friend from work was gone and i had some bad blood with the girl but nothing that mayor then usual but i still liked her and that never changed. So we began talking more in real life and it became a little better but then it became June 15th and that's when her and my internship stopped i decided i wanted to work there for the summer but before she left i still wanted to know what did i do wrong to her and is there a way to fix it. i went to ask her and she didn't say anything to me nothing at al i had never felt worse then that day. So summer went on and that was not fun i was there alone all my friends where on vacation one joined the army and the other one the police so we didn't talk anymore and the other one we kinda talked but only once a week for 10 minutes.
Skip to September 5th and there we have the first day at school and that is when my depression rose from a 4 to an 8. i found out that i was in the same class as this girl i knew and to make it shorter i didn't go to school for 5 weeks. The times i went she didn't want to look at me or looked at my back in such an angry way that only made me more depressed. So in the meanwhile, all my friends were gone and i didn't have anyone to talk to. So i just went to the only place to get it all off my mind the gym i went from 120kg to 80 within 2 months and i always heard people say o when you get skinny all the problems disappear and everything will be fine but it won't. So now i have tried to live with all this pain and i cant tell anyone about it. i don't see a point in my life anymore the only reason im still here is for my parents they would die if i kill myself so that the only thing that holds me back. I still have some friends but they don't see the seriousness of my depression and i cant talk to anyone. I tried talking to a counselor but that doesn't help. If only i started sooner.

So that's why i made this video talk to people and don't be scared to talk about it.
find help so i won't be to late for you. I don't know how this will end i don't know if ill be around much longer but for everybody that watches this video find help if needed and don't be scared to talk about it. i hope my story will let you realize it is ok to share your story and id could be more shaming then mine “a guy that got into depression and killed himself because a girl didn't talk to him anymore” but no story is a shame and share it maybe not open but go anonymous on forums and find some people that can help

Lucky – my name is kinda stupid i ain't so lucky"

7cczm8,1,2017-11-11,"Thinking about quitting my first ""real"" job 4 months in. How should I proceed?",Dreadh4llow,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7cczm8/thinking_about_quitting_my_first_real_job_4/,"Hello! So I've read numerous Reddit threads about similiar problems as mine, but nothing has quite covered my situation, so here goes:

I graduated university this summer with a bachelor's degree in Journalism and Communication and right off the bat got my first ""real"" job in a hotel group as an online marketing coordinator (I do have various 1-2 month long internships and projects in my field under my belt as well as retail jobs). The job in itself is fine, I like WHAT I am doing on a day-to-day basis (online marketing and doing social media etc) but the big problem however is HOW things are run over here - my direct boss is constantly overloaded with her work, meaning she's stressed 24/7, which carries over to the rest of the team causing a very negative and toxic atmosphere, she complains that I don't work incredibly long overtime like her, everything work-related there is unorganized and INCREDIBLY hectic and stressful, there's little to no strategy involved in the tasks that I have to do and the workload is immense. The people who've worked the same position have never lasted there for over a year. Combining that with the fact that I am paid 35-40% less than people on similiar positions on average leaves me in a pretty bad spot to be in right now. I feel the mental impact that place has on me and it feels emotionally very taxing to continue and I've only been there for about 3.5-4 months.

I've been quietly on a job hunt for about a month and have attended 4 interviews (all marketing and communications related) thus far, some of which have not yet replied their final answer and some that have politely rejected me. Each and every company I've been interviewed for has left a way more professional, well thought out and easy-going impression and feel than what I have ever experienced (as well as a more competitive salary) in my current working place.

So my question is how should I proceed with this situation. I've been thinking of quitting for now, moving on to some ""easier to get into"" field like customer service or administrative job until I find a job that I really want so that I can continue work related to my speciality.

The other option is to suck it up, devastate myself even further and succumb into the endless void of a mess that is my current job environment and keep on going to interviews. I just dread the thought of sitting down in that office so much that I'd rather work anywhere else right now BUT staying would look better on my resume.

What are your thoughts?"
7cd5mr,1,2017-11-11,I [28 M] am worried about how past behaviors will affect relationships,ParkertheEagle1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7cd5mr/i_28_m_am_worried_about_how_past_behaviors_will/,"When I [28 M] was 24, I moved to Arizona for a one-year internship. I wasn't really in a good place emotionally while there, and during that year, saw about 11 prostitutes. I had never solicited sex before, and since I left Arizona, have never done it since. I just worry about how a potential romantic partner would react to this information. On one hand, I don't necessarily feel that it is something that someone I was in a relationship with would NEED to know, but on the other hand I value honesty and transparency, and don't like the idea of ""hiding"" it.  I guess I just wouldn't be comfortable being in a relationship with someone who probably wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me if they new that one year in my early twenties, I solicited sex from multiple women.

I am just wondering if I should bring this up when I get serious with someone, since it might change the way the feel about the relationship. Is it just going to be a matter of some women will be understanding about it and see that it was in the past, and for others, it will be a deal breaker? 

Thoughts, advice?

  tl;dr: When I was 24 I solicited sex from quite a few women. Worried about bringing this up in a serious relationship."

I dropped out of college when I was 19, spent the next five years basically neet with some sporadic odd jobs/seasonal work, and went to trade school back in late 2014 for a few months and failed at completing that. Now I'm getting close to 28 and I honestly can't live like this anymore no matter what I've deluded myself into thinking is justification for this. I want to live my life like my friends have all been doing for like five years now. 

I've been thinking of going back to school to get a degree in something computer science/programming related and try to get some kind of internship if possible to get a jumpstart on work. I have a few problems though. For one, I still owe the government about $6500 in loans from when I went to trade school, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to get financial aid until I pay those back. My resume is also pretty barren. I've never held a real job that's lasted more than like 3 months, and I have nothing of real note to put since like 2012. Do I even have a shot at any of this? It feels almost like now that I want to fix my life I don't really have any chance left to do so."

I know I did not respond to very many posts, but I read every single one.

Since that post, my husband and I have blocked phone numbers for my JNM and GC sister, who is the most likely FM. We have also blocked social media accounts for my parents, FM and BIL, and have purchased a video surveillance system for our house, which my husband is having waaayyy too much fun putting together (EE major - he lives for this kind of project).

Some other stuff that has happened. Shortly after the NC was put into place, we found out we are having LO #2 arrive next summer, and that my husband has received an internship offer for 10 weeks over the course of the summer in a location MUCH closer than we were last summer. While this is going to be difficult, due to distance apart when LO is expected to arrive, my MIL and siblings-in-law live in the same town and will be able to help until he gets back.

We are not sure, due to reaction by JNM of pending arrival of our first baby (BitchBot can catch you up if you missed it) to either not tell her until after LO #2 is born and we are back together, or not tell her at all. I feel like this is a big piece of news that is supposed to be shared - with family especially, and I have told my oldest brother, but not anyone else from my family. My brother has promised not to say anything until I tell the rest of them.

It's been a couple of weeks since I went NC, and I'm adjusting to the change, but I also feel like I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I used to call my dad pretty frequently and talk, before work, or on my way to the daycare to pick up LO, but I don't want him to be the info collector for JNM, either, so I just kind of dropped off the face of the planet. This can probably be pinned to me having three weeks of class left before final exams, but I don't know when JNM will realize I'm not talking to her.

Also, llama feed tidbit: I heard through my older brother that JNM was talking to him about going to visit GC in AL for Thanksgiving while he stays behind and takes care of her house/animals that she's already talked to me about going with them, and I've agreed, apparently . . ."

Taverns took in customers with a submissive groan of wood and metal seats, and interns all around put up their hoods to shield their faces from the rain.*

*For Red, it had been another one of those challenging nights. Alone in her decently sized room in the far reaches of the Security sector, her nightmares had kept her awake for another day. Coming to a hazy awakening, she lifted a furry hand to her face, placing it over her right eye and brushing her tense fur to the side. Scarlet blood was all that she could remember from the last few moments of her dream, and she struggled to recall the rest of it. Taking a moment to wake up more, she checked the clock in the corner, set to the Facility's run times. Four in the morning, way early. But there was no way she was going to be getting more rest after that. As she stepped out of bed and slipped into her jacket, the dream came back to her.*

There at one point was the loud crack of a draconian rifle, and then the spray of blood onto Red's face.*

7cdwy2,1,2017-11-12,"23 [M4F] Looking for a friend and activity partner with mutual interests in Melbourne, Australia.",ThePoeticallyCorrect,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/7cdwy2/23_m4f_looking_for_a_friend_and_activity_partner/,"Hello, dear reader!

As the title conveys, I am a 23 year old guy looking for an activity partner in Melbourne. I want to make a connection with someone who shares mutual interests and would like to hangout once in a while - more or less often depending on how it goes.

I am an international student living in Melbourne since January 2017. I recently took my final exams and am looking forward to formally graduating next month from UniMelb. Since I have some spare time on hand, I want to go around and attend the many activities and events that this wonderful place has to offer. Having a partner who would like to pursue the same endeavor would be fantastic!

For my interests and preferred activities, I am into;

**Movies**: Absolutely love horror movies, but must be a good quality horror. I also like comedy, biography, suspense/mystery, and sci-fi genres. Generally quite picky! To make my taste of movies more elaborate, my top favorites - genre independent - include; The Conjuring franchise, Annabelle: Creation, The Intern, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Intrastellar, Martian, Lucy, The Hangover franchise, The Ring, and Orphan. If you happen to be interested in trying out movies from other parts of the world, I would love to share some of my personal favorites.

**Cooking**: Before the beginning of 2017, the most cooking I'd do would be making tea or boiling an egg. When I came to Melbourne, I got to stay with my wonderful housemates who already followed the rule of each person having to cook once every week. That's how I started making the kitchen my playground and now, I can safely say that I am pretty good at making the complicated dishes that I never imagined I'd be making.

**Food**: What good is it living in such a diverse place if you don't even go around trying the delicacies from other cultures, right? I believe that the two best ways to share cultures are music and food. I absolutely love sharing my homemade dishes with my friends who come from distinct backgrounds and love it even more to try out food from other cultures. So far, Rendang (Indonesian), Ramen (Japanese), and Gyudon (Japanese) are my top 3. I have absolutely NO food restrictions, other than that it shouldn't be too unhealthy or unhygienic.

**Music**: Don't really have language or genre-specific preferences, but rap is something that I've never come to like even the slightest. What I look for in a song is; a) heart-warming lyrics; and/or b) soothing, coherent music.

**Books**: Especially, audio books. I used to read more, but there was a time when I had to travel a lot every week between cities back in my home country. Reading anything or simply looking down at my phone makes me really sick when I travel, hence leading to my discovery of audio books. My favorite writers include; Carl Sagan, Erich Fromm, Susan Cain, and Oscar Wilde.

**Fitness**: For the past 4 months, I've been on the journey to becoming healthier and making myself physically fitter. I have made significant progress, though still have a long way to go!

**Sports**: Haven't been that sporty after the end of high school, but I love to watch and play Cricket.

**Indoor games**: Uno, ludo, carrom board - the 90's kids' classic indoor delights :D

**Sharing experiences**: To me, the truly awesome complexity and subjectivity of life comes alive when one gets to know the good and bad experiences of others. Having been through a lot of good and bad phases myself, I like talking about and listening to life's little pleasures and troubles every now and then.

Now that you know me a bit better, I'd like to detail the kind of a person I'm looking for. In a nutshell, I want to connect with someone who GENUINELY shares my interests rather than someone who just wants to do anything at all because they're bored. I look at myself as an honest, sincere, and caring person and expect the same attributes in my connections. One more thing I'd like to mention is that, if it matters to you, I am NOT a religious person in any sense. Since I do belong to a religious family, I would have absolutely no issues if you are a religious person for as long as my irreligion is not a problem for you.

Interested? Go ahead and shoot me a message. Tell me a bit about yourself and what interests you have in common with me. I have no problem sharing a picture of mine in the inbox if you'd prefer. Looking forward to reading from you!

Peace!

A few times I have been caught by inspectors and been issued a penalty fare which I pay on the spot using my contactless card. I don't ever give them my home address (which is what you can do if you don't pay on the spot, they post it to your house)

A few days ago I received a letter from the train company but I've since lost it, not sure what it said. I've called the company and they said that they haven't sent any letters to me (bit odd) but if it was to do with a penalty fare (I think the lady on the phone thought it was an outstanding fare) that I should ring the company that issues them on Monday.

It may be nothing but I'm just wondering, assuming the worst and they are warning me for dodging fares - how would they have received my address? Can they legally ask my bank for these details?

I thought we had a good relationship; we always communicated issues and tried to go out on dates when we could. I planned my future around her and absolutely adored her. We discussed marriage and future plans together. I never knew that she could be capable of cheating, and I’m just at a loss of how to proceed.

---
Context:
When we met, I wasn’t going anywhere in life; I was not going to school and was not working. She changed that, and I put myself through school with her as my biggest motivator. I’m currently at a 4-year university, with good grades and an internship at a reputable firm lined up for next summer. I never would have achieved this without her support. We moved in together at the beginning of this year, and have the lease until the end of the year.

Over the past few months, a string of unfortunate events occurred. I lost an offer with a company, my dad went through cardiac arrest and was hospitalized (he’s doing better now), and she was getting laid off work. We both fell into depression and she started spending more time with agroup of co-workers. I wanted to spend more time with her to cope with my problems, but I guess she wanted to escape the problems by hanging out with her friends. We talked about how I needed more time with her, but she would keep making plans that occupy the entire weekend with friends; I felt that I barely got to see her.

At one point, she mentioned how she wanted a break and that she wanted time to think things through. I couldn’t comprehend why and thought that we were just in a rut; we talked and came to the conclusion that we were going to make it work last Sunday. However, I still had suspicions about a certain coworker (M) of hers, and was worried that she was having an emotional affair. Last week Tuesday, I looked through her phone (I’m not proud of that) and realized that she physically cheated on me multiple times over the course of a week leading up to when we made up and actually on the morning that we did reconcile.

I was devastated, broke it off with her, and left for the night. I couldn’t believe she did that, and that she was planning to hide this from me. We were able to talk and it turns out that she was also sexting another coworker (M) of hers. She says she wants to experience being single and that she feels trapped being in a relationship.

We still live in the same household until the end of the year, and I have to stay here because it’s near my school and workplace. I stayed over at my parents’ house over the weekend, but I have to go back during the weekdays.

How do I move on from this? I feel completely betrayed and lost. My ambition to succeed in life is gone, and I’m scared to be alone. I’ve been confiding and spending time with friends and family, but feel this huge empty void in my heart. Every day is a challenge and life seems so bleak. I really miss her. I really want to move on and be happy, but I’m worried that I will always be a broken person. I’m worried that I will never find anyone that I can love as much as her, who loved me as much as she once did.

How do I get through this?

7ch9ti,4,2017-11-12,[Advisory] Big 4 vs National firm...Worth the pay cut?,AccountantwithaQ,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7ch9ti/advisory_big_4_vs_national_firmworth_the_pay_cut/,"Hi guys,

Senior undergrad student here and I currently find myself with two offers in hand for FDD. One Big 4 firm and one mid-tier. Having interned in the past at the mid-tier, I suppose they are offering me the equivalent of second-year pay. I am not yet graduated and thus received the Big 4 offer through your traditional Fall on-campus recruiting cycle, and therefore seem to be receiving new grad pay as one might expect. 

Now if the pay were the same, this would be a no brainer for me. Coming from a non-target undergrad and with hopes of one day attending a top MBA program to potentially break into consulting or IB (or hell, just keeping my options open in general) I believe the Big 4 brand + network would be a lot more useful than the mid-tier. 

My plan all along was to go spend 1-2 years at the mid-tier and lateral to Big 4. I wasn't expecting to be successful this recruiting season (as mentioned, non-target + getting into advisory right out of school is damn hard) but now that I have the B4 offer in hand it seems like I ought to just take it.

That being said, having done a B4 busy season audit internship + already spending the better part of a year interning in advisory (restarting as a junior again even though I would have been a Staff 2 had I stayed in audit), it really sucks to be staying down at the new-grad salary level yet again. The B4 offer is about 15% (~$7K) less than the mid-tier offer. Do you guys think that given my career aspirations, the benefits of less money upfront are worth it long term? How viable would it be to take the mid-tier offer, make some money, make senior, and then jump to Big 4 and get the best of both worlds?

Also yes I asked the B4 to match the offer, although I find it unlikely that they will given that they probably have 100 other kids who would do the job for free. 

tl;dr

* Two offers in hand; Big 4 and Large national firm
* Smaller firm pays 15% ($7K) more
* Already left audit to start at the bottom in advisory once before
* Hope to move to consulting/IB in the future
* Given that I come from a non-target undergrad, would the B4 brand and network be worth the pay cut?


**Edit:** Thanks guys, seems like every single person has said to take the B4 offer. That's what I was thinking as well, so it's nice to get that confirmation. "

I have a really time consuming internship right now: I get up at 6:00 AM, go to my internship, get home around 6:30 PM, make dinner and eat it, make preparations for the next day and then go to bed. Repeat this for five times a week and my weekendjob: it makes it impossible for me to go to the gym and get a decent workout.

I used to spend approx. two and a half hours in the gym three/four days a week. At the beginning of my internship I shortened the gymtime to one hour, but with changing clothes + transporting to and from the gym; all together it's just too much lost time that I can't miss. 

I am now planning to do cardio sessions 20-30 min. each day (mon - sat, sunday rest). My goal for the next months is weight loss/cutting so I figured doing cardio almost every day may not be that bad for reaching my goal.

Will there be a drastic muscle loss when I replace lifting with cardio for 3-4 months? My internship will end in the beginning of February. In February I'll resume lifting in the gym. "

I'm a sophomore in college, and I study molecular cell and physiology. I'm not the smartest student, but I try to work hard and efficiently. I don't plan on becoming a doctor, but I know that grades matter for the most part in jobs that relate to my major to an extent. However, I feel like I'm stuck making a choice. 

My school is a state university and I enjoy the opportunities they provide, but our professors seem to often display a pattern of either not being a good teacher but gives easy exams, or very competent professors that give out harsh exams that fail the majority of the class. I like to challenge myself and learn from mistakes, and in a perfect world I would love to always learn from the best professors in our school. However, I know the impact my GPA would be on applying to grad school or job hunting in the future (at least for my very first job), and I'm scared that even though I've learned alot and have faced good challenges that made me grow, my GPA would be what stops me from going anywhere. I guess why I would seek help right now is because of two things:

1) do I go to the professor that would teach me what I need to know in the future but potentially tank my GPA, or stay with the professor that gives out easy exams and only require minimal studying but leaves me clueless in the future when academic knowledge is required in my field?

2) what can I do to beef up my resume if my GPA is not as good as the other candidates? 

I don't know much about how society works in terms of newly graduated students, and how on earth I'm going to make it out there. I'm frankly terrified. 

(I'm joining a research lab in my campus, and I'm trying to get into internships in forensics both in my home state as well as Taiwan. My GPA right now is very average if not below average, which is a 2.9, and I'm trying to figure out other ways to help me be more competent in society when I graduate) 

TL;DR: I want to learn as much as I can, but my GPA would potentially suffer because of mistakes made in the process of learning. Scared and a bit lost at the moment. "

7chybk,1,2017-11-12,"Worst situation imaginable, relationship at risk...",quantumloopy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7chybk/worst_situation_imaginable_relationship_at_risk/,"This is going to be a really long post so please bare with me.

I've been dating my girlfriend now for 2 years and we're deeply in love. She's currently working in healthcare and I'm in my final year of university, despite being the exact same age. She comes from an *ultra* conservative background with extremely strict parents. I too am conservative but nowhere near as extreme as her family is.

Now I've met her parents just over a year ago and they liked me. They thought I was a good boy and charming, handsome etc. The only problem was that they wanted me to switch churches over so that I could attend with them, which in all honesty I wasn't willing to do (due to cultural issues; in both my culture and hers (same background), it's considered weak for the man to follow the woman in the matters of religion). Stupid I know, but I couldn't stand to see my parents upset at the fact that I would switch denominations just to please a girl's parents. 

Her parents didn't like that too much and basically forced her to stop talking to me. So for about a year now, she's been seeing me behind their backs and without their knowledge. We both hate living a lie like this, but it's the only way we can do it, and here's the reasons why:

1. Because of our ethnic backgrounds, it's considered immoral if the girl moves out of her parents house before she gets married.

2. Because of her conservative upbringing, her parents have pretty much full control over her life. Everything from who she talks to and what she does on a daily basis goes through them.

3. She's very family oriented, meaning she hates the idea of upsetting her family.

Now, all the above pisses me off to the highest extent possible, but it is what it is and I certainly can't change our ethnic backgrounds and the cultural norms that come along with that package. 

Our plan is this: wait until I finish university (few months remaining), hopefully have a job by graduation to start making money (I've got a fantastic internship lined up which should convert to a full time offer pending graduation), and then she'd reintroduce me to her parents. As of late, her parents have been asking her about me, saying I was such a good guy. Due to some certain issues that's happened in their church community, they've sort of relaxed their stance on the whole church difference thingy, so it seems like they're willing to give me a second chance.

Now all that was our original plan, but something major happened last night that changes everything.

Long story short, a good friend of mine got married yesterday, and he invited me to go. I brought my girlfriend as my plus one, and we attended the reception. As we were about to leave, she sees her brother-in-law's best friend (remember, her family are super close, and word spreads pretty fast in our circles). She says hi to him and he asks her how she knows the bride, groom etc. Turns out he's related to the bride!!!!

Now I'm pretty sure that he saw me, but I'm also certain he didn't see us holding hands or anything like that. But she *lost her shit*. I've never seen her that hysterical once we got to the car. She was about to throw up from anxiety. 

She's certain that the guy she saw there would tell her brother-in-law, and in turn, her sister will find out and *could* tell her parents. Now here's the real shitkicker.

She blatantly lied to her parents and her sister as to whose wedding she was attending. She told them that she knows the bride (not true, was my friend the groom getting married) from uni (which she certainly doesn't). So basically, this elaborate lie could quickly untangle if her sister tells her parents ""oh someone we know saw her at the wedding, and he's related to the bride"" (bare in mind, the guy she saw there also knows her parents quite well, all from the same ethnic background). Keep in mind that her sister is from the same strain as her parents, meaning she's more than likely to side with them rather than have her sister's back.

Her parents, as said before and can't be stressed enough, are the type of people to absolutely destroy her with questions and ruin her life if she's caught in this lie. 

My girlfriend decided to sort of 'beat everyone to the punch' and told her parents that she saw me at the reception (in a random encounter). They asked her how I was doing and what we talked about etc. You know the usual stuff.

But like I said before, I'm not the issue here. It's the risk that she could be caught out in this massive lie and our whole relationship comes untangled. We're so so so sick of living this lie and it eats us up, but we have no other option due to the reasons I stated earlier in this post. 

We're worried, and we need advice. I usually would never spill my heart out like this, but I'm so lost as to what we should do. At this point, we're just hoping and praying that the guy she saw there won't open his mouth when he sees her brother-in-law, and that no connection whatsoever is made to the lie she's told both her parents and her sister.

Any advice is welcome at this point, and I'm terribly sorry for writing this long post. "
7ci0oq,14,2017-11-12,New grad at Two Sigma?,DonTheHues,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ci0oq/new_grad_at_two_sigma/,"I just received an offer from Two Sigma and really loved the people that I talked to and who I would potentially be working with (they all seem really great to work with and extremely smart).

The one things that's holding me back is I feel like I'm going to crash and burn hard at this place: I've only had one Software engineering internship in the past and I put a widget on an existing site (It took about 2k lines of code), and my feedback I got from my manager was good, not like stellar or anything. And from what I've been reading on glassdoor, it seems that everyone there is a genius, and I'm worried that I won't be able to perform at their level. I also was a bit of a creeper and looked at what some current engineers had done in the past via LinkedIn, and there's no way I hold a candle to them in terms of projects or classes (especially because I've always been average in terms of how well I do in CS classes). I have no problem working really hard, but at some point, I feel like it might not be enough and I'll end up getting fired for performance that's not up to their level. 

So my question is, especially if you were a new grad coming into this company or any other company, what experiences did you have? What did they expect of you? In addition, how do you think I can gauge whether or not I'll be okay at the company? It's really hard to know without really getting a sense of what they expect from their new grads or knowing what team you'll be on. 

Thank you all so much!"

7cizal,12,2017-11-12,"How do I not appear ""lonely"" to others?",newvess,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7cizal/how_do_i_not_appear_lonely_to_others/,"Hey everyone, so I have a little bit of social anxiety that manifested itself when I moved to a new smallish town for college (a typical college town).

I am a transfer student and missed the boat on making friends freshman year, and I do not want to be in a sorority, but it seems like 90% of the girls in my classes are in one. To be honest, I sort of enjoy not having lots of friends, it's less of a distraction, I'm more productive, and I can do whatever I want. I had 2 jobs this semester, and I was in a fashion club and 4 classes so I had lots going on. Now, 2 of those have ended and I just have my classes and a job. 

In my hometown, I have lots of friends and things to do, and my social calendar is usually pretty busy whenever i'm back home (it's a big city and people are more mature, generally). I really just don't feel like I fit in, and i'm tired of wasting my energy trying to make friends with people who seem to not be interested in being friends.

School is going well, I'm kicking ass at my internship, I'm making money, My hobbies are modeling, hiking, and gardening, and I like not having distractions. 

I just don't have many friends. Last semester, my roommate tried to help by inviting me to things (church youth group type stuff that I really don't enjoy). I went a couple of times but it was just not my thing. I know she was just trying to help, but she said I seemed lonely. 

Now I'm self-conscious that I seem lonely to my current roommates. I don't have a lot of free time, and when I do, I like just hanging out at the apartment doing chores or just watching TV. Is there a way to not have them think I'm lonely?"

I'm at the top of my class with a 4.0 UW, I have ECs that pertain to comp Sci like a UCSD internship I did over the summer, but my 1500 is the only thing that worries me. How badly will a score like this affect my chances? "
7cj4jd,3,2017-11-12,Me [27F] with my SO [28M] of 2.5 years. I am worried his interest is declining.,throw_away981276,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7cj4jd/me_27f_with_my_so_28m_of_25_years_i_am_worried/,"Throw-away for the usual reasons.

Also, I'm sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my native tongue. I will try to keep this as short as I can. Thanks to whoever reads!

So, I've been with ""Mike"" for 2.5 years now. We met through mutual friends on an online game, and at the time we met, Mike was finishing his degree in another city, 8 hours away from mine, where I'm also studying. Because of the distance, we were both very hesitant to start anything ""serious"" (I never believed LDR could work for me). I've had 2 LTRs before him, in one of which we were also living together for 3 years out of 4, and I've also had sex with numerous partners ever since I was sexually active at 17. Mike, in comparison has had little to no experience before me, with no relationship lasting more than a month or two and very few sexual partners. *(I'm not keeping score or anything, I just think this might be important for you reading, just a little bit of background.)*

Also, for a bit more detail, I picked up on school only 2 years ago after a 5 year ""break"", which I took because I realized I hated my Uni and the degree I would be getting. I've been pretty independent (and dumb) since I was a teen, so I was working various jobs since 16 and moved out at 18, which is **really** rare in my country (the moving out, not the working part). When I paused my studies, I traveled, I partied, I gathered a ton of experiences and I worked a lot on a job I absolutely adored, but at some point it hit me that I'd regret never getting a degree, and that I'd love to make my parents proud by accomplishing something academically. I think this whole mess I had of a life actually helped me view things differently as the years passed, while I also worked on myself a lot, especially after my (toxic) LTR with my then boyfriend also came to an end after a short while. As a result, I decided to move in with my mother (very, **very** common where I come from for unmarried people to be living with their parents).

Mike on the other hand had never worked a day in his life before 2016, and lived off of his well-off dad. His whole adult life consisted of mainly solitude, gaming, and a few (10+years older) friends with whom he played D&amp;D occasionally. One could say we had the complete opposite lives, but our interests were quite similar, just like our ideas and thoughts on basically everything.

We became official in 2015, as we both decided it was worth the LDR risk. Less than a year later, he came to live permanently in my City, and to be honest we were mostly almost living together, and everything was mostly great (surely, like most couples, we've had our fair share of arguments and the occasional fight, but nothing we didn't solve within the day.) He started an intern job here in 2016, and I've tried my best to support him, as this was all very new for him and he has major anxiety issues and a very low self esteem.

Mike is very easy-going, funny, introverted, sweetly awkward person, whom I have grown to love dearly over time. He has always been very kind to me in every aspect. He takes care of me, he is affectionate, he tells me he loves me and appreciates me. Overall, he was the ideal boyfriend, and I truly see and wish for a future with him. We've worked a lot on our relationship, since he had no experience and he wanted to ""keep up"" (his words) with mine. I always thought this to be a great quality, the way we would discuss relationships in general, do's and dont's, boundaries, money, social etiquettes and so on.

I am beginning to feel that Mike has grown accustomed to having a girlfriend, and even though I know he loves me, I think he as fallen out of love with me. He used to insist on spending as much time together as possible, he would be excited to do even house chores with me, but lately he always prefers to stay at his place, and even at times I've aksed him for help with something, he will spend time at home chilling instead. This might be just me reading too much into it, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I think the fact that I'm still studying and stay home a lot while he's working has changed the way he sees me. He used to ""admire me"", as he often said, we used to have long and deep conversations on basically anything, but for about a year now he constantly defies anything I say, and I have to resolve to proving to him that I *know what I'm saying*. 

This varies from political facts, to details of our last discussions. For example, I was talking about a politician who has switched political parties, and he would just not ""believe"" I was right, even though I'm very politically interested and he doesn't even know the name of our Prime Minister. I had to Google it to prove it to him, and even then he just shrugged it off instead of apologizing or something. Another thing is how he constantly battles me when I point out that we had agreed on something, or how we will always forget plans we made and he even insists ""we never talked about this."". For example I've told him I had a doctor's appointment and I asked him beforehand to drive me, but then he completely ""forgets"" (?) everything and says I never told him of any appointments. This is really frustrating.

Mike is also pretty slow when it comes to understanding basic concepts, or following heavy topics. He was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyscalculia when he was little, but his parents never worked with him on these. He just needs some more time to grasp things, and requires repetitions when you explain something to him. That isn't to say he's dumb, it's just a fact which I also love about him- he's an artist anyway, whatever he can't understand in words, he can draw on a paper or strum
on a chord.

Now, I'm here for objective advice, so there's no point in sugar coating anything, so I'll be as honest as I can: I have a pretty big personality, and I'm very assertive as a person. I'm strong minded and stubborn, and a very confident and analytical person. I consider all of the above a double edged proverbial sword, especially because I know I'm a very inpatient person who can lose her temper quicker than I'd like to admit. I have snapped many a time, because he gets lost in his thoughts or focuses solely on some minor detail while the whole discussion has evolved greatly.

Also, this past April I lost my Dad, completely out of the blue, and I've been devastated ever since. He was my best friend and quite frankly the best Dad there was, and I'm struggling to get used to the fact that this amazing man is gone. This hasn't helped with my temper and my patience, and even though the first month Mike was very understanding, after I consciously tried to work on getting used to it and getting my self together, he seemed to completely ""forget"" that I was still mourning and well, hadn't gotten *over it*. I had to explain to him twice since that I can't be as cheerful and happy, and that I'm sorry I can't joke around and smile/laugh as often as I did. Yet, he still pushes me, and my buttons.

But anyway, back to the every-day life.

This past month I've asked him more times than I wanted to **ask** to stay the night with me, but he always stayed at his place. I've even asked for help with several things, and he dodged, or ""forgot"". It has made me very sad, but I don't want to be demanding. I've asked if everything is okay or if anything has changed, to which he assures me that all is well and he loves me, and nothing has changed. But the facts do not support that. There's so many small and big details that I take into account, and that's why I resorted in coming here for help. It seems like he doesn't put the effort anymore to work with me. Some days I wonder if he even knows me, if he cares anymore.

We also haven't had sex in about a month. I've lost 5kg (11lbs?) and then gained 10kg (22lbs?) since my Dad passed, I've also become really self conscious about that too, whereas I used to be really comfortable in my skin. I just can't help but think that on top of all, he doesn't find me attractive anymore either.

Because I know people are going to recommend therapy, I really really really wish I could. I can't afford it at the moment, not by a long shot. I'm saving as much as I can so I can afford it in the near future, but until then, I'm lost.

I guess what I'm looking for is suggestions on how to handle this whole thing with Mike, since the times I've tried to talk to him about it either he battles me, or he swears everything is okay and promises he will put more effort in things, but then a week later tops, it's the same. I feel ashamed to even bring this up again, and I'm embarrassed to ask him to stay with me/help me out again. Any insights on whether I'm losing it and completely on the wrong are most welcome too.

I'm very sorry if this was more of a rant, but I don't open up to my friends as much as I probably should, and this is the first time I've ""told"" anyone what's been going on in my head. So thank you so much to whoever read this, and I'm looking forward to basically *anything*. I can answer any question you have, since I doubt I was very coherent :)

Episode 32: Love Toboggan

1.	Love Toboggan. A toboggan is some kind of sled, apparently, so… they’re going sledding? While it’s autumn? Sure, why not… 
2.	Does Sara usually wear a full-body costume like that? Also, did I ever mention before that something about her face is… different, compared to the facial styles of Milo, Melissa and Zack? I don’t know. 
3.	Sara is apparently very bad at keeping secrets. Good to know. And she’s going on a date with Neal from the comic shop, which is also good to know, because… reasons. 
4.	Apparently the rest of Murphy’s (and Zack and Melissa, of course) are indeed going up to the hills to go sledding, judging from those outfits. 
5.	Of course Milo and his father would hate concrete. And of course Milo made a list of all the things that can go wrong with snow. Not all of them equally disastrous. 
6.	Giant snowman, of course. 
7.	Well, Neal seems decent at first sight. 
8.	Ah, this is just Sara day-dreaming about what could go wrong. I was about to say that although Sara’s story was kind of rambly, that was no reason for Neal to walk out on her right away. She really is a lot like Candace. 
9.	‘It’s not a to-do-list’. Zack, I think you might as well make it one to get it over with. 
10.	A spare ski really is a good idea. As is Zack’s thought of reading that list ahead of time, but as Milo says, ‘What fun would that be?’ 
11.	‘What are they running from?’ (Next scene) ‘Get out of the way, you stupid wolf!’ 
12.	Sara Murphy *is* Candace Flynn. 
13.	‘Large sheet of metal, on a cold incline, covered in ice. And *we* think it’s a good idea to slide down.’ Where would we be without Zack’s snarkiness? 
14.	Thanks for the five-second-foreshadowing, two random guys. 
15.	Well, they got down the *incline* all right. That counts for a lot, right? 
16.	The smokestack exploding because of Martin Murphy throwing all those free samples in the fire, while his son and his friends were on it, is so absolutely random. 
17.	I suppose that land speed record is about to get shattered. 
18.	Okay, that mood whiplash just made this very randomly sad. This is more like the jokes they’d pull on Gravity Falls than on Phineas and Ferb. Remember Big Henry, anyone? 
19.	Sara Murphy is Candace Flynn, but *worse*. At least her mental images never fought swordfights. 
20.	There’s a special quail brake on the train. That’s… that’s nifty. 
21.	‘Those aren’t quails, they’re partridges! Get outta here!’ 
22.	I hadn’t noticed before that the diner downtown was called ‘Diner Downtown’. And in retrospect it was inevitable that Milo, Zack and Melissa would end up crashing Sara’s date not-date. 
23.	…or not. Jay for Milo doing his best not to crash his sister’s date! And trying to avert a crash, I suppose. Although given that Sara and Neal already left… 
24.	‘Please sir, just don’t hurt the commemorative plaque!’ 
25.	Well, apparently Neal is a good match for Sara, then. 
26.	And there are Milo and their friends to crash the date anyway. Not particularly surprising at this point. 
27.	Neal/Sara is pretty cute. Milo’s song helps. 
28.	Aww. 
29.	Poor Mrs. Murphy. And this was a sweet episode. I think I liked this one better than the previous (not that that one was bad, it was pretty good). Neal really *fits* with Sara, if you get what I mean. In a way, say, Jeremy Johnson didn’t quite fit with Candace. He could be an interesting character if done right (although they probably shouldn’t make him *too* similar to Sara either, because that just gets boring). 

Episode 33: The Island Of Lost Dakotas

1.	Well, I suppose this episode will take on an island, and Dakota will get lost. It might cause Cavendish to reflect on their awkward friendship? Maybe they’ll even have an argument and that’s why he gets lost? I don’t know. 
2.	There are actually plenty of people and things in the intro that I never really noticed before, despite having watched this intro over thirty times now. Heck, Elliot is there, Milo’s parents, Sara (very distant in the background and you have to pause the episode, but I noticed her), Mrs. Murawski… I wonder whether there are any significant characters who aren’t in the intro. 
3.	Ah, so that’s what a corn dog is. I’ve been low-key wondering that for years without bothering to look it up. 
4.	So Cavendish regularly dies and Dakota goes back to prevent his deaths? That’s… that’s dark. I wonder whether that ever happens the other way around. I suppose Dakota would have known about it, since Cavendish isn’t the type who would keep that quiet. 
5.	Thanks for the flashback, guys, but I did remember that Hamisaur thing. 
6.	‘It’s a long story.’ ‘How long?’ ‘About eleven minutes.’ I am not surprised. Why am I not surprised. 
7.	You know, I wonder whether when Milo is nervous about something (like laced shoes) the others might not be better off taking his advice. But apparently Zack’s hamisaur obsession is just too great. The blame is on you if this goes wrong, Underwood. 
8.	I would argue that the other Dakota sticking around is not how time travel works (nor is talking about it to random old ladies on a bus) but this is Milo Murphy’s Law, and it shares a universe (and thus time travel rules) with Phineas and Ferb. Neither of whom have ever cared much about connecting the two subjects of ‘time travel’ and ‘common sense’. 
9.	…seriously, Cavendish? Seriously? At least in that lava case he should know Dakota saved his life. Like with the space scenario. I mean, the guy has to have more common sense than that, right? 
10.	(Admittedly, many of them are just plain bad luck.) 
11.	Interesting that Dakota doesn’t answer whether he cares about Cavendish, just ‘he’s Cavendish’. I’m sure he does care, though. 
12.	With that ship attendant, I’m pretty sure that’s Irving’s voice. Well, Jack McBrayer. 
13.	Actually it’s the captain, and by now I know it’s him. You know, I wonder why it’s often been the slightly more peripheral actors from PnF that have shown up (aside from Povenmire himself, of course, and apparently Alyson Stoner at some point… and Vincent Martella unrecognizably voicing Bradley. Okay, that just leaves Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Ashley Tisdale, kind of defeating my point. But it would be nice if they recognizably showed up sometimes, that’s all what I’m saying.) 
14.	 Little Sara and Milo are adorable. I think I’ve said this before, but I wonder how many years apart they are. 
15.	No Zack, that does indeed not make any sense. None of this makes sense. You’re thirty-three episodes in, how have you not noticed that before? 
16.	Okay, that first Dakota really could have picked a better spot to hide away until death than such an impenetrable place. 
17.	I would not be surprised if all these tribesmen are just Dakota himself, dressed up to play a prank on the newcomer. Or they’re part of a real tribe that really can’t stand Dakota’s. 
18.	The masks look fake enough that I’m tempted to put my bets on the first scenario. 
19.	Yup. And those are a lot more Dakotas than I expected. 
20.	Let us just reflex about how this is an episode in which one half is about a guy being duplicated endlessly through time travel anomalies and then ending up on an island with all his counterparts, while the other is about teens getting tied to a truck carrying a giant dinosaur made out of ham, with shoelaces, and with a lot more being attached on the way. What even is this show. Phineas and Ferb was sane in comparison, and that’s saying a lot. 
21.	I, for one, do remember the runaway antique fire truck. 
22.	So, this is the mayor of Milo’s home town – who’s entirely used to his antics. I still don’t think we know what the town is actually called. 
23.	Using the shoelaces to do that was pretty impressive, Milo. 
24.	‘Did you know those plastic things on the ends of shoelaces are called ‘aglets’?’ Because it wouldn’t be a MML episode without making a Phineas and Ferb reference at a random moment. 
25.	Of course Milo orders his shoes from the Dakota’s. That… that makes sense. 
26.	Cannibal Dakota, Really Smelly Dakota, and Birthday Suit Dakota. For some reason this made me laugh. 
27.	I do wonder what Cavendish would think about this. And yeah, what did he do to deserve all that effort? Makes me less surprised that some people apparently ship them. 

Episode 34: Fungus Among Us

1.	Fungus Among Us? That refers to plants again. 
2.	And this is an unusual episode. Long, and it starts with a Milo-narrated recap. 
3.	Ah, the story of the 1965 adventure. And it’s quite unusual that Milo apparently knows he is in a TV show (not that breaking the fourth wall ever stopped Povenmire and Marsh before). 
4.	Well, that was a very convenient landing. 
5.	Thank you for your head exploding gesture, Melissa. I think that was long overdue by this point, but it’s good to see someone realizing how convoluted this is. 
6.	Also, ‘beware the intern’… wasn’t there something about an intern that they mentioned when they went to the creator of Dr. Zone to get that letter from Milo in the Pistachion-themed long episode? 
7.	Yeah, Milo is a pretty bad actor. 
8.	Nearly naked Dakota. Not something I particularly wanted to see, thank you very much. 
9.	Yes Diogee, this is one adventure on which you should actually stay home. 
10.	Actually, Zack, it can’t end badly because it already ended well! I think. 
11.	So Dr. Zone Files started as a show about a zoning commissioner. Wow. Just wow. 
12.	Yeah, that intern is weird. Although since Dakota and Cavendish warned us to beware of him, I wonder whether we just all misunderstood what they were saying. That’s how subverted humor generally works, after all. 
13.	Ah, that’s how Time Ape came about. 
14.	You know, I hadn’t realized that Milo was quite this much of a fan of Dr. Zone Files – not to the extent that Sara is, at least. 
15.	And Milo really shouldn’t be so star struck anymore after those two hours, considering that he just became the one who came up with all these awesome things about his favorite TV show. 
16.	I must agree with Melissa. Zack’s old band members coming back to kidnap them in an episode centered on Milo’s journey to the 1960s is indeed about a 78 on a weird scale of one to ten. 
17.	Ah, so the intern is involved with a pistachio plant? (Well, not involved with in the vernacular sense.) That’s intriguing. The plot thickens. 
18.	‘I thought we were doing good cop, bad cop.’ ‘And who were you, Dangerously Unstable Cop?’ The moment when Cavendish and Dakota both have more common sense than you is a moment you should be wary of, Milo. 
19.	Guy with a purple shovel is nice. 
20.	Well, apparently there really were good reasons to be wary of that intern. Very, very wary. 
21.	That’s where the present-hand comes from. A pistachio trying to cover up his appendage. That makes MML-style sense. 
22.	Who was Jody again? Also, more pistachios kidnapping people. I wonder whether Zack’s band now consists of undercover pistachios too. Somehow. 
23.	So Mr. Draco was a hidden pistachio? Well, I guess not all along… right? 
24.	After all, that would mean Amanda was a hidden pistachio all along, and she’s got too much of a personality of her own for that, not to mention that it would be weird for them to shut down Milo’s crush plotline at a moment when Milo isn’t even there. 
25.	Wait, is Diogee actually going home? This is really a bizarre episode in which everything goes wrong, then. 
26.	So… how many people in 1965 are hidden pistachios? 
27.	That was a pretty elaborate scheme. Which our heroes just ran out on. Yeah, nice job breaking it, villain. 
28.	Well, at least the Dr. Zone creator has weirdness to spare here. And if he’s going to use this, shouldn’t Milo know about an episode containing giant sentient plants? 
29.	I like how if we hadn’t seen the start of the episode, this side of that phone conversation would still sound natural. 
30.	Writing down ‘AAAA’ is pretty cool. 
31.	The car is even more of a wreck than it was before, but at least they are outside of the time stream. 
32.	Uh oh. I wouldn’t be running towards Zack and Melissa so fast if I were you Milo, because they don’t look natural. You know, those 1965 pistachios did a much better job blending in. 
33.	Well, at least Milo caught on that they’re plants. 
34.	Which doesn’t explain their attitude, or their unnatural smiles. 
35.	At least Sara is still all right. And ‘I thought my dog peed you out of existence’ is a very rare sentence indeed. 
36.	Well, it’s not like these plants could make Lard World any worse. 
37.	Dakota’s disguise plan was pretty good, but of course then he himself just had to ruin it. At least he’s a fast talker. 
38.	Cavendish and Dakota are right. Stopping this before it starts is the way to go. 
39.	‘So what did I say about Milo and a time machine?’ *Melissa hands Zack a dollar bill*. 
40.	‘Wait, wait. Diogee, do not go home. It’s not safe. Stay with us.’ That makes this both serious and adorable. 
41.	…did Dakota just eat tiny sentient pistachio plants? 
42.	I wondered for a moment whether Professor Time was actually Milo, but he would have recognized the home address in that case. I wonder whether he’s someone they know nevertheless? 
43.	‘Is that what you call being brilliant?’ ‘Hey, it works in the movies.’ 
44.	Milo does sound like an agent of Lard World sometimes. 
45.	Giant mutated pistachio. Sure, why not. 
46.	Milo Murphy’s Guide to How to Provoke Pistachio Monsters. Clever plan, nonetheless. I see where this is going. 
47.	Yep. And that worked out as well as it possibly could have. 
48.	Well, this is all setting up for a cliffhanger of some proportions. 
49.	Looks like professor Time’s house was already infiltrated by the pistachios. 
50.	…well. I was *not* expecting to see Heinz Doofenshmirtz there. I mean, I had heard of the PnF crossover of course, and even that there was going to be a quick clip of Doof in MML, but I did *not* see it coming there. 
51.	Wow. Mind blown. Also, is it just me or does Doof looks slightly different in MML-style than in PnF style? 
52.	There is so much to analyze here. So Doof lives here, in the same town as the Murphys and everything else… it all depends, I suppose, on how long it’s been in-universe since Phineas and Ferb ended. Wow. This is awesome. I can’t imagine what it was like for those who didn’t know it was coming at all. 
53.	And since there’s still one episode left until I’m up to date, I’m guessing that that one takes place in a different time? Like a flashback? I mean, right now I can’t see the crossover as being anything other than the heroes from PnF teaming up with the heroes from MML to fight the new army of pistachios (there is something especially ridiculous about Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Heinz and Perry etc. fighting pistachios, as if bringing in characters from a slightly less zany franchise shows how wacky this premise is. Emphasis, of course, on ‘slightly’). Whom I was fully expecting to be a one-off comeback villain until I realized about two minutes before the ending that there was no way this would end here. Wow. I’m not even sure how to judge the specific episode – I suppose it was good. It’s all been pretty good, lately. And this show is so different from Phineas and Ferb in that it has a continuity in which major things shift. I imagine that that was something Povenmire and Marsh really needed to get used to at first. 

Episode 35: Halloween Scream-A-Torium

1.	For some reason it took me forever to get to this, but at least after this I’m fully up to date, at least for a month or two. 
2.	A Halloween special. I really should have watched this two weeks earlier… oh well. I mean, I knew that after how the last episode ended, it was going to have to be out of the continuity line somehow. I would guess that there are three scary short stories? Let’s see. 
3.	Vampiric Milo looks really strange. And as always, half the fun of Halloween episodes with shows like this is how all the tropes from horror stories get lampshaded and parodied. 
4.	Good that our narrator helps us stay focused. And of course Sara dressed up as Dr. Zone. I mean, it’s Sara. 
5.	Melissa is right. No more bets. And I suppose from that point of view, they might as well enter an unsafe truck, because every truck that Milo enters is unsafe by default, right?  
6.	Yeah, Zack is remarkably uncostumed. 
7.	“Aren’t we a little too old” – wrong show to ask age-related questions, Zack. 
8.	Like I said before, Sara is… well, Sara. 
9.	Okay, that would have at least startled me. Zack’s composure is most impressive. 
10.	Zack has a Halloween-related traumatizing backstory? Why not. 
11.	Yeah, it’s always important to keep zombies and vampires separate. Also, who wants to bet that everything in here is going to fail to frighten Zack, but Murphy’s Law will? Yeah, Melissa is right. No more bets. 
12.	‘I’ve heard this dream before, she says no.’ ‘Well, she might have said yes this time!’ ‘In your dreams.’ ‘Well, yes, obviously, but now we will never know!’ This is both funny and very relatable. Poor Cavendish. 
13.	The last Halloween? One would think that’s a mystery worth solving more than the pistachios. Maybe that should have been their mission from the start. Will Halloween’s demise be Murphy-related? 
14.	Poor Brick and Savannah. Still, it’s impressed that they somehow got dressed in costume under the snow. 
15.	Those time grenades are so going to backfire on everyone. 
16.	The ghastly chamber of ghastliness? Really? 
17.	‘It’s so terrifying I can hardly believe we’re just sitting in Milo’s driveway.’ Yeah… you should have known that you were never going to stay there for long. Now I wonder whether this’ll be one of those episodes in which all sorts of freakish things happen to the truck but no one inside is the wiser, Zack isn’t scared, and the truck somehow ends up back home with Zack not scared at all, and then maybe he ends up scared by something minor? That’s an honest guess, no foreknowledge involved at this point. Just genre savviness. 
18.	Sara is afraid of a lot, it seems. 
19.	That contrast between the music around the truck and Elliot’s bike, though. 
20.	All those Mr. Draco-related jokes, though. 
21.	It’s great that there’s a kid with a platypus costume. 
22.	Well, at least Dakota and Cavendish are perceptive enough to realize that they got the holiday wrong (albeit in a very funny way). 
23.	Of course this would be what the song is all about. It’s decent, and it somehow feels very Phineas and Ferb-y. And it’s, as always, impressive, that Povenmire keeps Dakota’s voice so distinctly Dakota’s and not Doofenshmirtz’s even while singing a song. 
24.	And of course they dress up as Phineas and Ferb, too. Why not? 
25.	Well, this is the moment where the trip really goes sour. 
26.	I guess I was wrong. Zack did find out. Maybe in a twist, none of the others will and they won’t believe that he’s traumatized about what really happened but they’ll think it was about something inside the truck after all? 
27.	Nope – Milo, at least, also figures it out. 
28.	It’s called a cliffhanger. Nice use of it. And I suppose that means it’s just the one-off, rather than the three short stories I expected. More like Excaliferb than Tri-State Trilogy of Terror, then. 
29.	Of course you’re not the man, Zack. It wasn’t even your backpack, remember? 
30.	Well, at least Melissa and Sara are enjoying themselves. 
31.	Those two don’t know everything about each other, apparently. And I’m pretty sure dragging an entire truck back up a cliff like that isn’t actually possible. 
32.	Like I said, at least Melissa and Sara are enjoying themselves. ‘The girls’ as Zack put it, which reminds me that this is a familiar pattern from PnF in episodes where it would be Phineas-Ferb-Candace-Isabella. Main heroes, plus main character’s older sister, plus girl who might have crush on main character. (Okay, with Isabella it was never ambiguous. Still, the pattern is there, isn’t it?) 
33.	When will Elliot ever become genre savvy enough to realize that Milo and Zack aren’t actually trying to commit safety violations? That they are on a runaway truck? 
34.	Swapped pumpkins? Time for Dakota and Cavendish to realize and panic in three, two, one… 
35.	Although Cavendish is right to chew Dakota out for ten minutes, they could have spent those ten minutes, you know, finding the pumpkin with the time grenade. 
36.	Isn’t there some sort of tracking device on the time grenade? 
37.	I love Zack’s expression and Milo’s casual attitude as they wipe the candy off with the windshield wipers. 
38.	And the ‘Empty Warehouse’. 
39.	Don’t you guys live near Danville, Sara? You shouldn’t be surprised by the laws of physics being broken. 
40.	Zack, you shouldn’t respond to a lot of these things. 
41.	At least Mort is self-aware enough to know they are bad at planning parties… and Milo, Zack, Sara and Melissa are there to help them out. 
42.	Glad to see everyone likes the truck, even if none of that candy is really, you know, edible anymore. 
43.	Of course Dakota was going to miss catching the time grenade. Cavendish’ facial expression makes it. This would be a good ‘people who have never seen this show explain what’s happening’ screenshot. 
44.	So Dakota and Cavendish caused leap years. That’s great. And I love the visit to Rome and ‘beware the Ides of March’. Even if the ides was technically not a holiday. 
45.	Is Sara even scared just from looking at *Milo* now? 
46.	Yeah, Zack really should have put more trust in Milo’s ability to terrify him. 
47.	This show is so random. And I’ve really come to enjoy the theme song – opening and ending version – by now. 
48.	This episode was pretty good, by the way. Zack certainly learned some morals about horror, the girls remained oblivious throughout, and I didn’t manage to guess all the plot twists. It was fun and entertaining. And now I’m really curious how next year’s fight against the Pistachions will play out. Although I did hear there’s a Christmas episode first, so that ought to be good too.

I'm a Computer Science major, never liked it, but stuck with it because it is a safe career path.  I've had 2 summers of well-paid internships, and hated every minute of it.  I always wanted to do acting, or to be a musician (though that is more of a hobby of mine), but I always thought that risking financial ruin by studying art or music at college was an idiotic move.  Well, after several epiphanies, my attitude has taken a 180, and I realize that I'd rather be poor and do what I love rather than be wealthy and do something I hate.

At this point however, it would be difficult to go into the direction of being an actor.  You don't exactly get much acting experience from sitting at a desk typing Java code.  I know that I have to take some type of action, so I'm wondering what steps I should take to make this dream a reality?

Should I tough it out and finish my degree, even if it takes 1 or more years to finish?  Should I tough it out even further and work in the Computer industry afterwards to build up enough money to move to L.A.?  Those options are what people mostly recommend to me, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of a better way.

7cjbea,1,2017-11-12,"Should I major in Journalism? Journalism undergrads/grads and/or professional journalists, please help!",marcosmmg,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/7cjbea/should_i_major_in_journalism_journalism/,"Hi, reddit. Howdy?



I'm an eighteen-year-old brazilian college student and recently I've been going through some major changes in my life. Changes both in the way I perceive the world around me and, as a matter of fact, in this very world of mine. 

To be more precise, I have discovered in myself an undisputedly stark passion for writing. Don't get me wrong: I've always enjoyed writing and I've managed to remain great at it over the years; in fact, my writing is the thing I value the most in myself and the thing I'm most proud of in myself. Something has changed, though. What was once a mere taste for writing has now (in the last two years or so) turned into a helpless passion. 

It is a passion so strong that my mental health rests upon it (dealing with generalized anxiety has never been so tough), or at least I've recently come to think so. Plus I have discovered inside me this HUGE need to see the world up close; it is as if there is an infinite amount of stories/perspectives out there just waiting to be told and I feel like I have to be chasing them there in the open in order to tell them. 

It feels like a calling, to be honest. 

This has led me into thinking I should major in Journalism. As of now I am firmly convinced that apart from journalism there are almost no other activities I can picture myself in. I've thought of becoming a scholar, as I once dreamed of, or going after a career in Law, as my folks think I should; both scenarios don't seem to appeal much to me, however. It seems like a major in journalism is the best choice. 

Yet, my question here still stands. Should I just go for it and major in journalism or should I consider other alternatives? The main criterium to be taken in account is usefulness: given that having a diploma is not necessary for you to be a journalist (at least here in Brazil; a good deal of the market has a degree in journalism though), is it worthy for me to major in journalism? 

I could double major, of course. There are plenty of other fields of knowledge that come in handy for a good journalist (and, personally, for someone who enjoys spending loads of time studying a subject): political sciences, economics, philosophy, law, literature. The list goes on and on; I just listed the ones I am most interested in. 

But double majouring requires a dispendable amount of time I am not so sure I have right now; or will have in a near future. You see: we all know that being a journalist is not about a diploma; it is all about having a restless, curious, independent, communicative spirit. And, therefore, I have to -- I just feel it -- start spending more time on that, which means, for instance: opening a personal blog and investing on it; applying for job posts at newsletters and local newspapers; vloging; freelancing; or even start acting as an independent reporter. All of this requires precious time and pursuing another major could most certainly take this time away from me. 

Also, double majoring would most probably not allow me to get an internship, which is vital. Again, it is a matter of time. 

Then, we come back to the same question. Provided that double majoring is hardly an option, will I spend my time more wisely majoring in journalism or majoring in something else? 

Yep. That's one hell of a dilema. 





My fellow /r/journalism redditors, this is where you come in. I am certain you've all been through this -- some of you may even have felt represented by the summary above. And I am also certain this was not easy for any of you either. So, you might deduce, I could REALLY use some advice from you guys right now (that's why I came here haha). 

Apart from giving me your opinion on whether I should major in journalism, it would be extremely helpful if you could add here a bit of your stories as journalists (how did you start working as a journalist, how was your first experiences like etc) and a little briefing of how did you get to settle this dispute when you were considering a major in journalism back when you were undergrads. Anything extra you might come up with would also be great (and rewarded with a cookie of your choice)! 

I thank you all in advance. Really looking forward for your replies ;)"
7cjepi,4,2017-11-12,Entry level job help,sir_gwain,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7cjepi/entry_level_job_help/,"Hello, I'm currently wrapping up my third semester towards getting an A.S. in IT with a 3.9 GPA and I really want to get a job in IT help desk or something of that sort. I don't currently have any certifications other than being TestOut PC Pro certified, which was a part of one of my classes. Basically the same stuff that's in the A+ so I do feel that I could go and study and then take the A+ and pass. 


However, I'd really like to start applying for (And hopefully land) a job, or even an internship as I've been in fast food management for 3 years now. If it helps I'm in the Indianapolis area. 


So I guess my question is: Do I really need to get an A+ before I can get a job? If so, how long would you advise I study before I take it? Lastly, is there anything I should be sure to brush up on before an interview for a help desk position?

**tl;dr**: been part of a campus group for 3 years. newcomer seizes opportunity, gains recognition, and hogs power and opportunity through self interest. how do i (and others) prove ourselves in this environment?

Hi all, this is regarding Me (21F) with my school friend  (Brad, 20M) regarding our work and involvement with a non-profit for which we are affiliated with on our college campus.



About three years ago, I joined a campus group that was an affiliate of a non-profit that dealt with a pretty specific social justice/advocacy cause. While historically it has been ignored, it's recently gained momentum and is a hotly debated issue. I've been passionate and interested in this issue for a while and was happy to join the group and contribute my best. The focus of the group is academic, and we mostly work with the executive branch to raise awareness about the issues through panels and speaker's series, as well as fundraising.



**Year 1**

Due to my dedication, a few years later I became the leader of the group. Now, this particular issue had not been that popular and so our membership was quite low. There were maybe 5 students in total working with me. Two of them were quite unreliable, and one was completely uninterested and flaky. One was reliable, and the last was Brad. Brad had joined half a year before I became leader. It was clear to me he was very capable and passionate on the same level as me. I appreciated and liked that side of him. So, it was no surprise I gave him more responsibility in the group (chairing panels, etc). One of the reasons I joined this group was to network, and develop some professional skills. Historically, the leader has been working quite closely with the executive branch so I was pleased with how my trajectory seemed to be going. Thus, when a new opportunity came up for a chapter member to ""extern"" with the main branch, collaborating with other chapter ""externs"" in the process -- in order to improve the unity of our organization, I offered it to the team, not wanting to hoard all the opportunities.




As per my prediction, Brad volunteered for the position. I gladly forwarded him to the appropriate executive and all seemed going well. The programming I planned were mildly successful, and I think I really tried hard. The issue was our club was still not that popular, due to the nature of the issue. What's more is that other team members wanted independence to plan events and ideas as well. So for the last half of the year, I trusted my teammates to plan some events, while providing guidance. None of them got anything done, and as the year dragged on and they flaked, nothing happened at all. I was disappointed in them, and also in myself. Meanwhile, Brad was working on a large conference with one of the other college's ""externs"". He asked us to put off our own panel, to support his. The conference ended up being mildly successful as well. 




Brad ended up working with the executive branch much closely than I did. In fact, he ended up becoming an intern for them and now is on the board as a director. It seems the ""extern"" opportunity opened up a lot of doors for him and I feel quite bitter about it. I think I did well in my capacity as campus leader, not perfect of course, but in the situation I definitely tried my best. Brad is very close and chummy with the executive branch, and what's more is the executive branch no longer has an interest in being involved personally with our own chapter beyond him (before, they had a mentor style relationship with us). I knew Brad was a great guy, and so I offered the leader position to him when I discussed ramping up his responsibility the previous year (before ""externship""). He suggested both of us could be co-leaders in the next year. I agreed.



**Year 2**

Brad introduced a lot of changes. He brought in a whole new team, we planned an intensive programme over the summer for the next year together. Everything was going fine, combined with the fact that our issue has gained momentum socially, we have done quite well. I still felt bitter about how he had gotten recognized by the branch through the extern opportunity and told him I'd appreciate the extern opportunity this year. He gave it to one of his friends, saying I'd have more than enough chance to personally develop. I brushed it off and decided I could prove myself some other way this year. I made it this far, and developing these relationships were really important to me and where I wanted my future to go.




It's been about 4 months working like this with Brad. He is very ambitious. He's bottle-necked and controlled almost everything. For example, when working on a file together, he might erase one section written by another person and completely replace it. This has been an issue with other members, where he undermines their work (ignoring their submitted drafts and uploading his own). Furthermore, he is taking a very hands-on approach, involved in everything and ends up moderating and chairing every conference. He micromanages every team and takes on a lot of duties for himself. He bottlenecks communication to the main branch. One of the things he said was he wanted to empower the team to have the same opportunities he did. From what I see, that's not happening and it often feels like a one-man show. He is incredibly patronizing, authoritative, and is largely directed by self-interest.





I want to be in the same position as him. I want to have the opportunity to have responsibility and chair panels and events. I want to become closer to the executives in the same way he has. I can't see how to do this when he acts as a blockade to all my initiatives suggestions/ takes them over for himself. The executives themselves put a large amount of trust in him (rightfully so, due to all his work with them) and I see it impossible to be recognized by them. I realize waiting around for opportunity will get me nowhere, but he suffocates any attempt of mine. I've sunk three years of commitment into this organization. What can I do? We've tried bringing this up, he says he will shift responsibilities but it ends up sliding back to square one.


Brad and I are not very close. He's quite asocial.

I already have a bachelor's in art so finishing my degree wasn't too much of a concern really, honestly I just went back to school in hopes of getting the job I now have.

However, after doing this job day in and day out, especially for artists, the crunch is bad 80hr work weeks and the pay...it's alright, but I'm only just about making what my friends who went into programming are making and they don't have to work insane hours.

Also...doing programming and being in vfx, the way the tech is going, I feel like my job will be less and less reliant on pure artists who can work a program and rely more on artists that can make a program.
I was thinking of going back to school for programming and moving in with my parents to try and finish up quickly and then move forward with maybe a masters then finally a job on the engineering side of...anything really- not just video games.

I've talked with a couple of people at my current studio and a former boss who's now a senior lead at another AAA studio and the suggestion seems to be to stay working and learn practical stuff on my own time or if I really want the degree...do it while I work.

most schools in california don't do 2nd degrees, so it would have to be as a master's, but for that, they want you to have a bachelor's in cs, if not the coursework. which, i'm thinking if I'm going to do the courses, I might as well move back with my folks, and get the bachelor's...

I'm 26 right now, so...kinda old, but finishing my degree would only take about two years so wouldn't be too bad if I do full-time.

So, just wondering...what would y'all suggest?"
7cjtiu,2,2017-11-12,Confession: My sins,temp420111,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/7cjtiu/confession_my_sins/,"I saw someone made a confession about his degenerate life, got to say that’s pretty fucked up, but I also did the same things or maybe worse than him. So, I wanted to make a confession here about what I have done in the past.
First of all, I’m just ordinary 25 yo asian guy with average looking. We all know most us here are degenerate person, but are you degenerate enough to call yourselves a degenerate? Have you ever done something very pervert/indecent/sinful things in your life? Im sure we all fap, peeps, watch porn, vanilla sex (at least for western) or doing something which pretty much common things for us guys. But I did very terrible things in my life, so here are my sins;

My first sin
Back in the high school graduation we had a small party. Almost half of my classmates were coming. We were sleepover in our friend, with 7 girls and 6 guys. I drug them all. I put 3 strong sleeping pills in the syrup bowls, I got it from my degenerate pharmacist cousin, with a condition I have to video my act. And yes, around 10 pm they all got sleepy. Around 1 am I raped all the girls, took pictures of their pussies, asses, tits, lick and suck them etc. I noticed they all virgins so I fucked their asses instead. I came 5 times that night, what a bliss memory (Shit! I’m hard right now). Next morning only 1 girl feeling hurt in her ass. I didn’t video anything but still keeping all the pictures in my google drive, until now :D

Second sin
I made a friend in my first day of collage, we were very close, every weekend I usually sleepover at his house, play games, watch porn, fap together, etc. He has a little sister, a 6th grader. She was so cute and so attached to me cause I can do a few magic tricks, that was how I awakened my lolicon fetish. One day she found us watching porn while jerking off together. I immediately noticed her and stopped my business and my friend just scram her out. The next day she asked me about that. I showed her a porn in my laptop, she wanted more. During the night when my friend already sleeping I always sneak out to her room. We watch porn together, every time I lost myself I just mount her and press my thing on her ass, and she don’t mind that. I teach her kissing thou I’m noob too (0 girlfriend). I lick her pussy every time, rub my dick on it but no sex, yet. Sometimes I think about what if we got found out? I definitely going to get beaten and going to jail, but I lost myself every time I saw her little cunt (Shit! I’m hard gain!). 

Third sin
During my second year, my friend got a girlfriend and so did I. Unfortunately, I lived in the country which the majority of the girls won’t have sex before married, ofc there are some easy girls willing to give their virginity for money/so called- true-love from trash guys, and my girlfriend was on the first side. One day we had double date and rented a villa, and again I drug them all just like what I did 2 years ago. At midnight I was about to rape my girlfriend, but I didn’t do it, I felt bad. But then I saw my friend’s girlfriend thigh, I got horny, so I touch her, play with her, then I noticed she’s not virgin anymore, “That fucked bastard already fucked her while I’m still whining to my girlfriend!”. So, I fucked her, this was my first time pussy, finally I lost my virginity, I came twice. 5 months later I broke up with my girlfriend.

Fourth sin
This is the continuation of the second sin. We still doing our weekly basis. She’s on 2rd year junior now. I’m going out with her behind my friend, and finally I fucked her. For the first time in my life, I fell in love. I graduated from my collage, I was planning to tell my friend about our relationship and propose her after her graduation from high school. I got a job, then I told my friend about our relationship, I don’t know what was I thinking that time but I also told him that I took her virginity, and I’m ready to take full responsibilities and marry her. But things did not end well, he beat out of me pretty bad, while he punching my face he was crying babbling out about “traitor” and “karma”, can’t hear well, talking about karma I wonder if he also fucked his girlfriend’s sister, I remember she has one, 2 years younger. I’m lucky enough his parents are out, otherwise I may also get beaten by his dad and going to jail. The next day I went to his house for apology, I got beaten again. I called his sister but out of reach, apparently, he changed her number. For the first time in my life I got broken heart. I gotta say it was very painful feelings, sometimes I cried on my own. I quit my job and became a NEET for a year, spent most of my time surfing internet.

-I love everything about japan, so I took a full course Japanese lesson for a year so I can live there.
-Now I live in Japan, most of my fellow otaku friends from collage work here as internship in some company. They helped me a lot, now I’m feeling better.
-I made an acquaintance with AV director hahaha :lol: 
-I’ve been in soap land (amazing experience!)
-I bought a virgin JK from a guy in Akihabara and fucked her (sooo expensive!)
-I made a friend with handsome lolicon Japanese guy who like to buy a loli girl (a legal loli, at least that was he said). Told him about my past, he praised me and letting me see his collections. 32 videos, 11 different girls (in case you wanted to know :P).
-I spoke with Toyosaki Aki once (it’s worth mentioning!)
-I’m still NEET, but I have like $1,7 million (My currency to USD) in the bank account, before my grandpa passed away he gave me this ""rat-account"" (go watch wolf of wall street 10/10 funny degenerate movie) and I periodically transfer the money to my own account. Before retired, he was working in government, a powerful person. And Im 100% sure this is illegal money. He loved me very much, in fact he was the only one knew what kind of person I am. 
-Lastly, you might be thinking I live in a bliss, but no, sometimes I feel lonely. I always dreaming about if I could meet a woman that could change my life, I would stop doing this.

I'm finishing up my last semester at a top school for CS, but I'm barely going to graduate. I really struggled thru school for various reasons but either way, my GPA is ~2.3-2.4, and it's not low because of breadths - I did poorly in some technical classes as well.

I worked at a big name company this past summer, but turn around time is slow, and the department I was in has limited resources to hire; aka no guarantee of return offer, but I'm confident good rec from manager. I've interviewed at a couple places for a full time position but nothing panned out; need to work on interviewing.

Anyways, in the mean time, I'm looking for resources to find a recruiter to get me in contact with companies/get interviews - I'm in the Bay Area and I haven't been able to find any; the ones I've looked at seem to all be for other fields, while I'm specifically interested in embedded systems, and really not interested in web dev/AI/etc.

Thanks!

**TLDR**: Bay Area soon-to-be-grad looking for recruiting agencies to match me with entry level position in embedded systems; low gpa, mediocre projects (class), but recent internship @ big name company in embedded systems"

I am a student (from the NorthEast,USA) who is currently in Butte, Montana on an internship, and will be leaving this area of the country on the 22nd (Wed before Thanksgiving).  A friend mentioned that I should go to Yellowstone and explore the area.  I've been trying to look into how to explore it and what I would need, but have been having difficulty finding information for the winter season (as it seems everyone on reddit goes during the summer). 

I was planning on driving early in the morning on Saturday, Nov. 18, and spending all day there.  However, I have run into issues with which entrances are open, and am generally overwhelmed with the prospect of trying to fit as much of yellowstone as I can on this trip.  A lot of what I have read says I should spend more time, but as a poor college student, I am trying to conserve my finances.  If it really isn't that much more expensive to go 2 days, I would definitely be open to that prospect.

Thank you in advance!

tldr; poor college student trying to make the most of his first experience in the NorthWest to explore Yellowstone National Park.  Please help with planning or suggesting 'must-see' places.  Thank you!"

I just switched to computer science last spring, and did a few summer courses. I am currently a senior, but it will take me an extra year to graduate. I am currently taking Data Structures, and Computer Architecture and Design. Next semester I will be taking 
-Artificial Intelligence
-Introduction to Software Engineering
-Algorithm Analysis
-Introduction to database systems
-Linear Algebra

The problem is when I look at internships, they list things that I will be learning in the spring, that I currently do not know. Should I still apply for the internships even if I do not have the skills yet, but will be actively learning them in the spring? I am not sure how to market myself on skills that I will be obtaining soon, rather than current skills.

Note: At my school we have intro to programming I and II. I had a bad professor for II and did not learn hardly anything including ""Polymorphism, Inheritance, exception handling, etc. How important is it that I learn these ASAP compared to say practicing C++/Java/ with algorithms.

7cl1nw,1,2017-11-13,I Might Have ADD? How Do I Go About Diagnosis in Ontario?,WhyShudAny1Know,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7cl1nw/i_might_have_add_how_do_i_go_about_diagnosis_in/,"So, the title does seem to have a really obvious answer but bear with me please.

TL;DR: I found out I may have ADD but I've been told that because many people sell drugs for it, a male my age may be seen as potentially scoring a supply for a new trade.

24 y/o, M, Canada.  No medical history of note aside from a list of minor injuries from stupid things.

I've always had issues focusing. When I was a teenager, I proposed that I might be ADD because of my struggles but my mother maintained that I was fine (never been tested).

**My Life Story**- Skip ahead if it doesn't matter

Home life was simple: do school work, handle the minimal chores you're given, maybe play a sport or instrument. I'd say I come from a privileged background.

I moved to Canada a few years ago for school. I had always lived with my family, had a vehicle to drive etc. Now I was living on my own, doing my own groceries, trying to be sure I followed up on my own school admin and immigration admin etc. It started out okay but before the end of my first semester, I was struggling. This wasn't the worst semester I had. I still got okay grades but definitely below average. This is of note because I'd previously graduated honours for my B.Sc. just months before. I struggled to get work done but I still scraped by. This did not seem like much of an issue at first. I thought nothing of it.

After that, I moved out to my own apartment and continued school. This is where things got tricky. I wasn't living on campus anymore so there were lots more bills etc and my roommates were juvenile so to avoid a bad credit score, I had to take on most responsibilities. 

Frankly, I got almost no work done. Not because I was struggling to keep up with bills either. I have calendar reminders and pre-authorized payments set up for everything. I even had the timing of each bill as such that I handled them all at once. But still, I could sit in front of my computer doing absolutely nothing but staring at it or outside. This was behaviour characteristic of my greatest determination to get work done. My brain was seldom idle. When I was in less of a panic about school and just""trying to do work"" I would be distracted by lot's of other things. I would work on one problem and get an idea for applying it in some other way or go read or watch videos on something else. It was intellectually productive but it was horrible for my life. 

The cycle continued and I got more and more stressed. This was combined with feelings of profound loneliness but I think that's possibly a cultural difference. Eventually I had some kind of emotional breakdown. It was quite scary. I was alone at the time and a childhood friend had just left my place. At the time, I thought my dysfunction was either mild depression or anxiety because of how active my mind was and how worried I was. I also found it difficult to start each day. I thought the episode was a panic attack but I went to a school counsellor who said they didn't think it was. We talked about balancing my mental, spiritual and physical health and I put in work to do that with some level of success.

Fast forward to my first job. A 6-month posting doing a job that was particularly easy for me. I moved house etc during this time and work was close to home.

Forward again. I'm taking on a more difficult role in my field and I'm not accomplishing anything. Much of my time is spent the same way: either catatonic in front of the screen or doing something else, despite how determined I am to achieve. My work ethic and ability to learn quickly has always been praised, when I did my internships before. I am capable but I make a ton of stupid mistakes and ask questions when the answer is right in front of me. It feels like I'm going crazy and I'm just embarrassing myself every single day. I just can't settle and push. I keep falling behind on my bills. I remember them at the most inopportune times and I end up paying rent a few days late and other bills can be much worse. A lot of my responsibilities, are frankly just not being handled and I know I can keep up but I still can't? I'm just not. But it always seems like I'm super busy....I just have nothing to show for it. When I go about one task it's like I follow a tree of activities. I branch further and further away from my original goal and never come back to it. I have dozens of web browser tabs open. Most, I don't get back to. It's like I don't handle one thing and then go to another. I try to do 10 at once but they're all related or interdependent somehow, so I follow that path. Writing it out sounds like stupidity right now.

I have always found that I am good at coming up with ideas and I can never finish them. I have tried many different approaches with no success. I have so many project files of ideas I have that I start and don't complete. Projects in my childhood home like building a fire pit that were never done. It took me months to string an electric fence around the property and it didn't get finished until a week before coming to Canada and my mother was on me to make it happen. It didn't work.

When I think about it....I have never started and finished anything on my own.

2 weeks ago, my mother calls and tells me that my brother's doctor told her to tell me that if I have focus issues, I should get it checked out. When I pushed, she said it was because my brother was diagnosed with ADD. He too, is at a similar age and stage in life and of course we had the same environment growing up. You would never have thought he could possibly be diagnosed with ADD but it turns out that since he moved out, he has faced extremely similar issues to what I do.

Doing some reading about it I thought ""wow, all the things I thought were depression and anxiety and complete dysfunction all seem to fit what I'm reading.""

Of course I know better than to try to self-diagnose. Everything always seems to fit.


**IMPORTANT PART**

But **I say all this to express that** I really do think I have a problem and I don't know how to get a fair diagnosis. It feels like if I go and be straightforward, I could be lumped in with drug dealers. If I don't be straightforward, I'll be lying and if I'm wrong about this, what if I get some other diagnosis?

I need to know how best to approach this. It would also be very helpful if someone know how to go about this in a way that OHIP covers it since I've never used it. I hope I don't have to tell this whole story again because my verbal communication rarely gives a complete picture. Do I go to a regular GP?

I really appreciate any help. Sorry this was so long.

7cl5q5,1,2017-11-13,A guy who has been in college for too long and feels lost on his motivation in a career path that he has studied for several years.,dmnlee,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7cl5q5/a_guy_who_has_been_in_college_for_too_long_and/,"I am 22-years old single male, currently in his 5th year of college studying Computer Science with a recently picked up minor of Computer Game Design and Development as an interest of mine. I am likely going to finish school in the Fall of 2018 which would total my time in school to be about 5.5 years. I'm in school for that long because I have failed some classes and went through some personal things with my motivation for college, and had picked up that minor out of interest.

In terms of work experience, I have an software developer internship(recently fired because I couldn't manage working an internship and go to school part-time) under my belt and a years worth of IT experience. I'm gonna also apply for an internship at a Game Company for the Summer for more professional experience.

I feel lost at the moment, not entirely sure if I want to be a software developer for the rest of my life after getting fired as it was difficult to learn the ropes which lead to my employment's end.

I started wanting to pick up new life experiences and explore more about myself and what my strengths and weaknesses are to really see whatever path in life is really viable for me.

I ended up getting a job as a chef at a restaurant working with a best friend from high school, because I wanted to have the experience of working in a kitchen. Which is going great and I really like it so far despite the low starting pay.

I also wanted to give my acting career one more chance as a film actor, I used to be a stage actor back in high school and in college performing for an acting troupe. Living in Atlanta, opportunities for the film industry has really grown now. So I want try again for a year and try to get into it more.

Mostly, I really want to study abroad for one year in another country as I have really wanted to get out of this country on my own for once in my life before I have to worry about a job and, bills to chain me down. Even though I would be in school for a total of 7 years. I have been blessed and fortunate enough to have a family that has been able to pay my way through school to the point where I have no college debt.

After my 5th year of college, I plan on asking my family to stop paying for school and I start will take out college loans to finance my dream of studying abroad so that I will no longer be a burden for them as they have supported me long enough.

When I think about it, the loans will not be as hard as most people in America as it would only be a year worth to carry for myself. Which is something that I am willing to make for myself to pay for.
I want to live out my youth and start picking up new experiences as much as I can before obligations of marriage, family, bills, and etc. will start hammering me down. I am young, single(never had a girlfriend and still a virgin). I don't think I have a whole lot in my life at the moment to stop me. 

When I am on my deathbed several decades from now, I want to be able to look back on my life not making regrets on opportunities that I took because, I didn't think I was good enough for it, or it wouldn't pay enough. 

Is this something that I really want to start doing for myself or just me being a reckless and inconsiderate millennial that should just buckle down and just graduate to get a job?!

Please let me know..."

Note: This is long. I do appreciate if you can get through this whole story. I said this at the end and just want to say it here. This is a story full of negative actions I have done. We have shared a lot of loving and fun times. Mostly all good. So I am sure you will come to the conclusion that I am a horrible person but It wasn’t all bad. Thank you for reading.

I was a bad kid in college. I started smoking pot first day of my freshman year (Fall 2009) and never stopped. By my sophomore year I started doing opiates, cocaine, hallucinations, Ketamine, benzos.. pretty much what ever I could get my hands on. I always told myself I wasn’t an addicted to drugs and I’d smoke weed every day of my life til I died. In April of 2014 my Oxy dealer ran out. A friend told be he could get some black tar heroin it was expensive and sketchy but I didn’t care. I went to this dealer and got some heroin.  I went home was hanging with friends when Mallory (a year younger than me 21 at the time) walked in. A very beautiful girl who was a friend of a friend. We were chilling talking and she mentioned to someone that she had tried heroin. I was intrigued and pulled her aside took her to my room and showed her the heroin I just bought. I asked her if she wanted to do it with me. She said yes and we got high (I have never injected and never will… we squirted in our noses). We spent the whole night talking, She told me about her life and what she wanted to do. I learned she had a horrible boyfriend and hated her current job. After the night was over I was crushing on her. We became friends who got high together. This went on for 2 months. 

The heroin started to affect me personally. It’s a horrible drug that really fucks you up. When the semester ended I decided to go home and get some help. I left college went home and Mallory called me telling me she loved me and wanted to get clean. She drove from college to my house about 4.5 hours and we shared our feeling and made love. We were clean for about 2 weeks. We spent the rest of the summer getting high. So to speed things up we returned to college still getting high, in November 2014 my family talked me into getting married to her. I bought a ring and developed a plan to ask her. I spent a lot of time planning this event. But she was so messed up from the drugs she didn’t even want to get out of bed. Which lead to a fight ending in me asking her to marry me. Horrible I Know it should have been my first clue. A few months go by and I was done with the hard drugs. I just wanted to smoke weed. I told her she needed to be clean to, we needed to grow up and be adults. She said okay but it was a lie. I would catch her using her friends as excuses to get high and started about a month long fight. Finally one day while she was out of town with her friend I took her stuff to her house. When she returned I told her to either get clean and be serious or give me the ring back. She gave me the ring back. Which ended our engagement. So now to move on. (February 2015)

While Mallory and I were fighting that last month I spent a lot of time with my friend Jackie (22 at the time) Little did I know Jackie became the true Love of my Life. The mistake Jackie made was falling for me as much as I did her to soon… I mean 2 days after Mallory and I ended things. This is where I started to really mess my life up. I didn’t quit doing drugs in fact Jackie and I began doing prescription pills and china white heroin together. But more responsibly. Wasn’t every day mostly on the weekends. I know it’s a crazy statement to make but we were more responsible but It didn’t help me make good decisions. Jackie’s lease was up and she needed a place to live, I offered my house and she moved in with me.  For a few weeks Mallory and I were still going through that “post break-up phase” I would sneak away and go have sex with Mallory and then go back to Jackie. Jackie had no clue and I kept it that way. I cheated. Well Jackie found out. Mallory ended up moving back to her home away from college and she was out of my life. Jackie was so upset she found a place to stay permanently at a friend’s house and moved out. I knew that Jackie was the one and was heart broken. I continued to do drugs and started to make a long series of Irrational decisions. Paired with the drugs, my lack of confrontation skills, and not wanting to lose this girl I really started to act out. A few of these memories are fuzzy but… I know one night she was mad at me and I wanted to talk but she wanted time to cool down and be apart. I freaked out I went over to her house and caused a scene. When I left she and her friend decided to leave so that I couldn’t make any more decisions. Again being fucked up on drugs that made me angry. When she returned to the house I pushed and threatened her friend they locked themselves inside and called the police. They came and calmed me down and told me to go home. She ended up telling her family about these crazy incidents. Which is obviously not good. 

A few days went by and Jackie and I began to repair our relationship. Still getting high and falling in love. She graduated from college and found a job in her field in town. She still lived at her friend’s house but stayed with me most nights. In May 2015 I graduated from college and found a job in a different state. She and I decided to move together and stop doing drugs...Still smoking weed but nothing else. My boss was a manipulative liar and lied to me about my job. He told me I was going to making good money and that he would have a good job for Jackie. Well needless to say when we arrived we both found out that he didn’t have a job for her and I was not making the money I was told. But we decided to stay and gain the experience. The job was in the middle of no where working for a resort. I worked from 4:30am to 11pm. Every day for 90 days straight. We stayed sober. About half way through the 90 days she decided she wanted to return the school and get her masters degree. Again no drugs but the lack of conflict skills and disappointed that she was going to leave me I disagreed with her. This disagreement really hurt her feelings which is when I learned I needed to support her. A few days later I truly supported her. She wouldn’t be able to begin her masters degree until June 2016. She decided to go to the next job with me in a different state. On our way we decided to get some heroin and get high. We arrived at our job fucked up and lasted for about 3 weeks. We went through withdrawals and were out. Things returned to normal a happy couple working and travelling the country together. She returned to our college town and began school in June 2016. 

While she went back to school I stayed with the same company being promised of a good future. I traveled the country working at various resorts by myself. Jackie and I still maintain a good long distance relationship. Until my insecurities set in. While I was working long and hard hours she was getting to live the college life. Going out to the bars having fun… but never cheating on me. My insecurities set in when we stopped talking. When I would be working I couldn’t talk, when I would get off she would be out partying. It made me upset and it hurt my feelings because I felt like the distance and lack of interaction was driving us apart. I continued working around the country and started to get heroin mailed to me without her knowing. I was getting high and becoming a very functioning drug addict. Getting high again made me very irrational. I began to start fights about her going out with her friends and not making time for me. I fought with her when she told me her mom and her were going to go to on a mission trip out of the country. Again in hindsight I know all of this was irrational. She loved me so much she always talked me through it…. Mad but supportive.  During a gap in work I went back to my home town where I ended up meeting at a hotel bar and having some drinks. We didn’t sleep together but during our drinks she wanted a picture and I said yes. (this will come up later).

After my next job jobs she took a flight so she could drive back with me. I had just a little more drugs when she got there and told her I had got a little to celebrate the end of this particular job. Well we got high one night in an awesome hotel room. The next day we went out to see the city and I began withdrawals. I had to admit to her I had been doing drugs for the past 3 months. She was not happy. She forgave me and we drove cross country home having a wonderful time. Summer came around and she had to return to school and I to my next job. This was the hardest for me. Again I started doing heroin again. Still insecure in our relationship kept doing the same shit. Starting fights about us not talking. In October 2016 she told me she really needed her space and stopped talking to me. This went on for a few weeks and my drug use increased heavily. I ended up missing a few shifts and was eventually told to go home. I was not necessarily fired but I was. I returned to our college town and broke down. 

This was a major change for both of us. I didn’t have a job anymore. We have been fighting about me doing drugs for almost a year now. She had to adjust her college lifestyle to accommodate me and that frustrated her. One night we got into an argument and I started again to fight with her. Making irrational statements like I wanted to kill myself, I hate myself. She told me if I felt that way she would call a hospital to come pick me up and get some help. This same event happened twice. It was awful I still remember it and is one of the worst days of my life. I had to go home for Thanksgiving I left and drove home. After thanksgiving with my family I got arrested for weed and cocaine. Again she didn’t know I had it. I called her from jail and she contacted my mom to get me out. Jackie was so mad. So mad she needed space. When I returned to Jackie In our college town our relationship took a major hit. While shopping for a Christmas tree I could tell she was upset about something. She was so upset she didn’t even want to talk. She finally breaks and starts yelling at me (all these fights we had she rarely yelled) Mallory had FB messaged her and told her that I meet up with her and that I still love Mallory and sent her that picture of us at the bar. Jackie was so angry she asked me to move out of her house. She didn’t talk to me for weeks. At the beginning of the year January 2017 she started talking to me again and I invited her to my brothers wedding. At the rehearsal dinner I had to much to drink and got mad at a waiter in a restaurant and this finally put her over the top. She was done! She broke up with me at my mom’s house. I was so drunk I acted out horribly. I yelled, cried, hit myself, and finally decided to go to a hotel for the night. Saving me the embarrassment in front of my family she went to the wedding with me pretending everything was okay. She got a flight and went back to the college town. Done with me. 

A week later we haven’t talked much and I meet up with Mallory. We spent a few nights together in the city getting drunk and doing cocaine. While with Mallory Jackie found out that I was with Mallory. Hurt she found which hotel I was in and called. I didn’t answer she then blew my phone up. When I finally answered crying and angry she was so disappointed that I ran back to this girl who has been devastating our relationship. Didn’t want to talk to me anymore… I understood. 

About a week later February 2017 my family had an intervention. I was so upset still denying that I had a problem. I didn’t want to go. But I did. I spent 90 days in rehab to truly learn about myself. I learned that I don’t need drugs in my life to be happy. I finally learned the skills to communicate and not act out irrationally. From February to May Jackie and I didn’t speak. I received one message from her that said she was happy surrounded herself by people who support her that her anxiety has dropped since leaving me. I told her I was happy for her. I worked every day with my therapist on myself and eventually knew how much I loved Jackie. This made me sad. I didn’t want to turn to drugs I didn’t act out… I was just sad. One day when I earned a day pass my mother picked me up and we took a long drive. Coincidentally, Jackie texted my mom how much she missed me. That she has gone on dates with a few guys and was not happy. Wow did this ever make me happy. My mom texted her back with a report how well I was doing along with some nice words of encouragement and told her she was with me and if she wanted could text me. Jackie did she texted me hi. This started a very slow conversation for the last few weeks. Nothing about our relationship just little how was your day, good night, hope all is well conversations. Again working with my therapist she set a meeting for Jackie to come see me. I wrote out a letter apologizing, telling her what I have learned, how I want her in my life. We both cried and hugged it out and soon after I was finished with my 90 day program (May 2017). We decided to start talking again. She picked me up and we had a great weekend. She very clearly communicated to me that we were not back together. I understood it takes time to rebuild trust. 

I got a job at a semi local resort to the city where my mom lives. She had to return to school to  finish her last summer semester. During this time we talked a lot. She still had her college life and I handled it like an adult. During the summer she told me about the guys she went on dates with and I listened and accepted it. I was happy she knew in her heart that I truly am a good person who could make her very happy. She found an internship in the city where my mom lived and asked me to help her find a place to live. I did, I helped her move and set up her new house. When she moved back we started to spend a few days a week together and everything seemed like we were getting back together. A few weeks went by we were happy. She needed to return home for a family matter and I told her I would take her. While in the car she was browsing music and decided to see who I have been talking to. She found a message from a week or two before she moved where I tried meeting up with some girls. Messages that said where do you want to meet. I never acted on anything mostly just feeling lonely while she was out partying. (irrational action)…. I messed up.  She was very angry. We drove home together and really didn’t say much. A few more weeks went by hanging out but our relationship was at a stand still. I thought we were trying to move forward. It appeared that we were trying to build  a relationship back. 

About 3 weeks ago I came home from work hadn’t seen her in about a week so excited to see her. When I got there I was disappointed from her lack of enthusiasm. I finally broke down and told her how sad I was that we seemed like friends who just stay with each other on the weekends. That there was nothing there. She told me she was mad at me for all the horrible things I have done to her. She didn’t want to have a sexual relationship with me because of how mad she was and didn’t know if she could truly forgive and move on. The next day we had a fun day with some friends and went to bed. In the morning she told me she needed to let me go. She told me that she feels bad that she doesn’t know if she can forgive me but is keeping me hoping that we will have a life together. This broke my heart and I packed up my stuff and left. Really sad knowing that no matter what kind of changes I made to my life my past mistakes could never be forgiven. I returned to work and we didn’t talk for 7 days. She called me and said all she wanted to do is relax watch some tv and be sad. Loving her so much I invited her to come stay with me.  She agreed as long as we didn’t talk about our relationship. She came and stayed 2 nights with me and we had a good time being “friends”. The second night she was there we had sex for the first time in a long time. When she went to leave the next day It seemed like she was trying to say goodbye again. There was no hope in rebuilding. She left and called me 2 minutes later that her car broke down. So I helped her get the car towed and fixed. In the mean time I let her borrow my car. She returned a few days later stayed the night got her car and went home. She and I started talking a little bit more. Still not talking about our relationship we began to interact. I was so happy. I felt like I had a chance to get back together with her. 

This weekend (November 2017) she invited me to come stay with her on my day off. She told me she had extended an invitation to her friend to stay with her but didn’t know if she was comfortable because of this girls bad reputation. But being the good person Jackie is she accepted her and her boyfriend to her home. The four of us decided to go out and have some drinks. We had a good time returned home, super drunk, and got into bed. When she laid down I said something like “I think we really have a chance” She responded “No, you don’t have a chance”. And if your following this story you could probably predict what happen… I acted irrationally being drunk. I embarrassed her by yelling mean comments about her guest who obviously heard from the next room. I walked out of her room and went outside for awhile. I learned in rehab that if I remove myself from a situation I calm down and start to think rationally. I wrote a letter to her apologizing for my outburst. I told her that I was so frustrated that I have change my life but didn’t feel good enough I acted out. I seriously feel absolutely horrible about what I did. She woke up read the letter and continued with her planned day with her friends. I stayed at home cleaned up a little bit and waited for her to return. She asked me to pick her up and on the way home she told me how mad and embarrassed she was. Didn’t say anything else about it. Her sister was coming in town and wanted to spend time with her so I left. While leaving I could just tell that I have exhausted all my chances of being with her. I don’t think she will ever forgive me. While having a day to think about what happened I regret everything. This is the first time in a long time I acted like this. Its not who I am I know I am not a bad person. Is it to crazy to say I love her so much I acted out when I feel like I am losing her?


I have talked to her over the phone one time since leaving. I told her again that I was sorry. I asked her to know that again the liquor took control and I needed to stop drinking. This time I really do want to stop drinking. 

I want her back so much. I know she will be the best wife, mother, and friend I could ever have in my life. 

Question: How can I save this relationship? Is it to crazy to say I love her so much I acted out when I feel like I’m losing her? 

I know from this sub reddit that most responses will be you’re a horrible person and need to let this beautiful soul go and live a happy life. There is part of me that believes this… but I do know we have something special. I absolutely know she feels that one day she will marry me and be happy but is having a hard time forgiving. I re read this story and almost all of it is horrible negative fuck ups that I’ve had. But please note that we have shared a lot happier times. We have established relationships with each others family. We have been there together through the worst times. Drugs and alcohol really effected my mind set. After rehab I am happy with who I am, proud that I have returned to the man my mother raised. The only thing I want in life is to be a good husband and father… things in my life I have never seen. I want to give my kids a life I never had. I want this over becoming highly successful in my career. More than making tons of money. I want a family. And I found the woman, my soul mate who I can accomplish this with. 

Tl;dr: I have been dating a girl since college. I have done horrible things to her: Verbal abuse, cheating, lying, and drugs. She finally had enough and ended things. I went to rehab and learned new skills to improve my life and I finally got clean. We started to rebuild our life together and after almost 6 months she tells me she can’t forgive me. I know I have done a lot of terrible things to her. ALL were due to being an irrational drug addict. But now I have reconnected with the old me and want to save this relationship.

7clrid,7,2017-11-13,Need some career advice,Indiabiooks,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7clrid/need_some_career_advice/,"Hey everyone.

So I am a recent graduate(July) with a degree in CSE from a private Tier-3 university (pretty well known though to my knowledge) and am currently unemployed. Now even though I am from a shit college, I am interested in CS and understand and love whatever I learn or do. I have a good grade(8.5), have participated twice in GSOC (it's a program by Google where you are paid to contribute to open source) and also did an internship earlier this year. 

Unfortunately, that is all the experience I have. Now I was interested in Android development since last year and although I spent some time learning it back then, it's only recently that I have become somewhat good at it. In fact, I actually have been spending the last few months learning more about about advanced concepts(like Dagger, Rx, etc for those who know about it) and have implemented them in an app(intend to showcase it). I am like really into it right now. But I still don't think I am good enough to work in a team so I need a couple of months more to polish my skills and also publish another app, which I am working on currently, on the play store. I am also thinking maybe go the indie route and work on stuff that I love(like open source). What I am worried about is will that harm my job prospects? Is it true that if I am not employed by end of this year, I won't ever get a job? I am also not that good with algorithms so I think if I give it a few more months(yeah, it's too late to do that but maybe I can improve a little?), I can improve on both and be better prepared. What do you think? Also, where would you say I should go for a good Android job? I have Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune in my list in that order."

Im sorry I never knew what to say. I should have said anything because I miss talking to you now. I love you so much. I miss being in the garden with you the most. 

Its so hard to visit grandma...because everywhere I look I think of you. I sit at the table, put my feet on the legs, look at the wall across from me and all I can see is you, playing Dominos, solitare, or pick up sticks. Its hard even to eat because I think about all the vegetables you grew. Green beans are the hardest. I miss sitting under the tree with you, snapping beans. I miss the pumpkin patch you grew for me every year. I miss having you fry me zucchini and squash. I miss making fun of your insane love for onions. 

Thank you for forcering me to learn how to add. Thank you for everything you taught me. I use your wisedom often. Thank you for teaching me how to drive stick when I was 12. Thank you for giving me a love of classic cars. 

Just so you know, Devon and I got an apartment, and a hamster. I love it. I graduate in May, and I have an internship in January. I wish you were gonna be at my graduation. 

I love you so much. I miss you. Thank you for looking down on me and keeping me safe. Your probably the reason I didnt get a ticket this summer. Thank so much."

So I have my super day for JP Morgan's Technology Analyst Program (software engineering) in a couple of days, and I was wondering if anyone here had gone through the full time interview process recently (not the the internship process). If so, I was wondering if you could shed light on what type of technical questions I can expect, and possibly give me some examples. A lot of the examples on Glassdoor were vague, so I am looking to hear form someone that has recently gone through the full time process. 

Thanks in advance y'all!"

It’ll start next year in August … 
so the thing is, although I should be quite excited about it, I am having a hard time actually being excited. Last year I was in a similar situation, I actually was accepted for studying abroad but I cancelled it due to anxiety (i.e. fear of being lost, fear of not finding a flat, fear of not managing things on my own) – I am 23 years old now and grew up very sheltered, the thing is that I improved a lot already and am currently in therapy but I am so anxious that I might sabotage myself again and cancel the whole thing before even trying. 

My parents are extremely anxious as well and I am not even keen on telling them about it, because instead of being happy about it, I can already sense that they will also only project their fears on me and make me worry even more.

Has anyone of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?"

7cnbyi,5,2017-11-13,"Switch to less reputable college to graduate MUCH faster? Worth it, or not?",byebyebiosphere,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7cnbyi/switch_to_less_reputable_college_to_graduate_much/,"I've been adding up the credits and graduation requirements, and realized that if I switched to a different, smaller public university, after this spring semester, I could graduate in roughly 6 credit hours compared to the anticipated 40-43 from my local university. 

This is because I'm a transfer student from this smaller school to my current school, and all my generals are essentially done at this smaller school (I got an associate's at this smaller school). 

The problem is, the school I'm currently at is considered the flag-ship school for all STEM in my state, whereas this lesser-known school is not usually recognized as having good STEM programs. 

But, I mean, 6 credit hours compared to 40? 

My current school is also considerably more expensive, however I've had plenty of grants and scholarships, and have only been paying an extra 1-2k per semester. 

40 credit hours is almost another two years of school, whereas with 6 credit hours, I could be graduating this summer. 24 of the remaining credits are CS classes, whereas 19 of those credits are electives outside of CS (things like diversity, upper division writing, physics 1, etc.)

I already have an internship turned part-time job from this last summer, and they've told me they want to keep me and turn me full time asap; so work experience isn't too big of an issue, since I have roughly 6 months work experience, and a decent job pretty much lined up. 

Some other considerations:

If I transferred, I'd have a higher GPA on my transcript and diploma (3.7 compared to like a 3.0), since my grades dipped when I first transferred to my current university. 

If I transferred, I'd also graduate with a minor in math.

Also, current university is not an ivy by any means. It's a solid state university with a somewhat decent reputation around the country, especially for stem. 

I know you guys probably get sick of these types of questions ('help me know what to do with my life!' type), but I think I could benefit with some thoughts from the community while making this decision. 

Would I be stagnating my career by transferring to a less reputable school? What's worth more, a year and half of work experience, or a degree from a better (although not huge name) university?"
7cndus,1,2017-11-13,[M4F] My Mom's Friend (And Maybe My Mom Too!),bladesofsteel21,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7cndus/m4f_my_moms_friend_and_maybe_my_mom_too/,"I'm home from school for the summer and the days are dragging. I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my floating around sipping your drinks](http://www.clearwatercolumbus.com/two-women-pool-float.jpg). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later.

A mysterious figure is shown, most of the man is covered in shadows as he slowly drags a metal claw down some pipes as he walks. Finally he steps up to the camera...and it's SlowbroJJ, who has a very smug grin on his face, and is wearing a Freddy Krueger costume. Behind him, the two Raw Interns Susie and Sam step out in Freddy Krueger outfits of their own while Ricky and Bobby are seen shoveling some coal into the boilers to really add to the flames of the scene*


Slowbro: ""Hey there! I know, bit late for Halloween but god I have always loved the season. Always been a big horror movie fan myself, and as a kid I was always terrified of Freddy Krueger.""


*Slowbro slips the glove off, handing it over to Susie as he gives a nod* 

Slowbro: ""Thank you, but as I was saying. Now you might be asking, ""Slowbro why did you blow all of this weeks Smackdown pyro fund on building some creepy boiler room so you can dress up as a 80's horror icon with two very attractive women?"" And Ill tell you why!""


*Slowbro shrugs*


Slowbro: ""Because I felt like it!""


Ricky: ""This really doesn't seem like a good use of our money sir, we could have just you know....sat in your office and done a promo like-""


Slowbro: ""Damn it Ricky were trying to be creative here! This is why I won't sign your fucking papers to say you completed your- Alright. We will deal with this after Ricky.""

*Slowbro takes a deep breath, Susie speaking up*

Susie: ""I thought it was a cool idea""


*Slowbro smiles*

Slowbro: ""Thank you Susie! See, this is why you get raises and Ricky is the one shoveling coal. Being positive goes a long way""


*Slowbro turns back towards the camera*


Slowbro: ""Joking aside, I thought it was a very good metaphor for what will be coming up at NXT take over and Survivor series. You see, Survivor Series will be the JJ Show, as I have a potential of having 6 matches. The most matches any one person will ever have at any PPV ever. I will be fighting for a GM spot for Smackdown, Ill be fighting for the US title, a King of the Ring spot...which I would like to add is bullshit as Im the only undefeated mother fucking IC champion of all time, a former world champion, the G2 winner, a future US champion, a future Hardcore - I can rant all day but that's not the point. My point is this""


""Much like Freddy, I am the worst nightmare of many of my opponents coming this weekend. Mark? Oh Mark. You been asking for months for the ""Old Slowbro back!""...how you been dying to see the SlowbroJJ of old back. Well Mark, he's been back. He was back at the G2, he was back when he took out King of Zing by putting her through a table that was on fire....he was back when he made your buddy Simashi tap out. Now you get to deal with him at Survivor Series! You get to fight the very man you been asking for....but Mark. Please remember, its ever predictors dream to step into the ring with their idol....but sometimes it can turn out that one's dream is really their worst nightmare""

""Team Raw? I wish I could say I was concerned about you. The only man I want to get my hands on is Pruef....you see? Power Struggle? Great night for me. But that beating at the hands of Pruef? I haven't really felt quite the same....not really at one hundred percent since then. Pruef hurt me in a way that only one other has hurt me before, the night of Summerslam.""

*Sam rubs Slowbro's shoulder, comforting him as Ricky's sleeve catches on fire, his screams fill the air as Bobby tries to put him out in the background*

Slowbro: ""It hurt more then you can imagine, like being set ablaze. To see some stupid rookie put one of the greatest of all time down....barely escaping with a tie. Luckily I had my G2 briefcase and these two to help me...and Ricky and Bobby I guess were good at getting us drinks too, I guess.""

*Ricky at this point is rolling around on the ground, Bobby throwing a blanket on him as he begins stomping on Ricky to put out the flames*


Slowbro: ""So Pruef, I hope you are ready to face me once again. Because this time? One two...I'm coming for you.""


*Slowbro chuckles as Ricky finally comes crawling out, the flames now put out as he groans on the floor. Slowbro doesn't seem to mind though*


Slowbro: ""Primo! Buddy....Now. My original plan was to lay down for you at Survivor Series as I had nothing really to gain from beating you. But Church has promised me a mid card title shot now if I beat you....so...."" *Slowbro shrugs* ""Sorry Bud. Its just business.""


*Ricky curls up into a ball, as Slowbro suddenly becomes much more serious*


Slowbro: ""But let's be serious here for a moment. The man I really want to address here is Cappie. Cappie. I know you and Throdis are watching. I know you are dying to get into the ring with me at Take over, to finally answer the question that's been following you for so long. ""Who is the best member of the Advantage"". Let me tell you something Cappie. I am going to crush your dream at Take Over. You see? I been watching our old matches. How you always put yourself on the line, how you risked yourself for your tag team partner...how you did insane stunts at my whim for the Advantage. Extreme rules being the biggest piece of evidence.""

""You have always been a puppet Cappie. You may have been a good predictor, but you have never really been at my level have you? Got a lucky break at Great Balls of Fire and got a big title match because your friend Throdis let you have a freebie, but never really been able to prove you are on the SlowbroJJ/VacantforHOF level, have you? You need this, don't you?""

""But what happens Cappie when you step into the ring at Takeover? When I destroy you...when your worst nightmare comes true. Well Cappie, when the whole world sees that you and throdis are nothing but jokes? Your worst nightmare comes true. Ill walk out with your title, Ill make history by becoming the first man to hold every singles title in LLR history...Ill become the most dominant champion of all time....and the question will finally be answered: ""Who was the greatest member of the Advantage""""


""After Takeover, people will be forced to admit the truth, to answer that question with the only reasonable answer: ""SlowbroJJ""


""So watch out Cappie....Because one two....I'm coming for you....""

Well basically it's still the bitcoin core bitcoin-qt desktop application. 

Now I imported my private key in which there was bitcoin at the time of the split. I expected the amount of BTG to show up in the wallet and then go from here.... 

But it seems this full node wallet also shows when I spent my bitcoin after the split... I am confused: Isn't that the whole idea of the split that after importing the private key into the new wallet I only see the transactions I do or have done on the new chain and not the others as well... 

Well, what a mess, how do I have to proceed to ensure the new wallet recognizes that amounts I spent AFTER the chain split are not relevant for the BTG chain? (Meaning I still get the coins in the wallet and they aren't marked as spent immediately....) 

thx for some clarification here... 

p.s.: btw, there really hasn't been time enough to seperate the modified bitcoin-qt from the original one? By default using the same folders and basic settings, also not even branding the title or icons - cmon, thats a job an intern can do in one hour... really disappointing... "
7cnymg,37,2017-11-13,Confessions of a (soon-to-be-former) GIS'er,Grmull89,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/7cnymg/confessions_of_a_soontobeformer_giser/,"Hello GIS'ers or those who wish to pursue a career in GIS. I am writing this in order to document my experience working as a GIS Analyst over a period a few years. This post isn't a rant, this is just what my GIS experience was like and why I chose to leave the geospatial industry for the IT industry. 

Overall, I had a neutral experience working the GIS industry. Not great, not terrible. Every industry has its perks and drawbacks. The industry is unique in that it's at the crossroads of IT and graphic design. The IT side of things being data science and application development. The graphic design aspect of it being just that, designing something aesthetically pleasing. All of those aspects are the ""plus"" side of the industry for me. And now the bad side..

Over my career, I've met other geospatial professionals, and all of us have the same complaint that we're all grossly underutilized and terribly mis-and-micromanaged. With the exception of my college internship experience and my first professional GIS gig, I was supervised by somebody who had ZERO GIS experience. Zero. They hadn't ever touched the software and didn't understand what it's capabilities and limitations were. It was a constant struggle explaining to the Office Manager or my supervisors ""GIS really excels at X. It's not Autodesk so it can't do Y or isn't built on the premise that it be used for Y.""  

GIS is largely a data-driven system, and the other major obstacle that I experienced while working in the geospatial industry (especially the broader Oil and Gas Industry), is the fact that nobody wants to pay for data, send crews to collect the data, or the dataset that they're asking to be displayed is a scientific result of any number of factors. The other thing that really soured my taste for wanting to work in the Oil and Gas experience was my supervisor once told me ""These maps you're making really don't matter, DNR/DEP/EPA just look at them and throw them onto a shelf with the rest of them"".  So that rubbed me the wrong way, because I began to think ""Well if what I'm doing doesn't matter, then what am I doing here?"". 

I actually resigned from that position and went to work for an IT company doing just straight project management stuff and really liked it. I spent a little over a year at that position, and resigned because I wanted to be sure that it was the Oil and Gas industry that had soured me on GIS and not GIS itself. Upon taking the position that I'm currently in, I realized that it was GIS that had me down and it didn't matter what industry I was in. 

I had made some professional connections while I was at the ""IT company"" and I actually started down a certification path while I was there and put it down whenever I resigned, but picked it up again once I figured out I wasn't happy. I studied, got certified, applied, and got hired by to do Linux System Administration. 

Although my next endeavor won't be a GIS-oriented position, I still enjoy working with the software. I still like maps, like working with the data, and it's actually piqued my interest in exploring an IT career like Database Management or Application Development. Please take this posting with a grain of salt. If you're thinking about a career in GIS, don't be discouraged by this review, your experience may be vastly different from mine and I hope it is. If you're reading this and are experiencing the same pitfalls working in the industry, take comfort in the fact that the GIS discipline is a cross-roads of trades, and you can EASILY transition into something that suits your taste. Good Luck!"

7coj9y,8,2017-11-13,Should I reach out to my recruiter after doing poorly on a coding challenge?,ImJustPro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7coj9y/should_i_reach_out_to_my_recruiter_after_doing/,"I've been in contact with this company for some time now. It is a very large company, but the office I applied to is rather unknown and small, so the pool of applicants is small as well. I've applied for a Software Engineering intern position with this company and finished the coding challenge for them yesterday.

The coding challenge consisted of 10 multiple choice and one programming question. I aced the multiple choice, but the programming question - I choked. It was a very easy question. I jumped with joy when reading it because I knew how to answer it. Unfortunately I became obsessed with the idea of optimizing it that I got distracted and forgot to accomplish the basics. It only passed a few test cases, but had errors on most. 

I have had personal contact with the head recruiter and have made myself stand out through conference calls with them. They seem to have been impressed with my questions and my resume. I'm debating whether I should contact him and explain what happened and maybe ask for another challenge to complete, or send the proper solution to him - but I also think this would make me seem like a sore loser.

What do you guys think?"
7cokyr,3125,2017-11-13,I have been rejected by over 100 jobs in my past 2 years as a developer from code bootcamp. My story. Never give up.,Tychos1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7cokyr/i_have_been_rejected_by_over_100_jobs_in_my_past/,"I would like to preface and apologize if this is the wrong place to post. But I'd just like to share my experience since getting into code. 

I was working at an engineering job right after college and basically hated what I did. Very corporate america, my boss had 3 bosses, I had 2 managers, felt like cattle in a cubicle farm. I started looking at remote jobs because I couldn't figure out why I needed to be in a cubicle to write excel sheets and create power points all day. When I looked up remote jobs I realized they were all basically software development. I wondered why I went to school for mechanical engineering anyway since I spent all of my time playing video games, building my own computer, everything IT except for code.

After that feeling of regret wore off; I looked up boot camps in my area. I knew that if I tried to learn myself or online I would get stuck, become frustrated and probably quit. I wasn't comfortable with being uncomfortable yet. Unfortunately, most of the code boot camps designed to actually **get you a job** were from 9am-5pm for three months straight. I didn't have the finances to just quit my job and I wasn't going to take out a loan to go either. So I went to this 'after hours' part time(specifically noted that it was not preparing you for jobs) boot camp a few days a week at night and on the weekend. They refused to list the job statistics for students after the program but after harassing them about it they gave me a 'less than 28% of students get a job after this program'. I decided maybe if I bust my ass enough I can be part of that number. It started off pretty easy, I had taken an HTML class in high school, no big deal. Then came CSS - oh this is a thing I connect to the page and change how it looks. Then came Javascript - oh this is neat...wait..what, but I don't understand..so this works but this doesn't? Why? Oh that's just that way it is. okay.jpg. Rinse repeat that process of continually being baffled until I eventually accepted a continuous state of 'I'm not sure how to do that, and I've never done that before, but... I'll figure it out.'

This type of attitude has served me even beyond the local scope of programming into the global scope of my life. 

Toward the end of the bootcamp most students had dropped out. There were 4 left. Not many people my age(25 at the time) want to give up their Saturday morning to come into a classroom and learn to code. I wasn't the exception, especially when rocket league had just released and one 5 minute round warps space-time and 3 hours goes by. I managed to keep it under control and show up every class. 

I started shotgunning out resumes to almost every job posting I could find with the word development in it. I'd like to take a moment and apologize to the 67 HR people that stated 'Do not apply unless you have x experience’' and 'please stop applying to other positions at this company'. I would rather take a chance then not, it's not like I lose anything when they say no. I figured maybe if I could get their ear for only a minute then I might be able to convince them. Eventually a brand new startup messaged me back and brought me in for an interview. It was for ruby on rails. Nope -  0 experience but I'll learn whatever you want me to learn. They gave me a code test, maybe as a sick joke to get me to go away. I took it and spent about 8 hours trudging through it until I finished. I brought it back and to both our surprise it looked good. Then they told me no, sorry, not enough experience. We shook hands and I went about my day. I decided to call them up and ask if I could work part-time. Let me be an intern, don't make me the main man on your technology but let me work on something easier. 

I knew that they were a fresh startup on the block and that if they had interns it might let them look good. Gives that curb appeal of 'we are hiring the fresh minds in the tech space'. Anyway - they said 'We'll consider it, let me call you back'. They called me back and said 'Yeah can you work 20-25 hours a week? We'll pay you $18 an hour'. I was prepared to work for free so when I read that I was floored. Feeling like I was on top of the world I asked if I could also work from home a few days a week since I was going to keep my full-time engineering job. In retrospect I was probably pushing it. They agreed though, for whatever reason. I thought I had achieved the dream, and in a way I had. It was a startup environment, I could bring my dog, they had beer fridays at 1:00pm, a snack room, an xbox if you wanted to play during lunch. I thought I was hot shit. Yeah I'm a 'software developer' now throwing my title out like a left hook. Then I showed up for my first day at work to get my equipment and it hit me.

Now I actually have to produce for this company. None of this means anything if I can't code. I don't know ruby on rails, I've never used git in a professional environment. I merged my own pull request on the first day. That was bad. Luckily I didn't delete an entire repo like the other guy on here. Suddenly everyday felt like wait why did you hire me again? 

I struggle bussed my way through 6 months and kept my full time job as an engineer.  I started looking at other full time jobs in software because every day I showed up to my engineering cubicle I lost a piece of my soul. 

I found a full-time PHP junior software position and they brought me on. I maintained my intern job as well. I knew there were growing pains but it felt more like I was being torn from limb to limb. Under experienced and overconfident. I'm pretty sure Kendrick Lamar was directing his lyrics at me. Sit down, be humble. I now try to be a student in every aspect.

I worked there for about 5 more months and I was replaced by someone with more experience that was willing to take the same pay as me. The joys of being a junior developer.

I decided you know what, I've been doing this for a while - I'm going to try and get a fully remote job. I applied to a few places and actually received two job offers at the same time. For the first time I felt like it was starting to pay off. Two companies want me? I have a choice? What is life? I accepted a fully remote job doing react and PHP. Things started to come together. I started to think 'I have an idea about how to do that but it probably wont be optimized'. After a year the US election happened and I was working for a government contractor. Suddenly the budget was under review and there were no more contracts. No more work for us to do. The entire development team was let go. 15 people. 

Enter my most recent job. For whatever reason it was more difficult to find another fully remote job this time. I was declined by 90 jobs. Endless interviews, after interview #4 for company #63 it can get hard to stay 110%. I had a portfolio, decent resume, passed code tests, followed up even willing to take less money. I'm not sure why it was more difficult this time around. As my funds ran out I decided I'll work locally. I eventually accepted an office job and work remote partially. It's not my favorite thing but it's good for me. It keeps me on my hustle and networking with people is everything. I enjoy being in the office and enjoy the people I work with; they are flexible when I want it. When I was unemployed and constantly getting told 'NO' - knowing that I am approaching homelessness was difficult to process. Especially because I had received two offers at the same time just a year prior. One piece of advice I think about is 'Keep your head up when times are tough, and your head down when times are good'.

Even now I don't think I am 'the best' developer. I'm confused and stumped pretty regularly. I used to wonder if 'code was for me'. Now - I embrace the struggle and can look back and see all I've learned. At code camp I was always the last one to finish the in class projects or moved on with it incomplete. I've dropped out of college 2 times before finally finishing. Academically I was never amazing.

I now work two jobs. One full time as a front-end developer and a part-time where I teach code to students but this isn't intended to be a promo for that so I wont name it. I just like helping people learn since I know what it's like. 

If you're in one of my many situations never give up. 

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR** Went to code bootcamp because hated corporate america job. Worked at a startup, remotely, and now partially. Has been a rough upward ride overall.

**Edit** If anyone has any questions - feel free to send me a message here and I'm happy to help. Oh boy someone found it. If anyone is interested I have a small [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA) channel where I talk about these topics and more. Prepare^for^cringe. I'm still learning, but my goal is to help and motivate others with transparent information. 

**Edit** Thanks for the gold kind stranger.

**Edit** So I received a few questions about free resources and the bootcamp I teach at along with my thoughts on other bootcamps.

*This isn't intended to be a promotional and I'm not sponsored to write this*, but whatever - check these out if you want.

It's called **OpenClassrooms**. Weekly Mentor meetings.  **Price:** $300/month and has a job guarantee. I teach there so take that with a grain of salt. Do your research and find what works for you. If interested there's the discount code, OPENCLASSROOMS12 if you want to try it out. I don't know how many there are. First come first serve I guess.

I personally attended  **DevMountain** in 2015 in Salt Lake City, Utah. It has a pretty great rating and overall I thought the curriculum was modern but there just wasn't enough time in the evening courses to fully prepare for jobs. It also has no job guarantee. **Price: $4500**

**LambdaSchool** Completely free until you get a job that pays more than $50,000/yr, with a part-time option

**Thinkful** is also great. Weekly mentor meetings. They have a job guarantee. **Price:$8500**

**Bloc.io** - Basically just Thinkful that costs slightly more. Job guarantee.**Price:$8800**

**Free Resources I used to learn and still do:**

[Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Huge awesome community. 

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Pretty great for beginners. They're always updating it.

[Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) - Follow along tutorials.

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

Personal experience with PCs going back to Windows 95, LAN parties, Family Mr. Fixit.   

The internship entailed server backups (Backup Exec), WSUS/SCCM, general user issue troubleshooting, router installs, rolling out new PCs (imaging, adding/removing from AD, inventory), printer maintenance, network troubleshooting, setting up conference rooms.  The manager at my internship had hoped to hire me but the Federal hiring freeze dashed that hope.   

Aside from not having my own admin privileges (had to use my supervisors credentials) I was treated as part of the team. The guy supervising me had said I knew more than he did.  I actually left him with a few scripts to automate parts of his day.

I had been in a VA program as a disabled vet and that program seems to have been affected as well because 90% of the job leads offered were Federal.  So I've been conducting a job search on my own, without much success.

Now I realize that I need more professional experience to beef up my resume but what positions fit what I have?  I've had a handful of recruiters contact me but the salary offers seems pretty low for the Boston area.  

I've been targeting Desktop Support level roles at around $20/h.  I just got off the phone with another recruiter looking to fill a position at $14/h.

I can not just sit down and write code. When switching between languages I can't remember basic things like what the loop syntax was for each. When using a language which I used for a year straight after a year of not using it, I have to quickly search basic syntax that I can't remember. Even when using the same language I'm often doing a quick search in the code base (or more likely even the same file that I'm working in, something that I wrote earlier) for syntax.

I was born in Finland, and have lived in Canada since I was 7. I recently began an 8-month internship in France, which is the first time I've been in Europe since I left at age 7. Obviously, I am travelling around as much as possible.


There are two others doing an internship position at the same company, also from Canada, but we all met in France. One of them is this asian guy, who is nice, but a little bit socially awkward. He often 'coincidentally' joins me on my travels. For example, when I mentioned I was going to Berlin last October, he coincidentally booked bus tickets for the exact same weekend a few days later. I am happy to travel with him, but sometimes I also enjoy travelling alone, because it means I can meet new people easier. So far, all my travels have been with him.


Anyway, I obviously have to go back to visit my family in Finland. I decided that the best time to do this was Christmas (the 24th is also my birthday), and I booked plane tickets from Dec 20 - 26. I mentioned this at work. There is also an old friend from Canada joining me on this trip.


Today, I got a text from the asian guy, saying 'hey dude, I was thinking of going to Finland from December 22 - 26.' So, he is hoping to join me. Here is my dilemna:


1. I would prefer to do this trip alone. I haven't seen these people in 13 years, and I honestly just want to spend some quality time with them.

2. It seems this guy doesn't have anywhere to go for Christmas, and he is hoping to join me. If he does come to Finland, I couldn't imagine stone-walling him, because that is just completely opposite the Christmas spirit. 


For some reason, this time around, I am really struggling with the idea of travelling with him. WIBTA if I tell him I want to do this trip alone?

7cqgwl,14,2017-11-13,Changing careers: Should I seek an internship or jump right in?,imVINCE,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7cqgwl/changing_careers_should_i_seek_an_internship_or/,"Hello r/CSCareerQuestions! Let me first thank you all for creating and contributing to such a positive community which helps so many individuals.

I'll start with the TLDR to save you the scrolling: BS and MS in Neuroengineering ([MS thesis](https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A4303) was MATLAB-heavy brain-computer interface research), 5 years working in the OR, more than halfway through GA Tech's OMSCS with Machine Learning concentration and will finish by end of 2018, working on second Nanodegree (first was Deep Learning, now doing AI). Live in Brooklyn, happy to work anywhere in NYC. Hoping to change careers Q1 2018; should I intern?

OK, the full version:

For some background, I live in Brooklyn, NY where I work in brain and spine surgery as a [surgical neurophysiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_neurophysiological_monitoring). I have a BS and an MS in Neuroengineering from Drexel University, and due to some serendipitous circumstances early in my career, I'm 29 and peaked in my industry two years ago; I'm at the top with nowhere else to go. This is not a humblebrag, it's the result of a young, poorly developed and mostly unregulated industry with little mobility. In interviews, I'm very, very comfortable, and tend to come across as intelligent and articulate. In addition to my work in the OR, I also co-own a small animation firm where I act as technical director and audio engineer, and I volunteer actively with [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/).

My MS thesis involved developing from scratch a MATLAB GUI toolset for analyzing brain data from brain-computer interfaces, and then using the GUIs to analyze data which I collected from human subjects, and then compared to similar research findings. This was my first real exposure to programming.

After working for about two years, I started taking free Udacity courses on Python, and yadda yadda yadda now I'm done 6 classes of 10 in GA Tech's OMSCS (online MS in CS) program, with a concentration in Machine Learning. Considering my lack of a CS undergrad degree and the fact that I work and volunteer full time, I think I'm doing pretty well, with As and some Bs. I've also completed Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree, and am in the early stages of Udacity's AI Nanodegree. I chose to do the Nanodegrees in parallel to the OMSCS because I want to completely immerse myself in CS and data science so I can best digest and internalize the concepts, ideas, and skills.

I'm going to be finishing the OMSCS program by the end of December 2018. However, I'm really dying to get out of my current career for a number of only tangentially relevant reasons which I won't expand upon (unless y'all want me to). My girlfriend and I are in the process of buying and renovating a 3-family house here in Brooklyn, so my thinking is that once we're moved in and paying our mortgage with rental income, I can afford to take a (likely quite large) pay cut in order to pursue a CS internship while I finish my MS, so that when I AM done, I can comfortably be applicable for a full-time role.

**My question is, should I be aiming for an internship, or higher? Will an internship be a necessary precondition for me to be qualified for a full-time position when I finish my MS?**

My gut feeling is that my lack of a CS undergrad degree may leave me with some fundamental gaps in knowledge, though I'm doing pretty well in my MS program and am fascinated with the content and *LOVE* the challenge of completing my assignments. It's hard for me to delineate between impostor syndrome and legitimate recognition of my own limits.

Thank you all for your help and advice! :]

7cqosv,1,2017-11-13,"My FWB is beautiful, intelligent and loyal. She's not a very nice person.",Casconvacc,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/7cqosv/my_fwb_is_beautiful_intelligent_and_loyal_shes/,"Title. 

This girl is a year older than me. I'm 21. 

She is a stunning looking girl, facially very attractive, great tits and ass, big hips. Exactly my type. HB 8, possibly 9.

She's also probably as smart, if not smarter than I am. She's a law student and she's top of her class. I'm not from the US but basically she has already had a top internship, will almost certainly be taken on when she graduates and she's set up to make major bank. 

She's a lot of fun. We have this kind of banter going together and we spend most of our time together laughing. We don't go out much but we spend a lot of time in bed just talking, watching TV and having sex. 

We have a lot of sex. I have an insatiable sex drive but I honestly couldn't expect more sex out of this girl. She had a very low N count (2) and both of these guys were nowhere near me in SMV.

She's madly in love with me. She wants to spend all her time with me. Even 8 - 9 months in, she still texts me first all the time. She rings me every night. I still soft next regularly when it's necessary and it has worked well. I've held frame reasonably well (you've no idea how tough this is with a girl this smart but argumentative)and I don't take much of her shit. 

Now that I've got the positives out of the way. 

She's a heavy drinker. Goes out partying regularly and gets blackout drunk. We're in college so every night she does go out, she comes back to my house for sex. Without fail. So I have to be honest, it's hard to believe she is doing anything with anyone else. She also always initiates this. I've had her just arrive at my door while I was asleep,  strip naked and sit on my cock. 100% serious. There's no doubt I'm her alpha fucks.

Loads of orbiters. I'm talking 5-6 losers who do things for her. She tries to convince me that they're just friends and that they'd never see her in a sexual way (lmfao). I've had her having sex with me, then as we are lying in bed afterwards she texts this dude to come and collect her and drive her into canpus. Insane shit.

Another guy is in her classes. Complete beta / nice guy. Uses him for help with her studies. Pretty much openly tells me this and laughs about it. Has reduced this poor cunt to tears on numerous occasions by just being nasty to him. He always ends up apologizing.

Another guy is a housemate. Carries her books into class for her. Helps her with her luggage, etc. Walks her to her lectures. The dude absolutely despises me, maybe that's because I've bent her over his kitchen table where this cuck faggot eats his dinner. Hoping he leaves his bedroom door open some weekend so we can fuck on his bed. 

Ex-boyfriend still talks to her. Childhood romance type thing. She vents to him about her problems and this guy still listens to her shit. Incomprehensible for me to be quite honest. 

Another guy is actually a mutual friend, a really nice, decent guy, but just has no real balls at all. I partly met her through him. She'll watch movies with him, they'll get food together, basically boyfriend stuff without anything sexual. This guy is heavily overweight and not very attractive. Complete non-threat.

I'm 6'3, broad shoulders, tanned, athletic, etc. I've modelled in the past. I'm a computer engineering student. Popular and charming, but I guess most importantly, aggressive. I fuck her hard, I'm a recovering porn addict so I can go for hours. 7+ inches. I pull her hair, choke her, etc.  

She's got anxiety and she doesn't want anyone to know about the situation. I'd imagine she wants to keep this image of her being this strong in control woman, which is the image she gives out. In reality I'm the one in control and she knows it. She has even told me that since we aren't official I can see other girls. Yes, she's begging to be plated. I would but I literally don't have time for another woman.

The drinking, the orbiters, the mood swings are all major red flags. But she's also loyal, very beautiful, I enjoy her company and even though it's been going on 8 months, there's still the same spark and chemistry that there was the first time we got together. While she says she doesn't care if I see other women, I know this is complete bullshit. The one night we went out to a nightclub together (in a group with mutual friends) she was literally pulling me away from other girls I was flirting with. She basically pulled me into a taxi to go home with her and we fucked. 

She's a very self-centred girl with quite a few masculine character traits. She studies harder than I do, she's very argumentative and stubborn, has a bad temper, can be very callous and ruthless. All very unattractive traits for a woman, who's meant to be kind, caring, sensitive, etc. I'd imagine she's got some cluster B personality shit going on. As someone who's a bit dark triad myself maybe this is ok? I just feel I could make my life a lot easier sometimes.

To add an actual question, is it worth keeping a woman like this around long term? There's a lot of drama and a lot of power struggles but at the end of the day she's beautiful, entertaining, manipulative and she's going to make a lot of money. I think we could be a very powerful couple.

I have worked on political campaigns since I went door-to-door at 6 years old asking people to vote for my grandfather.  When I was 18, I interned with the State of Alabama Legislature during the entire legislative session.  I left politics shortly after but I wanted to add this because I have a deep understanding of state &amp; local politics on a personal level.  While this is all speculation, I feel like I have a pretty strong handle on 'how things are done' here &amp; this is my take.

This is a political hit job.  Admittedly, I was on the fence &amp; thought Moore's interview on Hannity earlier this week was poor.  I cannot even recount how many older legislators hit on me &amp; downright propositioned me when I was an 18 year old intern.  I kinda figured he probably had a thing for younger women.  But today's press conference with the latest accuser just screamed setup.  

First of all, what she described was a violent sexual predator.  This is in direct contrast to the other accounts of so-called victims who came forward last week.  So you're telling me that he had a hot female almost naked at his house yet took her home when she asked?  However, he had another in a semi-public area that he choked, bruised, &amp; ultimately threw her out of his car in a parking lot.  Even the other 2 young women who were part of last week's revelations never felt threatened or scared of him.  Pattern doesn't fit.

The New Yorker story speaks of him being banned from the Gadsden Mall in the early 80's &amp; have several locals claiming that it was common knowledge.  This, I can speak to more definitively.  If there was any hint of this being in any way close to being true, this would have come out 20 years ago.  I've worked Etowah campaigns in the late 90's &amp; it's not for the faint of heart.  Between all of his elections &amp; his 2 highly controversial political controversies, this would have certainly come out waaaayyyyy before today.  

I think we are seeing a new low in political warfare.  Do I think Moore was a little pervy when he was an up &amp; coming political figure while single?  Probably.  Sexual predator?  Not until something way more compelling than this comes out.

As for him denying knowing today's accuser at all even with the yearbook, ask yourself this.  Can you name all the places you had dinner or the yearbooks you signed 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago?  I know if a big shot DA came into a restaurant I worked at when I was 16, I'd probably ask him to sign my yearbook, too.

Unless actual evidence comes out, I can promise you I will be voting for Judge Moore in the special election.  I supported Mo Brooks in the primary but I also care about the Republican agenda &amp; have no desire for a radical liberal like Jones representing me....  "

7cs9xq,1,2017-11-13,2 Questions (about a major and essays),clashofclans202,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7cs9xq/2_questions_about_a_major_and_essays/,"#1: What is the informatics major like at UIUC? I've heard it's basically front-end CS. Is this true? What is the major exactly like?

#2: If it is true that informatics is similar to front-end CS (multimedia, web design, basic coding but not nearly as in depth as a proper CS major), then I might be in a bind.

My essay talking about CS (the major I want to do now which may change to informatics based on what you all tell me) basically talks about how I first got my programming book when 13 years old and how it sparked my interest in CS and motivated me to take CS courses at school and online. Then in 10th grade, I took a intro CS  class at school and the web development unit was what I fell in love with and was passionate about. How it motivated me to take an online web dev course, and how it inspired me to get a software engineering internship the following summer at a web dev firm. That's basically the essay in a nutshell.

The thing is, the essay talks about backend and front-end stuff. Even in my internship (in my essay, I talk about my experiences in the internship), I did graphics design and media creation and web application FRONT end for a majority of my time (I may have done a small backend task but that's about it). So if I chose informatics as my second major, I'd basically have to reuse the same essay. My CS experiences and web dev experiences not only made me interested in backend stuff, but also front-end (in fact, I kinda prefer front-end more). 

So what do I do? I don't have anything unique for the two different majors (should I declare an alternate backup major) and the one essay I have now  could potentially accurately describe how I have explored both majors. Even for my CS essay, I don't wanna remove the part about the internship. It was a ""software engineer position"" and that is pretty similar to CS.

Thanks!"

Right now i'm working on the design of a ""self-loading rotating system"" which is one part of an automated weighing and sorting system (which i'm also working on).
After having designed the shape and dimensions of this self-loading rotating system, I must now put it in motion.

here""s a picture to illustrate the loading system.
https://pasteboard.co/GTxy4Z9.jpg

The tiles are stacked in the top vertical magazine. my goal is, once it is full, to rotate this system by 90° in less than 0.6s so that the vertical magazine becomes horizontal and can be unloaded. then the process repeats itself  with the magazine that was horizontal before the rotation. the rotation would occure at most once every 20s.
Here's another picture of the whole rotating system (the turquoise blue parts are static, they don't rotate with the system)
https://pasteboard.co/GTxyISt.jpg

There are several sizes of this system that have to be interchangeable, therefore i'm using the biggest to have a powerful enough motor.

I tried to calculate the required torque to travel the needed distance (quarter circle) in 0.6s by using the electromechanic i had last year.
Here's a link to my calculation steps: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vhx1gcw2tt

If my calculation are correct, i would require a 6Nm torque, although i think i forgot other formulas to define the required force.

My concerns are the following:
     1. Are my calculation correct ?
     2. What type of motor would be the most adapted for my system ? I'm currently looking at stepper motors, either with a small torque but with a reducer to compensate or only with high torque. These motors seem quite well fitted for my case but DC motors could also be good as there are only 4 positions.

TL:DR
What would be the best electric motor/motor-reducer to rotate by 90° in 0.6s a ~9kg~ system with a moment of inertia of 0.345kg*m² ?

Thanks beforehand for your help.

Communication with my coworkers is less than ideal. The  employees I work with are usually remote and often don't communicate reliably. Sometimes they give me somewhat open-ended projects, then don't respond to questions I ask, so I am forced to do it my own way. Then it turns out wrong and I have to do it over. It's not like the biggest deal in the world, but it's disheartening/embarassing and has happened multiple times.
 One  of my coworkers is also really grumpy. If I screw up on something or ask too many questions, he gets very visibly annoyed with me. I seem to screw up a lot and don't feel confident in what I am doing. I know I won't get a job offer after this internship (even if I did, I don't think I'd take it).

I am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression and this job is just wearing at my mental health. I just absolutely dread/fear coming in sometimes. But I only have 4 months til I graduate. 

I have concerns with either possible decision:

1. I quit and miss out on having 10 months of work experience rather than my current 6 months(this is my only degree-related work experience) and possibly make my manager a bit upset (he complained about a previous intern leaving early than expected) and thus may not have a great reference. Though there is no official end-date for my internship- it is just assumed that I would be gone once I found an actual job. So it's not like there is a commitment I am breaking. Additionally, I can deal money fine wise until I graduate, but it would obviously help to have some extra. 

2. I stay and end up getting fired (my biggest worry- I honestly think this may happen) and having to explain myself when I get asked about it in interviews for new jobs. If not fired, I will still have to deal with the daily anxiety that I get from this job. I also will not have as much time to schedule possible interviews in between class and work and will have little time to prepare for them.

Would love some advice on what you think I should do. Am I being dumb for wanting to quit? If you think quitting might be a good idea, how can I say why I am leaving without sounding melodramatic and burning a bridge?

When I think about April, I think that she is (a) dedicated to her religious beliefs, (b) coupled with Jackson, and (c) a Trauma surgeon. Now we have a Muslim intern who very possibly could get story lines related to how people perceive her faith, Maggie and Jackson are becoming a thing, and we already have Owen as a Trauma surgeon. April has had little to do thus far this season. Does anyone else worry that she might be written out?

I also worry because so many new interns have been brought on and are seemingly being given decent screen time, and the last time that this happened (Jo, Shane, Stephanie, Leah, and Heather), it came on the heels of some major cast exits and most of them were promoted to regulars.

Does anyone know when Sarah Drew's current contract runs out? I love her on the show and would be sad if she left (especially because I hope for an eventual April x Jackson reunion!)."

So next summer I will be on an internship on the west coast (Im from Northeast), and I'm going to need transportation to and from work. I'm not sure I want to make that drive twice, as the travel time could be better spent working, gaining experience, making money, etc. I was looking at extended car rentals, and it got me thinking about buying a used car and selling it at the end of the summer, unless I choose to keep it. I would probably plan to drive the car back at the end of the summer and sell it at home, where I am not pressed for time. I am a definitely a ""car person"", so I would have an interest in trying out a different type of car for a summer before possibly being a new one down the line and am willing to go above the usual rules of income v.s. car price.

I have no debt and this car would be purchased with cash. (about 10-15k for a model that is still within powertrain warranty - Ford Focus, VW golf, Mini Cooper or similar). I'm willing to lose a little money on the depreciation, but 3 month rentals were all above $2,000 anyway, so perhaps I really wouldn't be losing that much after all. 


tl;dr 

It would be easier/cheaper/more fun to fly to my internship city, buy a used car there, and drive it back at the end of the summer - to either be later sold or kept. Is there any major flaw in my thinking? 

Thanks! "

I thought my interviews went really well, and got particularly good feedback from my interview with one of their engineering managers. Answering one my questions, he even let slip something like ""You'll find out what that's like when you get here.""

So I think I *may* have only just missed out on being part of a group of 22 (source: HR interviews) interns for the Summer. 

The thing is, I have a friend who yesterday got an offer, but I know he's got a better one at a trendy Unicorn that's he's going to take. Also, he knows someone that got an offer too (they interviewed same day or something), but they're probably not going to take it either as they have an offer at AMZN.  

So my question is, is there a certain number of people, that should they take other offers, would cause the HR team to reach back out to candidates and offer them 'second chance draw' positions? 

Say if this group of 22 offers became ~18 following through, would they try and do a top up?

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

Although there are various traditional methods available, today through this post, let's shed some more light on a well established form of therapy that is primarily used in Europe and U.S.A but is slowly but surely gaining importance in India.
 
Dance Movement Therapy.
 
Like any other expression based therapy, Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) is based on the idea that an individual will express himself/herself openly in an environment that is supportive and nurturing and this in turn will help promote healing. 
Dance Movement Therapy finds its origins through the work of Marian Chase. Chase is regarded as the pioneer of DMT and was professionally a dance instructor. It was in her dance school that she noticed the positive effects of dance on her students. She noticed that for her them, dancing was more than just a series of body movements combined together. It was more of an outlet for expressing themselves and their feelings. After further continuing her study at the Washington School of Psychiatry, Chase was able to lay the foundations of modern day Dance Movement Therapy. One of the most important contributions by Chase was the creation of the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA), an organization dedicated to the cause of DMT.
 Dance Movement Therapy as it is known today started shaping into place towards the end of the 20th century when therapists began using dance as a means of therapy. It was at this time that Dance Movement Therapy gained acknowledgement as a method of psychotherapy.
 
SO WHAT IS DMT?
 
The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA), defines Dance Therapy as ""Psychotherapeutic use of movement to further the emotional, cognitive, physical and social integration of the individual based on the premisr that the body, mind and soul are connected.""
 
It is a form of therapy that uses body movements as a key factor to understand expressed and communicative behaviour. The basic premise of the therapy is to free the repressed emotions and feelings that are stuck inside the body and mind and are causing problems. When repressed emotions or unresolved trauma gets stuck inside the body, it leads to problems and DMT aims at targeting these emotions to form the basis of assessing the individual and coming up with a suitable intervention plan.  There will often be certain barriers in verbal therapy sessions that prevent one from completely opening up and expressing, which is where DMT targets the underlying deep emotions, based on the idea that movements reflect an individual's pattern of thinking and feeling.
 
DMT therapists believe that the mind and body are interconnected and any change in the emotional state of an individual results in a positive or negative effect on the body. The negative effects can be seen through illnesses, negative expressions, unbalanced emotions, impaired movements etc.
 
A DMT session usually makes use of stages.  Preparation is the first stage and it makes use of warming up the body to reduce risk of injury.  Incubation is the next stage where the focus is on creating an internal environment through verbal instructions by the therapist. This helps to create a relaxed and comfortable session. The next stage is the Illumination stage where through talking to the individual, one learns what different movements mean and what they actually exhibit. It helps to showcase how the negative and positive effects are impacting the individual. The last and final stage is Evaluation which involves a share and feedback activity based on the occurrences of the session to share insights and move towards the end of the session.
 
WHAT DANCE STYLE DOES A DMT SESSION USE?
 
The dance style used in a sessions largely depends on the people participating in the session.  Many dance styles such as freestyle, yoga based, Latin dance styles, ballroom dances, etc are used.  The dance style depends largely on the needs of the individual or the group participating in the dance. Therapists can make use of improvised dancing along with having the participants follow a choreographed section.
 
WHO CAN GO FOR A DMT SESSION?
 
The answer to that is simple. Anyone can attend a DMT session. From adults to children, DMT can be beneficial for all. It is particularly useful for anyone facing emotional distress, unresolved trauma, victims of abuse, when dealing with loss or sudden acceptance of chance, prolonged health and mental problems, learning disabilities, speech disabilities , attention span deficits, depression, inability to express oneself verbally, bodily problems that restrict movement such as arthritis, ageing etc. It can also be useful for someone who wants to improve their self awareness and communication skills. It is also a helpful outlet for stress reduction and mode of relaxation.
DMT is practised at various set ups such as mental health care facilities,  private nursing homes and clinical set ups, medical set ups, rehabilitation centres,  education set up such as schools and colleges, residential treatment set ups etc.
 
WHAT ARE THE BENFITS OF DMT?
 
1. DMT makes use of complete integration of the mind and body through various brain functions and body movements to create a complete body and soul experience.
2. It combines usage of multiple areas of the brain simultaneously rather than only activating one part thereby increasing cognitive and physical recovery.
3. It helps in enhancing interpersonal relations through increasing self awareness, creating trust, reducing anxiety, establishing and enhancing boundaries etc.
4. Dmt helps in releasing repressed emotions and acts an outlet for the release without actually having to talk about it.
5. Anyone can take up DMT. This helps boost confidence and increase self-esteem and reduces complexes.
6.  It is particularly helpful for children with various learning disabilities, memory related issues, slow development, hearing impaired, speech related issues, anxiety and trust issues,  attention deficits etc,
7. It is an effective method of undercovering abuse and trauma, especually in children.
8.  It helps increase the connection between thoughts, feelings and emotions.
9. It promotes mental and physical health by aiding in relaxation and stress reduction.
10. It helps in increasing not only psychological benefits but also physiological benefits such as flexibility, reduced body ailments, reduced muscle tension,  increasing body circulation etc.
11.  As it does not require any prior experience of dancing, and explicit coordination skills, it is advantageous to one and all.
12.  It is particularly useful for anyone suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.
Although there are only a few advantages listed above, there are many more to Dance Movement Therapy.
 
SO CAN ANYONE CONDUCT A DMT SESSION?
 
As simple as the idea of dancing sound, it is actually not that easy to facilitate. One has to be a certified DMT therapist to be able to fully understand body movements, interpret the language of emotions and help form a structured intervention program that will actually benefit the individual. It is crucial to understand body movements, motions,  emotions, non verbal gestures to help the individual achieve emotional, cognitive, physical and social integration. The therapist will also observe the individual as to how he/ she communicates and reacts to other individuals in a group setting.  They will also observe how you sue and react to the various props that are used during the session.
There are two registered courses for a dance therapists.
The R-DMT, Registered Dance Mmovement Therapist has the basic level of training as put forward by the ADTA. They also require a masters degree and a minimum of 700 hours of supervised clinincal internship. They can conduct dance therapy sessions in a clinical or educational setting.
The BC-DMT, Board Certified Dance Therapist has completed the basic and advanced levels of training as put forward by the ADTA. They have also succesfully passed the qualifying examination and over 3000 hours of supervised clinical internship. They are qualified to conduct dance therapy in their own private practice setting along with acting as supervisory therapists that provide training.
 
Dance Therapy is one of the most advantageous therapies that is gaining importance in India as it is beneficial to one and all.  It not only helps to aid in healing and promoting wellbeing but only helps in overall enhancement of the total physical and mental framework of an individual. Awareness and interest at a large scale level is needed today to propel DMT into the league of traditional mental health therapeutic methods followed in India but slowly but surely, the times are changing."

7cw0jy,25,2017-11-14,What about Ineffective assistance of counsel,Cant_u_see,TickTockManitowoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TickTockManitowoc/comments/7cw0jy/what_about_ineffective_assistance_of_counsel/,"Now first of all of you people residing in the Jerry and Dean fan club please don't give me grief - this isn't about them personally this is about another angle to achieving Justice.
Jerry and Dean understand this so I hope you do too. Now I believed Jerry and Dean are men of fine character and there's no doubt that they're excellent lawyers, but from what I can see in this case their performance was not that good. there are many reasons why, one is I don't believe that they had a unified strategy and worked as a team and two it's always bothered me that all during the trial and after the trial when asked if they fought Steven Avery was innocent they are always answered they didn't know now an attorney going to do a much better job if he believes his client is innocent and Jerry and Dean surely have enough evidence of what was happening to make that determination it also bothered me that neither one of them spoke up about KK is tactics ethics Etc. Neither one stood up to him.
So  here is a list which is based on acceptable reasons which is based on what the courts have accepted in the past as ineffective assistance of counsel I believe there are many other let's start from the beginning
1. failure to vigorously pursue an actual change of venue 

With the judge and jury bussed in from Manitowoc, and the KK press conferences SAs chances for a fair trial was greatly reduced.

2. failure to petition to have the judge recused.

If SA was to get a fair trial B &amp; S should have tried to get a judge that wasn’t from the conflict of interest county.

3. failure to place any questions on the initial jury questionnaire

B &amp; S stated i believe that they had just 6 passes they could use, which went fast but had they filed to have questions included that they authored the jury pool would have been effectively narrowed quite a bit making their 6 passes far more valuable and the jury much fairer for their client they were given add Buting and staying added some questions to the initial jury questionnaire they could have eliminated quite a number of the pool before they had to even think about using their 6 passes. This would have provided SA with a much more impartial jury being sat!

4. failure to file important pre-trial motions, to challenge  pretrial rulings, to request a mistrial based on a Brady violation, and failure to file formal complaints against KKs prosecutorial misconduct.

B &amp; S appear to have just accepted what was thrown at them, without fight or at least without much fight
 1
5. failure to plan and execute a strategic and cohesive plan in order to vigorously defend their client.

It almost seems as if B &amp; S split up the witnesses they would examine by going - one for you and one for me and so on. They never seemed united in a strategic way i think because they never formed a strategic plan for SAs defense. They should have (and probably did) realize the magnitude of the case and the first thing they should have done was put together a huge group of interns to work on the case - they should have assigned groups of 3 interns to find out everything they possibly could about one player in this drama at a time including all of THs friends, acquaintances, sisters, activities, etc. etc. their backgrounds etc. - they should have known more about TH than TH knew about TH as well as other players in this drama - they could have and would have known if she went to a Halloween party etc. - they could have found out so much! But no - B &amp; S allowed them self’s to be pulled around by the nose by the prosecution - and spread so thin they weren’t REALLY effective at anything.

6. failure to effectively cross examine and question the prosecutions witnesses, and failure to impeach their testimony when there were many chances

This will be a topic for another post!

7. failure to clearly show the jury how prevalent and pervasive the prosecutions witnesses testimony differed from their original statements

8. failure to call expert witnesses for the following purposes:
A. a DNA and crime scene expert to testify the amount of skill and time it would require to clean the house and the garage
B. an expert in investigations to testify on how missing person cases are investigated, as well as LE actions that were inappropriate.
C. any expert to refute the states experts

9. failure to demand a re-creation of Colburn finding the key

This alone would have possibly changed the outcome of the trial

10. failure to call BD as an alibi witness.

Maybe problematic or maybe brilliant

11. failure to do a proper investigation or follow up on items obtained from discovery.

12. failure to raise objections during testimony at appropriate times.

This goes to a failure on their part to protect SA rights

13. failure to make the state prove that TH is actually dead

14. failure to ask for a mistrial and file a complaint alleging jury tampering.

15. Coming up next post trial questions that could have made a difference

While I certainly missed what I expected for water cooler conversations (sports, cars, etc.) it was made up with the fact that I was surrounded by beautiful women all the time. Having just turned 18 and with this as my first internship, I considered it quite the benefit!

Trying to make a good impression, I never raised an eyebrow when the ladies would cordially ask me to literally do all the heavy lifting, such as helping arrange office furniture and moving boxes around. It's funny that the AC was never on those days as it made me sweat a bit and sometimes even remove a layer of clothing. They were always so supportive, watching, directing and vocally supporting me (even cheering sometimes, these ladies loved to have furniture moved). I also did not expect them to be so touchy-feely! Perhaps they were simply uncoordinated or simply unaware of the concept of personal space, because it seemed like they would always brush up against me in the break room or rub my arms while having a conversation or laughing at one of my jokes.

And boy was I really surprised at how casual they took business casual! My goodness, I would have a hard time focusing if my very own mother were to strut around in those types of heels, those short of skirts, and those low-buttoned blouses.

As you can imagine, when the offer was on the table for me to accept full-time employment (surprisingly after a mere 2 weeks of interning, I must have killed it!) I found it difficult to find reasons to say no. I cannot wait for the future adventures to be had in my career at the Miller and Ingram Law Firm!

Hello DPP! Looking for a girl to play-out what a day/career at the office would look like. Obviously, I'm interested in having the male be sexualized in the office for once. But I'm open and willing to take this in a number of different directions and have a lot of details about a number of characters you could play. Medium/Long foreplay &amp; realism (it can be oversexualized, just in a realistic way) is a MUST. Prefer 1st person perspective, but willing to do 3rd as well.

7cwdde,1,2017-11-14,Never getting out of here,PugBuddies,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/7cwdde/never_getting_out_of_here/,"After grad school, I spent nine months looking for a job. I was willing to go anywhere, and I wound up taking a job in a place I'd never been to before. 

Well, fast-forward a year and a half, and I'm ready to leave. This job, the one that was supposed to be a great start to a career, is menial work with a public that treats me like shit. I did far, far more interesting work--for a much more pleasant public--as an unpaid intern than I do now. And the pay sucks. It's enough to support myself, and I'm grateful for that, but I don't feel like I can afford even small luxuries. I haven't seen a movie in theaters in over a year. Doesn't help that I have no one to see them with, as I've been trying and largely failing to make friends here. 

I've been looking for a job in another part of the country (a place I've lived before, and know I like) for almost a year now. I've gotten almost nothing but rejection emails. About three weeks ago, I got a Skype interview. Because of the timing (I suggested a morning interview several days in the future, which would give me time to prepare and set up a more interview-friendly place than my apartment; but they insisted on doing it 15 minutes after my shift ended) I had little time to prepare. I completely bombed the interview. I saw one of the interviewers making faces the whole time, and I got a barely-friendly rejection letter (""We have decided not to grant you an interview"") a week later. Since the mail takes 3-5 days to send, they must have written it the day after the interview. 

I thought I'd get another interview soon, since I'd sent out several applications around the same time, but one by one those employers all said no. I'm still waiting on a couple to get back to me, but I'm almost certain they'll say no too. I'm still looking for jobs every day, but I'm not finding any I'm qualified for. I've applied for every opportunity I can find, and now all the opportunities have dried up. 

I feel like I'm not getting anything better because I don't deserve anything better. I work hard at my current job. I've gotten good performance reviews. My managers all seem to like me. And yet no one else will hire me. I applied for a small promotion with my current employer near the beginning of this year, and the position was given to someone with more seniority. I feel like I'm never going to get out of here, I'm never going to get anything better. I'll be working this shitty job until I die. "

7cwo4w,64,2017-11-14,Should you move to California after graduating?,fuck012345678,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/7cwo4w/should_you_move_to_california_after_graduating/,"The idea of relocating to the bay area upon graduation from university is deeply ingrained into the culture of the University of Waterloo. Many undergraduate engineering and math students strive to get high paying internships in the bay area during their co-op terms, and by graduation, a large number take full time positions in the area. Based on engineering cohort exit surveys I've seen for various programs, the number of students taking a position in the bay area hovers around 30-40%ish depending on the cohort and how focused the given engineering program is on software development. The sentiment on this subreddit is that 'Cali jobs' pay more and are more technically challenging. There are new posts on this subreddit all the time from students anxious about whether they can get a co-op opportunity in the golden state. 'Can I get Cali in 2A? 1B?', 'Should I go Cali or Bust?', 'I feel like shit because all of my friends got Cali jobs this term and I didn't', etc. Is all the stress really worth it?

The following post is my criticism of the idea that everyone who is able to get a fulltime job in the bay area should take it. This post does not focus on other areas of the states like NYC or Seattle, as I know little about what it's like to live in those places, however some of the points in this post apply to these locations as well.

**Finances**

A lot of people convert their base salary in USD to CAD, and then say that they make X amount of money more than Canadians at the same salary. Is this a fair comparison? To really compare, we should compare net pay after rent and taxes. 
Let's compare salaries with realistic numbers. Based on a new grad survey I have, the average eng grad working in software in USA makes about 105k USD base, and the average eng grad working in software in Canada makes about 80k CAD base, typically in Waterloo or Toronto. Let's do the same analysis on these two salaries:
105k USD =&gt; $70,964 USD after tax

80k CAD =&gt; $62,816  CAD after tax

Now we need to take into account rent. This is a bit tricky, because rent is highly dependent on the individual. Do you live with roommates? Do you live with your landlord? (it's not worth it, trust me). To keep this simple, let's first assume that you want to live by yourself in a 1 bedroom apartment in the center of whatever city you live in.

The Rent

It's no secret that the rent is high in the bay area. We can simplify the bay area into two locations for analysis. San Francisco and South Bay. San Francisco has high rent but a better public transportation system. South bay has a weak public transportation system but lower rent. We will use San Jose as a fairly typical city in South Bay, and Waterloo and Toronto for the Canadian salary comparisons.

Let's do a fair comparison, of a 1 bedroom apartment in the city center for all four cities.
Based on my source [1] this comes out to:

[rent monthly cost] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in local currency] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in CAD]

$3,259.86 USD for SF =&gt; $31,846 USD =&gt; $40,590 CAD 

$1,703.08 CAD for Toronto =&gt; $42,379 CAD

$863.79 CAD for Waterloo =&gt;  $52,451 CAD

$2,372.09 for SJ =&gt; $42,499 USD =&gt; $54,169.44 CAD

This analysis suffices to show that just because salaries in California are on average about $20 - 25k higher, the actual net monetary gain is not as clear cut. You can repeat the analysis for people who would prefer to live with roommates and the rent numbers sums would be smaller. Let's do it. Taking the data for 3 bedroom apartment outside of the city center and dividing it by three, we get the following numbers:

[rent monthly cost] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in local currency] =&gt; [net salary after tax and rent in CAD]

$1485.41 USD near SF =&gt; $53139.08 USD =&gt; $67710 CAD 

$721.77 CAD near Toronto =&gt;  $54154.76 CAD

$495.61 CAD near Waterloo =&gt; $56868.68 CAD

$624.52 USD near San Jose =&gt; $63469.76 USD =&gt; $80883.96 CAD


My interpretation of these results is that you are going to make more money in the US relative to Canadians only if you rough it out with roommates and a long commute for a long period of time after graduation. Also, you can see that the net salaries in the local currency in the second rent comparison are very close. You will also have more expenses like groceries in the local currency which will drive the conversion rate benefit down. So you are also only going to make more money in the US if you time your conversions from USD to CAD well and move back to Canada after a few years. You are more or less speculating on the price of oil, as the CAD is kind of a 'petrocurrency' [2], and the price of oil is volatile. In my opinion these gains of USD to CAD are not very significant, and you're going to have to have lower quality of life in your twenties to get these small monetary benefits. Is it really worth it?

In addition, while San Jose / South bay may look like the best location financially, you also have to keep in mind that you will likely need to buy a car in south bay to have a life there. The public transportation system in South Bay is very poor. There's the San Jose light rail and the Caltrain which have stops which are very far apart, and then there are buses that run very infrequently. The point is that you're probably going to buy a car if you move to the south bay area permanently. There's not much way around it. Unless you want to be stuck at home all the time, or Uber everywhere, you need a car to actually have a life in the large suburban sprawl of south bay. So you need to buy a car, and owning a car comes with costs. Gas and auto insurance. In Canadian cities like Waterloo and Toronto, the public transportation system is much more developed and a car is not at all necessary. Gas prices are high and auto insurance varies considerably depending on if you're male or female, but is still high for young drivers. This is something to consider if you plan to move to the south bay.

As co-op students we do not look at the cost of housing as US interns often get stipends or corporate housing. We do not really even look at the tax rate too much, as we get a lot of our earnings back because of not working for a full year at a time. It is easy to overlook these factors and get the idea that US salaries are way higher than Canadian salaries for fulltime, but is that really the case? Admittedly you will make more money in the US if you make frugal decisions in life, but is it really worth the move? As co-ops, we quickly convert our earnings to CAD and see the benefit of the exchange rate every term when we move back and forth. Someone who spends 5 years in the bay area then moves back to Canada might have the experience of 5 years of frugal living with roommates and then slightly higher wealth in Canada. 

Some may mention high stock benefits another benefit of moving to the bay area.  You generally only get these if you work at a 'big 4' / top public company, and if you can get a job at the 'big 4' in California you can probably get one in Canada, or you can transfer your offer to a Canadian office. So I will not account for these in my analysis.

The one take away from this is that we should not take our 105k bay area salary and multiply it by the exchange rate, and imply that since we make $134k CAD, we are building wealth much faster than someone who stayed in Waterloo or Toronto. From the above analysis, we can see that this is simply not the case. Now that we've discussed the matter of finances, let's talk about some more subjective things. This will be mostly opinion based, so your millage may very.

**Quality of Life**

I can't speak for San Francisco, but as someone who has done co-op terms in South Bay, frankly, it's not a great place to live for someone in their 20's. As I previously mentioned, the public transportation system is very underdeveloped. This means that if you want to get around, you need to have either a car or pay a lot in Uber fees. And there's also... just not much to really do here. It's a massive suburban sprawl filled with corporate campuses and apartment complexes. In my experience, it pales in comparison to a city like Toronto. It is comparable to a Waterloo with basically no public transportation. San Francisco is probably better but has its own issues like crime, and the rent is insanely high. Without a car in South Bay you're essentially like a senior citizen, too old to drive, stuck in their own house. Given the high rent prices, you will likely be living with roommates for a long time after you graduate, and you will have to buy a car and pay insurance premiums if you live in South Bay. Will your quality of life really be better if you accept a bay area fulltime offer? I would argue no, at least not in the short term.

**Career Trajectory and the Future**

Another common idea that I hear all the time is that the bay area provides more opportunities for career growth or more interesting work. Actually I somewhat agree with this. It seems to me that bay area companies are much more serious about software development, and value software skillsets off of the generic web development path that don't get as much use in Canada like machine learning, distributed systems, networks, etc. Of course there are companies in Canada that require these skills as well, though.

The thing about moving up the career ladder in the bay area and getting promotions here is that you will have to keep in mind that you will likely want to move out of the state eventually. Settling down in the bay area, meaning getting married and having kids, is expensive, not only if you want to buy a house (it's near impossible), but daycare is expensive here as well. The argument I typically hear is 'work in the bay area, earn USD and come back to Canada to reap the benefits later'. So if you follow that mentality you will have to have a 'temporary' view to your entire life in the bay area.  Your friendships will be temporary, as you will have to move away in X years. Your employment will be temporary, even though you're a fulltime employee. You will have to uproot your life in 5-10 years when you decide to move out. That might mean restarting at another company and having to climb the corporate ladder again, or you may be able to get a senior position due to your experience. If you're the type of person that can easily adapt to change, which I assume most people here are because of co-op then this may or may not be a big deal. Really depends on the person. But I will say, restarting your social life in your late twenties may be difficult, and you may struggle to make deep friendships like you can make in high school / university with people you are forced to spend time with.

**Family and Relationships**

If you're a Canadian citizen, living in the bay area means living far away from your family, and probably most of your friends too. As a new graduate, you will typically have about three weeks of PTO, maybe 4 if you're lucky, or “unlimited” if you're unlucky. With three weeks of vacation, it's likely that you will be able to take at maximum 3 but more realistically 1-2 trips back to Canada per year. If you're considering living in California for say 5 years after graduation, you should ask yourself: am I willing to see my parents 5-10 more times in the next five years? Because that's a realistic estimate of how much time you will actually be able to spend with them. Some people are okay with that, some are not. If you have a girlfriend in Canada, the same logic applies, unless they want to move to the bay area with you. That's pretty unlikely unless your girlfriend works in tech, because who in their right mind would want to move here without a huge paycheck? Also, what happens if your parents get ill and need someone to take care of them? The bottom line is that if you spend a long time in the bay area you will be alienated from your family, and you will have very few opportunities to interact with them except over the phone / skype.

Finally, I conclude that moving to the bay area is not worth it, at least for me personally. It's marginally better in terms of finances, way worse in terms of quality of life and personal relationships. I made this post because in my early years of university I used to be so obsessed over getting a high paying tech job and doing co-ops in California, but to me the bay area is very overhyped and not at all worth the move for fulltime. I can't believe how naive I was. It might be worth it as a co-op, but as a fulltime, I don't think it is. I wanted to share my opinion so that some first and second year students can have a broader view of what it's like to actually move to the bay area and have some realistic expectations about living here and what it means for your future after graduation.

7cx7vq,1,2017-11-14,Any other insights on company destinations I could be finding? + a really helpful Tableau tool,PBandBagels,visualization,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualization/comments/7cx7vq/any_other_insights_on_company_destinations_i/,"As a side project the director of my agency wants me to look into some ways to visualize and interpret data around geolocations. Our agency has multiple campuses across the region, a few hours apart, and finding a point in between to have the occasional all staff gathering can be a pain, because every grouping complains that they have to drive more. 

I've uploaded everyone's addresses in an excel sheet and found a few geomapping tools, like [BatchGeo](https://batchgeo.com/) that help visualize groupings and map all the points. What the director really wanted was some insight on how much people are driving to our current all staff meeting points and BatchGeo doesn't do any batch calculating.

After a lot of searching, I found this [great blog post](https://tableauandbehold.com/2015/09/22/extremely-fast-geocoder-and-driving-distance-finder/) with a tableau map pack that helps me calculate driving time and distance between several map points and a single map point. I've uploaded that data for every one of the 9 all-staff locations into a sheet on excel and calculated average driving time and the standard deviation for each location. With this information, we can at least pinpoint which locations have the lowest average driving time for company members, taking variation into consideration.

My instructions have been vague - this is more of a ""let's give the intern something to do"" sort of project than anything else, but being that I'm interested in data analysis, I'm having fun with trying to make the most out of this as possible. Any other insights I could be finding with the data that could help select the best location, or find new and better locations? Do you know of other helpful tools?"

I came to Dresden for a 2 week internship and I don't really have much to do in the evenings so I thought going to a football game could be fun. Dynamo plays Kaiserslautern on Monday and I have a few questions concerning the game.

* How much are the tickets 
* Do I have to buy them in advance or will it be fine to do this just before the match. Do I need to register somewhere before my first game?
* Which sector might be the best for me. I heard the support is huge and I would be rather quiet as I don't even speak German
* How long before the game should I be around the stadium not to miss anything
* I heard the fans are regarded as dangerous but I also do know people tend to exaggerate in the matter of football supporters, I shouldn't worry about anything, right? I sometimes go to local games and I think I know the not-do basics about football games and supporting
* Any other information is welcome

Im 27 and come from Poland if thats important. On a  side note, Dresden is really impressive, I already love the city. I stay in Altstadt and theres so many beautiful places around. 

Greetings,
Tomek

Is he being scammed?,Lonely-Cub,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7cxaql/my_college_roommate_has_an_odd_internship_where/,"My roommate and I are freshmen in college. He is new to the big city and is from far out in the country and I think he might be taken advantage of. I don't know where my roommate works but he says it is at a financial institute and he spends a lot of time working. This past weekend he left for 4 days and said it was for work. He is often struggling with his financial state because of money he has to spend on gas and he has no income besides money that his parents will sometimes be able to send him.

He has been working for this company for a month and he has not been paid for any of the work he has done. He said that he is being trained to become a sort of financial adviser, and so far his description of what he does is mostly go to meeting, do busy work, and he makes calls to what I believe are clients. One reason why I think he might be getting scammed is that he has made calls to people trying to recruit them for the same program he is in. He has told me that once he finishes being trained he will be making good money, but so far he hasn't been paid anything. When I asked him if it was an internship he said that it wasn't which sounded weird because I have never heard of a job where you are not paid at all. The second reason is an odd one, some days at around 1 a.m he will get picked up by his boss. He will usually not come back until 5 a.m. This is what I can't understand why would he go to work in the afternoon and then come back just to go back to work late are night. He told me that at 1 a.m. he will drive around the city with his boss and remove signs of the side of the road and replace them with his bosses company's signs.

This is all I have learned about his job and the more I hear about it the more I believe he is being scammed, and I wanted to let someone know to see if maybe I'm just being paranoid or he is actually being scammed."
7cxayq,3,2017-11-14,How to gauge if a startup is worth going to?,guinkimmel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7cxayq/how_to_gauge_if_a_startup_is_worth_going_to/,"I have a great internship offer with a startup that I really like called DigitalOcean in NYC, my preferred location, but there isn't much information online about what the internship program is like, so I am a little hesitant about accepting. The interview process was very pleasant, people there seem great, and the product seems cool, but those are not distinguishing characteristics (in comparison to many other companies). I've requested more phone conversations with engineers so I can have a better perspective of the team I would be working with, but other than that I don't know what else I should be looking for.

For context, I interned at Google last summer, so I thought that I may want to try something new, but I am interviewing/have offers with two other Big 4s right now and LinkedIn. I want to make sure that if I go to a startup, it is somewhere I would grow/learn as much (or more) as an engineer before I decide to take it, especially since the compensation may be slightly lower than typical big company intern salaries. I also have friends who have horror stories about startups that were poorly run, and I would prefer not to spend my summer being in an environment like that. 

For anyone who has worked at a startup, what was your thought process in choosing that company, especially over a big name company? What kind of factors do you consider? What kind of resources do you use to find more information about these companies (other than the obvious Reddit/Google search and Glassdoor)? How do you gauge the growth potential/stability of a startup? Any obvious red flags that I should be aware of? How do you compare different startups? (I have an on-site with another startup called Affirm in SF next week, as well, but, again, not much information about their internship program online.)"

23/M, just graduated in May with a dual-major in marketing and business management. 

A few weeks ago, I applied to an entry level marketing analytics position. Fast-forward to last week, I forgot about that company since they hadn't gotten back to me, so I continued to apply to more jobs anyways. 

In regards to the other job, a recruiting company contacted me about an analyst position somewhere else. At first, I dismissed it, but after take some more time to think about it, I figured why not. So I went in for the interview through this recruiting company. 

Now, the first company called me and said that I was not a good fit for their marketing analytics position, but they would offer me a marketing analytics internship on a contract, hourly-pay basis, and if I would do well, they would convert me to full time (similar to how recruiting companies work, where they make you work on contract with hourly pay. Same idea). 

In the meantime, I spoke to one of my mentors from my community, he advised me to email the company that offered me the internship position and to tell them that I have already been offered a different position at a different company, and to let me know as soon as possible. 

I need a way to email back the company that offered me the internship position and see if they can set up an interview by later this week, because my first day at the other position through the recruiting company would be this Monday. 

Pros And Cons For Recruiting Company position:
Pros: Large company, looks great on resume, seems like a good analyst position to gain experience.
Cons: The pay is crap. And of course, with all recruiting companies, they take a small cut of the salary. I tried negotiating the pay, and they budged a little bit, and that was it. Still not much **at all**, but I guess I've got to start somewhere. 

Pros And Cons For Marketing Analytics Internship Position: 
Pros: I don't know for sure, but I'm almost 100% that the pay would be more than the recruiting company. (Both contract, hourly positions) and I'm more familiar with the commute, the position is more in line with what I studied in school, so I'm more familiar with it (I'm aware that not everyone goes on to work in the same field that they studied in college, but still). 

Cons: It's kind of a random company, so it doesn't look as good on my resume, but I'm thinking that bottom line, an analyst position would be doing the same analyst work (computer skills) across the board, so I guess it's a good learning experience as well.

What do you guys think? If I do end up going with the marketing analytics internship, I would have to schedule an interview by Thursday the latest, since as I mentioned before, my first day with the job through the recruiting company would be on Monday.

Thank you!!!

**TL;DR**: 
Company 1: Large company, looks great on resume, seems like a good analyst position to gain experience. But... The pay is crap. And of course, with all recruiting companies, they take a small cut of the salary. 

Company 2: Figuring almost 100% that the pay would be more than Company 1. (Both contract/intern, hourly positions), I'm more familiar with the commute to Company 2, the position is more in line with what I studied in school, so I'm more familiar with it  "

We go back almost 4 years at this point. Our relationship had a lot of ""shared trauma"" and many events that caused us to become particularly close (I can elaborate if necessary). Up until about 2 months ago, we didn't speak at all for about 16 months. At that time I determined I was mostly over her and she wanted to catch up for my birthday and see how I was doing. That meeting went fine, and I decided to unblock her.

I have been in rather private, casual relationship with my new girlfriend (GF) for only about 4 months. Everything is great with her, she really cares about me, she's a little more clingy than previous girlfriends, but otherwise as far as I'm concerned she's a real keeper.

---

Yesterday EX texted me for the first time since we met two months ago to inform me she was applying for an internship the company I work for offers. She even asked me to make an inside recommendation for her. I told her I would get her some more information on the opening, but privately I felt a bit uncomfortable with the idea of her working at the same location.

Obviously, it's not up to me whether or not the company I work for hires her. But if she is offered a position, even a temporary one, it could put me in a tough situation if she (EX) regularly tries to interact with me—not to mention the office gossip if word gets out she's my ex.

All that aside, should I tell my new girlfriend? Would it change her interest in me if she knew I could be working with my ex? Should I just wait and see what happens before saying anything to her?

Overall, I just want to make sure I do the right thing and not create a hostile environment for my ex if she does end up working ""with"" me, nor ruin my current relationship.

7cyh86,1,2017-11-14,What you need to know about working for MSP's.,TreMatt,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7cyh86/what_you_need_to_know_about_working_for_msps/,"Most of the Managed Service Providers that I know work as outsourced IT departments.  This is the MSP definition that I will be referring to in this rant.  

I wanted to write this because there are probably some folks out there who are working for a managed service providers and absolutely love it.  This isn't for you.

Background: I had zero IT experience three years ago and was graduating college looking for work.  I was hired as an intern dispatcher for the techs at a small MSP.  I finished the internship and was hired as a full employee after 6 months.  I accomplished this by showing up each day, learning as much as I could very quickly, and providing decent customer service.

6 months after my internship the tier one tech quit for a better job.  After some lobbying I slipped into his position and took over as first line help desk.  A year later the tier 2 tech quit for a better job and I took over his position on a ""Temporary"" basis for a slight pay increase.  I was now help desk AND junior sysadmin.  This continued for a year until I was totally burned out.  Working 60-70 hours a week trying to support the tier 3 guy and everything else.  We were two dudes supporting over a thousand endpoints spread out across the state.

I started applying to some jobs in the area and was picked up as an in house system administrator at a company that really valued and invested in IT.  My weeks are 40 hours.  I spend at least a quarter of that time hanging out and chatting with people.  I put in the minimum and my boss is always impressed in what I can get done.  I do all of this for a 30% raise over my last job.

So what did I learn?
MSP's can really grind you down but you will gain a return on investment in experience greater than just the time you work for them.  If you are trying to get into IT work, find a MSP apply for the lowest level to get in.  The turnover is huge in these companies so someone will always leave a seat open above you.

Beyond that what I have seen from other people in this sub about working for MSP's is pretty accurate.  You are a solution mill and you will never make everyone happy.  The MSP model is inherently flawed in that you are providing a service to companies who believe technology is not their core competency.  You will never be truly valued for your abilities because you are just a vendor.  

This leads to my ultimate job advice for all IT professionals.  If you feel overworked and undervalued it's probably because you work for a company that does not believe technology is their core competency.  

If you work for an MSP and feel like you are burning out don't be afraid to start applying other places.  I got my current job by listing specific technologies I had experience with and found out that most companies will be blown away by this.  In-house IT can be a great job if you find the right company. 

So how can you determine how a company value's their technology? Ask them how many users/endpoints they support and how much they have paid for their infrastructure.  I went from supporting 1000 endpoints with the cheapest hardware any company can get away with to 250 endpoints and a multi-million dollar budget just in IT.  You get what you pay for.  I am willing to bet the more a company invests in IT the better your quality of life will be.

Rant over."

My nstep-dad hated my dad so I didn’t tell him that my dad knew the founder but he ended up getting suspicious. This happened four years ago and the whole situation just seems so ridiculous to me now. 

Here’s the email: 

m62613,

This is a follow up to our brief conversation this morning.

You make these good things extremely difficult.  We are proud that you pursued and obtained a summer internship in an area that interests you.  We are disappointed in the process you used. That makes it hard to be excited.  The ends do not justify the means, and you were not forthcoming with this plan until after you had done much work on it.  This is deceitful, lying by omission, or perhaps being ""economical with the truth"".  You can take your pick from the definitions here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Lying_by_omission.  This is the second time in the last two months that I've been the victim of your behavior.  It is not fun. 

As a minor, you cannot work without your parent's approval, but you didn't seek to engage them in the process or try to convince them that this was a good idea. Instead, you assumed they would say no and decided to force the issue later, when you already had this good thing in hand.

One of the problems with building your relationships on deception is that people won't trust you and will treat you as untrustworthy.  You crave respect in your interactions, but you disrespect others through your actions.  You are not doing what is required to be given respect (it is, after all, earned not given).  You blame this lack of respect (most often) on your mother.  ""It's her fault she doesn't respect me"", you say.  Well, you are clearly contributing through your actions.  I doubt you see it, just as you don't see people willing to help you learn to study for tests.

OK, while I hope you've read the above, I fear all you care about is what we're going to do about this situation.  Here is what we're willing to do:

1) We currently have no details.  We must speak first with [name of the company] (I'm friends of friends with [person who works at the company] and [other person who works at the company] but the intro would be more logical through you) to understand the opportunity.  

In that conversation, they are going to hear two true things from me:  1) you didn't tell us until now that you were applying, and 2) you said that [name of the company] reached out to you first.   If speaking those two truths to your summer employer make you uncomfortable, then that's one way you know you've done something wrong.

After the conversation, If the opportunity makes sense to me and you are comfortable getting transport there and back, then you have our support, along with the following condition.

2) You have said (during these last two deceptive episodes) that you feel quite justified in your deception in order to get your way.  This deeply disturbs me. Therefore, any money you make will go to professional help on understanding your own behavior.  You and I will meet repeatedly with a therapist to talk this through.  In this way, you will get both a summer internship experience and hopefully some insight into where your process and character are failing you.

Do you agree to this?

I am a junior in computer science and I am super interested in machine learning. I was fortunate enough to have a machine learning internship last summer and I am also doing research work in machine learning. I got an A in my Intro to AI course.

I was wondering if it's possible to get into a machine learning job even without a grad degree? My university offers a grad level machine learning course but I can take it if the professor thinks I am capable enough. Though, this being a grad level course, I'm sure my GPA will take quite the hit. Nevertheless, it is something I'm interested in.

What I'm not interested in, though, is going to grad school. So do you guys think people with only a bachelor's degree can get good machine learning positions?

Thanks!"

7cz1hr,0,2017-11-14,Declining userbase or why i quit DotA 2: big emotional rant from 8+ years player.,Grach43,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7cz1hr/declining_userbase_or_why_i_quit_dota_2_big/,"**Disclaimer: Dota is the perfect example of love-hate relationship. Pretty much everyone I know hates this game but plays it daily. Since ive started playing it myself I completely stopped playing other games because they are so boring in comparison. Im still very passionate about it and enjoy it, but i cant play it anymore. As a player with 8+ years of playing dota i would love to share my thoughts on current state of the game and maybe open some useful (tbh no) discussion. I wrote the main part of this rant in emotions around a week ago, and now i just went through it, tried to structure it nicely and rephrased some parts of it. And obligatory ""english is my 2nd language pls no flamerino"" notice.** 

There are always some pros and cons, like in every other aspect of our lifes.

Firstly i would like to introduce myself e.g. tell about my DotA background. You can skip this paragraph completely.:

I first started playing this game 8 or 9 years ago. LAN-Parties, i have no option to choose because everyone plays this weird WC3 map and me stuck playing it feeling retarded af.
But nonetheless, i persisted and somehow i ended up playing this game for much longer than everyone whom i knew at the time. I never had the talent to play this game, i calibrated at 2k and only countless hours spent playing and watching replays allowed me to achieve 5,4k. In DotA 2 i played most notably against Prodota Gaming and i was lucky to sometimes play against pros like Miracle or MindControl. Even though i was more happy to play against Vigoss.I have around 4,5k hours clocked in in DotA 2 and same goes for DotA 1. Probably twice as much spent just thinking about it or watching streams

But everything comes to its end. At least in my case.

As you may have noticed, player numbers drop lower and lower; while DotA serves really niche audience who dont like playing some shitty ass anime brainless MOBA games (jk), i still think the major part of it is to blame on Valve. 

It hurts to see how the approach they choose doesnt allow the game to prosper. 

Im lurking on r/DotA2 since more then 3 years and there ALWAYS were complaints about developers. Just on top of my head:

1. abandoning their dev forum
2. not communicating with playerbase (us) in any way
3. not testing their updates properly (QA haha we just let our players test it for us bcus we dont care about them as its not our responsibility hahaHAHA and someone like u/bu3nyy will end up writing up every single bug he can find out but we are not going to fix it hahaHAHA enjoy the game)
4. not caring about workshop artists (remember the rant?)
5. not caring about mod developers (remember the rant?)
6. not caring about SFM tools. 
7. always broken India/SA/SEA/Japan/Dubai servers (haha noone plays there anyway)
8. not adressing boosting/smurfing/sandboxing/scripting issues until VERY RECENTLY (GUYS NUMBERS ARE DECLINING)
9. inconsistencies EVERYWHERE: tooltips, abilities, interactions (dont you have interns of some kind which could go through them?)
10. broken ability draft 
11. my personal issue - nerfing carry role (shrines, side shop, creepwaves, offlaner buffs and carry nerfs, this has been going on for 3 recent patches). you cant 1vs5 anymore, its impossible and you have to work around your team. 
12. broken guides (shoutout u/TorteDeLini)
13. Pimpmuckl not being invited (sorry) 
14. my personal issue again - taking over replays doesnt work since ages
15. killing dota trade system 
16. not sticking to their own cosmetics guidelines (rather minor because who cares)
17. not working AI, outdated builds, bots stuck with 2 branches magic wand and circlet etc. 
Excuse me, but those are just things on top of my head. Im sure if ill stick around ill remember more of them but i think thatsenough. Sidenote: remember how they couldnt figure out Blink bug? (Loda Slardar saving DotA)

18. and FINALLY NO NORMAL TUTORIAL FOR AGES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET NEW PEOPLE COMING IF THEY JUST CANT GET INTO IT WITHOUT STICKING IN HUNDREDS OF HOURS. Imagine the workload? Sometimes i think there are no players whove got into this game by themselves, its either old school dota1 players like me or friends who introduce them to the game. 

But whats so crazy about this game - **you cant escape the addiction**. Even now i look through my past matches from 2+ years on dotabuff and i consistently see 2-8 accounts still active today. The problem is, right now everyone who has got into DotA probably reaches their 22-24 – me included. Time when you start having less and less time and you slowly quit playing this game. I guess this is what happening - and there is no new blood. Look at pro scene - so many old names and almost no new players. Who are the new generation stars? Sonneiko? Silent was his university mate. Sumail? Played since childhood. Miracle? Maybe, but there are always exeptions to the rule. Fear, Dendi, Puppey, etc etc, more or less the same names everywhere.

The only positive things i saw were:

1. Valve devs directly answering to some performance related questions on reddit
2. Recent measures to prevent 8., 10. because guess what? - declining numbers finally started to dawn on them. The game is really unpleasant to play. The amount of stress you have in this game is INSANE. Last two years, i played every day for 2-6 hours. I stopped playing around 3 months ago and guess what - i feel like i am on emotional vacation, literally. I even feel like there is not enough stress/conflict in my life, thats how weird it is. Last week i went to jump with parachute. 

The thing about me personally is - this game gets me hooked on if i cope through first ~20 matches after a long break. Right now i play (lose) one game in a week and immediately shut down the game as fast as i can because its so awful.

I remember when i was grinding mm, it felt like JOB and well it was one. You stomp - you dont feel anything. You lose - you are mad. Only if the game was close and we won i felt some kind of satisfaction. My day depended on how many games i won.

And i still have this passion inside me: im still around on this sub, i like to watch russian rejects alohadance and arthas. But im really pissed off because of how no[o]ne really cares about the community around it (key users) and just spits me into my face. I guess Valve really only employs developers. 

Is it not possible in 2017 to hire an intern and make him check every tooltip for consistency? 
Whats wrong with this company? They develop game for hundreds of thousands of players and they just CANT get the basics down, some kind of CONSISTENCY. There are so many wonderful people in this community who do so much for players for free, and this just pisses me off. 

Final argument - toxicity. Now it might get a little too personal but since i want my complaint to include everything, ill write it out. My gf doesnt play dota. Never played. Well, she was interested enough to give it a try. I see her struggling, try to guide and support her. At the time she has around 80 hours. We play together for the first time (she played against bots) and some asshole starts to flame the shit out of her. I told her to mute him, explained how to do it and i thought she did. Actually she couldnt MUTE HIM. Remember the bug when you had to click slightly under the MUTE button? THANKS VALVE. 

But she didnt tell me and was silent until the end of the game. Then she ended up crying on my lap because this asshole flames her for the last 15 minutes blaming his lose on my gf (well he was probably right in the sense that she was playing bad, but he got matched with 5,4k player instead). After this game, she has never played DotA. I tried to convince her, showed how mute button actually functions (thx Valve), but it was kinda too late. This guy probably already forgot about this game and hwo he succesfully reduced potential playerbase by 1. Now think about how many of new-coming players can 1 (ONE) such player make to never wish to play the game again?

This was one of the last straws when i started to think about quitting dota. Thought about it for quite a long time and finally started to cool down 3 months ago. Do not intend to come back unless they fix issues mentioned above (at least half of them) or my dota hunger wins (lets be honest you can never be sure you quit forever).

But even if i return its for sure not in the next year. Maybe next autumn. Thanks for reading my rant. I really love this game but im tired of this BS.

I had a lot of trouble figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. When I was applying to college, I kept switching my application between CS and another major. I ended up choosing the other major because it was slightly more prestigious and had better job security from what I had heard. I realized halfway through freshman year that I liked CS more than my major at the time and wanted to switch. I thought my GPA wasn't high enough to (which, looking back, was extremely misguided), so I switched into business/liberal arts instead since I'd prefer that to my major at the time.

It's currently my junior year and I'm kicking myself in the ass for not trying to transfer into CS. It's too late for me now per university policy. Job prospects for my major aren't too great, and most people come out with a $30k starting salary. I'm liking my classes less and less to the point that I almost miss my first major and wish I stayed in it. I'm doing a CS certificate at my school instead, but I know I won't learn nearly as much as I would've with a CS degree.

My BF is a CS major and just got an internship from Facebook. I'm really, really proud of him and I love him a lot. Every once in a while, something will trigger my insecurity. Today, I got a generic recruiter message on LinkedIn about a job at Facebook, for example. I'll start to think about how my BF gets to do things that I would've loved to do for my career, and then I think about how I could've been doing the same things if I had started in CS or switched my major and get really upset at myself. My insecurity about getting a decent internship mixed with the fact that I screwed up by not pursuing CS makes me really upset and puts a huge strain on our relationship.

**It's not ""I wish I were him; I'm so jealous,"" as much as, ""Goddamn it, you remind me of what I could've done.
We both could've been super happy, cool software engineers together but I screwed up and chose the wrong field for myself and now I can't do that.""**

I don't want to put him in a position where he feels like he's hurting me, and I also want to get over my sadness and anger at the fact that I'm not doing CS and am probably going to end up in a job that I don't like that much and won't pay well.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I wanted to do CS stuff and realized it too late into my college career. BF is doing cool CS stuff and sometimes I'll get insecure because it reminds me that I screwed up by not pursuing CS. I want to be less sad about it so it puts less strain on our relationship."

I work within a group that has about 5 post docs, 7 PhDs, 4 technicians and about 12 student interns at any point. I've also worked within a much smaller group (4 max, including PI).
With regards to the smaller group I would never have to take into account other people when planning experiments. Plenty of bench space and access to instruments. But in the current situation it takes a lot of communication and taking into account the experiments of others. I'm fine with planning around this by arriving earlier in the morning or staying later; for me the pros of a bigger group involve more sociability with for me is key to a more pleasant experience.

You might not fully understand what happened to me last week. I don't want to discredit your reasons for doing what you did. I told you that. I said, ""if you don't want me, that's fine."" It wasn't fine to me, but I will not beg for you. I won't beg for you to endlessly drive to see me. I just want to get a few things off of my chest.


You came after me. You were persistent in wanting me to be around you. I had just moved back. I came back, broken hearted; a shell of who I once was. I used to be confident and happy-go-lucky and ready to be a light for other people's lives. Over time, that faded. After being left, cheated and ignored by others after giving them what they said they wanted. But I kept going, as I always have. Searching. Digging. Clawing. Scratching. Hoping. Praying. That one day I'll find a love that sticks for me and everything that I'd be able to give back to that person.


This story isn't that story, obviously. I wasn't sure why on earth you even wanted to speak to me in the first place. You were stunning. You were cool. You had interests and passion and the trait to put into words things that kept me going. You had a way of being talkative and caring. Asking me how I felt. Diving into my brain. Something I hadn't experienced in a very, very long time. You made me feel sheltered and cared for. You understood how I felt about always giving a constant stream of attention to each other. You felt the exact same. Endless texting. FaceTime calls for hours on end. Talking on the phone less than five minutes after seeing each other. This was what I wanted. This was what you said you wanted.


""What's your biggest fear with a relationship?""


""Someone only being with me to fill a void temporarily.""


Then what was I to you? What the fuck was I the entire time you spent every waking second talking to me? You spilled all your secrets to me. You cried to me. You told me that I was everything you wanted and more. And then everything just changed. In a matter of one day, you just shut off from me. You were replying, but not saying anything. I was trying to be a support and make sure you're happy. And I could literally feel the distance pulling you away from me. After everything that had happened the year before I met you though, I didn't know how to bring it back closer. I was scared. I made sure everything is okay, asked if you felt differently. You said I needed to stop worrying. You weren't going to break up with me. And that put me at ease. 


Three days later. You called me. You hadn't called me in a couple days. I looked at my phone. I knew what was going to happen the second I saw your face and name pop up. I knew it was all over. 


""I'm really sorry to be doing this.""


""Maybe you liked me more than I liked you.""


""You don't wanna call me a bitch or anything?""


I was just frozen. I didn't know what to say. I apologized for everything I felt I did wrong. And that was that. I was in need of someone to nurture me and cherish me when I met you. You did. But you took it all away. And now I can't take care of myself. I've made plans to skip town. Run away. Like I've always done. I deleted all of my social media, deleted every trace of you in my phone. I deleted contacts and conversations. I quit my job and my internship. I need to become someone different. I can't rely on someone anymore. I don't love myself. I don't know what I'm doing. And you made me realize all of this. I wanted you so bad. I felt so sure about you being around long term. 


You broke my heart into a million little pieces. And instead of picking them up, I'll just leave it behind here. I'll try and find a different heart somewhere else. "

-FolderC (U1, U3)

Somehow, sometimes i (U1) cant move/copy/access folders. Also U2 reported some folders missing (they reappered after a reboot of Server2016 ...)

Am i missing something? Should i've done things differently?

**Thats what brings me to unRaid.**  
Its not about the time i to migrate. Its not critical for our live. As i have ~4-5 TB free space i could migrate one HDD after another as the files currently used on Stablebit Drivepool are readable without Drivepool. But is unRaid ""better"" with permissions? I'll probably need (beside a share) several programs running (VM them?!). Those are Plex, sabnzbd, Unifi, Resilio Sync.

Furthermore i currently use Bvckup to mirror Folder[A,B,C] to an external storage. Afaik thats something i can virtualize too, right ?
What about a Hyper-V instance (openVPN) i use? Can i migrate this easily?


**If i migrate...**  
Does it make sense to migrate HDD after HDD?  
I'm using the following HDDs (in TB): 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2 (intern, Drivepool) and 6 (Extern, Bvckup). With unRaid i get 4+2+2+2+2-4=12 usable, while i currently use 13, which means i need another HDD. Should i go for 6 and use it as parity or for 4? What makes more sense?"

Feeling constantly guilty for beeing Addicted, my health, having no money, no energy, no fun, so many lost opportunitys, so many lies and so many missed things does nothing good for you.
Im naturaly a very optimistic and happy person but this all time grind, changed me without realizing it. I was on the way to make an appointment with a psychiatrist because i felt something is wrong with me and my depression was going out of controll. 
Im not saying that alcohol is responsible for all my problems but it makes things alot worse! The past two weeks where really sobering. Not only for my body but much more for my mind. It is as a heavy blanket is lifted from me. Im starting to feel happines again and i mean real 
happiness, not booze induced. 
No, its not easy to be sober and the thought of never drinking again causes nausea and many other wired feelings in me. I dont think to much of it and take it step by step, day by day.
Im looking forward into the sun and im excited what the next day brings to me. 
Thank you all for writing your story and thoughts on this sub. I will not drink with you all today!"

In my previous internships I did have some programming experience where I had to use python, sql and Java. I didnt have to do anything too complex, most of my work was rather simple. So maybe that isnt very relevant. 

But in my last internship I worked at a fintech firm which was focused on blockchain. Interning there made me realise that I wanted to build my career in the blockchain space. However I realised most companies were looking for technical talent rather than business development skills. It seemed to me that the only way to build a career in this would be to be a software developer. 

Most companies dont really need finance majors but people with a computer science background. So I have started to learn solidity for the past 2 months and learnt to utilise the web3 library to interact with the ethereum blockchain. 

I know that I will be always at a disadvantage compared to people from a Computer Science background. But what can I do at least from now till the next two to three years where I can bridge the knwoledge gap ? I realise that computer science is definetly much harder to grasp than finance. Any advice would be great"

It's just that I had came back to my country after having my internship from USA and somehow I have these very sad thoughts and the loneliness starts kicking in. I had fun while in USA and even went to bars and clubs though I'm sure I'm into bars over clubs, I don't enjoy dancing that much and rather drink. And made some amazing friends along the way

And I was fully aware that I had to go back due to the law and also the contract that I had signed. I just feel like I'm left behind again here. It feels like I just want to give up after being dealt a bad hand.

I'm not sure what to do honestly. I felt better not living in my country since I felt I'm more alone here and not many could understand me as oppose in USA. I still keep in touch with them but it doesn't feel the same. Plus I spent more time talking in person with My new buddies as oppose to chatting with them online."

I'm 35 years old and just transferred 60 credit hours into Arizona State University for Software Engineering (online) from my local college.  I live on my own in the Atlanta area and work full time.  I've been in the same job for 12 years (technical support) and became interested in programming several years ago.  I'm also part of a small startup (just four friends currently) and am writing software for that.    
&amp;nbsp;

Programming experience:

I would say my programming experience thus far is 'weird'.  I use that word because I wrote a restful API in .NET Core that connects to postgres for it's data and implements JWT for authorization/authentication yet I haven't taken a data structures class yet and have no idea what a hashmap is.  I have some experince with docker (API builds into a container), git (I use master/dev/feature branches), and linux (do all my coding in VSCode and vim).  I've also got some html/css/js experience from writing a tools backend page that consumes the API in VueJS.  Even after all that I still label myself as a beginner.

&amp;nbsp;


My plan:

I had never considered doing an internship before because I assumed they were all very low paid if not all unpaid, had never really looked into it.  I was speaking with a friend who's worked in the tech industry (Google, Square, Lyft) and he told me that internships at larger tech companies pay pretty well.  I did more research and found this to be true, opening the door to doing an internship.  This was only a few weeks ago so i'm in the beginning stages of planning some big life changes.  I want to quit my current job and intern on the west coast at a big tech company sometime.  I'm not really sure when, I take data structures next semester (spring).  I really want to wait until that's done so that I can hit studying for interviews really hard.  I guess my current goal is to come out of school with a degree in SE, a really prominent internship, and some side projects.  I want to give myself the best chance at coming back to Atlanta and landing a good job.  I welcome all feedback and any questions.

&amp;nbsp;

Questions:

Do most people begin applying for jobs DURING the internship?  I'm a little confused as to the logistics of this.  If I come back to Atlanta after my internship I have no place to live and no job.  How does the flow normally go for someone quitting their job to intern and then needing a job after the internship is done?

Are all internships done during the summer?

If fall internships exist, are they usually less busy?  When would I apply for a fall internship?

Am I expected to take classes while doing the internship or do people take that semester off?

If I'm not ready to intern next year, when would I start applying for 2019 internships?

How do I show off the code i'm writing for the small startup when it's all closed source?  I want to show how i'm managing my git workflow, using VSTS for tasks and bugs, and buiding/releasing.  Would just talking about it be enough or would someone need to see?"

How do you guys deal with haters in the industry? A lot of these guys spend all their time behind a computer and have no social skills that are damn near close to autism; but help you get your foot in the door; with their skills they get jobs at nice companies.

Ever since I upped my game, changed my looks, and have become more of a leader than a follower, the guys I study/work with have become more jealous, distant, and aggressive towards me. It's almost impossible to communicate with some of these men as they are equivalent to children. Yet they are phenomenal programmers.

Witty ass remarks I've gotten:
""If you want to work in this industry you're gonna have to gain a couple pounds!""

""Looks like you're dressed for the club...""

""Wow aren't you such a baller now, swagggg swaggaroo""

""What the hell do you have going on after class? Playing video games? What else could you be doing...""

""Talking to different girls at the university center? That's fucked up man""

Do you cut off your contacts and start from scratch with more high value men? Or keep these friendships as they can help you out in the future?"

The way my schedule is set up already I am taking 2 computer science courses in order to finish my minor  (both 300 level plus), a biology course, a senior seminar, a geospatial data management course, and one more geology elective. For this elective I want to either take Hydrogeology or Quaternary Geochronology. I understand that hydro would be a much more beneficial course for me to take, as I realize I am most likely going to end up in the environmental field, but it will make a tough semester much more tough. My question is... Would it hurt me if I chose the geochronology course instead of hydrogeology?

P.S. I already have two internships so I think maybe my experience could make up for the lack of taking Hydrogeology"

I did internships in each all throughout my education so Ive got plenty of good solid experience on my resume. I did a ton of coding while in my undergrad and found that picking up new languages any bosses asked me to came fairly quickly to me. I recently saw a job post for a combo coding/law job that really piqued my interest (but its more of the IT law consulting variety and not an attorney position). I know 3 of the 4 languages they're asking for and have most of the other skills/knowledge they listed but there are definitely a few small gaps. Should I stick with my current path while I teach myself these skills and then try to transition? Or is there a way to word a cover letter to let someone know that you aren't at 100% but you are eager to face the challenge of learning that last 20% and they can bet on you to do it quickly and enthusiastically?

7d53iy,70,2017-11-15,Boyfriend of 2 years cheated on me,Ineiman,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7d53iy/boyfriend_of_2_years_cheated_on_me/,"So here we go. A little backstory to start out with. He and I have had some communication problems starting about a year ago. He said that he felt like he didn't know how to talk to me and was becoming distant and pushing me away. I tried working through this because I loved him and wanted to be with him. We start working through things and it gets better and then it gets so much worse after that.

In January I asked him if we were okay as a couple and for the very first time he said no and explained that he was purposefully pushing me away and hurting me on purpose because he didn't know how to talk to me. I was really hurt by this so I broke up with him in a rash moment filled with emotions. I didn't take this very well and eventually asked for him back after a week. He accepted and we worked on things and they got better, as far as I knew.

Fast forward to recently he starts getting a little distant again because he moved away to Houston for an internship and I'm in Omaha, so long distance. I went and visited him during my fall break and had a miserable time. I felt like I didn't know my boyfriend anymore. Every time I would walk in the room he would quickly close down his messages and pretend he was doing nothing. This was driving me crazy. On the morning I was supposed to fly out he left his phone on the bed while he got ready. I know I shouldn't have, but I looked into his phone and saw the sexts. 

I told him that I looked at his phone while he was getting ready and before I could even finish he let out a big oh shit kind of sigh and admitted to sexting guys. I was heartbroken and confused. At this point we hadn't sexted each other in probably 6 months. Oh and all of this was on the way to the airport so I could make my flight, so we didn't really have the opportunity to talk fully about everything. He promised me that he had never actually done anything physical with someone and that they were just words. 

That night after he was off work we talked on the phone for two hours and he explained his piece. He said it all started when he first got there. He was having a hard time making friends so he downloaded Tinder and then eventually things went to flirting and then sexting. I asked him why and the only response I got was ""I don't know."" He eventually said he wanted to fully immerse himself in Houston and didn't want to be anchored by anything. I don't understand how I was holding him back so much, but oh well. After our talk I broke up with him again because I couldn't take it anymore.

Jump to last night, literally a month after breaking up, I was talking to someone and they asked how I knew him because we just became friends on Facebook and he was one of the only mutual connections we had. I told him he was my boyfriend of two years. He said that he had hooked up with him back in March. I asked him if he would send me the messages so I could read them, which was also probably a stupid thing to do, but I hoped it would help me move on. The messages were really hard to read. He called this guy the same things that he called me. I could match up some of the messages to when he wasn't responding to me as well. He also sent me their Grindr conversations where he said he lost his virginity when he was back home in Virginia over the summer, as well as many other sexual things. 

I was so angry last night that I texted him and gave him one last chance to tell me the truth and he still lied to me in his response. I was kind of feeling okay about it all last night, but this morning is rough. I woke up feeling so worthless. I wondered what else he lied about. I know he hooked up with one person, but how many others? How many people had he sexted? How long has he been lying to me?

I guess I'm just using this as a place to vent and hopefully get some advice on how to not feel so worthless.

tl;dr: How do you get over the worthless feeling after finding out your boyfriend of two years was cheating on you for who knows how long?"

7d5nbb,0,2017-11-15,ROI of an non-elite MBA for becoming Marketing VP?,sconesycid3r,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/7d5nbb/roi_of_an_nonelite_mba_for_becoming_marketing_vp/,"I'm an in-house marketing director in a major US city. I've been at this job for about two months, have been in marketing for about 7 years. I intend to stay in this job for awhile, but quite frankly, wasn't expecting to be at a director level yet at this point in my career and being here now has me thinking about a few years from now when I'm ready to start looking into VP marketing roles.

&amp;nbsp;

So I figured I'd get an MBA with a marketing focus, as my undergrad was journalism. I was hired to write by a large news organization right after graduation but quickly became involved in the marketing team and ended up really loving it, and being really good at it. So I stayed a few years, got a few promotions, and when I left there I ended up going to a marketing firm, was promoted a bunch there, managed some teams with great success, then moved on to this new job I have now. 

&amp;nbsp;

So far, my experience, work ethic, leadership skills and ideas have been enough that working and finding work has always been easy for me, but I'm concerned that the higher up the ladder I try to move the more it's going to matter that I don't actually have any formal marketing or business training, just on-the-job learning, webinars and conferences and the like and a bit of a knack for the industry I guess. I'm worried that I've reached a point where I'm not going to advance any more or won't be able to move on to more lucrative opportunities.  

&amp;nbsp;

But my undergrad GPA was... not great. I was soooo sure I knew what my career path was going to be so I put a lot of effort into the classes I thought were most important/enjoyable, extra curricular leadership roles and internships. I hit a really rough patch in my life and let some of my grades suffer as a result my sophomore year. Did better junior and senior year, but still, subpar GPA overall. But have my life in much better order now, plus all the work experience (and marketing experience for a local non-profit I'm on the board for) that I'm not personally worried that I won't be able to keep up in school, but I know convincing schools of that is going to be damn hard. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that's going to be a huge problem for me as I apply to programs, especially if I apply to any good ones. I plan to stay in this city long-term so I was looking at local programs, not really realizing initially how much the school you go to really matters for this. But now I'm getting very nervous that this might not be worth it for me if I don't go into a top-level school. Especially since I'm already in the career path I want and I'm already making $75k. And I don't want to leave my job, I want to do a part-time program so I'm not necessarily looking to have a job offer right out of school, though I'd definitely be open to opportunities that paid closer to market rate for my role. But mostly my goal with the degree is to have it so that in a few years I can take that next step up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also still in debt from undergrad but finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and the programs I want are all in the $60k-$90k range, so the thought of taking on so much debt again induces a lot of fear. I'm trying to save for a house and all that good adult stuff. I thought about doing a cheaper, online program, but it seems like if I want this process to mean anything at all I need to go all in on a big program. And I can't tell at this point if that's really worth it.

&amp;nbsp;

So any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated! Am I going to render myself irrelevant to the industry if I don't go back to school, or am I going to waste my time and money by getting a degree that's not going to advance my career? 

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr - I'm a marketing director who wants to eventually move on to be a marketing VP, but I have an unrelated bachelor's and a low undergrad GPA. Will an MBA at this point in my career, likely not from an elite school, help me advance, or waste my time/money?**"

So lately I've been feeling disappointed, mostly in myself. 

I'm a junior studying CS and I knew this was my last chance to get a solid internship, but I guess I just missed out on so much opportunity. I didn't even get interviews at any of the top tech companies, but at the same time, I didn't ask for any referrals and I didn't make sure my resume was adequate. I can only blame myself for that.

It might have to do with the expectations I've set for myself, but also because I've always wanted to have a good career. I go to a top10 CS university and many of my friends and peers are getting offers from the big4 and other tech companies. 

The problem is that because I spend so much time with them, I know that I'm just as smart and capable. My GPA is above average and I do well in class, but I'm just not ambitious enough when I need to be. 

I only have a mediocre internship offer from a bank that, from asking on this sub, is not a good experience. They didn't even give me a technical interview before giving me an offer, so I can imagine the level of talent there isn't great.

I don't know what I should do. I've already applied to many of the companies that are still hiring, but I haven't been getting many responses. I might just settle for the offer I have and focus on coursework for now, but I know I might hate myself for it.

Thanks for hearing me out. Any thoughts on what I should do?"

I recently moved to downtown Calgary for an internship. My building did not provide parking, so I applied for a residential parking pass. With this pass I am allowed to park in any time restricted zone, minus any ParkingPlus Zone (zone where you have to pay). 

This last Thursday my car was towed and impounded in the city lot. The reason for being towed was due to the fact that I had 8 unpaid parking tickets. It turns out I had been parking in the ParkingPlus Zone by my house, but I didn't realize it. However, since my car is registered out of province I never received notice of any of these tickets and there were no tickets left on my car.  

If I had known I was parking in the prohibited zone, I would not have continued to park in it. Since I wasn't aware of these tickets, I had no reason to think I was breaking the parking laws.

I appealed these tickets, but my appeal was denied on the grounds that they had the right to ticket me for these tickets, since I was breaking the law. 

They said I can go to provincial parking court to fight the tickets and go through the city claims department to fight my impound fees. 

Do I have a case? Can I fight on the grounds that I was oblivious to any of these tickets and would not have continued to park in the prohibited zone after receiving the first ticket?

Any help is appreciated.

I'm currently finishing a MBA and in order to obtain my diploma I need to complete an internship upon next semester.

In my interview I specifically ask the employers if they think that the internship they offer could lead to a real job at the end. It's particularly important for me since I will be done with college and I will need a job fast after that to pay my debts and all that.

I've been offered a job today, but the company told me without a doubt that they will not be able to offer me a position at the end of the internship for budget reasons. 

I still have a few options and a few interviews set up so I still hope to find some place that really meet my needs. That being said, if I refuse that offer I might end up with no internship next semester which would lead to me not being able to get my diploma.

What I am asking myself right now is: is it possible okay to accept their offer and then call it off if or when I find something more suitable to my needs?

I think I already know the answer to that, but I would like to hear from people who were in a similar situation once."

I was there full time this summer, continue to work part time, and have accepted a job in January.  
  
I am worried about a couple of things for the profession.  
  
Can insurance companies survive long term in a low interest environment? I know that the short term rate has started to go up, but the long term rate has not. The yield curve is flattening out which seems like it will be very negative for insurance companies.  
  
Also, it seems that many jobs that are done by a team of 10 people could be automated and turned into a 2 or 3 person job fairly easily. It seems that companies will need way less actuaries in the upcoming years because of this.  
  
Finally I feel as though the exams are a huge waste of time and are preventing actuaries from learning valuable skills such as python, and data science related topics.  
  
Can any experienced actuaries let me know what your thoughts are on these topics.

DEADLINE IN 2 DAYS.",dj4eagle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7d7v30/i_have_a_job_offer_in_another_state_and_i_am_very/,"Hello Reddit, 

I am graduating in May 2018 with my degree in Computer Engineering. I have had a Software Engineering offer for a large tech company in CITY A, and have had a fantastic experience working there as an intern. The salary/benefits are great, I love the city, and all of my family is close by.

I was going to accept, but applied for an Engineering Firm in CITY B. The role is completely different, and instead focuses on developing Engineering Leadership skills, with options to pursue skills in Technical Sales, Marketing, Product Support, Systems Engineering, etc. I had a great interview visit to CITY B, and was impressed with the Company. I just received an offer. I would be taking about an $4,000 pay cut, no real sign on bonus, and the higher cost of living in CITY B. 

I have always been hesitant about making a career in Software, even though I really do enjoy doing it, mainly because the future of automation, the sheer competition for tech jobs, etc. I am largely a people person, and can't stand the idea of wasting my life away at a desk, no matter how much I like it. I wan't to be interacting with clients, and my long term career goal is to move into management for a technical company; this job in CITY B appears to provide opportunities much more in line with my goals, and a lot of flexibility in being able to explore my interests. 

The slight pay cut isn't too concerning, but I feel tied back to CITY A. I am my mother's only child, and although she isn't elderly, I am the only person she really has. She doesn't take care of herself at all, has health problems (being managed fine), and can't even emotionally handle me being away at school. Also, my girlfriend of 2 years will be starting a 3 year doctorate program in CITY A. My plan was to marry her after she finished school, but I honestly have doubts that our relationship could survive the distance. She says she would be okay with me leaving, but we have had distance issues and communication mismatches (different expectation levels) when we were 2 hours apart over a summer, let alone 2 states away. If I was moving back, the story would be different, but if I was starting an entire new life in a young city, I think I would be interested in dating other people. I love her, but that is just what I feel, as bad as it is. I love my relationship, life in CITY A, and would be happy at my CITY A software job as far as I can tell, but the idea of being able to move away from home, pursue this job that REALLY interests me, and start my own life is hard to give up. I have done long distance before with an ex, but that was for a year, we were able to visit occasionally and power through it, and the relationship fell apart a year later we were back together; I'd be open to try it though. 

The last thing I want to do is live with the regret of missing an opportunity, and I can't tell if a year from now my S.O and I will still be together anyways. Please give me some ideas, perspectives, and stories to think about!!!"

CA,jahlijahman,almosthomeless,https://www.reddit.com/r/almosthomeless/comments/7d8h2w/my_girlfriends_crazy_bpd_mother_kicked_her_out/,"because the rationality of people with borderline personality disorder can sometimes be unclear, please hear me out because this probably sounds crazy. Basically my girlfriend has been living in a verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive home ever since her she can remember. Her mother is above the age of 50 I believe and is one of the most insane people i have ever met. I personally have been kicked out of her house by her mother back and forth 15 times. I think part of it was she used kicking me out as a discipline to my girlfriend. I just want to share some of my personal experiences with her mother so you can have a glimpse of what she is like though I do not provide the best imagery in writing. anyways, sometimes I was considered part of their ""family"" and other times seen as an ""intruder"" or ""spy"" by the mother. for example, one time I was helping my girlfriends little sister on the computer in their house with minecraft. her mother jumped to the conclusion that I was actually using her little sister to bypass her knowledge and look through their computer and hack them (note: I had known them for a year and a half now). I know this story is all over the place but bear with me. Another time I was kicked out was because I came inside and didn't ""announce myself"" after my girlfriend told me to come inside, her mom knew I was coming in, and I thought everyone was sleeping or else I would have said ""hello."" Last example of myself getting kicked out was because her mom said I could come over but not to bother her because she was cleaning (note: this was after we had a talk about ALWAYS announcing myself or I wouldn't be allowed over) so I walked in while she was cleaning outside said literally a quick ""hello"" and continued inside. Then her mom called my girlfriend downstairs and told her I wasn't allowed over anymore because she told my girlfriend not to bother her. I know it sounds really irrational (and it really is) and a lot of this sounds too retarded to be true. Her mother sits on her ass smokes pot all day, drinks, and apparently does coke too. Her father is the provider and earns a lot of money but her father is where it gets worse. I believe he's above the age of 60 and has had a head injury in his past, although he is the provider of the home the mother simply wears the pants in the home. whenever my girlfriend has come forward to her father for help, he either always sides with the mother to avoid confrontation or blows the whole thing off an continues watching his netflix. I know this story seems like there's more to it or there's no way things can really just be the way i'm telling you, and I know they can be a lot worse, but that's really it. and I've wasted time being angry at them for their mental illnesses and behavior but I can't change them. anyways, my girlfriend has been kicked out before, one time she was kicked out for not doing the dishes for one night because she helped her little sister with her homework (who is neglected and doesn't get help with school if I might add). please also note my girlfriend was working a job, attending community college, and an internship with an environmental community. (she wants to major in Ecology). my girlfriend had to quit school, and her internship to add another job to her schedule. eventually after a month and a half we convinced her mom to let her back to the house, she's been there for three months now but I told her from the beginning it has to be temporary because her mom will inevitably like she has before, find a way or a reason to blame others for how she feels about herself. my girlfriend stayed out of her way, followed her mom's orders and it got her three months but today when she woke up she got kicked out because her mom ah told my girlfriend a week ago that this cylinder block in the sideyard had to stay against the gate when they leave (for the cat or something). well her mom and dad both apparently didn't follow this rule, and when my girlfriend used the side door to leave one day she accidentally forgot to put it back (I know it was a stupid mistake but my girlfriend easily misplaces things and forgets things). the cat didn't run away or anything but her mom went on about how ""I've told you how many times and you never listen"" barking up a storm and a case to clear my girlfriend out ""justified"" in the moms eyes when really she only set that rule in a week ago, breaking it herself, and then when it happens once shes gone. might I add my girlfriend is 20 PAYS RENT, and lives in california. I'm 19. I've been with her for almost 3 years now and I don't know what to do. my girlfriend can't afford to pay upwards of $800 per month for a single bedroom, work two jobs, pay for school, and herself. I could move out too but that robs me of my freedom of rent-free home with my parents (who care deeply for my girlfriend) who can't let her live with us because we have 6 people living in a 3 bedroom apartment already. this situation is really bumming me out and any advice would be great. I wasn't sure if things like sec. 8 could help us out or anything. please let me know, thanks for dealing with my grammar and punctuation flaws."

A series of events today in Chesapeake has ultimately led to the dismissal of /u/SuleimonCaine (I) from his post of Secretary of Transportation and Labor. 

In our latest report from the region, Speaker /u/fullconservative (CU) had previously outlined a goal to repeal [Chesapeake Public Law B.012](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MY9JpQFBtWLun-cbSWUyIY2ClCRq_RwZKdkmZFiL5b4/edit), which would remove requirements of gender neutral language in bills, regulations, and state code. The CU and GOP majority in the state assembly, combined with CU Governor /u/Ninjjadragon, heightened opponents’ concerns over the law’s repeal. 

The Secretary of Transportation and Labor began the day by issuing [DOL/T Directive #2017-2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-a4sz3GotIWkQhGlyNXa7akYC2wpp6SZoEtP5-YsBA/edit) as a response to the threat of repeal. The directive would require members of the Departments of Transportation and Labor to continue adhering to the requirements of Public Law B.012 within departmental memos, regulations, or documentation. When asked about his issuance of the directive, Secretary /u/SuleimonCaine responded, “The repeal of Public Law B.012 is certainly possible under a coalition of Republican and Christian Union lawmakers, which drove the issuance of my directive.” The Chesapeake Speaker, /u/fullconservative, claimed “that Caine was basically the only one in [Chesapeake] vocally giving his support for this gender neutrality policy,” but conceded that Transportation and Labor Department protocol are “entirely [/u/SuleimonCaine’s] prerogative.” 

The Secretary justified keeping the law, which has been in place since the first assembly session in the state’s history, by asking, “If we aren't referring to men or women in specific terms, why should the letter of our law discriminate one way or the other?” The Assembly Speaker doesn’t see the issue as one of discrimination though. He opined that he doesn’t “think the state in general should look to be placing male or female pronouns where [they are not] appropriate,” but also doesn’t “see the need for a bill keeping [the Assembly] from doing so.” The Speaker insisted that “there are extenuating circumstances where using the suffix ‘man’ works just fine,” and that “the assembly should be able to decide for themselves if a bill is intentionally worded to be discriminatory.”

The Secretary disagreed with the notion that the Assembly should decide pronouns on a bill-by-bill basis, challenging that “gender-neutrality doesn't prevent [the Chesapeake Government] from addressing any issues.” He went even further by claiming the entire movement against the gender neutrality policy is “simply conservative virtue signaling.” 
The Assembly Speaker is “confident that Bill.012 will be repealed, and that the Governor will sign the repeal bill” despite the Secretary’s directive, citing that the Governor “was the one who brought the issue to my attention in the first place.”

The remainder of the Secretary’s day, and tenure, saw him issue two more directives. [One to create a task force to investigate the coal mines near the site of the West Virginian earthquake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwnyGHwX--IjVRn316YClNMjdmEZOJgnii1CWpDJuWg/edit) and another to [create an internship program to aid with the creation of Chesapeake’s Green Line High-Speed Rail Project.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wqLQ7ws-PwbP5KFiH_ynU33c6QV2M18w8RVZra820g/edit) News of these policy actions reached Governor /u/Ninjjadragon, who was reportedly unnerved that the directives were not reviewed with him. Soon after, the Governor announced the termination of /u/SuleimonCaine from his position. 

In parting, the former Chesapeake Secretary of Labor and Transportation claimed that “the Governor has fired the most active Secretary of Labor/Transportation in history because I didn't want to abide to his policy of micromanagement.” Looking back at his directives, the former Secretary remarked that they “are not any source of shame” and that he believes that he has “achieved enough in [his] brief time to outweigh the Governor’s current and future accomplishments for the term.” /u/SuleimonCaine, who is now seeking employment, may or may not remain in Chesapeake. His dismissal seems to have set the tone for the imminent repeal of Public Law B.012.


**EDIT:**

We have received the following statement from the Governor's office on the issue:

&gt;Former Secretary /u/SuleimonCaine, despite rampant speculation, was not removed because I was annoyed at him or because I didn’t agree with his policy, he was removed for a violation of a key rule that has been in place since I was swore in to replace Governor /u/RazorReviews, that being every Directive must be cleared by myself or my Lieutenant Governor. This isn’t done to attack policy or to shoot down ideas different from my own, but rather to be sure the Directives are strong and make logical sense depending on what’s going on in the news. Caine was removed after receiving the initial announcement in our primary discord, all Cabinet Secretaries were pinged and told to be sure to follow the rule, after his disregard of this he was warned in a PM, and then he was removed after his final violation of the policy.

Currently, it's about to be my 8th month in this Pathways program. Due to a hiring freeze, the State Department isn't hiring or converting interns to full-time as of now. Because of this, some interns who already graduated or are preparing to graduate this semester may have either taken the part-time job the SD offered or just applied to other jobs at other federal agencies elsewhere.

Due to the nature of my job (I'm at the IT section of the SD with little IT background and experience, and was only put there because I currently major in cybersecurity policy), I am considering applying elsewhere because I do not want to work part-time and I want to be a GS-9 (I will be graduating to earn my Masters degree in May, as I am currently a GS-5).

I cant share with anyone else, family and friends uninterested.",perfectenschlag1776,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7d9h9x/would_love_your_advice_and_thoughts_i_cant_share/,"Howdy everyone! I have been lurking on this sub for some time and I am always inspired and motivated by the various stories of others' FI. I wanted to briefly share my situation and goals, then get your advice on how I should continue in the near future. I don't have any friends or family that are motivated to be financially independent, most are uninterested in the idea - so you guys are the only folks I can share this with. 

1) Life Situation: I am a 22 yo college student, majoring in political science. I should be graduating in just 3 more semesters. I am single and live with a family member at the moment until I finish college. I plan to get into campaign politics after graduating and job placement shouldn't be a big concern for me due to internships and experience. I currently work 35ish hours a week in IT (not my desired career field but it pays the bills). I started at a community college and transferred to a four year. I am having to pay out-of-pocket for my education, so my savings goals are always directed towards paying for the next semester. Thankfully, I have zero college debt so far, and I plan on graduating with no college debt. 

2) FIRE Progress: I only have around $2,500 in a JH 401K through work, which work does NOT match. I stopped contributing so I can focus on saving for college. I have a schwab account with nothing in it; I opened it a few years ago with the thought of investing in stocks, but I did not due to college expenses taking priority.  I would like to be FI by age 40. 

3) Take Home Pay: Average $1,700- 1,900 per month (I am hourly).

4) Yearly Savings Amounts: Roughly $6,500, almost all goes towards college, some is set into my emergency fund (which has $1,200 currently). After paying for each semester of college, my college savings returns to zero, in which I then start saving for the upcoming semester. 

5)Current monthly expenses:---&gt;
--Car Payment: $320 (I had to buy a new car due to my previous being flooded. If I bought a cash car, I would not have had working capital to pay for my next semester of college. 14k left on the car @ 0.9% interest. Never buying a new one again!). 
--Car Insurance: $200
--Cell Phone: $70
--Help with utilities: $120
-I put $500 a month straight into my college fund. The rest of my money goes towards gas, groceries, restaurants, misc items, etc.  

When I graduate college, I should be entering my desired field at around 35-45k per year to start. I can expect for my salary to increase to about 50k per year after 2-4 years of working. I eventually want to get into business as a campaign consultant and increase my salary significantly. I will want to move into my own place, likely an apartment. After graduating and moving out, should I start saving and putting money into an IRA or into a savings to buy real estate eventually? I want to build passive income streams through investments but I am not sure how saving for such things will go in conjunction with putting away for retirement (into a 401k, IRA, etc). I would love your advice on this matter, and any advice you may have regarding a FIRE game plan. I am not sure where to start or if I am even doing the right thing now, especially since I will have practically zero net-worth aside from my emergency fund and a small 401k upon graduating college. 

Thank you all! "

I say Austin Texas and he says The State of California in general is better.
But what I've found is that the cost of living is much greater in cities where  a software engineering degree is good to have. While the pay is better in California than in Texas, it seems as if the pay you get doesn't keep up with the cost of Living. The categories for this are:
Cost of Living ,
Better Colleges,
Prices of Tuition,
Better Opportunities.

I've researched abit and found that Austin is a better city because the cost of living is cheaper than cities like San Jose, San Francisco, Long Beach, and Los Angeles compared to Austin.
UT Austin is also very high ranking for schools related to Software Engineering and the citiy is popular for its technology.
The prices of Tuition are the about same from UT Austin and Places I would attend like CSU San Bernardino and Long Beach.
And there are many internships and jobs for my field.

Do you guys agree or is there something I'm missing. Please let me know.

7dbvke,10,2017-11-16,Ex Flatmate is not paying the Nebenkosten. What legal Actions can I take?,ahmoutlaw,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/7dbvke/ex_flatmate_is_not_paying_the_nebenkosten_what/,"Hello r/Germany, 

I am a foreigner in Germany who has a problem with his foreigner ex flat mate. I need your advice regarding the legal actions I can take against him.  

I was the Hauptmieter and thus responsible for the flat and everything. My flatmate who stayed with me for 2 years is refusing to pay the extra Nebenkosten for the year 2015/2016. I am extremely upset and want to take legal action against him (reasons below). 

The Details are as follows: 

He lived with me for two years and left the flat in Aug 2016. Just before that in June 2016 we received the Nebenkosten bills. We had to pay 1250 euros more. He payed his due share. Now when he was leaving, I spoke to him personally and then wrote an email asking him explicitly to confirm that

1. He will share the extra bills cost for his period of stay.
2. He will share the amount deducted from the security, in case that happens.
 
He agreed verbally and in written form per email. Then I transferred his complete security deposit back. I was just happy that he is leaving now. 

Now I left that Apartment in July this year and finally received the Nebenkosten details a couple of weeks back. When I contacted him to pay his share (around 500 Euros), he came up with some bizarre reasoning citing Events from 2014 and saying that its unfair that I am asking him to share the costs. I am just extremely pissed off at his fucking cunty behavior. 

The Thing is that we already discussed all the bills and calculation (even per Email) from 2015/2016 and he transferred the extra bills per bank transfer to me. That means I understood everything and payed for it. Everything was spoken, discussed and agreed in writing. And now he is coming up with absolutely groundless points and trying to renegotiate/don’t pay the money.   


The reasons I am extremely upset by his behavior are the following:´

•	This guy was actually a recommendation from a friend of mine. 

•	I actually recommended him for an internship at the company I was working at, helped him throughout with his application and he got hired. 

•	Then he requested me if he can stay in my flat, as my flat mate at that time was leaving, and I accommodated him even not knowing him so well. 

•	He proved to be an absolute disaster when it comes to finances and cost sharing. But I controlled my behavior and didn’t make a big scene for little sums of money. 

•	I regularly host my friends for dinners and parties where this guy always joined but never ever contributed one penny. I also never asked him to share any costs as I thought – and stated to him- that he was a student etc. That’s my standard behavior and its not that I am trying to cash it here. Just highlighting my attitude towards him. 

•	He was almost always transferring a few euros less for the rent and when I confronted him after a while, he gave reasons like “Oh, I forgot” or “I misunderstood” etc. But it just can’t be for a year that you don’t understand the rent and costs of your living. 

•	We had an agreement – verbal and in writing. And now he brought up some bullshit stories from years ago and basically absolutely refusing to pay.  

•	I had to cover the deduction of 300 euro in the security deposit and also the internet (on my name) which had still 6 months to go before contract cancellation. So I have to pay more than 200 euros for that as well. 

He fucking did this to the guy who was solely responsible for his internship, gave him place to stay, accommodated him by all means and have written agreements with him. He is just fucking corrupt and without a bit of honesty.   

So this is the whole story guys. Could you please tell me what rights do I have legally and what can be done against him? I want to take a maximum action. 


Thanks a lot.

7dbvor,6,2017-11-16,How to get life back on track after trauma?,ThrowAway11162017,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dbvor/how_to_get_life_back_on_track_after_trauma/,"Three years ago I had a very serious flare up of Crohn's disease. I had just began my sophomore year of university when my symptoms became serious and the disease severely impacted my semester. I went to the ER at eight or nine times and was frequently kept overnight at the hospital. I was on a variety of medications to try to manage my symptoms but I just grew more and more sick. When I finally went home for winter break, I had grown so ill I needed surgery. Instead of returning for the spring semester, I stayed home for a second surgery and overall recovery.

It's also worth mentioning that near the beginning of my illness, my grandmother passed away. And after I was mostly recovered from my second surgery in early summer, I was in a physical accident that resulted in relatively minor but very painful injuries and a concussion.

Since then, my life has been a mess. I went back to school the following fall, but my grades were poor and I dropped two classes. Every semester since then, my grades have gotten worse and I've been put on academic probation twice (which I've successfully appealed claiming medical and mental health concerns). I've seen four counselors, been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, and talked to my pastor. I just can't seem to get my life back on track. My professors have been gracious but they're clearly frustrated with apparent lack of interest in even trying.

I've changed majors twice, thinking maybe I just wasn't focused on the right things. I even took an internship across the country from my hometown thinking maybe a change of scenery would help. I'm involved in extracurriculars and in my community but I only ever make it to half the things I sign up for.

I've made it through the past three years only because of the graciousness of professors and employers who gave me extra chances until the semester ended or I found a new job. My life is a wreck and I don't know how to fix it.

It feels like something essential in me got broken during that awful year and no amount of medication or bed rest is going to fix it.

I don't even know why I made a throw away account for this but I have such a deep sense of shame about all of this. Whenever I try to talk to someone in person about everything, I end up downplaying things and try to make it sound like things are getting better when they're not.

I'd appreciate any advice you may have. "

...

How’s it going, Reddit?

     Here’s a short story. I graduated SHS in 2009. I took my time off to develop skills in the restaurant, sales, and marketing industries before sprinting back to school. I graduated NSCC this year with a Liberal Arts Associates, which included taking a Stats 101 course.

     Here’s a longer story.

     I realized tech was my direction. I like working with teams, but also working remotely in cafe’s, because I care about my mental, physical, and spiritual health. Working in an industry such as data science would allow me to work on meaningful projects, afford housing and further education, and would allow me to exercise, sleep in, or whatever else I’d need to do to stay on my A-game.

     After working as a resumé collector at a job fair focused on cybersecurity, computer engineering and the like, I was granted some time to network. I learned from a recruiter that with 2 internships and a Bachelors in Comp Sci, I should be able to land a job making $60k a year, easily. This makes sense, because I live in Boston, but there’s just one problem: I live in an apartment and work full-time! I don’t have the money to afford a graduate degree!

     Anyways, after graduating in May, I started putting the pieces together. I went to General Assembly and took an intro to data science workshop. I acquired their resources and syllabus for the full-time, ten-week, $16k course on data science.I listened to two podcasts: Becoming a Data Scientist, and CodeNewbie, as I drove across three states for work (vendor selling, training, and merchandising computers). I bought LPTHW, and picked up many but not all the basics of 2. I went on Codecademy, took Python 101 and 201 workshops at GA(ga.co), and earned a certificate on edX.org(Intro to Python for Data Science). 

     After taking the Data Camp/edX course, I realized I should only be learning P3. So I bought the Learn Python 3 The Hard Way book, which comes with videos, and am about to get approved PTO for today, which I’m stoked about because all I want to do is learn until I can get a job that lets me feel happy. 

     With my dual-monitor setup, I’m printing scripts after I write them, analyzing them after running them, on paper, just to make sure I understand what’s going on in each line. My goal is to redesign my daily caloric intake calculator to P3, so I can use numpy and convert lists to arrays, and eventually create diet plans/meal planning/recipes through script, more for using skills I’ve learned in my own way than for any type of business idea. I’ll post it on GitHub once I’m through. Then, when I’ve finished this book, I’ll go through it once last time and break all the code I’ve written, so I can learn more about bugs, Errors, and debugging scripts.

     This week I find out if I’m funded $5k for a data science certificate, but this is dragging on so let me Boolean my point back to the title:

certificate = 0
python_learned = “in process”
python_learned = 0

     If certificate == True:
         print(“pass, and find job”)
     else:
         print(“apply for FAFSA, go to SSU for 3.5 years”)

     If python_learned == True:
         print(“learn SQL, other skills to land 1st tech job”)
     else:
         print(“ask Reddit what skills land entry level job”)

...

     Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’ve heard that startups are a great way to get your toes wet, but I’m not sure what types of skills I’ll need at first. I’ve almost considered going in a direction I didn’t have in mind, which would be learning about how Python leads to building websites, but my concern is that if I learn enough python to appropriately transition to learning something like SQL on my own, I might forget how to do some of the things I am learning, if it takes months or even more than a year to land my first tech job. That’s also why I’m hesitant to learn JavaScript. It’s almost common sense that I stick with one language, until I’m either in a workplace that requires I learn it, am in school and they’re teaching it, or I’m finally in a career that allows me to do the things I want to do, which would likely include learning a new language, since falling behind in tech is really easy nowadays.

     Reddit, what are your thoughts? Other than my soon-acquired Python and past-acquired Stats 101 skills and education, what other hats must I wear before I have a plausible chance of landing my first entry level tech job?

Thanks 😎"

7dd5di,1,2017-11-16,I'm thinking of dropping out of college as a Junior,LilWrench97,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dd5di/im_thinking_of_dropping_out_of_college_as_a_junior/,"Hello everyone, this is my first time asking for advice on the internet at all, let alone reddit. I'm currently having a career crisis right now. I am currently studying computer science and am in my first year as a junior.

The unfortunate part is that I am now almost completely certain that computer science is not my passion. The only reason I am even in this field is I was preselected for a program called MECOP in my senior year of high school. What this means is I am guaranteed two six-month paid internships (~ $20,000 each) with computer science companies in my junior and senior years of college, as long as I am majoring in some sort of STEM field. I had mild interest in computer science in high school so this is what I chose. However, I found out quickly that I did not enjoy programming as much as I thought I did, and the stress from having to keep a high GPA for my internship caused me to do very badly in my classes and develop depression. 

Therapy and pills have helped with depression, but I cannot help but think that the underlying problem is that I am constantly learning about a field that I do not enjoy. Ever since sophomore-junior year, I have been skipping a majority of my classes, and doing the bare minimum to pass with the grades needed to keep my internship - even if that means cheating or copying code to get by. The only reason I am staying in my major is so I can get my internships and help my parents pay for college, and I feel as if I am too far in to quit now.

My social life is almost-nonexistent, and I fear that by keeping this up my depression will only get worse and my future will be gone. 

Dropping out of college would disappoint my parents greatly, but they won't disown me. I'm afraid that this is the only chance I have to get a good career, and if I drop out I won't be able to get any more scholarships if I return, and I have no idea what other major I would pursue if I did drop out. 

So reddit, you are the only people I can turn to for help at this point. What do you think I should do?"

I can maybe manage a web server with Rex or Ansible. But I'm now also the guy who's responsible for a handful of Thinkpads that are being introduced to a company full of Macs. We're a tech startup that now needs a bunch of people using the web based backoffice app, and Macs were not approved for these people. I've been using OS X/MacOS for pretty much my entire career, and now I need to get these Thinkpads to the point where I can hand them to the employees.

I guess I'm asking for some pointers in managing these laptops. What is a decent solution if I want to avoid installing software by hand on all of these machines? I'll need Office, Dropbox, Chrome, Slack on every machine at the very least. Some of these laptops will be shared between two employees. 

What's the best way to provision/manage/maintain these machines from a Mac? 

Additionally, in a small company environment, what are your experiences with Office 365 Business Premium vs purchasing Office Home &amp; Business 2016 for PC outright? How would I handle licensing for employees that stay with the company short-term (i.e. student internships)?


I'd be grateful for any pointers and warnings of pitfalls you could bestow upon me. Cheers!"

I'm going to be studying abroad in Stockholm this coming spring semester (January - May) and wanted to find some internship opportunities that I could do part-time. 

Other possibly relevant details: I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at a small unknown US school. Somewhere around a 3.5 gpa. I have had one previous internship at a big well-known tech company (not big 4). I'm fine with being unpaid, I just want some more work experience.

Are there companies that take part-time interns or is it rare to find these? I've looked around and have seen people talking about Spotify, Mojang, Dice, Ericcson, etc. but they mostly don't advertise any spring or part-time internships. Should I email the company directly? How many hours a week will they be expecting from me? Am I correct in thinking that I would find more success targeting smaller companies (as this internship would not be the norm)?

I'd love to hear any thoughts that you guys might have! Thanks."
7de880,50,2017-11-16,I (21F) am resentful towards my selfish brother who basically got all my parents money and now they can’t help me for college.,FruityTrophotropism,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7de880/i_21f_am_resentful_towards_my_selfish_brother_who/,"I’m 21, almost 22. I’m graduating in a month. My older brother is now 26.

The background: My parents moved here almost 20 years ago. They obviously were poor immigrants but were able to start two businesses in mid 2000s. My brother was starting college around 2008-ish. He was always a liar and my parents honestly didn’t know better. Going away to college isn’t normal in our home country so my parents were very on edge about and therefore extra protective of my brother. Here’s a rundown of the expenses &amp; the lies my brother told:
1.) My brother has shit grades but was desperate to leave the state for school. He went to a bad but private school for a year out of state and my parents got him an apartment so that ordeal cost $30,000 base, not including his spending money (he never got a job).
2.) He didn’t like it and transferred out but because his school was so bad his new credits didn’t transfer. His next school, also private, cost another $25,000 base.
3.) He transferred again to a good school but kept bullshitting my parents saying the school will kick him out if he didn’t pay his tuition on time or his roommate will evict him if he didn’t pay his rent and that he couldn’t get a job because he needed unpaid internships to land a job in that city. So that last two years at $50,000 each year. 

This doesn’t include him flying home rather than taking the train because it was “uncomfortable” or my parents finding multiple expensive vacations for him to Miami and vacation. Yes my parents should’ve said no but they didn’t. They thought their businesses were going well and they like to see my brother and I happy. The point here is my brother shouldn’t have taken advantage of my parents. In the process my parents faced foreclosure multiple times, lost a car, and lost all savings and lost one business because they weren’t paying rent since my brother kept telling Jen he would end up on the streets without his rent on exactly the 1st. He would also lie and say he needs this $400 shoes because at his internship everyone had them and if he didn’t he would never be considered for full time. 

Fastforward to me starting college, my parents couldn’t help AT ALL. I took out my own loans. They couldn’t even co-sign so I had insane interest and had to embarrassingly ask a family friend to sign my private ones. They also could not afford to give me an allowance when they were giving my brother 1,000$ monthly and buying him clothes and anything he asked for. So I worked multiple jobs while going to school full time to avoid capitalizing interest, lived in shit apartments with roommates since my parents couldn’t pay my rent the way they did with my brother. 2nd or 3rd year I got a better paying job and became a bartender so I started saving and was able to make more school payments to lessen my loan burden. They couldn’t pay for any of my vacations (spring break once a year) while they paid for my brother multiple vacations per year. Basically my parents could do nothing for me, at all. The most was 50$ here and there. 

I bought my own clothes, managed my own loans, got approved for my own loans and gave THEM money (10-12k over two years) while my brother who’s been graduated with a real job doesn’t give them anything. 

My parents are extremely apologetic and feel bad (also deceived by my brother since now that I’m in school they know you don’t get kicked out of your semester for making a late payment or an apartment) he also said loans would cripple him while I took them. He also said he couldn’t not take unpaid internships because he would never be able to get a job, meanwhile I didn’t have any internships  In a very competitive city and I just networked and have a couple interviews nearing graduation. 

Anyway so yeah my parents apologize to me regularly for not being able to help me at all and tell me they had no idea my brother was lying to them and they were immigrants and didn’t understand credit (not used in our country) and he was their first one to leave home and they really thought he’d end up on the streets and that he needed everything he claimed he did or else the worst would happen. I’m not too resentful towards my parents because they really are nice, hardworking people that my brother took advantage of. They should’ve been smarter but it’s a shame they have a shit son who not only watched but let them lose their business, car, and risk the house. He knew and kept demanding money with the same “I’ll end up on the streets” nonsense. 

My brother and I were never close for a variety of reasons but started talking again a month or so ago and he told me he changed and wants his sister, etc. so we started talking but it’s making all these emotions come back amplified. I don’t want to never speak to him but I also don’t know how to not resent him. I just need help coping. 

TLDR: I need help coping with my feelings towards my brother. "

The few interviews I've done was for part-time jobs--so I wouldn't call myself experienced--much less for an internship position (this will be my first internship). I'm not really sure of what to expect or what the ettiquette is, even after all the researching I've been doing.

Let me just ask all the questions I have real quick (i bolded questions that i might need to address within the actual interview itself, just so it's not an eyesore having to read paragraphs of things):

* Is it appropriate to ask what to wear to the interview and the internship, should I get it? I understand I need to dress more professionally than in the typical job, but apparently it's also not good to overdress.

* What sort of questions should I expect? Like the typical, **""What are your biggest strengths/flaws? Why do you want this position? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Why should we give you this position?"" kind of questions you would see in a part-time job interview?** Or are the questions more about the role of the internship itself?

* Is there a limit to how many questions I can ask after the director is done asking me questions? How do I determine what questions are most important to ask? **(""Will I need to know certain processes to be more effective to clients in this position?
 What would you consider the most important traits you look for in someone in this position? What are the typical duties/typical day in this internship? Is this internship available only for the semester? Will I be working with other interns or with a team of people needed for this internship (case managers, legal-affiliated people, etc.)? What are the most demanding aspects about this job? This internship requires me to be oncall sometimes, what does that entail?"")**

* Is it important that I talk about what I've learned in previous semesters and how that would benefit me in this position?

* If you guys have any tips or suggestions for me that I havent mentioned specifically, then feel free to comment them!

I know this is long, but if you've read all of this...im very impressed and thankful.

I'm a junior sysadmin, straight out of school. 

I got a internship at a local company, and i'm loving it, but I've been having some problems for which I could use all the input I can get.

The problem is in my procedures for handling calls, changes, getting results. I've got a lot of motivation, and I really want to do all the jobs I get handed to me, and be proactive and find lots more for myself as well. 

I however find myself unable to do this, and I'm pretty sure that this is because of my procedures, that I don't really have. Add to this that I often forget to document stuff, since I've never had to, and you have a ""small"" improvement point. 

I'm working on creating my own procedures, but i'd love to get feedback from experienced sysadmins. 

What are your procedures, what do you do when you see a new call? What do you do when you need to prepare a change? How do you keep things flowing and moving? What are the general procedures you apply to your daily life? 

Do you have checklists? standardized forms you made for yourself to help yourself? Maybe an order of things you always do whenever you start something? Anything is appreciated!

I am a recent graduate (May 2017) trying to find an entry level cyber security or networking job. I have applied to 80+ places and have received only one callback. The town I am in isn't really an IT hotspot and entry level jobs are extremely limited. I am able to move ANYWHERE in the US and I feel that I have extremely good interview skills if anyone would give me the chance.

I'm getting extremely discouraged because most ""entry level"" positions require experience that I don't have on paper, but I know I can do. I can't find an internship in my city and I can't move for an internship because I wouldn't be able to afford living on internship wages. 

I'm not too sure what else I can do other than apply every where. My next step is to go door to door to local IT businesses in professional attire and ask for an entry level job/internship.

Any advice?

For the upcoming winter/spring, I can either take a semester off and do a co-op or continue in school while doing a part-time internship. 

The co-op seems to have very good mentorship, and I feel like I would learn a lot on the job. However, it does use a mix of old technologies and newer technologies. There might also be a chance that it might not delay my graduation. 

The internship seems to have less of an emphasis on mentorship, but uses more exciting technologies. Plus, I would be able to continue studying in school alongside it. 

Both deal with web and would have me doing full-stack work, and both are the same in terms of prestige. Are there any suggestions of what route to take and why? Would I learn/benefit more from taking a co-op? Should I take the co-op if it somehow didn’t delay my graduation?"

7dfrjm,6,2017-11-16,Should I quit my current startup job? Or am I just not seeing things through?,justanothercsguy987,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7dfrjm/should_i_quit_my_current_startup_job_or_am_i_just/,"Hey there, I've been with this thought for the past few weeks constantly going around in my head.

I graduated this year from a bachelor in CS, and did my internship at the same startup where I'm currently working at as a full stack programmer.

At first, I found it to be quite interesting, and I did learn quite a bit. While the team was very small (sub 5 people), I found them fun to work with, and the work itself was satisfying enough.

However, with time, I started finding problems that annoyed me little by little.

**1 -** First of all, work conditions. While the office is pretty small, it's cozy and spacious enough. Can't say the same for higiene conditions though.
Pretty much everything's dirty, the bathroom, the furniture being all dusty, sometimes there's even larvae crawling on the walls/ceiling, and then there's the constant flies near trash bins.

**2 -** Code base is somewhat messy too, depending on which part of the code you look at. There's a bit of everything, bad naming conventions, methods that are too big, no longer useful comments that stay forever, etc... When I have to work on the bad parts, I feel like hitting someone while trying to understand it and getting it to do what I want.
Still, I've seen far worse spaghetti code examples online.

**3 -** And this leads me to the other issue.. The code mess problem comes from our boss liking to do everything as fast as possible, with little care for code/file structure (and the other employees go with this too). It kills me even further when I'm enjoying making something from scratch, then a few days/weeks later come back to my code, and it's a mess that not even I understand. There's almost no long term planning/thinking, no Agile or anything like that. Also, while I'm working, my boss's often checking on me and asking me ""how's it going"", while I'm still trying to read/understand code or structure what I'm doing. That's pretty annoying and puts me under constant pressure to hammer code as fast as possible, I really hate it.

**4 -** Speaking about our boss, for quite a few months I liked him, even enjoyed talking with him about different things. Problem is, as I slowly opened up, I think he's been getting more and more toxic. I feel that he takes every chance he gets to slightly mock me in front of the other guys, either because I'm not the ""licking boots"" kind of guy (either with him or other people, I try to treat everyone equally), or because I don't live my life in a way that he prefers, etc... Either he's indeed being toxic, or I'm just too sensible and he's just joking with me. 

**5 -** Salary wise, I'm not very well either. I'm pretty sure I could be getting double or near double what I'm currently making (which isn't much) on any other company around here.

**6 -** Finally, I can't say that I think they'll actually succeed with their project. And thematically it's pretty boring to me too. I love coding either on it or anything else, but I couldn't care less about yet another tool made for helping other companies make more profit. There's plenty of software like the one we're developing too, so I can't see how mixing features from all of these kinds of software can help it be distinguished (and as far as I know, there's no marketing planned).

So, help me out guys, am I making the right choice if I leave? I've never worked outside of this company or on personal projects, so I don't know how much better or worse the world is out there..."

I landed my first job in a big corporation, hated the environment and switched to non-profits. I  wanted to do good, then realised I am not willing to sacrifice my personal life and went back to corporations. Since non-profits have 0 credibility in my country, the small ones at least, I had to start from the bottom, again, in a minimum wage paid internship in marketing. I only lasted for 1 year, I just couldn't get by with so little money and jumped at the first job that was better paid: admin assistant. I was promised to do events and writing. That was a lie, I did tons of admin work and almost 0 events and only little writing, which is what I want to do long-term. 

I applied for a job precisely on communications &amp; events. I lied in my resume about my last position, nobody would have hired me should they have seen admin assistant as my last job, even though I really have good experience before that. Then I somehow got the job - I have no idea why they chose me, besides being in a hurry to hire &amp; everybody else being sucky. I did the assignment they gave me very well, but they only asked hobbies related questions at the interview... 

I was looking forward for the challenge and somebody in the team quit and now I need to do their job instead of the one I was hired for. The problem is the initial job I was supposed to do was let's say 25% above my competency level, which was manageable. But this one is simply way way above all my experience. The person I am replacing has 10 years experience and I am literally shitting my pants. They gave me the role because, they said, it would be better for someone less qualified to do the job even if not at that high level, than to not have anyone on the position until they hire someone else. I told them I am under qualified for this, I will do my best, but to keep realistic expectations and that I will need time to learn &amp; progress. But I am just terrified, which is obviously not helping. I've started doing online courses on writing and social media, the moment I get home I read non-stop, take notes, practice. 

I know I will do some progress, I haven't done anything in this first week but read read read. But how do I progress fast enough for them to keep me and not lose my job in the first 3 trial months? Any advice? It would also help a lot if there was something I could do just to calm down. This company and this role are a dream I never thought could happen and now that it's all here, I'm not ready for it and I really want to be, it's such a great opportunity. "

Do you do this as an intern within your agency?

I'm kind of at the end of my rope with my supervisor bringing in former clients to intern/volunteer in my day program setting, and I have a current student who expressed strong interest in setting up a formal program to help with clients like this.

I am planning to present to my supervisor when they return from vacation in 2 weeks.

The biggest issues we see are just major countertransference issues, control issues and at times blatant disrespect to team members when they do not get their way.

There's also boundary issues (i.e. Emailing me 10++ times in a day and going to my supervisor if I don't respond ASAP).

I really feel students could do good work with this population, they're not there as much which would help with the boundary stuff and also we could do the ""good cop bad cop"" strategy which is what my supervisor does now with me if that makes sense?

Please feel free to share struggles you have found in this role too as I know my supervisor may look at it as a conflict of interest not to mention one challenging person may not respond well to having to report to a student (even though they are in different school programs).

I'm looking for other feedback and resources to make this a hard sell to my supervisor and honestly, to take this off my plate lol.

7dgd5z,5,2017-11-16,[22] Diving into marketing but what really is marketing? Need advice for a path/insights/opinion.,10minOFthinkingAnick,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7dgd5z/22_diving_into_marketing_but_what_really_is/,"Hello marketing community,

Currently I am a 22 years of age and a  3rd year student. I am studying at a shitty college (some of the lecturers are pretty good, they also lecture at other colleges/universities but they turn the level down as students at my college aren’t even mediocre though sometimes we get that 1 person in the whole year who is a great, recently we had a guy who later on went on working for Google, though he won some competitions, finished a great university later and made a good run with his career. So I hope that I am making the right steps in order for me to become an expert in marketing, sadly I dont even know what marketing really is, I will share my frustration and thoughts in the end of the post.

During my 1 and 2 years first half I worked at some hum drum jobs like McDonalds as my priorities were: cash + flexible schedule but it changed as I got more aware of the path I am going into – shitty college, no relevant experience = highest chance of becoming a dead waste in the job market which is already extremely competitive (probably everywhere). 

During the second year I had a lecture called “marketing” which was taught by a young guy in his begining of 30’s I would say who was a Economics and Philosophy PhD student at a local university. During it we learned the basics of marketing: 4P, SWOT, PEST and other small things which he knew – smell marketing, music marketing and stuff like that (though it were just some inside info he knew not a huge speech about these things). 

During the 2 year of studies I started the ""creation"" of my CV. I knew I have to fill in the blanks and start with something. My plan was to get 2 years of experience in a 1,5 year period (that could only be done with a job and an internship at the same time during summer or during studies when a study internship must be done – its for the bachelor thesis + experience thing).  I thought that the best type of experience would be at large companies because future employers would probably assume that I am already time tested and took the other “big boy” tests, also the work there is more organized and structured and if I would go abroad I think employers there would look at me in a more positive way (just an assumption).  Also I gathered a list of courses (Coursera, edX, Google, Facebook and lots of other valuable stuff I could find, made an Excel thing and currently am trying to finish all of them, get the certificates and boost my CV/linkedin even more).

My current work experience (from my last to the current position)

Sales department assistant (2016-11-08 – 2017-09-18) – Worked at a company which is a part of a company which is responsible for providing postal services in my country (a government sponsored entity). Tasks I did: market analysis (looking into competitors service offerings – DPD, Omniva, DHL and UPS aren’t that big here so my company and some others had the biggest market piece), selling services to small businesses, searching for potential new clients, administrating paper work (agreements and other documents).

Marketing department intern (2017-07-03 – 2017-09-01) – worked at a major retail operator, it is currently getting even a stronger position in the market by trying to merge with a local retail operator. Tasks I did: Creating/Coordinating weekly leaflets, competitor leaflet and social media communication analysis, filling in briefs for graphic design agencies.

Marketing department intern (2017-09-03 - 2017-10-27) - worked at one of the largest, most modern and economically strongest business mergers in my country. Mainly they operate in agriculture and poultry. Tasks I did: segmentation of several EU countries by HoReCa and others aspects (location counts, menu and others), creation of presentation as a tool for a first contact with potential B2B clients.

Marketing department assistant (2017-09-18 - Currently) - working at a local leading real estate developer (commercial, residential and other projects). This is a kind of a internship program for 2-4 year university students, I am probably the first person from college and 90% of the interns at this program are studying real estate. Tasks I do: competitor residential projects analysis, updating various residential project websites (WordPress, Joomla! and other CMS), reports (GoogleAds, Facebook), brainstorming for ideas when needed and others tasks which are sometimes not related to marketing like: presentation preparation.

Also during my second year I competed in an event in which 620 students were gathered, only 120 were taken to the final ""showdown"" (18 higher education institutions, of course this is not the top level thing, its an event for shitty/ok/good colleges), each team consists of 3-6 students who represent thei HEI. During the event each team must go through tasks which are presented by well known companies like Western Union and in the end of the event these companies choose who won their prizes and did the task with an ""A+"". This year me and my team won the prize for innovation task which was presented by a well known Europian bank. We got a few books and an invitation for 2018 innovation center opening and business lunch do discuss various topics, but before that I have the final study internship of 1,5 months, so I contacted them already asking if I could get into the marketing department and try to help them and get some more experience, currently waiting for their answer.

So...

I will definetly have the 2 years of ""relevant"" experience - thats the best experience I have managed to get, the internships at my country just arent that great (also they are maximum 2 months long, rarely companies have these internship programs), usually its tasks that nobody wants to do or customer relationships things, so I am very grateful for at least the glimpse and the scratching of the marketing industry surface I managed to get. I will finish my college with 2 years experience, certificates in digital marketing, marketing (neuromarketing and othet stuff I found), I will get more paper work (also a kind of certificates of attendance I would say) - I managed to sign up for free and open masters lectures at a local university which is a top notch thing here (that gives me value and also shows that I am active after work/studies, some lectures arent related to marketing but 4 out of 5 were for sure), also the ""award"" thing that me and my team won during that local event. I am trying my best to build my CV/linkedin and of course most importantly knowledge but I really dont know were I should go after studies. I felt like all the marketing managers were coordinating stuff and filling lots of briefs for different agencies - communication agencies (Ogilvy, Hill Knowlton Strategies), graphic design agencies, SEO agencies, AdWords agencies, iProspect and others. Should I find a specialization and go for it? like advertisement or how does this marketing career path work? When I checked the linkedin of current local Hill Knowlton Strategies CEO linkedin I found that she worked at 2 companies which are corporations but not ad agencies, though I feel like if I will enter an ad agency they will mock me as they are the real creators and I am judt a coordinator of their work, what I want is to make my brain work, I want to generate ideas and have a career path but I dont know how the marketing careers are ""created"". So currently I am doing everything that is marketing but the lack of real solid and specialized path is frustrating me.

Also I applyed for Erasmus+ grant, I would like to get that financial help of a grant and spend an internship abroad as I think marketing there is a totally different thing than here + more experience and international experience is always a good thing.

Can you guys give me recommendations/advice? Maybe you can share your insights about marketing industry and is it easier to start corporate and move to ad agencies or how is it, as I dont even understand what is a standart day at Ogilvy or iProspect or any other company related to marketing. I hope I mentioned everything."

Position: Software Engineer

I'm not too sure but 68k feels low for a software developer at Irvine. But considering it's a hardware company and the position is for a web team makes me think it's acceptable. One great thing about the offer is that I am familiar with the team, and I love the team's atmosphere.

Some background: I've been a part-time intern at this company the last 5 months while attending school so I'm very comfortable with the team, and know how to do the work. 

Do you guys think this is an acceptable offer that I should strongly consider? How limiting would my career be if I worked at a hard drive company instead of a software company? Should I try to negotiate the salary? Is 68k too low for a software engineer/web developer at Irvine?

The obvious and general response here would be to search desired job listings, and brush-up/learn the skills required accordingly. Though this isn't always so easy, and the variance of skills/knowledge can be high (excluding the very obvious ones). There is also the issue of domain knowledge, of which one may not have any at all, let alone specific to the job applied to. Picking up on this can seem tough from the outside, especially to be up to date on current practices.

Perhaps someone can suggest some useful books/blogs/etc which would help those of us coming from a purely stats/analysis type of background to get used to certain domain spaces and the techniques there. Industries like Finance/Econ, Bio/Medical, Ad/Marketing, etc., seem to use familiar methods, but sometimes have rather unfamiliar nomenclature for them.

A bit about my background (if anyone would have some direct suggestions for me I'd be very appreciative): Masters in Stats, Bachelors in Math, have had some basic analytics work using google analytics, a short (1 semester) internship for a pharma company as a statistical consultant, quite good with R, intermediate with Python/SQL/SAS, familiar with most modern learning techniques.  I've tried to keep sharp by reading stats/ML books, learning/refreshing topics on youtube, testing out some tools in Kaggle comps. Despite this, I'm still quite nervous come every interview (there haven't been many).

Sorry to be so long winded, thanks in advance.

7dh4ry,1,2017-11-16,"Are my parents toxic, or am I just overreacting?",amicrazythowaway,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/7dh4ry/are_my_parents_toxic_or_am_i_just_overreacting/,"I am a 21 year old college-going female who still lives with her family. My parents constantly put me down, calling me lazy, entitled, selfish, a loser, a ""fucking bitch"", asshole, whore, telling me that I will have a miserable life and that I deserve it, etc. Oftentimes, it seems like they get angry with me for no good reason. 

For example, one time I was giving them directions to drive me somewhere (we were all in the car together). I told them that the destination was on a particular road, and suggested that they exit off the highway on that road. We get off on that road and find that an accident has occurred, causing a traffic jam that we spent an additional 15 minutes stuck in. They spent the entire time screaming with me about how I am a, ""good-for-nothing brat"" and a ""selfish idiot"", and that people in the ""real world"" will ""kick my ass"". Just because I suggest that they exit on that road. They were pretty much blaming me for the fact that we got caught up in this traffic jam. The thing is, I had no idea that the traffic was going to be like this. They spoke as if I intentionally sabotaged their plans or something. 

Another time, my mom came home from work and started yelling at me about how I should start cleaning up the house for a dinner party we were to be hosting at our house, just as I was about to head out to school. I respectfully reminded her that the party was still one whole week away and that I have a lot of assignments to finish before then, but that I will help clean and cook when I finish them. My mom then started screaming about how I never do anything in the house at all (absolutely not true), that I am a ""fucking bitch"" who does nothing, etc. We are also Muslim, but I don't wear the headscarf. I was wearing natural makeup, jeans, and a tank top with a full-sleeve cardigan over it. In the midst of this ""cleaning the house"" argument, my mom started going on about how I dress, and she lunged at me to pull off my cardigan to expose the fact that I was wearing a tank-top underneath, telling me that I'm basically slut who is desperate for male attention. I was late for class at that point, and started walking out to head for school, and I heard her yelling, ""Karma will get you back! Let's see if you get a husband dressed like that! No man will want to marry a slutty, lazy girl like you!"" Mind you, I am a virgin and have *never* held hands with a guy even, so I thought that was pretty rich. My mom also curses me often, telling me that I will be miserable and that I will ""get what is coming for me"", as if her saying those things will seal my fate. She also casually throws terms such as ""dumb, fucking bitch"" at me when she is clearly mad about something else in her life.

My dad is also extremely controlling. He doesn't let me out of the house past 5 pm, even to go out to eat with some friends (a very innocent activity), stating, ""No unmarried girl from a decent family does that,"" as his justification (even though we live in the US, and have done so for over 20 years). I get stressed when my friends have any sort of event, because I know that simply being able to go out for a couple of hours leads to yelling match between me and my dad (and sometimes they have turned physical with him pushing me or yanking my arm). I often find myself lying to him these days, stating I am going to my school's library to study when really I am going to those events. Other Muslim girls I know don't have this problem. He also scolds me for not acting like an adult, all the while placing restrictions on me that most other people my age do not have (such as a 5 PM curfew). Also, one time, during an argument about me wearing makeup, he screamed, ""Guys will just cum inside of you and leave you!"" which was disgusting to hear from a parent.

I also don't feel like I can be open and honest with my parents. I have been struggling with depression, and it is causing me to struggle in my classes. Whenever I have tried to open a dialog about this with them, they get insanely angry with me, telling me that I am a ""loser who will never do anything in life"", they threaten to marry me off as soon as a finish my degree, that I am nothing but a leech upon the family, that I am making things up, etc. The worst thing they have told me however, is that I am a burden upon the family (and they say it often, but never towards my other siblings). I don't know why, but that comment gets to me more than the other ones do. They also tell me that when I go out into the real world, everyone will hate me and that I will come crawling back to them, because apparently I don't have the skills to navigate the ""real world"". Mind you, I have held several leadership positions, published a my own research work, got the chance to present my work at a conference, have gotten top scores on a standardized test for professional school admissions, completed prestigious internships, have lots of amazing friends, etc.

Now I am not sitting here pretending to be a perfect daughter either. I can be very cold, standoffish, stubborn, and talk back to my parents when their words and actions get to be too much (though for the most part I try to keep my voice down and keep my cool during these situations, and I can confidently say I *do* try my best to be a good person). I avoid them a lot too, which I know hurts them, but I find that it is the only way I can find some peace mentally. I am at the point where even when classes finish, I actively schedule my day in a way that I get home after they fall asleep. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells while interacting with them, like if I utter the wrong thing then everything will come crashing down. I also began to use my school's therapist services, because I don't feel like I can rely on my parents for any support and help. I am constantly afraid of showing my face to my parents, because they often have something to criticize about my appearance (not to humblebrag, but I am considered very attractive, and I don't have to do too much with my appearance to look ""good""), calling me ""desperate for male attention"" when I simply wear some mascara and a top and pants that fit me well. By Western standards the clothes I wear are extremely modest, and the makeup I wear is natural too.

I am in the process of looking for a job so that I can get more independence. But my question is, am I going through something normal? Am I overreacting? I often worry that I actually *am* selfish, lazy, etc. and that I deserve to hear those things from my parents because I am intrinsically horrible. :( How can I deal with this? I feel so stuck. Sorry if anything seemed incoherent btw; I am just so upset right now I kind of just poured everything out that came to mind."

Are there any studios in the vicinity who rent out their control rooms / live rooms / iso rooms? I hope to scout my own groups to record and earn my own keep.

All I Want for Christmas,darrylthedudeWayne,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/7dhrzu/a_christmas_movie_i_am_currently_in_the_thinking/,"This film is a culmination of some stories all set on the Christmas season. All of them tie together through the fact they are set on Christmas and also they all have similar themes.

Prologue- We Begin with a older man talking about how most of the best stories take place on special times. One of them being Christmas and he begins to tell us some of these stories.

The New Guy Part one- We cut to many centuries later in Modern day where in Canada a young 18 year old boy who was going no where in his previous home has moved to Canada as a new Intern in a up and coming film company. He gets there and realises it is not what he thought as most of the Interns are your typical Millennials and nothing like he is and also he is stuck with a Square office job there and later send to the mail room. That all changes when he decides to sneak into his bosses (who was off somewhere else at the time) and put a script for a movie idea he has in his bosses desk.

Christmas with Buble Part One- a Fictionalized Michael Buble is having a concert for Christmas. But this year it is not going as planned as a snowstorm has prevented the Guest from being able to make it the only people who made it there where a fictionalized Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Dan Akroyd. So he tries to delay the broadcast but the studio running it can't Then the power goes off and they are stuck there for the night.

Forgiveness- A Former drunk tries to find forgiveness for his sins. So to do so he helps a Priest with the local soup kitchen where he learns the true meaning of Christmas and also Kindness. He also meets his wife and Daughter again and while he does not come back together with them he does now feel redeemed.

Christmas with Buble Part Two- With the Concert/live tv event not happening Michael Buble along with the people there make the best of it and decide to have there own live show eating whatever is left in the fridge before it spoils and also drinking whatever is left before it expires. In this he learns sometimes you have to compromise and make with what you have.

Let It Snow- A Family spend the night before Christmas admits a power outage and decide to make stew and just spend the night with no power.

Cold December Night- A Man trying to get home for the Holidays. But his car breaks down and he has to spend the night at the autoshop and it is revealed he lost his family in a car accident awhile ago but thanks to the people at the Autoshop he learns to move on with his past and keep moving forward.

The New Guy Part Two- His Boss calls the new Intern to his office. He thinks he is going to get fired for breaking in but she loves the idea and wants it to get greenlit. So they begin planning out story boards for the film but of course it is not easy as they will need to film Test Footage to pitch to the other Executives and he has no experience in film besides writing.
 
Winter Wonderland- On the first day of Christmas break some school kids go out to play in the snow and hilariousness ensues.

The Quest Part One- A teenager (revealed to be one of the kids from the previous story all grown up) visiting his Uncle in a Log cabin he lives in. Along with his younger brother and Girlfriend. When he gets there they enjoy themselves and meet there Uncle's friend. However there Uncle sees a star in the sky and is convinced it leads to a Perfect place to celebrate Christmas. So There Uncle and his friends drag the three to go on him on his Quest to this place.

The New Guy Part three- So the day of filming for the test footage comes and they film it without getting through some comedic hijinks first but he finally gets it filmed and learns that you can learn stuff by doing it for your first time. The test footage is shown with a positive reception and is officially greenlit.

Santa: Truth or Fiction- A Young lad (one of the boys from the Winter Wonderland segment by the way) is starting to have doubts about Santa Claus after overhearing his parents. However his Grandfather stays up all night with him to prove that Santa is real. However they get no luck and the boy goes to bed. However the next day there are presents under the tree but it is left ambiguous to weather or not it was Santa or the parents (anyways the kid learns that sometimes you can't prove something is real but if you believe then you can believe)

The Quest Part Two- the Group continues there ""Quest"" and they walk through snow and the wilderness. Along the way they find the biggest shock ever Santa's slay crashed landed and Santa Claus trying to calm his Raindeer and get the slay backup. So the group helps him and Santa gives each of them there presents early. They then continue there search and find where the star was lighting and it was a Bed and Breakfast and seeing it is starting to get more cold they stay there for the night.

baby It's cold outside- A Younger man has his eyes on a young lady he loves. So he tries to convince her to spend the Christmas Eve with him at his place so she will not be lonely and by the time she gets back home it will be too cold outside to travel back home from the city. She is later convinced and she finally falls for him and they have a nice Christmas together as he takes her around town.

Epilogue- The film then ends with the old man revealing himself to be Santa Claus. He then tells the audiences he has more stories to tell (setting up a sequel) but until then Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. "

I'm traveling tonight, and I'm watching the lights twinkle below from a lonely hotel room in a lonely city. 

I'd love to chat to pass the time, if you enjoy the following short:

-----------

You expected him to look.

His intent was obvious, when he asked you to pick out the file from the bottom drawer. So you gave him a show.

With a graceful flourish of your ponytail, you bend at the waist and give your boss a long, deliberate view of your ass - making sure to give a coy little wiggle in your tight pencil skirt. 

You can almost feel his eyes on you. Predatory. Ravenous. It was expected.

But his strong hand running up the inside of your thigh is a complete surprise.

Goosebumps race up and down your limbs. The iced lightning of adrenaline floods your veins, and every little hair on your body stands on end. Shock twists together with sheer excitement in your belly, and hot, wet heat blooms immediately between your legs.

You straighten, and your back meets the toned outline of his chest - your two bodies separated only by layers of cloth. The outline of his suit is distinct. Crisp, tailored wool. Charcoal. The rich burgundy of his tie flashes through your mind.

His hand gives your ass a playful squeeze, and your ruby lips part sensually in mock surprise. You've spent so many months carefully painting them every morning, waiting for this exact moment. You shift, preparing to turn - to press your lips firmly against his, to show him how desperately you've been craving him.

But his arms tighten around you.

With a single shove against the small of your back, you're bent over his desk. The mahogany is cold and hard beneath your hands - you can feel it through your blouse, against your belly and your breasts.

There's a sudden, harsh tug, and your skirt is up around your waist. His fist tightens around your ponytail, and pulls. A gasp is torn from your throat as he forces your back into a sensual arch - your ass pressed outward, grinding against the growing bulge in his slacks; your slick, black pumps shaping your curves against him.

There's the distinct sound of his belt buckle. The soft rasp of leather on wool. Your panties rip, torn from your body in his burning need for you.

An excited giggle bursts from between your lips - the pent up desperation from months of fantasizing being released all at once. From the moment you stepped through his office doorway on the first day of your internship, up until this very moment - every second, of every day, you've craved him. A desperate, overwhelming yearning. 

You can feel it now, growing at a fevered pitch, deep in your belly. It's a coil of lust, twisting about itself with growing tension. 

When you feel the swollen head of his cock at your entrance, it snaps - a low moan is drawn hoarse from your lungs, and you can feel your own hot juices trickle down your inner thighs.

He thrusts.

With a fistful of your ponytail in one hand, and a grip on your hip with the other, he penetrates you. Your soaked, burning sex welcomes him, and you can feel each granite inch of his cock as it sinks into your body.

When your lips are finally wrapped tight around the very base of his shaft, with his full, heavy balls pressed up against your clit, you can feel the muscles of his thighs flex against your ass.

The power of his body is intoxicating. You push back into him, savoring the rigid feeling of his toned legs and abs flush against your skin.

He thrusts again, and your knees quiver. 

Again. And again. The thick, hard length of his cock plunges into your body, claiming you. It's everything you've been dreaming about, and more. No amount of daydreaming at your desk could have prepared you for this. 

There's a fluttery, tense feeling in your belly. You can tell that a wave of orgasm is about to crest, but it's something more than that. There's a new craving from somewhere, deep in your most primal, ancient instincts. 

Those lush, ruby lips part, and your lashes flutter in surprise as you realize you're hoping he cums inside of you. 

The thought of it sends you over the edge, and the wave crests - a sudden cascade of intense ecstacy that sends ripples of pleasure coarsing through your body. Instinctively, your pussy grips him - the powerful contractions of your soaked, searing walls milking him hungrily.

All the while, he continues to thrust. Deep, powerful strokes that leave you gasping and begging between heaved breaths. 

You're his now. You know it. He knows it. A cute little plaything - young, pretty and eager for her boss.

His muscles tense. They flex. He bottoms out inside of your with a final, aggressive thrust, and you can feel his balls against you as the entire length of his cock gives a single promising throb.

He erupts.

With a rough growl, the first, thick rope of his cum splashes into your tight little slit. The heat of it fills you. A second hot splash, and a third. It coats your walls, floods your womb, and drips slowly down the insides of your thighs. 

In the coming months, you'll look back on this moment as you stroke your swollen belly and grin. But right now, in the moment, your mind is blank - focused only on the animalistic fire raging between your legs. 

The feel of his seed is overwhelming, potent and thick within you even as it coats your thighs. You tighten yourself, tensing, gripping his shaft in rippling waves of pleasure.

Your tongue peeks out from between your lips and grazes your teeth in a knowing grin as the last drops of him are planted deep in your belly."

7difas,34,2017-11-16,Public assistance isn't just ~free money.,socalledwelfarequeen,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7difas/public_assistance_isnt_just_free_money/,"What a lot of people who have never needed to ask for this kind of help don't seem to realize is that the process isn't simply filling out an application and waiting for the monthly check to roll in. As it turns out, there are quite a few strings attached.  

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. At least in my case, those strings pulled me along until I suddenly found myself in a new place entirely.  

For a little backstory, I've suffered from extreme depression since I was all of thirteen years old. My home life growing up was a complete nightmare. My father is a verbally and emotionally abusive drunk, and my mother is an enabler who has never hesitated to take out her own share of the abuse out on me. To give just a taste, a close friend of mine died when I was seventeen. The day of finding out, still a complete mess, my very drunk father demanded that I 'stop fucking crying over a piece of shit' and that I help him access internet porn. When I was not amenable to this, he screamed a lot of horrible things at me. It ended with an offer to buy me a gun to kill myself with if I was 'that sad'. My mother somehow slept through this despite the fact that it ended with him screaming at the top of this lungs and throwing the laptop across the room. In the morning I was told that I just misunderstood what he was saying. 

Things like that have left...some marks. Unfortunately, I spent years justifying my own bullshit with how terribly I was treated. I'm too damaged. Who needs to try in school? I'm too stupid to do anything. Just smoke a little more, have another drink. What the fuck does it matter? I floated around for years like that, occasionally living off others, occasionally working bringing home small paychecks from minimum wage jobs I wouldn't hold for long. 

Here's the part where I start to get to the point. Finally. Someone suggested that I apply for SNAP 'just to see what you can get'. So I did. The answer is 195 dollars a month of food assistance for the unemployed. Guess what though? Unless you have small children or you can order off the seniors menu, there are requirements you have to fulfill to keep receiving assistance. Even that has a very short shelf life. (And I'm sure that those people have have plenty of strings too)

I was required to go to 'Job Club' every Wednesday morning. This class that I highly resented at first, is actually very helpful. They offer job leads. They teach you how to properly write a resume. They work with people on interviewing skills. You're also assigned a counselor to work with who you form a bit of relationship with. In full bullshitting mode, I had written down a desire for post-secondary schooling on one the many forms I had to fill out. Nearing the middle of me aimlessly clicking around hiring websites to keep face, my counselor pulled me aside and gave me a flyer for a training program that they sponsored. Not quite college, but I said I wanted to learn something right? What I heard was it was a great way to extend the months I would receive money without having to go to fucking job club. 

So I did it. The training itself is nothing impressive. I'm now certified in Microsoft Word and Excel. It's hardly a degree, but it was fairly in depth. More than enough than for an entry-level office job. Even better yet, they offered internships to learn other skills. A paid one at that because I chose to disclose my mental illness. 

By the end of my internship, I was hired at a 14 dollar an hour office job. A little over a year ago this would be unimaginable to me.

**TL;DR: I guess after all of that is that you don't just get free money. If you work with the agencies, there are a lot of opportunities out there. That is often their entire point. It's not to let people linger in poverty with government money to keep them alive. Sometimes they can help someone build a whole new life. For the people that can't take said opportunities, as I said, there are always strings. Shit isn''t free for them either.** "
7diflv,8,2017-11-16,[Help] Is it right to subject a dog to a move?,LaniusShrike,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/7diflv/help_is_it_right_to_subject_a_dog_to_a_move/,"For the last couple of years I've been separated from my best buddy. He's been living at home while I intern and that was a great decision because my living situation was terrible for a dog. Long hours, odd hours, small apartment, and no good parks/off leash areas within easy distance.

But now I have a full-time job at a place where I can give him a great life. I OK'ed him with my apartment, I can bring him to work AND our office is on a site that used to be a park (20+ acres of woods and meadows). 

It's not like he's starved for attention now - my family takes great care of him but he is definitely ""my"" dog. He was my rescue project that I worked hard to fit into my home. Whenever I visit, he becomes dog-shaped velcro and doesn't leave my side. (My parents joke he's ungrateful because for all their spoiling, he forgets they exist when I come home.)

In April my father will be visiting me and he's offered to bring my boy with him. Home used to be west coast now it's east so it's a significant trip and dad's flying, not driving. 
My question is:

Is it right to subject my dog to this move? 

I know I want him with me for selfish reasons. He has a good life where he is now (and he's spoiled beyond belief!) I know travel is stressful and I know airplanes are risky and scary. 

But. I miss him. And I feel like I've been patient for years: when I was in a situation where I couldn't take him because I would compromise his quality of life, I didn't. 
Now I have the means to give him an AWESOME time- maybe even a better time than he has at home because I can bring him with me to work (as opposed to him staying home for 8 hours while my parents work). I worked hard to find a job, an apartment, and a lifestyle that would be great for him and I feel like I want my patience and my work to pay off in the form of having my best buddy with me again.

Is this wrong of me?
Or fair to him?"
7dige0,7,2017-11-16,I'm barely passing my CS classes and feel like a failure. I'm considering stopping school.,Joafie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7dige0/im_barely_passing_my_cs_classes_and_feel_like_a/,"I'm putting hours upon hours of effort into my CS classes (sophomore year in CS, although I'm technically a Junior when it comes to how many credits I have) and barely scraping by with C's. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail systems programming (what I'm taking right now). I'm just so angry at myself because I absolutely love the theory, I think it's really cool, but for some reason I just can't get a good grasp on it. I failed the midterm after studying days in advance for it, I'm getting C's on assignments I was positive were going to get A's. I really love programming and am positive it is what I want to do, I just don't know why this is so hard. 

This is why I'm considering stopping school. I feel like I'm wasting my money. I learn way better by myself taking online tutorials than I do in a classroom setting. I'm also wondering how much the degree is going to help me get a job. I have a decent portfolio at this point already (iPhone and android apps, internship, web development), and am creating a full stack web application for a small business part time (using angular and django). But I also don't know how much of that matters if I don't have a degree. I've seen people on here that get jobs without degrees, but everyone I talk to tells me to stay in school, and that the degree is by far the most important. But if I keep failing my classes than what's the point? I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel if I love software this much, I shouldn't be failing it. It makes me rethink it all sometimes."
7din0n,1,2017-11-17,CS graduate with no experience next steps?,RunningGame,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7din0n/cs_graduate_with_no_experience_next_steps/,"I graduated last spring with a BS.c in CS and I've been applying for a lot of jobs but haven't gotten passed that stage. I think the reason I don't get any interviews is because I'm older (30 years old) and I haven't worked for the past 7 years or done any internships (interns aren't really a thing in my country though). I was hoping I'd get a job, any job, to start off with too mitigate the gap in my employment history and then hopefully move unto more interesting work. That (obviously) hasn't happened.

I got high marks in school which I list on my otherwise barren CV, because I have little else (I also list the jobs I worked 7+ years ago).

After months of no interviews I recently updated my CV to include an explanation for the lack of previous occupations (I don't go into details I just say I got very sick and couldn't work for a long time and so I started university in the meantime). I don't know if that's a good idea or not but maybe it looks better.

My family members have tried to help me and have generally been great but computer science/tech industry stuff isn't really their forte. I don't socialize much outside my family. When I got sick it left me as an invalid for a couple of years and I got really depressed and isolated myself completely, eventually people just (understandably) moved on. When I finally got off my ass and went back to school I was still dealing with a lot of problems and felt really uncomfortable taking classes with, mostly, much younger people so I didn't really make any connections there. Therefore my personal network outside of family members is pretty much non-existent. I'm not fundamentally awkward socially or a bad communicator, or at least I don't think I am, but it is what it is.

I realize that I'm in a tough situation and I don't have a lot of redeeming factors. But this is what I have to work with. I don't know what to do next though. I currently live with my parents and they're very supportive and are actually encouraging me to get a Masters degree. I already got what I think is a good education from the national university, which everyone here attends, and I did well so I don't know how further education is going to help me get a job. I'm open to any suggestions though. I just want to get my life back on track.

My parents constantly put me down, calling me lazy, entitled, selfish, a loser, a ""fucking bitch"", asshole, whore, telling me that I will have a miserable life and that I deserve it, etc. Oftentimes, it seems like they get angry with me for no good reason.

For example, one time I was giving them directions to drive me somewhere (we were all in the car together). I told them that the destination was on a particular road, and suggested that they exit off the highway on that road. We get off on that road and find that an accident has occurred, causing a traffic jam that we spent an additional 15 minutes stuck in. They spent the entire time screaming with me about how I am a, ""good-for-nothing brat"" and a ""selfish idiot"", and that people in the ""real world"" will ""kick my ass"". Just because I suggest that they exit on that road. They were pretty much blaming me for the fact that we got caught up in this traffic jam. The thing is, I had no idea that the traffic was going to be like this. They spoke as if I intentionally sabotaged their plans or something.

Another time, my mom came home from work and started yelling at me about how I should start cleaning up the house for a dinner party we were to be hosting at our house, just as I was about to head out to school. I respectfully reminded her that the party was still one whole week away and that I have a lot of assignments to finish before then, but that I will help clean and cook when I finish them. My mom then started screaming about how I never do anything in the house at all (absolutely not true), that I am a ""fucking bitch"" who does nothing, etc. We are also Muslim, but I don't wear the headscarf. I was wearing natural makeup, jeans, and a tank top with a full-sleeve cardigan over it. In the midst of this ""cleaning the house"" argument, my mom started going on about how I dress, and she lunged at me to pull off my cardigan to expose the fact that I was wearing a tank-top underneath, telling me that I'm basically slut who is desperate for male attention. I was late for class at that point, and started walking out to head for school, and I heard her yelling, ""Karma will get you back! Let's see if you get a husband dressed like that! No man will want to marry a slutty, lazy girl like you!"" Mind you, I am a virgin and have never held hands with a guy even, so I thought that was pretty rich. My mom also curses me often, telling me that I will be miserable and that I will ""get what is coming for me"", as if her saying those things will seal my fate. She also casually throws terms such as ""dumb, fucking bitch"" at me when she is clearly mad about something else in her life.

My dad is also extremely controlling. He doesn't let me out of the house past 5 pm, even to go out to eat with some friends (a very innocent activity), stating, ""No unmarried girl from a decent family does that,"" as his justification (even though we live in the US, and have done so for over 20 years). I get stressed when my friends have any sort of event, because I know that simply being able to go out for a couple of hours leads to yelling match between me and my dad (and sometimes they have turned physical with him pushing me or yanking my arm). I often find myself lying to him these days, stating I am going to my school's library to study when really I am going to those events. Other Muslim girls I know don't have this problem. He also scolds me for not acting like an adult, all the while placing restrictions on me that most other people my age do not have (such as a 5 PM curfew). Also, one time, during an argument about me wearing makeup, he screamed, ""Guys will just cum inside of you and leave you!"" which was disgusting to hear from a parent.

I also don't feel like I can be open and honest with my parents. I have been struggling with depression, and it is causing me to struggle in my classes. Whenever I have tried to open a dialog about this with them, they get insanely angry with me, telling me that I am a ""loser who will never do anything in life"", they threaten to marry me off as soon as a finish my degree, that I am nothing but a leech upon the family, that I am making things up, etc. The worst thing they have told me however, is that I am a burden upon the family (and they say it often, but never towards my other siblings). I don't know why, but that comment gets to me more than the other ones do. They also tell me that when I go out into the real world, everyone will hate me and that I will come crawling back to them, because apparently I don't have the skills to navigate the ""real world"". Mind you, I have held several leadership positions, published a my own research work, got the chance to present my work at a conference, have gotten top scores on a standardized test for professional school admissions, completed prestigious internships, have lots of amazing friends, etc.

Now I am not sitting here pretending to be a perfect daughter either. I can be very cold, standoffish, stubborn, and talk back to my parents when their words and actions get to be too much (though for the most part I try to keep my voice down and keep my cool during these situations, and I can confidently say I do try my best to be a good person). I avoid them a lot too, which I know hurts them, but I find that it is the only way I can find some peace mentally. I am at the point where even when classes finish, I actively schedule my day in a way that I get home after they fall asleep. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells while interacting with them, like if I utter the wrong thing then everything will come crashing down. I also began to use my school's therapist services, because I don't feel like I can rely on my parents for any support and help. I am constantly afraid of showing my face to my parents, because they often have something to criticize about my appearance (not to humblebrag, but I am considered very attractive, and I don't have to do too much with my appearance to look ""good""), calling me ""desperate for male attention"" when I simply wear some mascara and a top and pants that fit me well. By Western standards the clothes I wear are extremely modest, and the makeup I wear is natural too.
I am in the process of looking for a job so that I can get more independence. But my question is, am I going through something normal? Am I overreacting? I often worry that I actually am selfish, lazy, etc. and that I deserve to hear those things from my parents because I am intrinsically horrible. :( How can I deal with this? I feel so stuck. Sorry if anything seemed incoherent btw; I am just so upset right now I kind of just poured everything out that came to mind.

TLDR: Parents do not treat me well. I am wondering if this is normal and if I deserve it (because I am not a perfect child."

I am on an internship position on a big company, and I was assigned a small project regarding a internal web app. The language of choice was C# with ASP.NET. I have a few weeks to finish at least a small part of it, but the thing is I have zero knowledge regarding C# or .NET. 

The project is about an web app that will ask for credentials, then let you login to some internal software that manages other internal projects files. I need to do at least the login page and be able to access the other software (the front end).

As a background, I am a beginner in Simulink and medium in C. They are aware of the fact that I don't know C#. I know its almost impossible, but I don't wanna quit or disappoint. Maybe they wanna see how I react under pressure or something, I'm not sure.

So I just need a little help from you guys.. 

1. Where should I dive in first: C# or ASP.NET?
2. What should I learn in order to develop at least the front end of this application.?
3. Where can I learn it from? Any tutorials where I can pick exactly what I need in order to develop this app?

If so, why aren't they your main target?",83wonder,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7djbnk/doesnt_disney_have_more_control_and_more_to_lose/,"I was a gamer up until the PS3 days and remember being amazed fighting that lake monster in Resident Evil 4 and battling the sniper The End in MGS. For whatever reason I lost interest years ago and have been shocked reading about Battlefront and what devs are doing to gaming now. 

The response and unity seen over here over Battlefront 2 has been great to see unfold, but it seems like a lot of the effort is somewhat misplaced. 

Disney owns all this and is the boss, EA just has the development rights and makes/distributes the actual game correct?

It seems like EA is pulling a bait-and-switch now, and they already had a somewhat negative rep going into all this. It doesn't seem like they'd care much about their rep if they made a bunch of money on sales and then brought back in-app purchases. They have a monopoly here and make money regardless of what you think of them just like ISPs. 

*Disney* on the other hand is GREATLY concerned with their reputation. 

Just recently they banned LA Times critics and then reversed the ban after a boycott and outcry. 

Remember the tragic alligator incident at Disney world? [They fired an intern shortly after for posting a picture of a sign instructing employees to lie about gators in the park, and promptly rehired her when the info became public.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/18/disney-fires-rehires-intern-who-tweeted-sign-instructing-employees-to-deny-on-site-alligators/?utm_term=.9180b7141380)

And most importantly, what about all the sex scandals coming out right now!? [Disney bought Harvey Weinstein's film company Miramax and employed him until 2005](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Miramax_Films).  They also had a story released a couple years ago about employees that were sex predators. 

Disney is shaking about possible scandals coming out involving them. Take this fight directly to them and don't let EA be the fall guy (with their already shitty rep) while both Disney and EA continue to make money hand-over-fist and fuck people over. 

Maybe I'm missing something but I couldn't even find a response from Disney regarding this Battlefront II controversy. 

Hope this helps some. Keep fighting guys, I wish you the best!

Hopefully this lovely community can help. To give you some back story, I went into a local university majoring in Biology and after not enjoying the class and getting a bad grade on it, I decided to sit down and rethink my future. I met with professors of MIS and CS and decided to take an intro programming class that taught Visual Basic. I loved that class and knew that's what I wanted to major in so I switched. Three semesters later, I am finishing up this semester with pretty good grades learning discrete structures and towards the end of C++ (I would consider myself proficient). Next semester, I am taking Data Structures and Multi user operating systems that deal with Linux. 
Other than that, I have taken Linear Algebra and Calc 1 and 2. I am a Junior but technically a sophomore in the CS degree. 

Now onto the real questions, I have a resume, but I think I need to make a CS related resume to apply. I have work experience but none are CS or technology related. What do I put on my resume for the recruiters to notice or am I out of luck? 

I don't know if GPA is that important but after I got a low grade in Bio, I had to grind my way back up past 3. 
Current GPA: 3.1


TL;DR: Sophomore standing in CS degree. Looking for summer to apply for summer internships but need help building a cs related resume. GPA: 3.1, classes I have taken: C++, Discrete Structures, Data Structures, multi user operating systems, linear algebra, calc 1 and 2."
7dk77d,403,2017-11-17,No rehearsal dinner update yet... BUT - some backstory.,beenursie,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7dk77d/no_rehearsal_dinner_update_yet_but_some_backstory/,"So we have not met with FMIL and FFIL yet to discuss the rehearsal dinner. See BitchBot if that sentence makes no sense. However, I have a confession to make. This is not the first time I've posted about my FMIL. I posted a while ago under a pseudonym with a lot of details changed because I was afraid of the story being found. With that being said, I have been through a LOT with my F(uture)ILs. I decided to delete the other account and repost the stories for you with the (mostly) correct details so you can see just how deep the crazy goes. So with that being said, forgive me if you recognize elements of this story; I should have just posted it this way from the beginning.

On our first date, my FH told me that his mom could be kind of crazy and hard to handle. I shrugged it off, I've dealt with plenty of crazy in my life. Our first few meetings were totally fine, we got along fine and while she wasn't overtly warm and fuzzy to me, she tolerated me and treated me nicely enough. The first time I saw her claws was when FH was offered an incredible opportunity through school - a several month long internship across the country. At this point, FH and I had been together about six months, so the thought of going long distance was not super appealing to me. FMIL immediately went on the offensive, touting how important it would be for FH's schooling and how this was such a wonderful opportunity for him. I never asked FH not to take the internship - I actually encouraged it. I knew it would be an awesome experience for him and that if we were meant to be, it would work out. FH on the other hand struggled mightily with this decision and really waffled back and forth for a while. In the end, he agreed, and he decided to move across the country by himself.

All is well in the world for about five minutes. Thanksgiving is coming up, and FH gets a break to come home. This was our first holiday where we were a serious couple and we knew that we'd need to split it between my family and his. FMIL made it extremely clear that she needed to know if we were coming for dinner so that she would know how many to cook for. Because just cooking for her and FFIL vs. the four of us would change her plans SO much. So I told her that as soon as my family figured out our plans, I'd let her know. My family is NOT a scheduled plans kind of family - we fly by the seat of our pants constantly. With five very busy and different schedules and a very laid back matriarch, we've never been one for rock-solid foresight. FMIL asked continuously over the weeks prior to Thanksgiving. FH just kept telling her that our plans weren't set in stone but we would let her know as soon as they were.

We finally decided that we would eat dinner at FMIL's house and then go to spend time with my family afterward. Before FH could get in contact with her to tell her that, she texted him that 'he'd better figure it out soon or there wouldn't be place settings for us at their table'.

*record scratch*

Um. Excuse me?

I told him to tell her that in that case we would be spending the holiday with my family. That completely pulled the rug out from under her as I'm sure she expected me to beg to be included. Little did she know that I don't play those reindeer games. FH and I had a lovely dinner with my family while FMIL pouted with FFIL.

After dinner, FH (then spineless) began feeling guilty and said that he thought he really should get home to see his family. I walked him out to his car and he said 'I never realized holidays could be like that.' I looked at him and said 'Like what?' He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said 'Fun. No fighting. Everyone getting along. Like a family.' 

**Ya'll.** All I could do was hug him. It was my first true warning as to how fucked up the next several years were going to be - and BOY did they ever get fucked up. Your llamas are in for a wild ride and I WISH I could say that this shit was made up."

I'm the girl you go to when you want someone who worships you and is so happy for your attention, your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't care, glad that you have someone to take care of your less vanilla desires.

You have a young blonde girl in the city who wants to be that girl, maybe you met me when I was touring your office, an intern you saw a better position for, maybe you're a friend of my father's and you groomed me to be so sweet for you.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is.

Kinks: BDSM, spanking, anal, traditional gender roles, cheating, lactation play, older men

We are starting from the ground up here, so I am hoping that any of you might have suggestions or advice if you have gone through the same process.

Currently, I am recording the whole service, and editing it and cutting it out later. What is the best method to do this? Should I really only record the message, or is it best to record the whole service, and pick out what I should do later?

Should I publish these weekly, monthly, or in another sort of batch format? Is there any value in doing this? Is there anything I should be aware of, regarding the children's story time that would be recorded, and the choir? Should I receive permission from the guest speaker before uploading the service, or does their speaking already allow me to redistribute their message on our website?

Finally, Have you had any luck with trying to implement standard operating procedures? I am assuming that making podcasts of our service is going to completely depend on me, but if it is reasonable to train others to help me, that will be ideal.

:-:|
The Eagles won their bye within the division as all three of their divisional opponents suffered losses in week 10 while the Eagles took a much needed break to get healthy. Doug Pederson will try to use some of his mentor’s bye week magic to come out and get another win at AT&amp;T Stadium. Philadelphia is 5-4 at AT&amp;T Stadium, winning 3 of its last 4 games at the venue and they will look to improve upon that record on Sunday Night Football in Arlington. The Eagles are rode a 7 game win streak into the bye after dropping a 50 burger on the stout Denver defense and they will look to do the same against a Cowboys team that is on the ropes. Though the Eagles have lost some key players this season to injury they should get one back when cornerback Ronald Darby returns to action after being injured in week 1. The Cowboys are coming off a rough loss vs. the Falcons where Dak Prescott was sacked 8 times and the team struggled missing Ezekiel Elliott, Tyron Smith, Sean Lee and Dan Bailey. The Cowboys will be desperate for a win to keep their division hopes alive, a as a loss would all lock up the division for the Eagles pending an unlikely collapse. Two of the last three games against these teams have ended up in overtime, so I would expect some fireworks in this one.

The Eagles dominated every aspect of the game Wentz was 15 of 27 for 199 yards and 4 touchdowns and the Eagles added 197 and 3 TDs on the ground including a 44 yard rumble by Jay Ajayi who joined the Eagles earlier in the week in a trade from the Miami Dolphins. The defense did their part as well holding the Broncos rushing attack to just 35 yards and forcing Brock Osweiler into two interceptions while sacking him three times.  Overall a dominate performance by the Eagles.|  
**Cowboys** - [Video]( http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000876149/Cowboys-vs-Falcons-highlights-Week-10) –  The Cowboys struggled against the Falcons in their first game without Ezekiel Elliot as he serves his 6 game suspension. The Cowboys were also out All-Pro left tackle Tyron Smith and All-Pro Kicker Dan Bailey and lost Pro Bowl MLB Sean Lee in the first half. The Cowboys struggled block the Falcon’s pass rushers particularly DE Adrian Clayborn who sacked Dak Prescott 6 times on the day and the Falcons got him 8 times overall. The Cowboys defense also struggled without Sean Lee in the middle as Tevin Coleman was able to run for 83 yards and a TD and Matt Ryan tossed two more TDs as the Falcons dominated most of the day.|

**Stats to Know** |
:---|
**The Cowboys' Edge Defenders**|
[DeMarcus Lawrence has been playing lights-out in 2017. He's generated the 4th-most number of pressures (46) for Edge Defenders and has the 5th-best Pass Rush Productivity Score of them, too (14.4). In their last game, the Eagles game-planned around negating/mitigating Von Miller--who also primarily rushes from the left side--and it largely worked, despite him coming up with 5 pressures on the day. The trouble for the Cowboys could come if the Eagles are also able to slow/mitigate Lawrence's pass rush because their next best pass-rushing ED, Tyrone Crawford, ranks 67th in PRP and 45th in total pressures. For comparison, the Eagles, who heavily rotate their EDs--and sometimes use Graham at DT--spread the wealth, with the 4 primaries ranked 8th, 32nd, 35th, and 38th in pressures.

**Matchups to Watch** |
:---|
**Eagles Offensive Line vs. Cowboys Pass Rush**|
It wasn’t that long ago that the phrase “Cowboys Defensive Line” was actually referring to their defense of Greg Hardy. A few years later, their defensive line is actually playing quite good on an otherwise lackluster unit. They are led by Demarcus Lawrence, one of the leagues leaders in sacks, who almost exclusively lines up at LDE. Lawrence has posted a sack in nearly every game this season. The Cowboys defensive line also features David Irving, who returned from early season injury and has posted 6 sacks on the season. Irving is tall and has the length to keep opposing offensive linemen off him. This unit has done a lot of damage to opposing offenses and will be the key component in stopping the Eagles offense, especially since All Pro LB and Eagles killer Sean Lee will be missing this game. The Eagles offensive line has been one of the best units in football this season even without future Hall of Fame tackle Jason Peters. Lane Johnson has another tough task this weekend in Demarcus Lawrence. Fans should have a lot of faith in Lane to play well since he has neutralized virtually everyone he has gone up against this season. Irving is a tough matchup on the interior and will pose some issues throughout the game. If the Cowboys want to win they need to win this matchup considering Lee’s absence. The difference between the Cowboys defense with and without Lee is [appalling]( https://twitter.com/BrandonGowton/status/930198609966063617). The Eagles offense will look to further exploit that weakness.|
**Eagles Defensive Front vs. Cowboys Offensive Line**|
For a long time, we heard how great the Cowboys offensive line is. Under the microscope, in their first game without Zeke and future Hall of Famer Tyron Smith, the Cowboys offensive line collapsed on itself like a dying star. Cowboys’ replacement tackle Chaz Green went out on the field in Atlanta and made former Eagles tackle Winston Justice look like an All Pro. Keeping that offensive line together over the long term was always going to be a challenge considering Tyron, Frederick, and Martin are all among the tops at their positions and will require (and have required) sizeable investments in them for their services while remaining in good health for long stretches of their careers. Doug Free retired in the offseason and was replaced by their former guard La’el Collins. As of week 11, Collins ranks as PFFs 60th ranked right tackle. Last week, per NEXGEN stats, the Cowboys ran the ball almost exclusively to their right side, which is smart considering Collins is at least better than Chaz Green and Zach Martin is an All Pro. Left tackle, and really the entire left side of the Dallas offensive line without Tyron Smith, is a huge liability for the offense. As of today, the status of Tyron Smith for Sunday isn’t resolved, though he likely won’t play. Sunday presents a big challenge for Dallas as the Eagles have one of the best defensive fronts in the NFL from top to bottom. The Eagles are made in the trenches and are built to be able to combat what Dallas brings. The Cowboys coaching staff has to be able to adjust if Tyron Smith is out again. Zach Martin and Travis Frederick are as good as ever but they cannot carry the line without adjustments. The Eagles defensive line is full of game wreckers. How can Dallas combat this with the lack of real depth on their roster?|
**Dak Prescott vs. Eagles Defense**|
Ezekiel Elliott’s suspension will loom large again this week while Dallas figures out a way forward without last year’s rushing leader and fashion nobody. What everyone knew but what was finally understood last week was Elliott’s ability as a runner and pass blocker would surely be missed. The Dallas offensive line is one of the better run units in the league and Elliott is a load to bring down without litigation. He has excellent patience, vision, and strength in between the tackles and on stretch runs. He’s a true bell cow, 3 down back, whose absence really forces the Dallas coaching staff back to the drawing board. While he is not the best player on that offense – Tyron Smith is – his loss changes the effectiveness of the Cowboys offense. Now they have to rely on their second year signal caller, which did not go well last week. Make no mistake; regardless of who you think is better, Dak Prescott is a franchise QB. This isn’t to say he is flawless but he’s no scrub. Prescott is lethal in the running game, especially if the Cowboys are in the red zone. Additionally, he is a very good QB throwing on the run. The Cowboys would be wise to incorporate more read option looks and boots to try and slow down the Eagles pass rush and keep them off balance – especially if Tyron Smith is out. Cole Beasley hasn’t played to the level of last year’s production but is an effective receiver from the slot. They still have their stud CB and PBU leader Dez Bryant outside. And Jason Witten still somehow walks. While their offense has taken a step back some from last year’s pace, they Eagles still have a lot to game plan for. It’ll be up to the Eagles defense to play smart and contain Prescott. If the Eagles are up to the task, it could be a long night for Dallas.|
**Eagles Offense vs Cowboys Defense**|
The Eagles will march into Dallas with the 5th ranked offense per DVOA, 5th through the air and 10th on the ground. They will face a Dallas defense that is ranked 22nd per DVOA, 19th against the pass and 26th against the run… and this time it will be without Sean Lee. The Cowboys defense is an average at best unit with Mr. End the Talking Horse playing but drops off more quickly than Jaylon Smith’s foot when he is out of the lineup. Unfortunately for the Cowboys, this has been a vicious cycle with Lee throughout his career. Lee is excellent in run and pass defense and has made it habit to stomp the Eagles with his hooves when he plays. After Lee, the Cowboys will trot out Anthony Hitchens and the ghost of whatever Jaylon Smith used to be in college. Hitchens is currently PFFs 24th ranked LB. He is solid in run defense but is nowhere near as good as Lee is in coverage. The Cowboys will likely lean on second year but basically a rookie LB Jaylon Smith. Smith was a stud LB at Notre Dame and likely top 5 pick in the 2016 draft who suffered a major injury in his final college game. This dropped him into the second round where the Cowboys took a major gamble on him. So far, Smith has struggled to look like he belongs in the league, registering only a few bad ass tackles and generally being a liability on the field. He has had to overcome a lot just to see the field again for what is basically his rookie season. Time will tell if he improves. Right now, Cowboys fans must be nervous. Lastly, the Cowboys remade their entire starting secondary outside of second year CB Anthony Brown. The CBs have been decent as the season has gone on – they’ve certainly taken their share of L’s. Jourdan Lewis, one of the few Cowboys to ever win in court, avoiding a conviction, has had a solid rookie season at CB. The same could be said for fellow rookie Xavier Woods. The Cowboys will likely be without Safety Jeff Heath, much to the joy of Cowboys fans. Rookie Chidobe Awuzie may get the start alongside PFFs 43rd ranked Safety Byron Jones. Long story short, the Cowboys secondary has dropped off from last year’s average pace when 3/4ths of their starters walked in free agency. Additionally, their run defense is very weak. Enter the Eagles, who have a diverse offensive scheme that is difficult to game plan for and can beat you in many ways. Lead by MVP Front Runner and the best QB of the 2016 NFL Draft Class Carson Wentz, the Eagles will look to establish dominance over a young and struggling defensive unit. The Eagles won’t take this match up for granted and neither will the Cowboys. This is a huge rivalry game that could effectively end the NFC East race should the Eagles win. The Eagles offense has a number of match up advantages against the Cowboys defense in this game that may likely prove to be too much, especially considering the Eagles have put up at least 20 points in every game this season.|

7dlrbg,20,2017-11-17,Job Satisfaction as an ENFP,ashley34,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/7dlrbg/job_satisfaction_as_an_enfp/,"Hello!  I'm new to this sub, but I'm obsessed with Myers Briggs, so now that I know this exists, this will be a lot of fun.

I'm pretty much in the middle of E and I, so I read about INFPs and ENFPs, and ENFP sounds much more like me.  I also have some social anxiety, so I'm probably less outgoing than most ENFPs.  I'm a very strong N and F, and I'm a moderate P.

I spend a lot of time thinking about my career, the way society thinks about careers, etc.  I've never had a job I liked except for my unpaid internship at an arts council.  I loved the artistic atmosphere, and I loved that I was working for a cause I believed in instead of just making a company money.  I've been out of college for 2.5 years, and I've had two full time jobs since then.  I first worked as an editor at a pharmaceutical company, and now I'm in marketing for an engineering firm.  I'm actually not interested in STEM at all, but I somehow keep ending up in STEM fields.  I first majored in music therapy and then switched my major to English.  I knew I would probably never make a lot of money with either of those options, but I did it anyways because I cared more about liking my job than making a lot of money.  Unfortunately, that didn't work out, and I neither like my job nor make a lot of money.  It's boring, and I don't care about making money for a business.  I'd love to work in non-profit again, preferably doing something at least somewhat creative, but non-profit jobs are actually really hard to get.

It seems like most people don't think the same way as I do when it comes to careers.  I'm always questioning the fundamental career system in America and wondering how I can make a better life for myself, whereas most people seem content to work and make money.  Other people will tell me it's not supposed to be fun and that's why it's called work, and I get that, but 40 hours a week is too much of my life to spend on something I hate.  I sometimes feel like something is wrong with me because I'm so unsatisfied with just going to work and making money.

I’ve started wondering if maybe this relates to my personality type.  Most people are an S, so it would make sense that being an N could make me think differently about this than other people.  Are there other NFs out there who feel similarly?"

7dm5cu,12,2017-11-17,HuffPo: Women On Clinton And Sanders Campaigns Allege Sexual Harassment,HootHootBerns,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/7dm5cu/huffpo_women_on_clinton_and_sanders_campaigns/,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-campaign-sexual-harassment_us_5a0dfdf2e4b045cf43705417?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

&gt;Lilian Adams and Zoey Jordan Salsbury were teenagers when they started working on opposite sides of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Adams, then 19, joined Hillary Clinton’s campaign and Salsbury, then 18, joined Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign. They were ready to make the world a better place by helping to elect their candidate.

&gt;But each woman says she was sexually harassed by a fellow campaign worker — and that both campaigns were ill-equipped to address the allegations. Their stories show how political campaigns can prey on the same young people who power them with their work and energy.

&gt;Even as Adams and Salsbury came forward to tell their stories, each requested that her alleged harasser not be named, citing safety and professional concerns.

At first seems to tell a fair tale. But then things get a bit...iffy.

&gt;Salsbury did hear from the Sanders campaign after she posted about the incident this month on social media. A former digital media manager reached out to her this past weekend, she said, and on Monday, a Seattle-based lawyer named Bernice Johnson Blessing called her on behalf of the campaign. “It firmly felt like the kind of call you make when you’re trying to feel out if someone has the interest and/or standing to bring a lawsuit,” said Salsbury.

&gt;The conversation with the lawyer made her uncomfortable. “It felt like I was being blamed,” she said. She suspects that Sanders plans to run for president again in 2020 and “they’re afraid of me being a roadblock to that.” Blessing did not return a request for comment.

From here they go out of their way to point out ""this isn't the first time for Bernie's campaign"" and cite the Carmona drama. 

&gt;In a statement to HuffPost, Sen. Sanders was adamant that he does “not tolerate sexual harassment” in his Senate office or on his campaigns. “It is critical we listen to those sharing their stories, recognize no workplace is immune from these problems, and address them in a serious manner,” he added.

&gt;Sanders’ office told HuffPost that while his presidential campaign employees and interns would have been provided with a handbook detailing the process for reporting harassment, volunteers were not given that information. It’s a policy that they plan to change in the future.

Makes sure to close that the Hillary volunteer doesn't blame Clinton, but they're soured on electoral politics."
7dma3n,76,2017-11-17,$16k Brunch Wedding (+ Honeymoon + Rings) Budget Breakdown,mmouseyy,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/7dma3n/16k_brunch_wedding_honeymoon_rings_budget/,"First and foremost, THANK YOU ALL! This sub was my refuge during planning. I hope this breakdown is helpful to someone!  
Warning: long. Pictures at the end. Hubby asked that I leave out vendor names; PM me if you want more info. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Our brunch wedding was on Sunday, September 24, 2017 in Columbus, OH, USA. The most reoccurring compliment we got was how the wedding felt very ‘us’ and very much like a celebration of love rather than an excuse to party. So, success!

&amp;nbsp;

**RSVP Breakdown/Guest List details**  
Invited Guests: 128  
RSVP'd yes: 70  
Guests that showed: 68  
Total guest count (including us &amp; vendors): 74  
Kids breakdown: 2 babies, 2 toddlers, 3 tweens  

I estimated roughly 85% of the invited guests would have to travel and stay overnight. We also invited many children that ultimately didn’t come, so that, plus the distance accounts for many of the ‘no’ RSVPs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Budget Breakdown** (all costs include taxes, fees and gratuity, if applicable)  
Planned Budget: Initially 10k, then we bumped up to 15k once we realized how much things cost

&amp;nbsp;

**All inclusive venue** ($2,664): That cost includes the space for our ceremony and reception (8 hours total, including set-up and tear-down), all chairs, linens, flatware/dishes, labor, and a catering manager who assists with all day-of logistics. I cannot say enough about how much I loved our venue. The staff was incredible and working with them was so stress free. Our wedding was on a Sunday, which meant the food/drink minimum was 10x lower than Saturday (that is the literal figure, not an exaggeration).  

**Food** ($2,094): The catering company owns the venue, so, again, it was amazing. We had passed apps and 2 stations during cocktail hour. For brunch, we had a buffet. Everyone we talked to loved the food and inevitably brought up the buffalo chicken dip (app) or maple french toast &amp; cream cheese bake (“entree”).  

**Open Bar** ($1,550): Included a selection of 3 beers, 2 wines, mimosas, coffees and juices for cocktail hour and reception. We paid for the bar by consumption. Perk of a brunch wedding: people generally don’t get trashed.  
The coffee was actually a day-of decision; apparently a few people asked at the bar so the catering manager approached us during pictures to ask if it was okay. We’re not coffee drinkers, so we didn’t even think to add it originally.  

**Wedding Cake** ($97): The cost includes one round two-layer cutting cake, a two-layer sheet cake (cut in the back and served), and delivery. Multiple people told us it was the best wedding cake they’ve ever had. No one believed me when I said it was grocery store cake!  

**Flowers** ($50): My sister and I went to the farmer’s market the day before the wedding to create our bouquets. Unfortunately, those flowers died overnight. My amazing best friend got her equally amazing FH to go out at 7:30 a.m. and get new flowers (which she paid for). My wonderful cousin then made them into bouquets. We did not have any other flowers.  

**Photography** ($1350): This was for about 4.5 hours of coverage (first look, ceremony, family portraits and ⅔ of the reception). Our photographer made us feel totally comfortable and really bought into our vision of wanting to capture people and emotions above all. 2 days before the wedding she contacted us to let us know that she recently hired an intern who wanted wedding experience and asked if he could be a 2nd shooter at no cost. Um, of course! He was also great to work with. Bonus: we got our sneak peeks at 7 a.m. the following morning.  

**Photo Booth** ($549): This was a not-budgeted-for splurge after I got an unexpected bonus at work. The booth came with the option to print, email and/or text the photos, which was super convenient. It also created GIFs and Boomerangs, which was a big hit. We received a link to the online gallery the day following the wedding, and I still love looking at it.  

**DJ** ($500): includes ceremony music, cocktail hour and reception as well as MCing. Granted, we did not do a first dance, garter toss, bouquet toss or any other organized things (just announcement of the couple and toasts) so the MCing was limited. People typically worry about dancing at brunch weddings, but our crowd danced once we started dancing! The DJ was good at reading the floor and seamlessly incorporated our “must play” list. The only hiccup is that our friend/DOC and my cousin pulled a prank where they told him I requested a specific last dance because it was my favorite song. “Back that Azz Up” by Juvenile. That is correct folks, one day I will have to tell my future children that was our last dance.  

**Bride's Attire** ($878):  Includes David’s Bridal dress/veil/jewelry, alterations (not at David’s), a hair comb I never ended up wearing, welcome party dress that I didn’t wear, getting ready romper from TJMaxx, Rent the Runway dress for post-wedding activities (since we were done by 3 p.m.), and Bagdley Mischka shoes from BHLDN.  

**Hair** ($80) and **makeup** ($340 for 3 people): Unfortunately, I was stuck with the bill for my MOH (sister) and reader (best friend)’s makeup after my mom decided not to come to my wedding (the MUA had a 3 person minimum for weddings). Fortunately, the 3 of us looked gorgeous!  

**Groom's Attire** ($675): Suit, shirt and alterations from Pursuit (HIGHLY recommend for central Ohio peeps), Kenneth Cole shoes and belt from DSW, tie from Burlington Coat Factory, tie pin, faux boutonnière and watch from Amazon.

**Wedding Rings** ($967): I discussed our BOGO Free luck in a previous post. I am not sure about the specific amount my husband spent on my [e-ring](https://imgur.com/FTApIlf), so that is not included.  

**Decor** ($175): Includes centerpieces, card box, table numbers, signage, easels, geometric photo frame, picture printing, and faux flower petals for the aisle. I had a large collection of votives and pebbles in my possession already, so that was a large cost saver. I painted the gold lacquer around the glasses to jazz it up a bit.  

**Stationery** ($119): My mother insisted on paper STDs that we eventually got during a Vistaprint sale. Those, along with postage, thank you cards, 10 paper copies of our invites (in addition to our Paperless Post e-vites), and a self-inking return stamp make up the cost.  

**Gifts** ($108): I got the MOH a cute robe and wrote her a heartfelt card. My husband got the BM a grilling apron and custom beer mug along with a card. We got the groom’s family thank you gift cards for throwing us a welcome party, and I got my best friend a custom necklace for doing the reading.  

**Officiant** ($130 for rehearsal and ceremony): We had a quick (15 min) secular ceremony. He kept it brief, yet meaningful. We both wrote our own vows, which many people said was the highlight of the day. It was definitely our favorite part! Also, the officiant had our license back to the court within 3 days, which was great. In hindsight we didn’t need him for the rehearsal, so we could have saved $50 there, but it didn’t hurt so *shrugs.  

**Marriage License** ($67): The woman at the courthouse told us that 2 of the 3 licenses from the court were for scrapbooking or keepsakes. She neglected to say that one of them needed to be reviewed by the officiant before it becomes a keepsake. So, we had to bring it to the officiant’s office the following day before he could send the license back. Annoying, but this, the flowers and a small fire were the only things that went wrong, so it’s all good!  

**Airbnb** ($291): for 2 nights. This was one of our best decisions! I stayed there with my sister before the wedding and my husband and I stayed there the night of. The Airbnb was only a 5 minute walk to our venue, which allowed me A LOT more getting ready time. Crucial for a morning wedding. The hosts were very sweet and left us Prosecco for our wedding night.  

**Registry** ($30): We had a honeymoon fund and small traditional registry hosted on Thankful. Super easy to use, and it doesn’t take fees from your money transactions!  

**Website** ($0): We used Wix. It takes a little more time and can be clunky, but it was worth it for us to do it for free. I really liked our website layout and functionality.  

**Day of Coordinator** ($0): A good friend of ours offered to coordinate as a wedding gift. I gave him all of my spreadsheets, schedules, scripts, etc. and we met with him twice in the month leading up to the wedding. He, along with the catering manager, handled everything on the big day. The wedding flowed seamlessly, and we ran on time the whole day!  

**Family Welcome BBQ** ($0): My husband’s local family generously hosted this for us at their home the night before. It was a great way to spend extra time with our families  

**Honeymoon** ($3086): We took the day after the wedding for a breather and then spent 5 days in New Orleans. 2 weeks later, we spent 3 days in Washington D.C. Both were so. much. fun. I’ve been to NOLA numerous times, but it was my husband’s first time there. We ate, did tours, drank, shopped, explored, caught up on sleep, and ate some more. A large part of the affordability of this trip is that we booked our lovely bed and breakfast during a website glitch that listed our room with 3 nights free. In D.C. we visited friends, saw the monuments and went to the National Museum of African American History and Culture twice. The cost includes airfare, hotel and all other honeymoon expenses (including minimal shopping) as well as the dinner we had on the night of our wedding.

&amp;nbsp;

**Total Cost:** $15,857

**Total Out of Pocket Cost:** $12,440  
We fully expected to pay for everything on our own, so the assistance was very much a surprise. Prior to deciding not to come, my mother gifted us money to go toward catering and the STDs. My grandmother paid for my dress and veil, and my cousin covered my makeup/mua gratuity as a wedding gift.

&amp;nbsp;

**Takeaways:**

* Bring all of the paperwork you get from getting your marriage license, just in case.
* Make sure children know not to throw their napkins onto lit candles. We had a small fire I didn't learn about until later
* If you’re on a budget, take a lot of time to do research. I probably looked at over 20 officiants before I found one that was $80
* Look for sales, coupons, and ways to thrift or re-purpose
* Brunch weddings are awesome  
* I have LOTS of advice about wedding planning now :)

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

7dmecs,15,2017-11-17,Losing Hope,bootythebat,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/7dmecs/losing_hope/,"Hey everyone.

So i’ve just received both my rejection letters for a summer internship from the two majors that I️ interviewed with. I️’m currently in my 4th year studying geophysics at a major oil school in Texas (if that even matters), and I️ will graduate in the Fall of 2018. 

I️ really don’t know what to do. I️ can’t see myself going to grad school because my GPA is garbage (~3.0) and I can’t see myself studying another 3 years of geophysics. I️ also don’t see myself being able to land a job out of school without having an internship under my belt. 

The only thing I️ can think of is that I️ enjoy programming, but i’m not even close to the level of what the comp sci majors are at. I have been taking a few comp sci classes here and there just to see if I enjoy it and I have so far.

I’ve thought of doing a programming boot camp after I graduate but I️ just feel like that would put my geophysics degree to waste. I️ want to do something that can at least somewhat relate to my major, even if it’s just a data analyst job.

I️ guess another passion of mine is investing. But without a business degree it is quite hard to get into that market.

Anyways, I️ just feel like I️ shouldn’t have chose geophysics as my major and I’m just confused as to what to do now.

Any words of encouragement or help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks guys."

I have Asperger's, so it can be hard for me to know what is ""expected"" in situations like this, but I imagine many people out of college also don't really know what to expect.

I have some prior internship experience, and my friend referred me to her company. I dropped out of the internship because I had too much schoolwork, and they weren't too happy about it. I honestly figured I had just lost the job, even though I did get along well with them and the work. 

Fast-forward to just now, I got a text message from the hiring manager for the position (company does not use recruiters like most do). She asked me to call her, so I did. She said they want to offer me $60,000/yr salary + full benefits. The company by default provides the standard things (matching 401k, etc) but oddly seems to supply bonuses in the form of health savings (also has very good health/dental/vision/rx insurance for low prices comparatively). They give employees $2,000 - $3,000 to pay towards copays/rx/etc yearly, on a ""use it or lose it"" basis. This would be perfect for me because I see a psychiatrist who doesn't take insurance, which will cost me about that much per year.

I was jerked around a bit in the beginning, and their expectations confuse me sometimes. I also felt that the salary (might?) be a bit low, but it's in rural VA and not a big metro area with a high cost of living. 

I need help deciding on what to do at this point. I know it's important to get a good starting salary because promotion rates are based on this, but I also don't want to negotiate myself out of the position."

I feel like I'm stuck in a sunk-cost fallacy because I feel like if I make a major transition, I'll struggle to pay my mortgage because of low pay and I'm behind the game for those who got in before me and I may never catch up. 

I enjoy programming and IT, but I don't think my personality is really ever going to be utilized in there, except for maybe in management, but even then, I want to feel like I am reaching out to others, and I don't know who much I can do that in the tech industry.

I've been advised many times to go into radio and politics/lobbying by people in and out of those industries who know me, but I'm afraid they either aren't too serious or I may not do well. I'm in a stable job right now, but it's incredibly mundane and frustrating because I don't have the power to change anything for the better or reach out and improve what I see as a society in trouble.

They tried to help, but they were both lost and I couldn't wait for them because of our deadline.

Everyone felt happy about it and I smiled alongside them, but deep down I really didn't want to do it, but I feel like I had to stand out because of how competitive it is to get a job/inte. At the same time I picked up another project not related to school because it reflects well on my resume and was good for experience, but I ended up working with the same person who was clueless once again. He still tried and wants to try but we had a deadline again and I couldn't wait around for him. On top of all this I was applying to internships.

First time poster, long time lurker. 

I have my first industry interview coming up and I somehow managed to pull off a hail mary. I'm 30, recently quit my job in management to go back to school for CS.

I'm a first year Student who has been self-learning for the past 2 years. I've been developing a JavaScript app for going on a year and a half in my spare time, it's fairly complex and has required several rebuilds and refactorings. It uses node, express and socket, the project has taught me a ton about coding, and thinking like a developer. In addition to that I've completed a large amount of the code school curriculum, learned a bit of VBA for Excel scripts that were deployed at work and toyed with Python. 
In school I've built a couple Java projects, but found most of the work to be easy and require minimal effort, and my professors and TA's have noted i'm ahead of the curve. 

Prior to moving away for school I researched businesses in the area where I could apply for part time work because I need some type of an income and I can definitely manage the workload. I found a company that is in the same domain I previously worked in, but also hires developers. I sent out a resume in the hopes that they'd be interested in bringing me into a lower level position and hopefully transition that into a summer software internship after I completed my first year. 

They contacted me pretty quickly and after a brief exchange, set up an interview for a position within their software team where I would be working with a language I've never done more then read about. I've already started codeschool tutorials, and I plan on trying to knock out some small projects over the weekend. They sent me somethings we're going to likely talk about during the interview. 

What can I do to show that despite my early stage of schooling and my time limitations during the school year I will be able to pivot my domain knowledge, ability to self learn (I worked my way into management at my previous job by learning things on the fly and developing skills to move into the next open position) and passion for development into being a productive intern able to contribute to the team, as well as to the company's success?

I've been lurking this sub a while and still don't really have a clue what I'm really doing as far as finances. This is gonna be long but I'm trying to give as much info as possible before I get into where I need help.

I am 21 years old, about to graduate from undergrad and go straight into graduate school (if things work out right). I have about 15k in student loans from undergrad, and will add about 13-15k more from graduate school. 

I do not have help from my parents aside from health insurance from my dad which I can keep until my boyfriend and I get married and i switch to his. My car insurance and phone bill are both in my mom's name, and I pay her, but I'm trying to make that change as soon as possible so I can limit communication with my mom as much as possible (very abusive situation growing up). 

My boyfriend is an RN. We are currently living with his parents until I at least finish graduate school, but hopefully he will be finishing up his BSN and on his way to getting his nurse practitioners by the time I am done with my masters. 

He currently makes around 50k, or about 3k every month after taxes. He does not have any kind of credit built up, but we have around 4K in his savings. I have no job currently because it was causing extreme stress between work and the course load I'm taking, plus my internship starts in January and will be a full time work experience, and I have about a 530 credit score due to the loans I've taken out for undergrad - from my understanding I will not have to pay them as long as I'm still in school and then I'll have a 9 month grace period before I'll have to start repaying them. I'm not against getting a job, I love working - I just had to take a break for my mental health. I also have monthly medical bills bc I see a counselor at least every two weeks and have to see my med management person at least once a month.

We are trying to save for a ring, a wedding, my boyfriend is wanting to replace his 08 Civic in March with a 2017 WRX - my '15 fiat is technically paid for but we pay his grandparents 250 every month bc they gave us the cash to buy it outright, and we are also wanting to move out of his parents house when I finish graduate school, which will hopefully be in the summer of 2019. 

I am not sure how to work towards any of this, and his financial skills are even less than mine when it comes to budgeting and everything. He's good with saving but we're both pretty clueless otherwise. He has been able to get a credit card through his bank with a low limit to start gaining credit. I am wondering if I should try to do the same and get one in my name so I can start building my credit as well. I have been getting pre-approved card advertisements in the mail since I took out my student loans and I'm wondering if there's any merit in getting one. His parents are willing to cosign on things with us (his parents have perfect credit) but I just don't know if we're taking on too much. 

TL;DR - trying to get a joint phone plan &amp; car insurance plan set up with my FH, he's planning a new car purchase in march, we are paying 250 each month to his grandparents for my car,  and i typically have like 200ish in medical bills every month, by 2019 I will have roughly 30k in student loans, we're trying to save for a ring, a wedding, and possibly a house, and I'm trying to decide about applying for a credit card to build my credit bc he is getting one to build his. We have roughly 50k a year rn or 3k a month. That will probably double or triple after I get out of graduate school in 2019 and he finishes his bsn. I am just completely lost on how to start doing any of this. 
I grew up in a very poor household where money was extremely mismanaged so it's very hard for me to have this amount of money to handle and so many things to figure out financially.

Or am I just overreacting?,amicrazythowaway,Hijabis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/7dodrs/how_to_deal_with_parents_that_treat_me_badly_or/,"I am a 21 year old college-going female who still lives with her family. My parents constantly put me down, calling me lazy, entitled, selfish, a loser, a ""fucking bitch"", asshole, whore, telling me that I will have a miserable life and that I deserve it, etc. Oftentimes, it seems like they get angry with me for no good reason.

For example, one time I was giving them directions to drive me somewhere (we were all in the car together). I told them that the destination was on a particular road, and suggested that they exit off the highway on that road. We get off on that road and find that an accident has occurred, causing a traffic jam that we spent an additional 15 minutes stuck in. They spent the entire time screaming with me about how I am a, ""good-for-nothing brat"" and a ""selfish idiot"", and that people in the ""real world"" will ""kick my ass"". Just because I suggest that they exit on that road. They were pretty much blaming me for the fact that we got caught up in this traffic jam. The thing is, I had no idea that the traffic was going to be like this. They spoke as if I intentionally sabotaged their plans or something.

Another time, my mom came home from work and started yelling at me about how I should start cleaning up the house for a dinner party we were to be hosting at our house, just as I was about to head out to school. I respectfully reminded her that the party was still one whole week away and that I have a lot of assignments to finish before then, but that I will help clean and cook when I finish them. My mom then started screaming about how I never do anything in the house at all (absolutely not true), that I am a ""fucking bitch"" who does nothing, etc. Also, at the time I was wearing natural makeup, jeans, and a tank top with a full-sleeve cardigan over it (I also don't wear hijab). In the midst of this ""cleaning the house"" argument, my mom started going on about how I dress, and she lunged at me to pull off my cardigan to expose the fact that I was wearing a tank-top underneath, telling me that I'm basically slut who is desperate for male attention. I was late for class at that point, and started walking out to head for school, and I heard her yelling, ""Karma will get you back! Let's see if you get a husband dressed like that! No man will want to marry a slutty, lazy girl like you!"" Mind you, I am a virgin and have never held hands with a guy even, so I thought that was pretty rich. My mom also curses me often, telling me that I will be miserable and that I will ""get what is coming for me"", as if her saying those things will seal my fate. She also casually throws terms such as ""dumb, fucking bitch"" at me when she is clearly mad about something else in her life, and tells me that during salah she prays to Allah that I get a daughter ""like me"", clearly intending to curse me.

My dad is also extremely controlling. He doesn't let me out of the house past 5 pm, even to go out to eat with some friends (a very innocent activity), stating, ""No unmarried girl from a decent family does that,"" as his justification (even though we live in the US, and have done so for over 20 years). I get stressed when my friends have any sort of event, because I know that simply being able to go out for a couple of hours leads to yelling match between me and my dad (and sometimes they have turned physical with him pushing me or yanking my arm). I often find myself lying to him these days, stating I am going to my school's library to study when really I am going to those events. Other Muslim girls I know don't have this problem. He also scolds me for not acting like an adult, all the while placing restrictions on me that most other people my age do not have (such as a 5 PM curfew). Also, one time, during an argument about me wearing makeup, he screamed, ""Guys will just cum inside of you and leave you!"" which was disgusting to hear from a parent.

I also don't feel like I can be open and honest with my parents. I have been struggling with depression, and it is causing me to struggle in my classes. Whenever I have tried to open a dialog about this with them, they get insanely angry with me, telling me that I am a ""loser who will never do anything in life"", they threaten to marry me off as soon as a finish my degree, that I am nothing but a leech upon the family, that I am making things up, etc. The worst thing they have told me however, is that I am a burden upon the family (and they say it often, but never towards my other siblings). I don't know why, but that comment gets to me more than the other ones do. They also tell me that when I go out into the real world, everyone will hate me and that I will come crawling back to them, because apparently I don't have the skills to navigate the ""real world"". Mind you, I have held several leadership positions, published a my own research work, got the chance to present my work at a conference, have gotten top scores on a standardized test for professional school admissions, completed prestigious internships, have lots of amazing friends, etc.

Now I am not sitting here pretending to be a perfect daughter either. I can be very cold, standoffish, stubborn, and talk back to my parents when their words and actions get to be too much (though for the most part I try to keep my voice down and keep my cool during these situations, and I can confidently say I do try my best to be a good person). I avoid them a lot too, which I know hurts them, but I find that it is the only way I can find some peace mentally. I am at the point where even when classes finish, I actively schedule my day in a way that I get home after they fall asleep. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells while interacting with them, like if I utter the wrong thing then everything will come crashing down. I also began to use my school's therapist services, because I don't feel like I can rely on my parents for any support and help. I am constantly afraid of showing my face to my parents, because they often have something to criticize about my appearance (not to humblebrag, but I am considered very attractive, and I don't have to do too much with my appearance to look ""good""), calling me ""desperate for male attention"" when I simply wear some mascara and a top and pants that fit me well. I would say that the clothes I wear are modest, and the makeup I wear is natural too.

I am in the process of looking for a job so that I can get more independence. But my question is, am I overreacting? I often worry that I actually am selfish, lazy, ungrateful, etc. and that I deserve to hear those things from my parents because I am intrinsically horrible. :( How can I deal with this? I feel so stuck, but then I feel so guilty too because as they often point out, they have done so much for me and parents have a high status in Islam. And we have definitely had lots of good times and conversations too, but the things I mention above seem to outweigh the good in my mind. Sorry if anything seemed incoherent btw; I have just been so upset lately I kind of just poured everything out that came to mind."
7domp4,1,2017-11-17,Big N vs Unicorn Internship,90ccc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7domp4/big_n_vs_unicorn_internship/,"Have a few offers (a) big N, (b) unicorn, and (c) a almost unicorn (a few mils below). 

Mostly deciding between (a) and (b) since compensation are significantly higher than (c). (b) is a relatively new unicorn, about a year or so. Also (a) is 12 weeks, (b) is 10.

Salary/stipend and living expenses are basically the same at (a) and (b). 

Has anyone had similar experience in this position between a largerish more well known company and a smaller company that (maybe) might do more interesting work? Will be doing something back-end related on a team at the big N and no idea for the team on the unicorn (not a lot of information), likely data infrastructure/pipeline stuff. Deadline is coming up so I don't have a lot of time to investigate, especially with exams too. Python is a constant between them (meh mostly). Talent/engineering from the unicorn seems pretty strong anyway, looking at linkedin's... they recruit a lot from ivies etc though obviously both teams are great.

Another consideration is fulltime offers and re-recruiting. I will probably rerecruit next cycle for intern/fulltime so I was thinking the big N might help more in terms of recognition? In addition, I feel the internship experience and mentorship is more consistent and better at a more established company. More events with a largest intern class etc, bootcamp. 

Fulltime compensation in terms of salary from the unicorn seems at least as good as the big N (from h1bdata.info) how risky are RSUs and stock options from late stage startups? 

Deferring one to the fall or something is also not an option since I have to take this one liberal arts course for graduation thats only offered in the Fall, and need to graduate on-time or early-admit for MEng. 

Any points I should consider more or thoughts?

Also, how do companies generally respond when you turn them down and then apply again next cycle? Fast tracked?"

GMAT: 650 (retaking on Dec 30 but it's my 4th take (not public. Only score I accepted) so doubt my chances)

GPA: 2.67 in Business and Economics. Bombed my 1st year real bad. Combo of getting sick, not being ready (terrible HS), partying. Got better my 2nd and 3rd years. Then took Accounting and started to get worse. Initially was fine but I started hating my classes. Liked Marketing way more and switched (but incurred a F that I should have resigned) My last year I focused on my internship which I was hoping would lead to a FT job (it didn't...just remained PT). Was a 25/hr commitment and sometimes conflicted with classes.

Worked 5 years in Digital Marketing. Currently the lead at a startup for 1 sect of Digital Marketing. I'm highly specialized, however, and would need to transition one way or another or be stuck in my specific type of function.

Volunteer: Tutor/Mentoring occasionally at Board of Ed (ya its spotty and lame)

EC's in college: 5 leadership positions, 9 total club involvement, 2 volunteering commitments, 3 internships (and another a PT job)

Post grad goals, I'm dead set on Brand Management for a top CPG (P&amp;G, General Mills, Nestle) and building my career LT at that company. Plus, I want to use my connections from my MBA to start an educational non profit. Akin to Khan Academy but more focused on giving kids insights into careers in a fun way so they can figure out what they want to do in life, and know how to get there. I need influence and connections in order to achieve it from a wide range of fields of individuals open to submitting content (which would be edited obviously). In other words, I'm too much of an ordinary pleb to do this now.

I'm not trying to get into anything fancy. I get that my stats ain't up to par. I toured a bunch of schools a few weeks ago and liked the smaller programs far more than the bigger ones. I'm also applying via the Consortium for my first 4-6 apps. 

Gonna be applying in stages:
First Wave (Jan 5th)
Consortium (Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Cornell, Emory, UCLA or Berkley)
+ Rochester (non Consortium)

Second Wave (throughout Jan)

I made it my life goal in starting my MBA this year.

So...what do you guys think? Do you think I have at least a shot with 1 of these schools? Is it possible to get rejected by EVERY school? My primary schools are Indiana, Wisconsin, Kellogg, and Cornell. Everything else is essentially a Plan B, and the March ones are a Plan C."

So, I’ve graduated a few months ago with a BA in Advertising and it turned out I don’t really like advertising. I’ve did some internships during my studies and I couldn’t find a job in the industry after that. 

I’m now working part-time as a sales assistant for a company that sells luxury stuff and it’s not that bad. I mean, I’ve good colleagues and I get some money in commissions on top of my standard salary, by it’s not definitely my kind of job (I’m a shy person and to do good costumer service you can’t be shy).

I’ve always wanted to work in the movie industry but I’ve never done anything in that regard so far. I feel like I still don’t know what my real passion is and I feel like I’ll have to try many different things before finding it.

I’ve took this part-time job so that I could have 4 days per week to work on my personal projects, but it’s been a month and a half and I haven’t done anything at the moment. I’ve a good contract with this company because I can ask to work more whenever I like, but I’m not compelled to work more than 3 days per week.

I’m 26 years old and I feel like I’ll never be able to find my passion and have a job that I really love. Also, I still don’t know when I’ll be able to buy a house, a car and raise a family with my girlfriend.

What should I do?

Thank you!

I just wanted someone with experience there to clear my mind up on how it was for you working there. Would it be the right spot for me? These are some questions I have in mind.

1.What perks do you receive if you are promoted? Or not promoted?

2.How is the work environment there in general?

3.Do you feel comfortable there, are you happy, would you recommend it?

4.Why did you work at Enterprise to begin with, do you think there would be better off options?

5.This is a general question about any job, but as workers or employees do you expect anything out of the company?

6.Another thing is I want to grow professionally throughout my life, does this company give you the chance to grow?

7.If you could change one thing about the company, what would it be?


You don't have to answer all these questions, just a general feel would be fine but answering the questions would help me alot.

I turn 24 on Monday and I am going upstate to meet up with my friends to have a nice calm weekend for my birthday. We can't do any partying because I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer a couple of months back and just recently had surgery on Friday to have it removed so I can't drink and I'm taking things easy. The problem is that I've been so frustrated and overwhelmed with multiple doctors appointments plus balancing work and school and internship and i've been too busy to acknowledge the news.

Well today my boyfriend was supposed to make it here at around 4:30 (It's a 1.3hr drive up) and we all had reservations to go to dinner at 9pm. Well he ends up having to stay late at work and texts me at 5 saying he is leaving soon. At 5:20 he tells me he is heading out. At 6:30 he tells me he just got home (with traffic it'll take him an hour to get to me). So I texted my best friend, put on some sweats and got out of my nice outfit and took off my makeup and told her to cancel the dinner reservations because we won't make it there on time. By the time we get there it'll be 9-10pm. I'll have spent my whole Friday basically waiting for him to get here.
 
I know it's not entirely his fault. I'm just so upset that I started crying. I just feel like all I wanted after a week of painful recovery was to relax with my friends. I wanted to be upstate earlier to spend more time with them. All I wanted was to dress up and feel pretty with this huge scar on my neck and go to a fancy dinner. I just feel like everything that has been happening the past few months is catching up to me and I'm breaking down, I just wanted today to go right. He'll be here in an hour and I don't want to be angry at him even though I kind of am. But I don't know how I'll be able to handle this car ride when I'm so upset. I know it sounds silly, its such a small thing... missing dinner, but I think it's just the weight of all the frustration and difficulties these past months is crashing down on me. 

Update; I’m an hour into a silent car ride. I tried to address why I was upset and he kind of blew me off saying that he couldn’t help it because he had Work. I don’t think he said it maliciously I think he just doesn’t understand why I’m upset and at this point I’m kind of too aggravated to explain myself so I just went quiet and we haven’t spoken the whole car ride. Thank you guys for the responses so far I appreciate it. "

I took a drug test to get an internship last June and passed it. The company hires interns and temps through the temp agency Aerotek.

I got asked to come back for a couple weeks over Christmas break, so I stopped getting high on the 1st of Nov. just in case I'll have to re-take a urine test.

The problem is, as someone with chest pain from anxiety and stress, it's been tough. I don't want to make it seem like I'm just a pot-head (like my friends seem to think), but that I get high to help wind down after stressful days.
And it's been one off those weeks where getting high would be quite nice. Just found out I have Coeliac disease so I'm worried about what that might entail. Also, getting my first surgery ever on my scrotum in a couple weeks. I've had a lot of tests/assignments the last couple weeks as well. And my close uncle is getting brain surgery this weekend too. 

Do you guys think I will be asked to get a drug test? At first I thought I'll definitely have to take one, but I was told that I won't have to give the company my bank information again. Also, it's the same calendar year so I think I might not have to re-take it, considering it's been less than 4 months since I stopped working for them from the summer.


Thanks guys.

7dpatv,1,2017-11-17,How do I deal with non technical people without coming off as insulting or condescending?,corbinthecoder,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7dpatv/how_do_i_deal_with_non_technical_people_without/,"Just a little story to explain what I'm going through. 

Currently I am trying to obtain a grant by my local government to finish up a startup project. I went to the government building, spoke with the grant committee head, let's call her Carol,  showed Carol my project, and everything was spoken about like I was going to get funding for my project. 

Flash to the next week, I make an appointment with Carol and she moves me to another person, We'll call him Bill, who is condescending about anything that is app development: ""We've had people try and obtain this grant for app **ideas** before."" I show him my project, tell him that I'm 85% done and explain to him that I'm past the idea stage and need the money. His demeanor absolutely changed after he saw the project as well. 

&lt;side-rant&gt; All developers hate those people who are skill-less and think they will be the next Steve Jobs with their idea. They usually have no money, and offer a random developer they know a small equity stake in their world changing idea to do all of the work while all they want to do is sit back and relax &lt;/side-rant&gt;

During the meeting with Bill I explain to him that I have done business plans before and had done market research a few times as a marketing manager/ intern. I try and explain to him that things like primary market research and financial projections can't be made for tech startups due to their being too many variables in how the company operates, and that if I were to do them they would be fraudulent fiction. Bill doesn't get it and sends me a framework for how to craft a business plan.

I email Carol back, not to go around Bill, but because it was Bill's last week there for some reason. In the email I quickly break down problems with doing primary market research and financial projections as if I were I writing about an issue on github, or creating a stack exchange post.

Carol replies in a whole bunch of businessy jargon saying that I need to be taught how to speak in a business setting and essentially I'm being a condescending asshole. 

I show my girlfriend, an english major, and she basically agrees that I was coming off as condescending. My girl friend agrees to help me write an email back to Carol and over 3 hours my girlfriend starts understanding that due to the direct nature of the problems I'm having there really isn't much I could do to address these problems without using indirect language that gets nothing done. We finish drafting the email and I pass it to my dad, who has an MBA from a top business school and he spends another hour going over it changing things. 

Now I feel that after my girlfriend and dad went over this email so many times that I'm doing things in an indirect way that will accomplish absolutely nothing. 

I don't know how to address these issues without coming off as an asshole. I feel like the tech support guy that has to get yelled at by a customer for asking if they turned their computer on and off to fix it.

How is it that you guys tend to deal with these situations? I went from what seemed to be guaranteed to get this government grant to unintentionally an offensive asshole.

My longer-term goals (which aren't fully flushed out yet) include possibly getting an MS degree and then hopefully working in a full time SWE/ML role, probably at a mid-sized startup. That being said, here are the offers I am considering:

Nextdoor + KPCB: Seems cool and is very consumer/product oriented and I will get the chance to do some ML work. KPCB fellowship is cool, don't think I should go to a company just for the fellowship though.

Plaid: High growth, small, ML work, not very well known but definitely extremely solid engineering team. They tried to recruit me really hard so I would feel terrible if I said no.

Affirm: High growth, bit larger, ML work, again fintech, somewhat well known. Really strong eng team here too.

Blend: I worked here last summer and really enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going back. I enjoyed the work and my team a lot. 

Comp wise, they all look similar except for one company's offer which is ~9-10k more for the entire summer. I'm trying my best to optimize for the long term and luckily do not have significant expenses, so I don't think considering comp for an internship is something that's very important for me.

&amp;nbsp;
A friend of mine just finished a one year technical program in programming and he was really nervous. He had worked in a hospital for 20 years as an orderly and was looking for a new career to jump into. Programming is what he chose. He contacted me about seeing my CVs because I had been recently hired (4 months at the company now) for a job. I had worked in IT infrastructure for a long time and I jumped into programming after completing a technical degree of 3 years. That 3 years included a work coop of 3 months as well. (referred to here as a 'stage', it's sort of the french word in Canada we use for coop or internship). I knew he was nervous so I decided to share my experience and I realized that maybe other newbies out there might want to hear what I went through, below was my email to him. Name have been removed, for obvious reasons. He, like myself, is in his late 30's and making this change to a new career. After sending him this email, I decided to share it here, because... Maybe it can help some coders out there struggling. To know they aren't alone. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Hey _____ , I'm emailing you quick while I remember, ____ gave me your email, to send you my resume. I'm at work atm but I just wanted to keep you in the loop. :) I haven't forgotten, just been busy at work... Anyways, I'll send you my resumes tonight so you can have a look see.

Also, I want to take this opportunity to share my experience of being a new programmer with you. ________ mentioned you were a little nervous and I completely understand. During my stage, I literally had panic attacks every morning. I remember one evening it was bad, I had to have a few shots of whiskey to settle my nerves. It was brutal and I was really scared. I felt like I didn't know anything. That I wasn't competent and I couldn't possibly succeed doing this. That I couldn't compete with these kids of 20 years old knocking out code so fast! 

There were literally days I sat down and looked at the screen and was like ""I don't understand a single thing in front of me."" Because the one thing school doesn't prepare you for, is the SIZE and complexity of the systems and they simply can't. But, most environments, people get that. They get there's a learning curve and it can be steep depending on the system. But you gotta embrace the grind. You plug away at it and step through each process... also sometimes you have to ""black box"" your understanding of things. Also, if you literally don't understand a single thing, just ask for help. Never just sit and muddle through random code. They will not like that. They prefer you not know and get help, rather than sit there and try grind away at something you don't understand at all.

I've been here for 4 months and I love my job and my work. No panic attacks and no fear. It's this amazing collaborative experience and it's literally like no other job I've ever done and it's amazing. You're going to love it. :)

Also, I've heard rumors we're hiring... so after I send you my CVs, try to get yours done asap. My boss is a good guy. He's fair and understanding. He's just looking for people who love coding and the working with code. *crossing fingers* I hope to see you soon!"

Basically, it's a 12 week program where we develop a proof of concept for new technologies (no code to dev servers). I think doing this internship would stick a big name on my resume, which might help me get a better full time offer or at least the potential to get a better full time offer(via more interviews) when the time comes.

The other company is a small to medium size company that has a more ""startup"" vibe, and everyone I've talked to who's worked there loved it there. Unfortunately, hardly anyone knows who this company is and it won't look as ""impressive"" on a resume. But, I do think I would enjoy my summer at this company more simply because of the environment.

Salary and living expense are pretty much the exact same so it's not really a factor for me. So I guess my question is what should I do? Or what is more important for an internship if I am wanting to consider the future, having a big name on my resume to make the chances of netting an interview easier or to enjoy the experience more?

EDIT: I just want to clarify that I would probably enjoy the IBM internship too, but most likely not as much as I would enjoy the smaller company.

I’ve only been coding for a few years and I recently started an internship in IT.   Previously I was very successful with sports and music.  I can tell you very specifically what makes me determine whether a musician or athlete has skill.  

Programming is unique because there are so many specialties, tools, and styles that it’s hard for me to determine someone’s ability.  What is that thing you notice other programmers do that tells you they are proficient?  Is it the process and how quickly they code, or is your observation of their skill only based on results like clean code?

I believe that as we progress at a skill, a big thing that differentiates is knowing the difference between what is a “good” or “bad” habits.

Maybe five years ago I was interning at one of my first jobs and a coworker lent me a book to learn pearl with. I didn't actually need it for the job but I read through the book during my free time before the internship ended. I can't remember if a friend showed the idea of a JAPH to me or if I just found it myself online while looking up other things about PERL while I learned, but I remember reading about JAPHs and thinking the idea was pretty neat. This ""Just Another Perl/Unix Hacker"" code was the only real thing I ended up making at the time though and unfortunately I've used PERL like once, maybe twice, since then, so I honestly would take at least a couple hours to walk through this now.

(They aren't judged on the amount of tickets closed or time to resolve so they don't mind if we take tickets.)  Also, long time lurker, first time poster.

Back in mid August; I grabbed a ticket that had to do with securing and backing up data from someone who had just left our company. (They left on very good turns and is still good friends with my higher ups. ) So the policy we have is that their manager and Dept. Head get an archive copy of their emails in a PST file. They also get a copy of the Documents folder and anything we (IT) might see that is relevant to the company and that department projects. (Some users like to work fully from their desktop folder...)

 Before the user left, they copied all their personal data that they wanted to copy onto a flash drive. Or so they thought. Anyway, I finish up transfer all the data around, shut the laptop down and lock the office on my way out. 

Flash forward to beginning of October. Ex-User calls one of my managers and asks about a certain power point they were working on while employed here that they need for a very important upcoming meeting. In addition they don't have any of their personal data that they copied over. So, the manager asks if I can go do this person a favor since I was the one to handle their leaving.

 I gather information about what this power point should have in it and I head back to the locked office. Open the office, boot the laptop back up and scan the drive for any power point files. Then I also check for any of the keywords that should be in the file. Nothing. I even check all the backup files dating three months prior to them leaving,, nothing. Can't find this power point,  but the user insists it exists.  I get them calmed down about the power point and see about finding their other data. 

We come to find that because our Security blocks unknown USB drives,  the user took all their personal data from the encrypted laptop drive and put it onto an unencrypted backup drive. Big whoops. (The program we use for back ups encrypts the files themselves so we don't have to have the whole drive encrypted.) I get the user an authorized flash drive and copy their data onto it for them to take home. I also moved all their data back onto the encrypted drive. 

Apologized for not being able to find the power point and secured the equipment again. Flash forward a week or so and I get called into my one managers office, he asks me about the ticket and data recovery and if I remember it. He goes on to explain that the ex-user called him and told him that the file never actually existed... -_- 

I wasted 3 hours that day search through files and folders and archives of back ups.

TL;DR. Ex-user who is very good friends with my bosses thought they left an important file on their old PC. I spend 3 hours of my work day hunting for the file. Turns out it never existed.

It's also because of the terrible sprint-out delay, but I think this is a coding mistake just like how you accidentally flipped the sound values for friendly and enemy footsteps.  So that will be fixed.

But holy shit you must give an ADS sensitivity slider to consoles.  Have one of your interns grab a controller and ADS while jamming the stick fully to one side.  Ask the intern if that speed feels ok.

Right now you have to pop in and out of ads just to follow a strafing target inside of maybe 10 yards.  combine that with the fucking lag and you have a real mess of a game.  feels awful to play.

edit:  the other fucking thing about this is that if you are drop-shotted inside of maybe 10 yards, you absolutely can't do anything if you are adsing.  between the flinch and the time it takes for you to lower your aim due to the low ads sensitivity, it is actually impossible to put a shot on the drop-shotter.  just wait til more people figure this out."

BOSS Level: One year anniversary

Reading the ""Power of Moments"" by the Heath Brothers and the concept of Multiply Milestones, I have made the connection that the reason we are so addicted to our past relationships is because it was much like a game. Like a game, our relationships had built in levels that were extremely fun and rewarding. In a video game you gain skills, find perks, unlock characters, explore new worlds, try different strategies. You invest a lot of time, and money, and energy. 

Then the break up happens. 

For many of us, this may feel like someone talking away our favorite thing to do. For me, it felt like someone took away not only my favorite game, but also my PC/video game console. We couldn't play anything. We couldn't enjoy anything. 

I propose a solution. 

The New Game. ""Reset"". And it has gone like this for me: 

Level 1: Cry until it feels like you're dying

Level 2: Join r/exnocontact

Level 3: Finally commit to r/exnocontact, block your ex, ignore their messages. 

Level 4: Map out your next week, full of everything you need, favorite foods, favorite activities, favorite people

Level 5: Tell yourself, you love you, and believe it.  

Level 6: Do something to invest in your future (I took classes)

Level 7: Start to plan things for yourself like you'll do whatever it takes to make you happy. 

Level 8: Go a year without contact, keep going

I explain all this because I have seen a decent spectrum of companies and job requirements, both hiring and trying to be hired, and for my latest 2 years of hiring I was looking for an intern last summer, a co-op this upcoming spring, and a full time associate engineer for next year. I just have to ask, where the hell is all the talent?! I occasionally visit this sub, and it's chocked full of BME grads or soon to be grads who are constantly fretting about job prospects. And yet, I have had BARELY ANYONE apply to my R&amp;D Engineering positions. As I said above, I fancy myself well versed in the industry, I know these are the type of jobs you guys want. So what gives? Is the employment crisis for BME's over? I could believe it; I have personally seen the medtech industry just in my brief brief time in it add BME is a core major for its technical talent. This is true throughout every single medtech company I have seen and heard. Medtech itself is growing, going to be huge in the next decade. Or, is there another disconnect somewhere? A brief search at many top companies shows a ton, and I mean A TON, of unfilled positions calling for BME's of all experiences. I personally was just head hunted for my latest job, so haven't actually explored the job market in 5 years, is the market just that hot for us right now?

Some info:
Oath is in California and the others are in the southeast
Honeywell is paying ~20% more than Home Depot plus hosing (don't know about Oath yet)
The Home Depot offer required 2 technical interviews (not too difficult though), and the Honeywell offer was just 1 nontechnical interview. Oath was 1 technical and 1 nontechnical interview. 
The Home Depot internship seems more free in that I would kinda pick my own project and work on it with a partner. The oath one would focus on building libraries and frameworks for mobile apps that its brands use. Honeywell seems more backend, .NET based. They all seem to have a collaborative, open office atmosphere though.

My thoughts:
My goal is to get a big N internship eventually. Which of these would you pick, and which one has the most name recognition in the tech world? Also, one of my concerns is that the Home Depot interview required more technical interviews which makes me think they might be looking to get more out of me than the others possibly?

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

If you've read any of my other posts, you have some back story in me, so I won't bore you by repeating details. Suffice to say that I started young and my church leaders would use my problem to shame and guilt me into doing whatever they wanted.  

Fast forward to when I was 20 years old. I had decided to become a pastor and was doing an internship at the church I had grown up in. I was used to the mm using my porn and masturbation addiction to guilt trip me since they had been doing it for 6 or 7 years by that point, so when it continued, it didn't seem strange to me. But this time was more intense. I lived at the church, worked at the church, went to school at the church, and hung out with church people. The church leaders told other church leaders about my struggle and I wasn't often mocked or ridiculed for being so ""faithless."" I had started questioning things that I learned or things in the Bible, like that time Elisha summoned a bear to murder 42 children because they called him bald. Anytime I would ask a question looking for an answer, they would just tell me that I didn't have enough faith because I masturbated too much.  

About 3 or 4 months into the internship, one of the leaders decides to go through my phone. I had been texting a friend from another church about my questions and how the leaders had responded. My friend said that it maybe wasn't the best place for me. The leaders flipped their shit, and decided that I wasn't going to be allowed a phone anymore. It was at that point that I decided to move on, and I told them I was going to step down and move on to another church. 

At this point, they told me I had 1 hour to pack my stuff and leave or they would call the cops on me. While I was packing, they called everyone that I knew and told them about my porn problem and made up some lies about me. I then wasn't allowed to go on to any church, I didn't have a home, a job, family, or friends. My parents wouldn't let me move back home, and I had no where to go. 

That's why I can't talk to people about it. My experience tells me that people will always use information against you when they have a chance, so it's better to not tell anyone. "

7dt30u,1,2017-11-18,Advice for my biology internship decision,FnafMissingLink,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/7dt30u/advice_for_my_biology_internship_decision/,"Hey everyone, I don't know if this is quite applicable for this reddit, but I'm not quite sure with who else I could seriously talk about this. 

I'm currently a Biology master student within a cellular and development specializaton. This is also something that I want to pursue as it's very interdisciplinair and close to my preference for (eco)toxicological research. 

During my bachelor I had the best internship I could've wished, for which focussed on assessment of particles effects in larval zebrafish. I also came to love zebrafish larvae a model organisms and would've loved to pursue research on them. However, even though it was a great collaboration that fitted me perfectly, I wasn't allowed to pursue this research for my master as students have to broaden their perspective. 

So for my masters study after lots of oriëntation and introductory talks, I found myself stuck with 2 internship opportunities, both who adressed interest in having me. 

The first one is actually from a physics faculty who wanted to built a microscope that was able to detect particles within zebrafish larvae. They were in need of a biology student that would dedicate himself to injection of zebrafish larvae (a skill that I've always wanted to learn). For this study they collaborate with the chemistry faculty as they had a research that would benefit from tracking these particles (a really interesting resrearch!), and that faculty would give me an intensive training on zebrafish larvae injection. However, the huge downside to this is that it would be literally all I would be doing. The physics faculty kind of threw me a bone saying that perhaps I could help with other parts of the study later on. However that was only when I notified I had to able to write a thesis on this study and thus also want to have some contribution to the development of the study. They did not specify what I could be doing. They did also admit that their main interest in me was because injecting zebrafish larvae isn't really a job for most physic phd'ers, and thus they specifically had need of someone for it. They also seemed quite strict on having me at their workplace all the time (although I don't have to inject all day) which felt quite uneasy as there are also courses I want / have to follow in-between. 

The second study was from the biology faculty. It was a research that used micro-ct, tomography and hybridization techniques to uncover developmental pathways of a fish embryo / larvae with a parasitic lifestyle (no zebrafish). The supervisor seemed quite nice (although she was quite hard to understand due to a heavy chinese accent). However, my exact role in the study was still quite vague and it also seemed she was quite hasty with her research as she would depart just a month after I would end my internship. The techniques seemed okay, as I would learn something new, but as I've said, she was quite vague on what I would be using them for, as it seemed she already did some of the things herself already and was mainly focussing and looking for someone for the micro-ct part, which I found a bit less important. However, The research itself was quite interesting, and I felt I had a bit more contribution to the development of it! She did seem quite nice, so I guess she wouldn't be that harsh on me following courses as well, but she also hinted that their research group tends to have their breaks together and people would notice if someone didn't show up. 

tl;dr
So now I'm quite torn up between both positions as both are interesting, but also seem to have their downsides. The first one felt as if they would be abusing me (although learning zebrafish larvae injection really fits me), while the second one seemed quite vague (but I think I would be able to have a bit more contribution). I know I won't have the perfect internship I had during my last year, but it doesn't make it easier to pick. The internship will last for half a year, and during my next year I'll also be able to do an internship (where I already had a small agreement with a supervisor that was too busy this year). 

My goal with this 'rant' was mainly to ask for advice on this decision to other people with similar studies, especially regarding my future career. I really want to continue in (eco)toxicological research and work with zebrafish as a model organism. However I'm also open to other developmental studies, as perhaps my perspective isn't fully formed yet since it's based on one good internship. 

'm looking forward to your opinion, even if it's a small one! If any of you have questions about me, feel free to ask them! I do want to thank you guys in advance. Of course if my choice ended up being the wrong one, it will be just for half a year. I think I'll be able to survive that much!

I feel like this is an appropriate question to ask her, but please let me know if it isn't.

I'm in my MSW program now in my field placement, and I just ran into a major wall with my field supervisor. It has been building for some time, for sure, but this Friday she just got so frustrated with me, that I'm scared she'll request that I leave next week.

I'm in a hospital, and I love the work and my patients.

I'm not sure how to fill you guys in on the entire story, but I'll try. 

On the second day of my internship, my supervisor pulled me aside and told me that I needed to focus on hygiene, and I had some dirt on my flats (they were on the lighter side) and some dust on the bottom of my paints.  I told her they were painting in my building, but that I was sorry and I would make sure it didn't happen again. She then probed me about how I felt about receiving that information. I tried very hard, but she kept asking me, ""It looks like you feel upset."" etc. etc. SO, I teared up a bit. I clarified to her that I was just feeling disappointed in myself, and I wanted to make a good impression, and that nothing she said felt out of line for me, and I'm glad she told me. 

Following that incident, she forced me to take bags of clothes from the case manager in the hospital. I told her I did not need them, but she made me take them.

Okay, moving on. Now, after that we focused on the job. She was hard on me, but I learned quite a bit. I had a good time for a while, but she began to ask probing questions, such as, ""Do you have anxiety?"" ""What do you take for your anxiety?"" ""What do you talk about with your therapist?"" ""Why aren't you close with your parents?"" ""Do you not have access to your emotions because of your relationship with your parents?""

She asked me to go to a spa with her, and I said no.

Then, a few weeks ago, I was pulled aside again, and told that there was a smell about me. It was certainly an upsetting conversation, but after I pulled myself together, I told her that I appreciate her telling me that, and I would handle it. Truthfully, I come from a house full of pets and have a partner who smokes. What she told me is certainly not out of the realm of possibility, which I told her.

She then followed this up with providing me with multiple bags of perfume, lotions, shoes, again making me feel a bit uncomfortable.

Anyway.....she continues to call me defensive, rude, and not receptive to feedback. Every time she gives me feedback, she requests that I process it with her at that time. Sometimes, I respond with, ""I'm okay."" I made the mistake of asking why it was necessary to do that every time, and she got very angry and said it felt like a slap in the face. I was just trying to say that I didn't need to do that, for me. Some things, I just want to be like Olivia Pope, and handle it.

The conversation that brought this all to a head happened this week. I tried to open a conversation with her about where I talked about how sometimes I felt my boundaries were being crossed, and this might contribute to what she's reading as defensiveness. Her response was that she was just trying to help me (referencing the examples from above) and all I do is respond negatively to her trying to help me. So now, she is setting a meeting with my field liaison (who is also my professor) because she's at a loss for how to ""reach me"". She complained that she didn't know my true thoughts about anything, and didn't understand why I didn't think this was a safe space.

I don't know how this meeting will go, and I don't know how to advocate for myself in it.

&gt;Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. 

&gt;Introductions were made, but soon enough they turned to business and the discussion became heated.

&gt;“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” Dumbledore asked.
 
&gt;“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. “I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of software further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed —”  
 
&gt;“Of some kinds of software,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “Of some. Of others, you remain… forgive me… woefully ignorant.”  
 
&gt;For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.  
 
&gt;“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that MS Paint is more powerful than Excel, Dumbledore.”  
 
-----------------------------------

&gt;""And now we come to it, Harry,"" Dumbledore said grimly. ""The horrific secret of Voldemort's power. He has taken the dark powers of Excel and gone where no man should go, shedding his humanity in the process. He has used Excel to make not just one but *six* databases.""

&gt;Harry gasped. It was a horrific misuse of Excel's proper function. ""But surely we can just fire him?"" Harry asked, ""and bring in a new IT guy?""

&gt;""Alas, if only it were so!"" Dumbledore cried, ""but he is the only one who understands, at this point, how those spreadsheets work. Voldemort cannot be fired, Harry. Not while his spreadsheets continue to be used by Accounting.""

&gt;Harry nodded grimly. This was why Director Dumbledore had brought him on board, after all. ""What would you have me do?""

&gt;""There is only one thing for it, Harry. You must export all the data from his six spreadsheets into proper database software. Only then can we finally get rid of him.""

This may be more of a general job question (if there's a better sub for this type of question, please let me know), but I'm seeking advice on how to initiate the conversation to transition from an intern position into a full-time position. Currently I'm an intern at a small IT consulting firm, where the hierarchy is transparent, doing software development work, and I've been there for 6 months. The work culture is super lax and top management has expressed how they would love to move me to full-time once I graduate from college. The work is there, so I know they need people. 

I graduate in less than a month, and rather relying on previous expressions leadership has made about hiring me for a full-time gig, I want to know if I actually have a future with the company. This would be my first time having a conversation like this, so do you guys/gals have any tips how I should approach this?

I've ben a bit troubled lately and I know this community may be able to help me out. I've been vegan for a little over a year and it's something I've been very passionate about.

I live in a pretty small town, and while there are small vegan clubs here and networks/sanctuaries/etc in larger cities near me, I feel a bit disheartened that I am not able to attend larger activist events.

As far as locally, I've done a passion project during an internship last year to try to educate my school community about more sustainable living, and even managed to get some people I know to go vegan or vegetarian. I also make vegan meals and treats and share them with my friends, family, and teachers.

However, I don't feel like I'm ever doing enough. I try not to be pushy with people I know as I kindly educate them on certain things when they come up (like water consumption of farming, meats being linked to cancer, things like that). But I wish I could do more, especially seeing others doing so many wonderful things. 

Do you have any ideas about what I could additionally be doing? Thank you all so much in advance (:"
7du6d2,0,2017-11-18,Should I [22M] tell my now girlfriend [22F] I slept with another girl while we weren’t officially boyfriend and girlfriend,throw_away120948,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7du6d2/should_i_22m_tell_my_now_girlfriend_22f_i_slept/,"I met a girl in a club in late March while we were drunk, I’ll call her Ellie.  We went on a few dates and starting having sex in April.  I told her after our first date I wasn’t looking for anything serious (I was trying to lose my virginity) and she agreed but it seemed like she might have only been saying that in hopes we would start dating and not just be sex buddies.  Fast forward two months to the last week of class for the semester and Ellie and I are talking about us.  I was doing a summer internship on the other side of the country where I would also be working full time when I graduated the next semester.  I didn’t view her as long term relationship material because I didn’t think I would have known her well enough to ask her to move across the country with me.  I wanted us to naturally grow apart over the summer and go our separate ways.  I told her we should take a break and see other people and see how we feel when we go back to school.  Again it felt a little like she was more invested in me than I was in her emotionally and she agreed.

Fast forward a few weeks and I’m at my internship across the country and we are texting and Snapping each other and I’m having no luck on Tinder (no dates).  I tell her I’ll pay for half her plane tickets if she visits me. She’ll get a cheap vacation by the beach and I’ll be getting laid, I thought.  She agrees.  A few weeks later I see a girl we’ll call Jennifer I talked to from work on Tinder and ask her out.  We go on a few dates and have sex.  This relationship lasted maybe a month before we “took a break”.  Ellie comes down and we have a good time.  At the airport to take her home she asks if I’m her boyfriend and I tell her I’m not sure right now and we should talk about it in the Fall.

I maybe see and fool around with Jennifer once or twice after that but we eventually break up.  In the meantime Ellie and I have been exchanging sexy photos and videos most of the summer.

This past semester I realized how much I actually liked Ellie and how special she is.  We have met each other’s parents and she is looking at grad school near where I will work (she graduates a semester after me).  I love her now but I’m not sure if I should tell her about Jennifer.  On one hand I literally said “we can see other people” over the summer but on the other I felt she may not have truly wanted to agree and continued texting each other romantic and not just sexual things.  I want to be as honest as possible and she deserves to know before she moves across the country for me.  At the same time I don’t want this to drag our relationship down years down the road if we are still together if it doesn’t have to.  I’m willing to accept the fact that she is totally justified in breaking up with me if she chooses.

Thanks for the advice.  There’s no way I would cheat on her now since I love her and it would make me a massive piece of shit.  I’m still trying to figure out how bad I screwed up  and whether or not I should tell Ellie.

TL;DR
Girl I am seeing wanted a relationship, I didn’t.  Slept with another girl over the summer.  Now I want a relationship with first girl.  Do I tell her I slept with someone while we were seeing each other but not officially boyfriend and girlfriend."

My grandma passed weeks ago, and my dad got fired from his 13 year fulltime job for helping my mom deal with it (he called out days from work to help with funerals and burial arrangements)
My brother had to go into emergency surgery in the middle of the burial service because his intestines somehow got tangled. He's been in the hospital for a month. The rent in our apartment building skyrocketed because of a new policy. My grandpas homeless and has to share the room with me now and has no job. 

Me and my mom are now the sole breadwinners. I work 2 jobs and go to college.  I cut out hours from my part time job in order to get more days at my internship because they pay cash upfront but the problem is for the past few weeks the internship has been cancelling me out of days in the week and it always changes and the days interfere with my school and my other job. 

I intern at a vocational school/design firm doing the brunt of business card, flyer, signage designs, as well as proctoring Pearson tests. The first time I came to this internship, the boss kept telling me that my first month I will take a photoshop certification test and they will pay me as a full time employee $25 an hour 5 days a week. That was 4 months ago. Every time I bring it up my boss brushes it aside. The problem is, I wasn't put on a contract, nothing was in writing. I got this internship because my mother was his client and he hired me as a favor to her. I appreciated the opportunity but I cant keep working here for 50 bucks a week doing $25/hr work. Realistically I should be walking home with $175 bucks every week. 

I also feel justified for getting a raise because I take care of a lot of his clients while I'm off of work. My free time at home is getting calls from 3 or 4 clients who complain about the boss being slow with the designs so I take care of them for him and it prevents them from going to someone else. I work on Saturdays yet I find myself working everyday of the week because of them. He came to me last week and said I have to stay longer (5 more hours) in order to teach basic photoshop ($100/hr with certification) to clients. I now work 12 hours now doing overall $675 worth of work for only $50 if I was a full time employee. I get paid under the table, in cash which is why I have stood here because its more convenient for me.

The point is, I can't keep this internship if I'm going to help support my family. If I only bring 50 bucks to the table for $1200 monthly rent, and 80 bucks for bills (I cut out hours from my 2nd job for my internship that wants me to be more open in the week and they keep changing their minds last minute if they need me, so I work once a week at my 2nd job) 
I would quit but I just want to get my certification and leave. If I get $100-$150 once a week I can at least keep 25 bucks for food and travel for the week and contribute more. Im considering getting a third job if I cant get a raise just so I can use the internship money for myself and the rest of the money I earn goes to the family.

TLDR
Lots of worst case scenarios have happened and my extremely underpaid internship is full of empty promises and its interfering with school and my second job therefore I need more money to support my family."

As I'm posting this I am still working on my drivers license (me and my instructor expect to take my final exam by January), but due to a potential new job that I think requires me to have my own vehicle I am starting to think ahead already.

For background information, the company I might start working at is an IT management company. They take care of the IT management at small companies that don't have their own IT managers inside. This means that occasional trips get taken to customers around the city or beyond for maintenance, or to place new equipment. I already have an internship here and I want to start working here part time which I told the manager. He appeared very positive and would like to discuss the possibilities with me when there's more time.

As a dream car I always wanted a Volkswagen Golf 2 because I really like the style and they are still plenty around for sale on the used market. What I am concerned about however is the reliability of a car that's over 20 years old (taking in account that I want to get a model between 1990-1992), and overall how easy it is to work on the car. The last thing I'm concerned about is if parts are really expensive for this model.

I am quite enthusiastic about cars though and I actually want to learn a thing or two and I wouldn't be afraid to dive into it to do small repairs and maintenance. I don't think I can do major repairs such as replacing the clutch because I lack the tools, space and experience for that. If I were to work on my car I would have to do it in the driveway in front of our house, so taking the engine apart myself for example would be really difficult.

What would you guys thoughts be about this? Would this car be an okay choice or should I rather look for something different with the situation I posted above?

Thanks a lot in advance for your input!

She moved to the city I live in on her own and we continued to date. After 6 months we got an apartment together. After three years of living in the apartment we bought a house (all in my name though.) We've been living together in the house for 3 months.

Over the past few days I was seriously contemplating my happiness with her. It feels like I was the one giving everything into the relationship while she was only giving to herself. I feel completely drained. I didn't look forward to coming home after work as it only meant that I would have to cook dinner (she never cooks), do chores (she would help out a bit but I ended up doing most of them) and when I finally had time to relax it meant either sitting on the couch with her while she stares at her phone or doing something by myself like playing video games or watching TV.

I then tried to remember the last time we had sex. A week ago? Maybe two? I tried to think of a single time she initiated any sex or showed interest in me sexually other than the random penis grab or kiss. Nothing came to mind. The last date we had that wasn't just going out for dinner was at least months ago.

I tried to chalk it up to moving into the house, me starting a new job, her starting internships and finishing up her degree but I could keep going back further and further to see evidence.

As I thought about it more and more, it felt like I was in a relationship with a mostly freeloading roommate who occasionally let me have sex with her when she felt like it. Most of my interests she didn't like and when I showed a passion in them she would dismiss them. We have very little in common, which isn't helped by her very low amount of hobbies and interests. One thing that keeps coming to mind was a while ago when I asked her what her dreams were, if money was not a factor - what would you want to do? She had no answer and couldn't even come up with anything.

The confusing part here is I still love her. She is a great person at heart and I feel terrible doing this to her. I'm afraid I'm making a huge mistake and will be regretting throwing this all way. With the holidays coming up it terrifies me having to explain to my family what happened. I'm no spring chicken anymore and I'm afraid I might be single forever if I leave this for good.

7dulg3,2,2017-11-18,I attempted suicide today,mojojojo-369,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7dulg3/i_attempted_suicide_today/,"For some context- I am a 20-year-old Indian male and have been depressed for 14 of those years. Please brace for a long ass post.

To start off, the suicidal thoughts, although intense, are recurring. Prior to this, the only time I ever felt like killing myself was when I was 15, going as far as going to bed with a knife with the idea of slashing my wrists open. I was in 10th grade at the time.

Now, I am in my final year of college, with only a semester left (6th). To help you understand better, I'm briefly going to explain the education system of India. After 10th grade, you have to choose to study one of three streams, i.e. science, commerce and humanities/arts. I opted to pursue Commerce and went on to graduate high school with a very respectable 93.8% (anything below 90% is generally looked down upon).

With the kind of marks I had scored, I applied to several top colleges in the country and managed to secure interviews with all but one. However, I chose to attend the ""college of my dreams"" since it was one of the best in the country offering the course I had been wanting to study- Bachelor of Commerce.

One more thing about us Indians is the fact that working while still a student is considered to be unacceptable unless you're an intern at a very reputed institution. Since the college is in my hometown, I had no other option but to stay at home with my mom and brother (dad works abroad).

As I started college, I realised that I had made a huge mistake choosing the said institution. I couldn't make any friends, mostly because I am the type of person that likes to go out with friends every other weekend (I'd been devoid of going out with friends for a lot of my teenage years), whereas they were the type of people who preferred studying all the time. In a class of 75, I felt alone and outcast. I somehow managed to score moderately in the first semester, and just passed in the second. From the third semester onwards, I resorted to absenteeism, lying to my parents by saying that classes were off for this reason and that reason. The problem became so bad that my attendance fell well below the required minimum and wasn't allowed to appear for the exams. I couldn't tell my parents because of my trust issues with them. They aren't very understanding people.

However, the downtime allowed me to explore options and I managed to discover what I wanted to do in life- become an author. It was November '16 when I had started writing and I completed my work on January '17, and without any word to my parents, sent them over to various publishers. By the end of May of this year, all of the publishers that I had sent my work to accepted the manuscript and sent over contracts to sign. I chose the one publisher that would get the work done at no cost at all.

Some more context to help you understand my situation better- a lot of people here choose to pursue Chartered Accountancy, one of the toughest courses in India, along with B. Com. Naturally, my parents wanted me to pursue that. A month after college started, I found myself in another classroom, studying to crack CPT (Common Proficiency Test, the entrance exam to be able to study CA). I flunked the exam twice and finally gave it up, much to the disdain of my parents, but they came to terms with the fact that I did not want to study CA (accepted, not understood). The ""only other"" alternative left for me was to study for the plethora of exams that are conducted by various MBA offering colleges. I was assigned a tutor who diligently taught me while I ""diligently""  learned. The only problem was, I could not find any interest in the stuff I was studying, nor in my current college curriculum. I couldn't bring myself to tell my parents about it because they always discount everything as my ""childish wants"", and have a long habit of taunting me and bringing me down when I already feel bad. Hence, I had no other choice but to cram my way through. 

What angered me the most was the fact that my parents refused to invest in a career of authoring, were not satisfied when I wanted to intern so as to earn some pocket money of my own, wouldn't let me work anywhere because of the stigma surrounding it, but bought me an expensive laptop on my birthday which they constantly use to emotionally blackmail me, whereas all I wanted was their support.

Around the same time, several residents of the apartment complex we live in picked a beef with my mom for reasons unknown. Although I support her at times by throwing some choice of words at them, my mom's expectations of me have heightened. My parents have gone on to say that I must make my way into an IIM (Indian Institute of Management, one of the top B schools for MBA), and an IIM only, just for the sake of ""showing the people their place"". That left me further demotivated because the people who are supposed to care for you and understand you are the ones using you to ward off the unruly people, with whom I have nothing to do with. At the same time, my dad keeps saying that I should consider myself lucky because they haven't evicted me from the house to fend for myself like the Western people do. I was mad but held back from saying anything because me talking back is usually met with the saying- ""how dare you speak to me like that?""

Today, my tutor called my mom to talk about me. He said that I need to increase my speed of working out on sums (faster than 25 questions in 30 minutes, which is near to impossible) and comprehensions (comprehensions are usually a page long and I take a very modest 8 minutes to complete the set of 5 questions, whereas the tutor thinks I should do it in less than 4). While he also said that my accuracy is top notch, the above complaint and also one more about me using my phone ""all the time"" were enough to send my parents into a frenzy. My dad said that if I couldn't crack CAT, there would be very bad consequences and my mom grounded me and took my phone away, and also made it clear that I won't be allowed to go out of the house to meet my friends or won't be allowed to have them over.

That was the last straw for me. I wasn't angry, I was just tired. Tired of living for someone else, tired of doing something I don't want to prove a point to others, tired of being angry and basically, tired of just living. After whatever happened, my mom went out to meet my grandma, and that's when I decided to go ahead.

I won't describe the details of how I set everything up, but I locked the door to my room and attempted to hang myself and when that didn't work (too little height), I tried to choke myself out with a belt. That didn't work either, and I just ended up crying in my toilet for a solid fifteen minutes before washing my face and pretending like nothing had happened. 

I have a great group of friends who want to support and help me but can't, due to their environment. Today was not the first time I had attempted suicide, and I can tell you with a guarantee that it's not going to be my last. Bawling my eyes out didn't help me at all. I just wish my parents understood that I am not a failure and a waste, just for not being able to do what majority of the people do on a daily basis. I wish I had the opportunity to explore my talents like writing crime fiction, poetry, rap songs, blogs, taking photographs and editing them. I could leave everything and fuck off, but it wouldn't take long for my parents to track me down and bully me further. I just feel trapped in a world of helplessness and hopelessness. My throat still hurts as I type this out.

I've read so many birth stories here and they helped me so much in anticipating my big day. From the middle of my pregnancy onwards I started planning on doing it the Dutch way: a home birth, without pain medication. I chose to follow a Hypnobabies self-learning course, and it was super helpful.

So, here's my story! I'm really sorry but no baby tax for privacy reasons (this account is almost a throwaway because of that too).

-------

We were already getting impatient. I was 41w0d pregnant already, and I had a membrane sweep the day before at the midwife's appointment. Knowing that the average pregnancy duration for first timers is 41 weeks didn't help that much. I had been having Braxton-Hicks contractions that were not so intense, and some menstrual cramp-like pain in my back. Also I had been having some of the ""lightning"" or ""knives in the cervix"" sensations while walking for about a month already. It really felt like the baby was just going to fall out! My brother came to visit and went away without meeting the baby, my big sister too. My mother, my step-dad and my younger sister were staying with us in our house. My step-dad was betting that the birth would happen on that weekend because of the change of the moon on Monday. Every day I checked a birth day probability calculator. If the baby wasn't born during the weekend, we would have an appointment at the hospital on Monday to decide what to do. I desperately wanted to avoid an induction (I had read that pitocin makes the contractions too strong to bear without anesthesia).

My prenatal care was completely made with a midwife practice. In the Netherlands, this is the common path. Normal, low risk pregnancies go to the midwives, and home births are encouraged. The numbers of home births are going down, but it is still around 10%, I think. They have a good system in place to provide safe and quick removal to hospital in case something goes wrong. It would also be possible for me to change my mind in the middle of the birth and ask to go to the hospital if I wanted, and my insurance would cover it.

So I felt safe in trying for a home birth. The reason I chose a home birth was simply because here I would only be admitted in the hospital once I was at least some 5cm dilated. For what I had been reading, I imagined that getting out of the comfort of my home to go anywhere when that far in the game would be much worse than just staying at home and doing everything there. A positive birth experience needs relaxation - that's what the books were telling me, unanimously - and getting up to leave somewhere is far from relaxing. I had seen many stories of births stalling once the mother gets to the hospital, and snowballing into a series of interventions. I wanted to try to avoid that. I prepared by following the Hypnobabies course, which uses self-hypnosis techniques to help in relaxation during childbirth. I followed the self-learning version, which has a book and a set of CDs with hypnosis tracks. I had been doing it for about two months, not super religiously, but well enough. I felt prepared, and I had my partner's support and help with this. 

At around 23:50 on that Friday, as we were preparing to go to bed, with my sister in the next room and my mom and step-dad downstairs, I started feeling contractions that were coming with some regularity. So much for trying to sleep before things really start! We timed them and they were not that close together yet, and the duration was not regular either, but it did feel like it was the real thing. My partner warned my family that things seemed to be happening, but we asked that they stayed downstairs the whole time. I decided to start using my Hypnobabies birth track to start relaxing, but that didn't work that well while trying to time the contractions. I quickly found out that using my exercise ball and rotating my pelvis rhythmically while having my head on the bed was the most comfortable position.

By 3am, the contractions were strong and frequent enough, so we called the midwife, who said she would be in in about 30 minutes. When she came in, a little bit of disappointment: she was the intern who had followed two or three of my appointments before. My midwife practice had six midwives whom I would meet throughout the pregnancy, but the one following the actual birth would depend on who was on call on that day. My favorite midwife was heavily pregnant herself, so she was out. The recently-graduated intern was filling in for her, and she was the one who came to attend me. I was slightly worried that she was not experienced enough, but honestly there was not much time for me to dwell on this.

When the midwife arrived, I was having contractions every 4-5 minutes. Right when she arrived my water broke. The water was clear, great! She checked me and told me I was 3cm dilated. Things were going well, baby was doing fine, my vitals were also fine. She said I could go to the bathtub if I wanted, and she would come back again in about 2 hours, and when she came back, she would stay. The contractions were getting stronger and closer together, and I decided to try to go to the bathtub. It was weird, I felt too warm and too cold at the same time, but in general it felt good to be in the water. I don't know how long I stayed there, maybe one hour? I might have fallen asleep in the water briefly as well.

At some point I decided to get out of the bathtub and get back to the ball. Things were getting quite intense by now, and it was getting hard to cope with the contractions when I was not sitting on the ball and rolling around with my hips. I also started making noises as I breathed out, with my mouth wide open to relax my jaw. While I wasn't really using the Hypnobabies techniques to the letter (I preferred to keep moving on the ball than to go completely limp), I think that the course gave me the ability to relax as much as possible and to remove my mind from the moment by going to a ""safe place"" that I created during the course.

I started to feel nauseous and asked for a bucket. I threw up everything that I had eaten for dinner. I didn't mind that so much, which is interesting, since I have a real phobia of throwing up and hadn't done so for some 10 years now! I knew throwing up meant I was in transition, which also meant that things were progressing fast enough and it wasn't going to get much worse than this.

The midwife came back at 6am, and now I was having quite long contractions (they felt like they were 10 minutes long, but I think it was not that much) and very short breaks between them. I tried different positions, but only sitting on the ball felt right. It was really hard to cope with the contractions in any other position! So it was quite uncomfortable when she wanted me to lay on the bed for her to check me. She did and I was only 5 cm. I felt disappointed. Wasn't it supposed to be transition when I threw up? Isn't transition around 7cm? We waited for about 1.5 hours (I checked the birth notes, but at this point I was not really keeping track of the time) and she checked me again, and I was still at 5cm. She said that if things didn't progress, we would need to go to the hospital, as it seemed the baby was facing up. What??? At this point, I almost broke down. I did NOT want to go anywhere! She asked me to lay on my left side as it would be better for the baby. Getting out of the ball to the bed was hard enough, and laboring laying down was getting very hard! At this point I really lost my rhythm and had trouble focusing on relaxing. The midwife asked me when did I pee last, as a full bladder can sometimes prevent dilation. I was not sure, I thought earlier in the night. She asked me to try to go to the bathroom to pee, but I couldn't get up. I asked to try to use the bedpan instead, but that also didn't work. So the midwife said she was going to try to empty my bladder with a catheter. She did the procedure, which I barely felt, and emptied my bladder (around 100ml, as I checked in her notes). She checked me again immediately after that (at around 8:20), and I was 7cm. She smiled and said, great, you're dilating again, we don't need to go anywhere. I thought to myself, shouldn't you have said anything about going to the hospital only after trying out the catheter?? I certainly would have preferred not to hear the H word unless we really had to go.

At this point, my partner's help was so, so important. Laying on my left, the contractions were too strong for me to deal on my own. I couldn't focus on relaxing by myself, but when he would use our cue words and touch me to help me relax as we had practiced, I could feel immediate relief, almost like magic! It really helped me go through this, which was the most difficult part. Not only because I was not in my preferred position, but because the midwife was just waiting in the corner of the room. For what felt like a long time she didn't check me. I started feeling a lot of pressure and a sensation that I needed to push (at around 9:10), but she said I shouldn't push yet, and that I should do shallow breathing not to push to avoid tearing. How could she say so if she didn't check me? And how long would it take for her to check on me again? This was the first time I said ""I can't do it"", to which my partner smiled and replied, that took some time for you to say! I couldn't explain to him that it was not the birth itself that I felt like I couldn't do, but the waiting without any feedback. I felt I needed her to check on me because I really felt ready to push!

Eventually I managed to say it out loud something in the lines of ""how much longer must I lay on my left?"". She finally decided to check on me, and said, you're complete, you can push. No shit! I already felt the pushing sensations for a long time by then (edit: this was just 20 minutes after I told her about the pressure, but it felt like an eternity) and I was fighting against it as she instructed, breathing strongly, to avoid tearing. Well, it didn't matter anymore, it was time to push (9:43am). I asked for the birthing stool (which looks like a toilet seat), as I wanted to try to push in a position as close to squatting as possible. It felt very comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, that the contractions slowed down and didn't feel strong and productive anymore. Fifteen minutes later I decided to move back to the bed, in all fours (10:05am). I kept pushing, and it was quite hard work. It was not painful, but I felt like I was not making enough progress. After some 20 minutes (10:28am) in that position, the midwife asked me to try on my back. I thought that was a bad idea, since I had read that in that position I would have to push the baby against gravity, but I went it with anyway. It still didn't exactly hurt, but it was so exhausting! It did feel like I was progressing, and finally she said she could see the head. My partner said, the head is just there! I pushed as much as I could, and finally pushed through the very strong stretching sensation, and the baby was out (at 10:49am)! Waaaa! I did it! The midwife counted 10 fingers and 10 toes and said the baby was doing great.

Then she said ""I still haven't seen what it is..."", turned the baby to me and showed me. A GIRL! I was crying and said her name, the name I had chosen when I was 15 years old, the girl to which I wrote many letters that I will give her when she is old enough :')

I had to have two stitches for two second degree tears, and the midwife injected some pitocin to help expel the placenta. It came out soon and completely and I barely felt it.

So, my baby was born at 41w1d. The whole thing lasted 11 hours after my first real contraction, 7 hours of stronger contractions after the water broke, and 1.5 hour of pushing. She weighted 3.170kg (7lbs) and measured 48cm (18.9 in). She had perfect APGAR scores, 9 and 10. It was a textbook perfect home birth, and without any pain medication. At no point I thought the pain was too much to bear, but mentally it was quite exhausting at times. It didn't feel at all like it lasted 11 hours, and I really could not keep track of time. Physical recovery was easy enough with the Dutch perfect maternity care system: a maternity nurse comes to your house for 8 days to make sure that mother and baby are healthy. Having a newborn, on the other hand, was super hard for the first 5 or 6 weeks... but that is a story for another time :)"

(**TL;DR at bottom**)
My first post here as well as my first post overall, but a long time lurker and happy to finally be here. I'll try to keep this short and sweet, thanks for taking time out of your day to read this. Firstly - I was an intern at a start up, and directly under the CTO. I was able to do a ton of research, learn a ton about programming (Mostly Java), and work with guys that new exactly what they were doing. It was awesome, and I was/am grateful to have been a part of it. Long story short - It's a start up. We need money, still don't have it, and we're quickly running out of money. The reason I say ""We"" and ""Am"" is because I'm not technically *fired*, as there's still a chance they could pull the money from somewhere. Since those chances are slim, and I've already been told I am unable to rack up any additional hours unless something changes, I've decided to make this post anyway under the assumption I've already 100% lost this job. 

That being said though, I guess I'm curious if anybody has any suggestions for where I can continue from here. I am not opposed to anything, and would love to hear any and all suggestions. Some facts about me in regards to my skills in and around this field:

* I know Python, Java(Apex), and am learning R.
* I'm also good with Hardware, Desktops, laptops, Rpi, Redboards, etc.
* I love the problem solving that comes with this field, and am currently hoping to pursue Machine learning, AI.
* I really don't care about how well a position/job pays. As long as I can afford a roof over my head, and some groceries every month, I can make it work. I'm mostly concerned with filling an enjoyable, fulfilling role. 
* At this point, I am without certs, and have no schooling beyond High School. (I *love* learning, but I'm terrible at it in an institutionalized setting) I'd love to get certs, and I'm not opposed to trying school, but I worry I would waste time and money just to fail.

I feel as though I'm in an interesting, and honestly kind of worrying situation. I would love to continue right from where I am now, and just keep learning and growing in these fields (In a perfect world), but I'm open to anything that would keep me around computers and programming. So aside from calling up my boy Elon and seeing if he has any positions open /s, is there anything else anyone can think of that fits this situation in one way or another? 
Thank you again for taking the time to read all this. 

**TL;DR**:
Lost job that was allowing me to learn and grow at my own pace and getting paid to do so, Would love to continue in this direction, but am feeling overwhelmed and not 100% sure how to proceed. See bullet points for some of my Strengths/Weaknesses. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Note: See a typo, rule violation, or just think I did a poor job on my first Reddit post? let me know, I'll make it right."

7dv8pd,2,2017-11-18,DID or Schizoaffective? Thinking About Going Off My AP!,boujeedragon,schizoaffective,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/7dv8pd/did_or_schizoaffective_thinking_about_going_off/,"I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder since July. I've never experienced any kind of visual hallucinations &amp; the voices I've ""heard"" have been alters. For about 5-6 months I went back &amp; forth between personalities of people believing I was 2-3 people at once. I couldn't define who ""me"" was anymore. Basically there were 2 main characters. 

One was Ryan. One was Me. Ryan became my fiance. Then Ryan began to split into 2 separate Ryan's. One who was funny &amp; one who was stoic. I had to distinguish between the two separate Ryans to determine who was my fiance. I wore a ring on my finger &amp; spent hours in conversation about our future. I spent hours laughing at funny Ryan's jokes. They made me fall in love with them. I honestly feel like I went through an engagement &amp; broke up. It was all real to me...I have flashbacks &amp; can't remember conversations that I had during this time. 

Aside from always having a Ryan on my right hand, I believed that people I knew (friends, family, celebrities, people on social media) would ""visit"" me where I essentially would adopt their personality &amp; think I was them. I thought my friends all had VR goggles, would put on the goggles &amp; become me when I was living with my parents. When I ran into them IRL, I thought they knew they had ""visited"" me at the ranch but we weren't allowed to talk about it. 

When I had a cigarette, each mannerism represented a different friend. Things like objects (a yellow blanket, a furry pillow, peanut butter, La Croix water, Coca Cola) would be a trigger for different people that I would become. Cars....every brand of car, to me, was a personality that I became. 

None of the meds would work. I was hospitalized 4 times &amp; each time I went to the hospital, it was Ryan &amp; Me. I would talk to the psychiatrist as either Ryan or Me. I would tell the psychiatrist, ""Hang on one second. I'll let you talk to Ryan about that."" I was on lithium, tegretol, risperdome, halodol &amp; a bunch others I can't remember -- many antipsychotics &amp; I was still believing I was more than one person at once. I thought that Rihanna &amp; ASAP Rocky would ""visit"" me &amp; essentially become me in the hospital. 

Each time they let me out of the hospital I still believed I was engaged to Ryan &amp; that we were going to get married that summer &amp; invite EVERYBODY. I thought all of my friends would just accept that I found a man that was a part of me....

So my big question is...was this one long psychotic episode of SZA or do I have DID? I was believing I was getting ""visits"" up until September. I have been on Invega shots since July. I just moved out of my parent's home in September &amp; at my new apartment, everytime I had a cigarette, I would have a conversation with Ryan &amp; think someone important was visiting me to convince me to quit smoking. I quit smoking. I haven't had any kind of ""visits"" since. I no longer acknowledge that there was a Ryan. I am now completeley out of this state of mind.

I have had extreme side affects from the Invega -- gained 30-40 lbs, no motivation, morning depression, lack of interest in everything -- I am a completley different person than who I use to be. I have seriously been considering going off antipsychotics because I don't believe in sacrificing my body (getting diabetes, getting coronary heart disease) for my mental state. If I have DID then I have nothing to worry about. But if I have SZA then I might go back into psychosis.

What do you think? Anyone go off their AP &amp; not relapse into psychosis? The fact that I've been on antipsychotics &amp; was still having visits makes me think that it was DID. And I can acknowledge these different personalities but no longer engage in them. I've been extremely functional, have an internship &amp; wake up at the same time everyday. I just feel that these antipsychotics are going to kill me."
7dvf9x,2,2017-11-18,Help me Pick an internship - I'm torn,LowStranger,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7dvf9x/help_me_pick_an_internship_im_torn/,"Hey Guys,

I have 2 internship offers that are pretty different, and I'm looking to get some opinions to help me choose because I'm completely torn. Maybe some of you have been in a similar boat.  I'll start with describing the two offers and then share a few of my thoughts.

Internship at one of HP's research labs on an ASIC chip design team - This is for a job on a small team of about 15 people and I would be a digital design intern on this team. Getting to do chip design for some of HP's cooler printing technologies. Things like 3D and Large scale high performance printers, not too much with consumer printers. It's down to the transistor level design along with doing some Verilog programming for the controllers in the chips. Working close with the analog designers also on the team to be able to do design, testing, and verification of any project our team has. This internship is in Oregon.


Internship with Local Hardware Security Company - This company is a small 10-15 person company that does hardware security for FPGAs and Embedded systems.   I would get to do a good bit of VHDL and C programming in the security space. This company does work for Intel, Xilix, Microsim, defense companies, etc.  This company is really laid back, does outstanding work in their niche area and is literally a 7 minute walk from my house in FL.


Both companies have been really great to me, showing that they would really like to have me on the team.  Before the semester started I was hoping to find an internship that would let me work a lot with FPGAs since that is my strong suit and ideally be on the west coast if possible. In terms of the type of work, the small local company is a much better match for me based on what I am already good at and know that I love to do. One of the reasons they want me to work there is because I do a research project for FPGA hardware security that I already know I love. So I know I would 100% really like working here and it would get me a lot better at stuff I already have some experience in.  The position with HP is offering work that I don't really have much experience in at all, chip design down to the transistor level. And it no doubt would give me a ton of experience with some topics I'm a lot weaker in but want to learn about. Transistor circuits, analog to digial, etc. For an EE I'm pretty stupid when it comes to analog stuff, transistor circuitry and things like that so I think it would be really good for me to learn these topics. I've been doing a lot of work with Digital Logic, FPGAs, and Embedded system so those are my strong suits, but I kind of want to get better at some other areas as well. I think I would like the chip design work HP is offering me to do and it will make me a more well-rounded engineer that I am trying to become but if I end up not liking it that much I'm going to be kicking myself in the butt for turning down a company that was pretty much offering  do something I already know I love. There have been topics I thought I would like in EE before that I ended up hating, so that has me hesitating on passing on something I know I like for something I think I'll like.

In summary, HP is going to provide me a really good learning experience and opportunity that doesn't come by often. It will allow me to work in a new area and become more well-rounded. But i can only predict I will like the work since I've never really done it before. It will also give me the chance to travel to the west coast.  The local company is going to provide me with work I already know I love and make me better at it, but It will be making me better in a niche area I already have some experience in instead of making me more well-rounded in terms of electrical engineering.  Also being able to walk to work and live where I already do would be just as great as being able to travel to the west coast.

I'm so torn on which direction to take for my summer internship. What do you guys think?"
7dvfw1,2,2017-11-18,Should I drop out of Uni if I get a job?,10able,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dvfw1/should_i_drop_out_of_uni_if_i_get_a_job/,"I'm nearly done with my third semester at University and thinking about it, it really seems like a huge waste of time. I'm studying engineering but I feel like I'm not learning anything. Or at least, I'm not learning anything I have to go to Uni for. It feels more like they just tell me what to learn, lecture in a super shitty way that I don't understand, then judge how well I learned it. Almost everything I'm taught I can learn by reading online lecture notes from other Universities that teach the same thing. I don't do bad in my classes.

And on top of that, I'm a skilled programmer and I've worked for companies that require programmers in the past, and while I obviously wasn't on the level of a programmer who has been working for years, I knew way more than the equivalent interns who were there with me. In other words I'm fully capable of working at an entry level programming job.

I just don't see the reason to stay at Uni. It's a burden money wise and effort was and I'm really not happy. I've started looking for jobs (programming jobs, I already have a menial job) and if I find one I see very little reason not to drop out or at least suspend my enrollment and go work. I feel like I'd be way more productive working on *real* projects, and meeting people in the workplace than the Uni environment, which is half drunk kids and half super serious students, I can't really relate to either group fully.

I know you can't fully know my situation but what I'm saying seems rational, right?"

I have a high-paying job in my field lined up starting the day I officially get my degree that I got through my only semi-friend here (thankfully). 

I will be making around $70k the first year, and I'm very grateful for that. A few years ago, I seriously thought I was either going to kill myself before this point or be making $9/hour at Walmart and wanting to kill myself.

However, I still am unable to relate to any people or enjoy myself in any social activity. I have to take sleeping pills at night or I just lie awake and feel guilty all the time. I am just scared that I'll start to break down very fast because I have no real support network.

My family of origin is abusive/toxic, and I cannot really rely on them for anything. I have made honest attempts at making friends, and it usually works for a few weeks or so, until I'm effectively ghosted, and they ""forget"" to invite me to things. 

I guess the dichotomy is that I am going to be materially and financially well-off, and I should be able to be independent. However, I am truly afraid that I will just break down fast. I barely scraped by in university (not academically, but emotionally), and there is a lot of underlying infrastructure that is done for me here. My employer knows I have Asperger's and is alright with it, and they are going out of their way to help me transition. I've already done a phase-in internship for a few weeks and have gotten to know the people I'm working with, so that's a benefit. 

I feel this bizarre mix of happiness, fear, and depression all at once, and I'm trying to sort it all out. I'm very, very grateful for how things are turning out for me leaving university, but I still feel that without any network of people I actually like and who like me back, I may start to fail in life, and if I can't be financially independent, I'll literally just be homeless, because there's nobody I can come crawling back to."

Maybe Jo will go "" ""missing""and Alex will find out something is wrong after Jo's interns come searching for her.

I know there was a BTS of Matthew Morrison with a bloody face so I think someone hits him... but who will it be is the big question. Does Alex go crazy or does he understand the ramifications of acting out now? How does Bethany Joy Lenz's character play into this?

Recently I poured all of my spare money as well as the salaries I earned through internship into bitcoin investment (bought the dip at $6000). I highly appreciate bitcoin's ideology of decentralization, which prevents nasty manipulations from any entity or government.

My home country banned Bitcoin exchanges this September (although Chinese government itself still keeps mining, so does the Russian government too, very evil), but bitcoin still keeps rising after the prohibition. My confidence grows steadily and I believe sooner or later the bitcoin will eventually reach the market cap of gold, pulling up a single bitcoin to worth $500k at least.

Let's keep our confidence and see it hits the moon.

HODL!"
7dw25w,2,2017-11-18,Completely overwhelmed and crushed by debt. Need emergency advice.,seriouscrushingdebt7,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7dw25w/completely_overwhelmed_and_crushed_by_debt_need/,"So this is a throwaway because I'm ashamed of having gotten to this point. My finances are completely wrecked and I need advice on how to treat this emergency debt situation.

So I'm a full-time student that has idiotically built up a ton of credit card debt. I graduate at the end of this year, so I had planned on using this school year to pay down my cc debt, but that is proving to be nearly impossible.

Alright, so I owe $6,994.97 in credit card debt on a single credit card (Amazon Rewards Visa) with a 20% interest rate. I have tried to get another credit card, credit line increase, balance transfer, or personal loan, none of which I qualify for (presumably due to my student loans and/or cc debt).

My income for one month is around $600 as I can only work part-time as an intern on federal work study. I also picked up a job doing audio transcription from home (since school+internship makes working normal hours anywhere extremely difficult), but it is obviously not lucrative at all and probably brings in $40/month at the most.

The following are the bills I pay each month:

Rent - $766
Household bills - $40 (my share w/ 3 roommates)
Cell phone - $100
No car/transportation costs
No groceries/spending on food

Total: $906 in bills

So obviously my bills are much more than my income each month. I do also receive a financial aid disbursement each semester, but I was only refunded $1,500 for the entire semester (Aug - Dec) this time and I have finally run that fund dry. I am panicking now because although I haven't used my credit card since August, I still cannot get on top of this debt. I can't afford food, I'm certainly not going to be able to afford Christmas at all, and I cannot even pay my minimum amount due on my credit card.

It seems to me that it's pretty much hopeless at this point unless I can somehow get another part-time job very quickly (which I'm pretty much spending all my free time applying for), but if there is any other advice anyone can offer, I would really appreciate the help!"

Struggling to frame 6 Contract/intern positions and a self-started company in Web Dev before early graduation this December,cscq-20171117,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7dwce5/please_help_struggling_to_frame_6_contractintern/,"Hi everybody,

It would mean the world to me to get some advice on structuring my resume!

I'm really sorry this is so long, I have difficulty following typical templates since it usually comes out as 3 pgs...
Any advice at all on focus or templates for this would be greatly appreciated

Honest history:

 * Summer 2013 - Web dev intern at startup #A in KC, MO
 * Summer 2014 - Web dev contract at startup #A in KC, MO
 * August 2014 - Began CSC degree at large mid-western university (not known for comp sci) few hours from KCMO
 * During school - won award for Startup Weekend, sat on several school organization boards and committees 
 * Summer 2015 - Web dev intern worked at V M L (largest marketing firm in KCMO); configured build system for Spr int.com
 * During school
   * two-month contract position as a developer of a Slackbot (worked independently of company business) at small web development company;
   * Organized a small non-profit of 4 friends to help passionate programmers find resources (met weekly) and I learned a lot about team management and promoting comradery (Never had a cash flow/EIN)
   * Awarded for committee involvement organizing ""fun and innovative"" campus events for my residence hall
 * Summer 2016 - Web dev contract at V M L; greenfield dev on dev team of 40+ building Angular 2 components, organizing stories with McKinsey and Company (2nd largest management consulting firm in the world), built component gallery system (self initiated idea) for devs to be able to share frontend UI components; worked with V M L DevOps team to explore Drone CI (to potentially replace Jenkins) for Docker-based continuous integration (also self-initiated and led, most of this work and learning Docker was after hours) (I also worked with Github API here).
 * During school
   * Organized another company to develop a social meet up app (was featured in school paper/online)
      * Recruited and lead six students (volunteering for the experience and interest in mission) through developing marketing campaigns, organizing events (company worked directly with university for two events), and leading the development of several web apps in Elixir/Phoenix and Angular 2 for the mobile app.
      * Mentored graphic designer in experience design through careful critique of wire frames and guided exercises
 * Summer 2017 until October - ""Software Engineer"" at KCMO startup writing Clojure and Java on backend for a React Native frontend
   * While here, I owned the development of an entire service offering from the business logic/ui templates/pmt processing
* December 2017 - I get my diploma a semester early! Yay. I took an average of 19 credits a semester and passed out of several courses in our CSC program in order to get everything done so quickly. My last classes have been online, which is how I worked at the last startup until October (which ended due to a bad fit and constrained resources).

*ALL the while*, over the course of the last five years I have created over 100 _source_ (not forks) repositories on Github for large and small projects that I have done out of interest in learning new stacks. My code is well structured but not well commented, since I have only a couple projects that I actually collaborated on to make. 
Note: the majority of my work is in TypeScript, and I hope that pushing TypeScript is not misunderstood as different than ES7/EcmaScript

Thank you to anyone who read this far, you are the real hero."
7dwn8s,10,2017-11-18,Business Lunch at Work,kenji4589,vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/7dwn8s/business_lunch_at_work/,"I was fortunate enough to get to eat out twice this week for work, and I had very different experiences for each. On Thursday, we had an intern event where the company hosted a trip to an ""Escape the Room"", which is a cool puzzle room where the end goal was to find some hidden item, and lunch afterwards. We went to a steakhouse for lunch and I asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and they said no, but they could stir up some veggies for me, which I declined. I brought my own meal prepared for this and they were kind enough to heat it up for me and put it on a plate, and when all the meals arrived someone commented that my meal looked the best, which was nice of them (I made an Aloo Gobi dish with brown rice). And then on Friday I got lunch with my manager during a business meeting with another company, and since it was a much smaller group I thought it would be rude to bring my backpack and my own lunch. I told them I was vegan before we left, and they picked some burger place with a veggie burger and supposedly really good fries. When we were ordering our food, I noticed all the fries had some sort of cheese on them except the plain fries, but when I mentioned getting plain fries for the table I think they thought that was boring and just ordered two other dishes of fries I couldn't eat. My veggie burger was kind of sad (no buns, but had an avocado slice) and came with a side salad, and the other non-vegan burgers all looked fantastic, so I was kind of disappointed in their vegan option. After the lunch and when I got back to the office with my manager, I quickly got my own lunch that I brought to work and enjoyed it, kind of wishing we could have just skipped lunch all together so I could get to my real lunch sooner. I think the difference between my two lunch experiences just reinforces the concept that non-vegan restaurants could improve their vegan options and I'd rather just bring my own meal because I know it'll be good. It's gotten to the point, for me at least, where if I hear there'll be free food at some event it has no effect on me and if I'm required to sit through some organized dinner for an event I know the foods going to be subpar to what I can make at home and make a back up meal plan for the worst case scenario. I've gone to a few vegan restaurants, and I'm always amazed at the choices available, but only really eat at them when I'm back home with my parents (my mom's vegetarian), which is pretty infrequent. I don't mean to hate on non-vegan restaurants, I'm just saying I'd rather make my own meals and share some of my food with other people than have to pay someone to make me food that's overpriced and not as good as my meals. I do weekly meal prep on the weekend, so there's always a meal available at my home too."

The pay is bad and the job is mentally draining me so right now I'm trying to get a different job but have no experience so I thought about going for a job where I can study on my own. I'm thinking about getting a A++ certification for information technology field to start from bottom and move up as the pay is horrible in my current job and I've been somehow interested in computer from the past. But ultimately, I wish to work as a 3d animator but it's going to be a long road in this field before I can even get a job so I plan to study hard.

So here's the situation;

Although I wish to be 3d animator, I don't think I can last any longer due to mentally killing and low pay job I have right now, so I need to study IT + get certification to get an IT job to support myself and study animation at the same time.

Has anyone ever dealt with a situation of studying for 2 different fields at the same time? "

I just received an admission offer for MSc in CS at Delft (Data Science and Technology Track). I had a couple of things to ask.

* I didn't fully understand the coursework to be followed. Apart from the 5 courses, what is the rest of coursework going to be like? Is it electives from the same department? Can I choose electives from other departments as well? (Refer Page 2 of https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Onderwijs/Opleidingen/Master/Brochures/Data%20Science%20%26%20Technology%20%28DST%29%20DEF.pdf )

* If any current / past graduate from the course could comment, what are the best courses to choose (from the department of CS / other departments)?

* I am from an electronics background, and don't really have a strong base in computer science fundamentals. Most of what I know is self-taught. Are there provisions to take any bachelor level courses during the studies? How expensive are they? I understand it probably might be too difficult to accommodate them during the normal coursework of MS, when is the best time to get through them? Reason I ask for this, is because I feel most companies ask for the basics (DS, Algo, etc) for their recruitment process, and I think attending a class is the best way to master them.

* Coming to jobs, how are job prospects, especially for data science and technology graduates as a Non-EU student. What kind of companies have graduates gone on to work with? What kind of job profiles?

* Are there any entrepreneurship focused clubs, fraternities, etc? What kind of experience can I expect there?

* As a Master's student, is it possible to work with any of the dream teams? (1. Are we eligible? 2. If yes, is time available for a typical MS student?)

* How are the possibilities for part-time jobs during the studies? I understand that we can either work 10 hours / week or do an internship? Which among these is the better option? Which one is more plausible? Also, the part time is 10 hours / week for how long?

* What are the best clubs / fraternities to join during the introduction program? What are the roles of these clubs during the course of MS? Is there any group of people who train and compete in international coding competitions?

7dxwtc,2,2017-11-18,Her name was Sarah. And I’ve been writing. A lot.,sagealexander97,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7dxwtc/her_name_was_sarah_and_ive_been_writing_a_lot/,"Like I said. I’ve been writing a lot. I’ve gone to therapy. I’ve talked to my parents. I’ve talked to other friends and family. But here I am. Sitting alone in front of the TV with leftovers from yesterday, watching a TV show I’ve seen a million times. It was my first day at my new job today, and all I wanted to do was text her. Call her. Have her call me. Have her FaceTime me. But no; all because I fucked it up. Everything below is everything I’ve written since the breakup (August 10th, this year). It’s a lot so feel free to skip if need be. Call me pathetic, call me a crybaby, call me whatever breakup stereotype comes to mind. I sent her an email pouting my heart out, wishing she’d read it, but no response. Eh but what the hell. If you’re willing to sift through three months of writing, drop an opinion. Let me know what you think. I’ll let the masses judge me. I love her, and I miss her; and everything below I believe greatly expresses that. Waste time at your own discretion. But more importantly, be gentle. Thanks guys. 


To Sarah:

I️ know that you don’t have any reason to talk to me, and I️ know that you really don’t want to. But these past few months have been really hard for me; because I️ haven’t gotten over our relationship. I️ wake up and fall asleep feeling like absolute shit wanting nothing more than to talk to you, but I️ can’t for fear that you’ll call the cops on me. I️ don’t know what I️ did to deserve that threat, because I’ve never harassed or cajoled you in any form of communication whatsoever that would warrant that threat. Please, call me, text me, email me, please Sarah give me something here. Please. I️ still love you. I️ still love you so much with everything that I️ have. And I️ can’t help but find myself crushed under the pressure of wishing I️ could explain myself and show you who I️ truly am, and not what you’ve decided to label me as. I will never forgive myself for what I️ did to us. But I’m still here, and I’m still waiting. Because you still mean everything in the world to me. And then some. I️ love you. Please call. I’ll be here whenever you decide to. 

Over these last few months I’ve tried to pin the 
relationship on you. I’ve tried to wonder why and how you are doing as well as you are because it really does look like you are doing so much better without me and that hurt me for really really long time. But I know that it’s not your fault. Obviously completely wrong move to just immediately try and find out how you were the one who fucked it all up because it was me; as you and I both know that it was me and everybody who I’ve talked to knows that it was me it was my fault. 

When I was hanging around Bijou, I️ tried to tell myself that time shouldn’t have a priority over happiness, because for the last couple of months I have been believing that I meant nothing to you and that the last three years also meant nothing to you and now I know that that’s simply true. I know that you did love me, you did care about me you totally completely utterly wanted to follow through on all of our dreams together just as much as I do. But I deluded myself into thinking that I was happy being around Bijou instead and I wasn’t happy with you. Therefore happiness overcame time and for a brief moment our relationship didn’t matter to me. Sarah; I am so sorry for that, because I will never love again. 

I will never truly have the happiness and the corroboration and the the love and the trust that you and I had. You were my first girlfriend, my first love, my first everything and now it’s all gone because of what I did to us. And I accept that. I️ accept that is my responsibility and it is my fault and it is my duty to fix it anyway that I know how. But that little inkling of sadness that little hole in my heart has been filled by you, the realization of the happiness that you are the one and only person that I am truly meant to be with, and that you are my one and only love. And I have come to the conclusion that I’m just gonna have to keep waiting. 

I’m going to wait as long as it takes for you to truly forgive me for my mistakes and to truly move on because I don’t want to start over. I don’t want to forget about this. I want to learn from it, mature from it, and make myself better for you and you alone in the future because that’s how love works. That’s how I️ work. And don’t want to spend my days without you. And with one final chance, I️ want to show you that I will never make the same mistakes again. This is Sage 2.0, this is new Sage, this is Mr. and Mrs. Sage Alexander call it whatever you want to, but Sarah; baby, I’m back. And I am never ever going away. I promise you for as long as it takes to the end of my days. 

Even if I have to do it alone okay? Because I will. 

Because you’re worth it to me. You are worth so much more, so much more than I ever let you see. But I am never going to skip out on my love for you ever again. And for the rest of my life I am going to spend all of my days in each and every last breath showing that.  

Because I love you with every fiber of my being. With every beat of my heart, with every breath I take, every move I make: all of me belongs to you. So you take all the time that you need. Live your life, take a break, be happy. But if you ever change your mind; your boyfriend, your best friend, your one true love, your man will be here waiting. 

Because forever Sarah: I love you.

I️ know that I️ hurt her first. And moreover because I fucked over the both of us saying “you don’t have to be scared of me, I won’t hurt you”. And I know she’s trying as hard as she can to get over me and get rid of the pain I caused her. But no matter what she says or does and no matter how she tries to push me away I can’t get her out of my head. Days are spent thinking about her and worrying and wondering if she’s with another guy. And it sucks it really does. Some days I pray for peace and others I pray she’ll come back to me. I️ don’t know why. I can’t say why. I wish I knew what the hell was going on. 

I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I put so much into my relationship with her. She was my first girlfriend. She was my first love. She was my best friend. She was my first kiss. She was my first I love you. I based my identity off of she was my first everything. And now that she’s gone, so is who I am; or at least: was. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I invested so much into the idea of what the relationship made me. I invested everything in the fact that this was my first relationship, this was my girlfriend, this was my best friend, this was my wife. I thought of how lucky I was, and I saw what had happened with us and thought how incredible was it that I could find my soul mate in high school and take a deep sigh and say “okay, I’m done.”  Without having that in my life, I’m so fucking lost. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

We were supposed to get married. I told her that. I told her we were meant for each other that we were soul mates. And she believed me. I found her and I said “you’re beautiful, and I’m gonna marry you.” She was the first girl I said “I love you” to. And she was the first one to say it back to me and mean it. I really really thought she loved me. And now I’m losing her to somebody else. Whoever else that may be. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I can’t even talk to her. Did I mention that? She made me wait 30 day intervals to be able to talk to her. She said don’t talk to me for a month. And so I didn’t. We talked a month later. She said again, don’t talk to me for a month; but she added, if you want any sort of chance if you want any brownie points in my mind if you want to even start to maybe being my friend again, don’t talk to me for a month. I respected her boundaries and we talked a month later. Then she said, “don’t ever speak to me again. And if you try to, I’ll tell the cops you’re harassing me”. I can’t even try to make it better, I have no option to even explain myself or speak to her for fear that she’ll point to me and force a criminal record on me. I can’t even talk to her for fear of this damning mark that would stick with me for the rest of my life. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I think I’ve been discussing something with my therapist that I️ really haven’t been telling anyone else.  It’s kind of a motif that’s come about in the last two sessions. People think that the biggest problem I️ have with the break up is trying to find out “who I️ was” before it or who I’m supposed to be after it. And it has to do a lot with school or work or my relationship with God, hobbies or whatever else I️ do And I️ think that all of those yes are a part of my identity, but they’re all facts of life that I’m already well aware of and, really, already have them taken care of. And the one thing in me that hasn’t gotten attention and that is lacking is my love life. But that’s what it is I️ have all my shit taken care of. School, work, hobbies? Whatever I️ have all of my ducks in a row everything except my life with Sarah is taken care of. And I️ have this one thing that’s missing now and I️ don’t know what to do. I️ was still in the infancy of my relationship it was still growing and all of a sudden it got SUDS and died. This is kind of like losing a child I️ guess I’m saying. It was something that is new to me and my life and I️ haven’t developed fully yet. I already know where I️ am and where I’m going in school and I️ already know what I️ want to do after, I️ have my friends and family relationships and my relationship with Sarah, now null and void, is quite literally the one thing thats come and gone without being completed or “taken care of”. Everything except for my life with her is set to fall like a domino effect lying out the final product (what all the dominoes look like when they’re pushed down). The final product being me and who I️ am. And that’s why I️ feel like I’m the only one who believes in the cause to get her back that’s why I️ feel like I’m alone in this when I️ can’t conform to what everybody else is telling me to do “move on” “distract yourself” whatever. Why I️ chose to replace my Sarah domino with my Bijou domino is temptation and sin. And something that I️ shouldn’t have allowed in my mind life and relationship with Sarah. I️ should’ve incorporated our faith in our relationship a lot more than we did. There were only a few times when her and I️ would pray together. And when I️ say few I️ mean “unable-to-pinpoint-exactly-when-over-the-last-three-years” few. 

I'm sorry. 

I'm sorry for causing you pain this past 3 years. I'm sorry for all those fights. For being over dramatic and territorial. I'm sorry for questioning your loyalty. I'm sorry for flaring up and not being able to control myself at the worst times. I'm sorry for doing my part in the controlling aspect of this relationship. I'm sorry for not communicating properly. I'm sorry for all the poor and detrimental decisions I have made in this relationship and I am sorry for causing what ever pain I did. I'm sorry for everything I did wrong these past 3 years. And I'm sorry I was the sole purpose for all of it ending. It was the best three years of my life, but I don't want it to end. I can't live without you in my life. I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks, time and time again I've proved to myself that I can't live my life to the fullest without you. I want my life to be a part of yours and I want your life to be a part of mine. I'm sorry I was disloyal to you. I'm sorry I lied to you, I'm sorry that mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake I made you deal with the same shit over and over and over again. I was a hapless bully to you and a witless punk to your parents. I manipulated and abused you. And I chastised you for seeing right through me at the worst of times when I doubted our relationship. I regret that. I regret taking you for granted. I regret not holding you tighter, not hugging you longer, for not kissing you more often. I want to be better, I need to be better in order for this to work; and I'm trying. I need you in my life I need you way more than you need me, I understand that. I'm sorry that I hurt you, and I don't ever want to do that again. I don't ever want to make you cry again. I've missed you. I've missed you so much throughout these last few weeks. I've convinced myself before that I was better off without you, that I shouldn't have wasted your time as long as I did. But I don't want to look at our relationship and see a waste of time, because it wasn't for me, it wasn't a waste of time. I have heart aches and pains every single day without having you here for me. I hate having no one to talk to, no one to back me up, no one to advocate for me, no one to stand up for me, to support me, to have all the time in the world for me like you did. You called. You texted. You FaceTimed. You told me that you loved me. You made time for me, you spent your time off school here for me. Here for the both of us. And forever in my heart will I cherish our times alone that we had together. Getting to take you to class, kissing you goodbye before my day started with classes or my night started with work, coming home to see you there laying in my bed, watching my tv or on the computer. I loved being there with you and playing house. I love you Sarah. I want to make your heart melt again. I want to love you again. You are an amazing person with a lot to offer anyone who comes in proximity to you, let alone gets to know you. And I'm sorry I became one of those people you hung up your feelings on and treated you the way that I did. Because truth be told, I wasn't worth your time. You have incredible things to offer people whether it be your ability to teach anyone basic manners and proper demeanor and disposition or it be the positive outlook you have on practically anything. You're smart. You're humble. You're kind and you have a lot more to offer than you care to realize. And that's why I love so much about you. So many people thrive off of the positive energy that you can have. The way you interacted with me at any point during the day isn't anything I should have passed up. I had fun spending time with you, and it's abhorrent that not every single time I interfaced with you did I have the common decency or sense to understand why you mean so much to me. Because you have absolutely no idea just how much I would give up just to have you back in my life again. I want you to understand why I'm telling you this and how I want to show you I've grown and become better from all of this horrible shit I've put you through, and all of the horrible shit I've been through. I’m sorry. For the times I hurt you, for the times I lied to you, and for everything other reason I’ve given you to be mad at me. I know my apologies might not mean anything to you, and that I’ve put hurt and devastation on you far beyond instant repair, but beyond from that all, all I can tell you is that I promise to try to be better for you in the future. If there is a future. I love you. I just want to tell you: thanks for everything. I know I haven't been an ideal person to be around in general but I really love and respect you even though I rarely show it. I don't know if you've noticed but I haven't a single friend and my family life is not. You are a significant bright spot in my otherwise dismal being and even when you get short tempered with me I know at the end of the day you still have my back and I thank you for that. I love you. And I want nothing more than to show you, with one final chance. That we belong together. And that for the rest of my life; I love you.

Sarah,

I’m here to tell you that I respect your decision. I apologize for everything I have done to cause you hurt. I have heard what you have said and I will be doing some soul searching (and work) to make sure I do not repeat my mistakes in the future, and so I thank you for that.  I wish you nothing but the best and I will always cherish the time we spent together. 

I know we’ve had a lot of differences and disagreements before, during, and after our break up, and I’m sorry for pushing your buttons and boundaries as much as I did. Sarah, you mean everything in the world to me, and I am so sorry I didn’t take advantage of our relationship and our happiness when I had the chance to. 

But that’s all I can offer you, is my deepest and sincerest apologies, and to promise in the future that it will never happen again. Because I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am sorry you believe that I belittled you and abused you. I’m sorry that you would see me as a threat to your safety, because I would never. And I know deep inside you know that that’s just not true, and I’m sorry you’re putting that on me. I am absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and very perplexed that you would think that but I can’t change how you feel; but, I will take responsibility for your feelings and I am very sorry. You know me Sarah and I would never hurt you and I know you know that. 

Nevermatter, I will forever cherish our time together. Being high school sweethearts, Friday night lights, school dances (Sadie Hawkins and me flying home for your senior prom being my personal favorites), the time we got together over last fall break playing house together and our time together over Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks too. I know the summer wasn’t everything we had hoped for, and I know I had a lot of shortcomings and faults over the last few months. But beside all that, I want us both to remember the good, because I know that we did have good in our relationship; and I’m sorry you’ve decided to carry the burden of remembering only the bad. 

But, I digress, I can’t change that about you, and if you decide to live that way and see us as that then I can’t control that either. And I can’t change the way you see me, at least not overnight, and I pray and hope you do eventually decide to change that thinking; wherever or whomever it may be coming from. I wish you could see us how I did and do now; and I hope one day you’ll truly forgive me for my mistakes. 

I did love you, Sarah; and I still do. I do truly love you. I know you don’t ever want to see me again, and words can’t describe how deeply that hurts me. And I am really hopeful that one day you’ll change your mind, as a friend or otherwise. Please remember that we did share a lot of amazing times and dreams together. But I’ve come to the realization that it is time to let you go and see what’s meant to be. 

If you ever need to talk, I’ll be here. And if you ever change your mind, there will be a man waiting here for you. And if I’m ever blessed enough to have you back in my life; I’m never letting you go again. 

Until I get to see you again; best wishes, Sarah Brown. 

With love, your best friend, your Livewire:

Sarah:

I know you didn’t want to hear from me, but I’m sending this to try and express to you what you mean to me, and what this break up has been doing to me over these last few months. I’ve wanted for so long to call you or to text you or to contact you some how. But was unable to, for fear that you would report me for trying to do so and would leave me here left with a damning mark on my record. But now I’m here taking a leap of faith, and would hope that you would just hear me. 

I apologize for everything I have done to cause you hurt. I have heard what you have said about taking our time apart and I will be doing a lot of changing and soul searching (and work) to make sure I do not repeat my mistakes in the future, and so I thank you for that. I wish you nothing but the best and I will forever and always cherish the time we spent together. I know we’ve had a lot of differences and disagreements before, during, and after our break up, and I’m sorry for pushing your buttons and boundaries as much as I did. 

Sarah: you still mean everything in the world to me, and I am so sorry I didn’t take advantage of our relationship and our happiness when I had the chance to. Every day I’ve woken up and gone to sleep wasting away inside and out aching over what I did to us. It wasn’t because I was unattractive to you, it wasn’t because of the distance, it wasn’t because we had too many disagreements or fought too often; no. This happened because I betrayed your trust. This happened because of me and my faults. And instead of communicating to you properly as I should have done as the man I wanted to be in your life, I drove you away and ran the opposite direction. I can’t believe I’ve hurt you like this. I promised you, I told you, and I made sure that you believed that I would never hurt you. I should have kept my word to you, and I hate myself for breaking all of our trust, promises, hopes, and dreams we spent so much time building together. Sarah, I am so sorry for what happened to us. And I am dying every single day wishing that I could have you in my life; and that I could be called yours again. I wish that I could do it all over again, that I could go back and change who and how I was, and be who I was supposed to be to you.

I pray, plead, and beg with tears in my eyes and pain in my chest every day and night that one day, God will bring you back to me. But all I have been told to do is to accept that all of this pain and all of what is happening to me and my mental health will lead to something amazing in my life, whether that be with or without you. I can’t sit here and tell you that I’m over you, because I’m not. And I know it will take everything that I have and an extremely long time for you to get out of my head. Because you are everything to me. You were my best friend. My first love, my babygirl, my high school sweetheart, my honey, and my one and only. And I am absolutely outraged, disgusted, and torn apart inside and out that I became so blind and selfish that I lost sight of that. 

I can feel who I was dying inside. The hopeless romantic, the guy who believes in love at first sight, the guy who believes that firsts are everything, the one who believes in saying things like “you’re beautiful and I’m gonna marry you”. I can feel him wasting away, and I don’t want that. I don’t want to lose that part of me, because that part of me is who got you in the first place. I didn't really have an identity before our relationship, and with you in my life I invested everything I have and everything that I was into the relationship. I put so much stock in being the guy who married his first girlfriend, that were the high school sweethearts who made it, that for me, it was one and done. And now that you’re gone, so is that identity. I don’t know who I am anymore, and I know that I need to invest a lot of time and energy working on that. 

I put so much hope into our future. I loved planning out the rest of our lives together. Starting from where we would get married, to Santorini, to what my last written words to you would ever be after I’m gone. That plan still holds value in my life. People have been telling me to move on, to find someone else, and to find value in other aspects of my life, and ultimately, to distract myself with work, school, and my career prospects. And to a certain degree, that is true that I should focus my time and energy in that, rather than wallowing in the mire over what was and what could have been with us. But you know what kind of guy I am. I have all of my ducks in a row. School and work are taken care of and my future career is looking up just as we had planned, and I wanted nothing more than to share my recent experiences with you. I wanted to tell you about the meet and greet I had at the police academy here and I wanted to hear you tell me “good luck”. I wanted to tell you about the new details I’ve gotten about my internships with Northwestern or Bain and hear you tell me “good job baby” or “I’m so proud of you”. I want to talk to you, to communicate with you. For me to tell you about my day and you tell me about yours and us have interest and conversation about what’s going on in each other’s lives. I had so much hope in our plans, and I still want to be the man in your life that gets to say “I do”. There’s so much in my life right now that is solidifying and I wanted nothing more than to share these experiences with you and follow through on all of the plans that we made. Like the times we used to joke about us getting you the best, newest, biggest truck on the market, lifted to the moon, and all decked out with the perfect pink and teal paint job and all the details and accessories you wanted so that you would able to show off to friends, family and guests, while on the other side of the garage, I’d tell people “yeah I got a new window motor” in my old ass truck, just because we could, and were that different and had our own personal tastes and dreams that we adored in each other. Those were good, fun, wholesome times having those plans and those jokes with you. 

I know that I can’t change your mind, but I want to extend an olive branch to you, because that’s all I can offer you: is my deepest and sincerest apologies. And I want to promise you that in the future, what I’ve done will never happen again. Because I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am sorry that I belittled you and that you would think that I abused you. I’m sorry that you would see me as a threat to your safety. Because I know, deep inside, you know that that’s just not true, and I’m sorry that you’re putting that on me. I am absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and perplexed to the point of pure torture that you would think that, but I can’t change how you feel. But, I will take responsibility for your feelings and I want to tell you that I am very sorry. But you know me Sarah, and you know that I would never hurt you intentionally like that, and I know you know that. 

I loved having you in my life and as a part of my family. And every single one of my relatives you’ve met and assimilated with before have agreed that you were a really really good fit with all of us. I loved knowing that my family adored you. My family loved and embraced you with open arms. But, even from the beginning, I always felt I wasn’t accepted into your family. I know and understand that I had a big part to play in that. But you can’t discredit that regardless of my shortcomings, and regardless of what I did and said to make your parents not like me, that I never tried. I did try, Sarah, and you and I both know that no matter how much I didn’t like it, I tried. Maybe my efforts weren’t enough or maybe I wasn’t good enough. I could tell you that maybe your family environment was too far opposite compared to how I was brought up, but maybe also I could have done more to compromise. And I know that I could use some maturing in that field as well. I never should have expected you to try and keep the peace between your parents and me. I understand that you, yourself, were trying to stay off the radar, and had your own struggles keeping the peace between yourself and your parents. And I’m very sorry that I added to that stressful part of your life. 

I won’t ever forgive myself for destroying everything we’d built up, and throwing away all the time we spent together. But, like I said before, I will forever cherish our time together. All that I have been able to do since August is look over our memories with fondness. Watching the video of you opening the prom-posal I made for you, watching the video of me surprising you when I flew home for your senior prom, the thousands of pictures I have of the both of us, the text messages, the scrapbook from fall break last year: it’s all still here and it all still really means something to me. I haven’t been able to let you go. Us being high school sweethearts, ‪Friday night‬ lights, our school dances (Sadie Hawkins and your senior prom being my personal favorites), the time we got to spend together over last fall break playing house, our time together over Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks, and having you as a New Year’s kiss too. All of those hours and miles spent in my truck, driving to and from the beach, all of our little adventures, date nights, and super-date days. And every single time, without fail, you’d take the middle seat next to me. You loved being there, and I adored having you there with me. And I should have shown you more love, appreciation, time, and affection for all that you did to and for me in our time spent together. 

I know the summer wasn’t everything we had hoped for, and I know I had a lot of shortcomings and faults that fueled fights and conflict between us over the last few months. As I should, I take full responsibility for that, and I won’t ever forgive myself for losing out on you. The time I’m having to deal with now, is like the time I had to deal with before after our first breakup. All that time with you is now gone  it’s passed, it’s over, and I wasn’t there. But besides all that, I want us both to remember the good, because I know that we did have good in our relationship; and I’m sorry you’ve decided to carry the burden of only remembering good memories tainted with bad ones. But I can’t change that about you, and if you decide to live that way and see us as that and nothing more than a stepping stone or a learning experience, then I can’t control that either. And I know that I can’t change the way you see me, at least not overnight. But I pray and hope you do eventually decide to allow me to change that thinking; wherever or whomever it may be coming from. I wish you could see us how I did and do now; and I hope one day you’ll truly forgive me for my mistakes. 

Words can’t express what you mean to me. Because if I could take everything good that I have in my life, all my experiences and all my happiness, and joy and good that I have, and put it in a bowl or something to offer it up, and say “Here. Just give me one more chance with her”. I’d be okay with that. I did love you, Sarah; and I still do. I do truly love you. I know you don’t ever want to see me again, and words can’t describe how deeply that hurts me. And I am really hopeful that one day you’ll change your mind, as a friend or otherwise. Please remember that we did share a lot of amazing times and dreams together. But I’ve come to the realization that it is time to truly prove that I do love you and let you go to see what’s meant to be. 

I know that there's a lot of pain and suffering in this world; and you and I have seen and experienced it first hand with the time we spent out of the country. I also know it’s a long shot to hope that this letter will help or change anything, but if I am to really and truly let you go and move on, I hope that this letter will at least facilitate us ending on a semi-good note so that we aren’t left feeling vulnerable to the worst parts this world has to offer. I really do hope the best for you and I hope that you feel the same way for me. Because that’s all I want, is for you to be happy. And at the end of the day, reality wins. And the reality, is that I’ll always love you, no matter what.

If you ever need to talk, I’ll be here. And if you ever change your mind, there will be a man waiting here for you. And if I’m ever blessed enough to have you back in my life again; I’m never letting the same mistakes come between us. 

Until I get to see you again:
Best wishes, Sarah Brown. 

With insurmountable love, your best friend, your Livewire:

7dy3jt,1,2017-11-18,I lied to my university's advisor and now I don't know what to do,i_lovegiraffes,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7dy3jt/i_lied_to_my_universitys_advisor_and_now_i_dont/,"So I'm both an intern and full time in a graduate program. Over the last month I've been cheated on by my boyfriend, I cut my dad out of my life, and my sister has been in and out of the hospital and doctors offices with stage 4 kidney disease and mental health issues. She doesn't need dialysis now but will in the somewhat near future. Taking care of her has been a family effort.

All of this is super overwhelming. I have some mental health issues myself, including depression and anxiety. Lately I've been so anxious that I have been sick to my stomach and depressed as well. I'm doing my best to keep surviving but with all of that I'm behind in my classes. So badly that I'm going to fail one of my classes as of tomorrow. 

I decided to talk to my advisor about it. I was talking to her and I didn't want to tell her about all my life drama and that I have mental health issues and that I can't handle this shit... So I lied. I told her that my sister is starting dialysis and I take her to a lot of appointments so I'm behind. I made her illness sound more severe and demanding because I didn't want to people to judge my lack of stability and question my sanity forever.

She ended up giving me a few extra weeks to finish my classwork.

I feel so bad for lying about it. I needed an out so I didn't have to reveal my emotional issues but still get a much needed extension but I think I crossed a line. The worst part is that my cohort found out so now everybody feels bad for me. 

What should I do?

7dyfem,3,2017-11-18,Possible Internships for Undergraduates interested in Statistics?,Sciencekid42,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7dyfem/possible_internships_for_undergraduates/,"I am not sure where to ask this question, but I'll ask it here because I'm doing currently doing a Math/Stat major. I am currently in my sophomore year in college and will have many of the ""computation"" math-courses finish by the end of this semester. I have completed Calculus I-III and Introduction to Statistics (Not Calculus Based), and will finish Introduction to Linear Algebra and Discrete Math when the semester ends. I currently have 3.93 GPA and tutor at my college which I believe might help get interviews. The real problem is that I'm lost about how to look for possible internships with my particular interest. I am aware that not having some proof-based classes or higher level classes will hurt my chances, but I'm personally looking for any kind of internship that will help me get started with working in the job industry for any type of Statistics-focused job. 

Another reason for posting here is that I am curious what internships you did during your Undergraduate, so I can address my current options.

Thank you for any advice."
7dyfly,6,2017-11-18,I don't know how to recover from stupidity,shadeslayer89,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/7dyfly/i_dont_know_how_to_recover_from_stupidity/,"I'll be honest, I was going to create a throwaway for this but as it is the single greatest fuck up of my life, I think I deserve to be shamed, yelled at. 

I let the girl of my dreams go without even telling her how I felt about her. 

Growing up with pretty much nothing, only money enough for food, I was always conscious and careful with the decisions I made. I never asked a girl out in high school, even though I had so many crushes (I'll never know if any of them were both ways) because I didn't have money for a fun night at the movies, or even just to go chill and bowl. In college, I was frugal as my scholarship only paid my tuition and I still had to work for some extra money for books - living in the basement of a friend really helped me out.  Once again, even though I had a major crush on a girl from freshmen year, I never asked her out for fear of not having enough money.

Then a golden opportunity came by and I took it. An internship at a top fortune 500 firm, working more hours than going to class, paid off and I got a job that made my money problems disappear. My aim was always to first get a job that set me up for the next 10 years so I can pursue what I really wanted - medicine or engineering. I got the job, worked for 6 years, got the money I needed and I quit. I entered medical school and literally on the first day of anatomy class, there she was. I knew instantly that she was the one, I don't know how, or when, it was just like an electrical feeling. 

I remember being nervous when I first talked to her, but it was so easy after the first minute. It was like we knew each other our whole lives. We were partners for everything, blood drawing, practicals - I think that being together on the same team relaxed us so that we could do our best. We talked about everything.

I was there for her when her boyfriend broke up with her. She cried for two whole nights but I was there just to listen. I was heartbroken that after a week ( I thought I'd give her space) she hooked up with another guy in our class. And this thing repeated several times through out the 4 years, and idiot me was always just too late to tell her how my feelings for her had grown. 

I couldn't believe how unbelievably lucky I was that we both matched at the same hospital. This time, I told myself, I would definitely tell her. I didn't have any money problems any more, I never had any confidence problems, so this is it, I have to tell her. But before I could, the resident she worked under asked her out. 

And today(after 6 months of dating), she just called me 10 minutes ago to say he proposed and she said yes. I went through the motions, because I am truly, deeply happy for her. She deserves happiness. 

But I can't help but feel my heart drop like a stone. I feel so truly stupid."

I am at a career crossroads and would like to get any perspective or opinions as I can.


I will have four years experience early next year, and I will receive my stamp when that happens. I’ve passed the PE exam.  I have two suitors that have contacted me in the last few months.  I will be getting an offer next week from one, and probably one from the other shortly after.  I’ve been open with both about my situation, who I’m talking to.


I was hired by Company A (Small local firm, Land Dev, Water Rec, Transpo, Drainage, Survey -&gt; 100 employees)out of school to be on their drainage team.  We did a lot of private work and some public works jobs as well.  I like H and H work and I feel that I’ve reached a certain level of competency that I feel comfortable with.  The team at Company A was very respected and I loved working with them.  They produced very high quality work.  The team consisted of a supervisor, 3 PMs, 2-3 EIs and the occasional intern.  The PMs didn’t seem like they were ever going to leave.  However, during 2016, we seemed to be losing a lot of bigger jobs that we should have gotten. A different firm called me up during the summer of 2016 and asked me to interview.  I perceived a ceiling that I would hit once I received my stamp. There didn’t seem like enough space for me to become a PM.  Since I was updating my resume I sent it out to any companies with postings.  


Company B (Small loca firm, Land Dev, Drainage and Survey -&gt; 50 Employees) offered me a job. The drainage team consisted of a supervisor and 2-3 EIs.  I was hired with the anticipation that I would become the supervisor shortly, since the supervisor, “Andy”, wanted to move to land dev and become a PM.  This is the main reason I moved from Company A to Company B.I was not anticipating this happening for 2-3 years.  However, this last summer (2017) the exec team wanted to move Andy over to become PM.  They discussed moving me into the supervisor role but felt that I was not ready...I needed more experience to do everything a supervisor entails.  They’ve been looking since.  At my annual review with Andy, he mentioned that some in the exec team wanted to move me into the position “sink or swim” but he felt that I wasn’t ready.  I am fine with this assessment. I don’t even have a stamp yet.  However, it seems that most of the stuff I need to learn to perform well as a supervisor I can’t learn in my current position as an EI.  


Since they started the search for a supervisor (their post wants 10+ years experience for the position). I’ve been coordinating between Andy, who is doing double duty as the drainage supervisor and a land Dev PM. I basically have a weekly meeting with him, get marching orders and the supervise and coordinate work with the other Eis and interns.  He peaks in periodically as needed.


The search started in August, and I feel the longer it goes on the closer I get to the exec. Team deciding that I am ready.

In September, Company C contacted me.  Company C is a mid level (300 employees) regional firm that is opening (3 years old) an office in my city.  They have a drainage team in the HQ, but they would like someone with local experience to work on Land Dev (a small group right now), and public works jobs.  The office lead impresses me as he’s been able to win jobs from away from larger firms.  I would support their land dev. Team with drainage and work on their public works jobs.  I would probably get a wider range of tasks since they don’t currently have enough for me to bill 100% to just drainage stuff.  I would be somewhat alone, but company C spoke with “Bobby” who I worked under at Company A, and Bobby gave me a ‘glowing reference’.  Bobby is not one to sugar coat stuff or give a false reference.  Gives me confidence in my ability to work a the lone drainage person in an office. (I’d still have support from the HQ drainage team). I’m okay with this since the more knowledge and experience, the better.


Also, in September, a new supervisor from Company A called and they would like for me to come back. (The ceiling I originally perceived is gone.  The old supervisor and 3 PMs are all gone, and the new supervisor is building up their team.)  I would quickly be able to lead projects and direct EIs in their work, with supervisions.


My goal is to gain as much supervisory experience as I can as soon as I can.

Company B - Current Company - Possibly become a supervisor and lead a department of 2-3 others. Or they hire a supervisor and I’m stuck as an underling.


Company A - My former company, would quickly be able to lead my own work.

Company C - Lone wolf in a small, growing office.  If drainage work picked up, they would definitely hire one with much more experience than me.


My preference would be to become the supervisor at my current company, Company B...but that is up in the air.

I hope I explained my situation clearly. But please. Let me know what you think."
7dysgr,2,2017-11-19,3.2 At an SMP :(,fahrishta,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7dysgr/32_at_an_smp/,"This is a bit tough for me to write out, because it makes it all the more real. I didn't want to post this in the 'what are my chances' as I feel like there's more to this.

Basically - and I really do not mean to sound like a sob story - but I've had a tough life that consisted of working to make ends meet to support my family. My grades suffered. My undergraduate cGPA was a 3.40, my sGPA was around 3.45. I did a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences with a minor in pharm. tox. I also stupidly took multiple tough courses &amp; packed them into my semesters. Obviously, I ended up with a whole lot of B's. Thankfully, just one C+. But still, not great. I knew if I had spaced them out like my fellow pre-meds, I would've done much much better. 

I decided to do an SMP to bring my GPA high. All I will say is that it was affiliated with a medical school and we took courses alongside medical students. Grad students were graded on a bell curve, though. I thought that life was a bit easier and I would be able to handle it just fine. But that's not what happend. A lot of unfortunate circumstances (family + death of a loved one) and the resulting crippling depression - all led me to finish my SMP with mediocrity. Yet again. I graduated with a 3.2. A whole lotta B's, once again. 

Normally, at this point anyone else would have accepted defeat. But I knew that the minimal time I got to study was the reason for those B's. And I applied for another SMP (oh god, don't remind me of the insane amounts of loans I have now). It was a bit of a rash decision, but I've been able to ace my exams thus far and I very much expect a 4.0 this semester. This completely has to do with the fact that I went through therapy + let my family know that I could no longer sacrifice my dreams. 

As for the MCAT, I have been studying and have been scoring in the 509/510 range. I still have till April to take it. I know I have to absolutely destroy the test. I took the old MCAT 3.5 years ago, and got a 26.

As for clinical, I have managed to work as a scribe &amp; I'm starting an internship at a free health clinic. I have 2 years of research with a poster. 

But my question is this: What I want to know is if I still have a shot? I want to be sincere in my applications. I want to be completely honest and transparent about the external circumstances and how they prevented me from applying myself. I come from poverty, &amp; I'm a first generation college student (but Asian). This has definitely made it harder to reach my potential.  I know I could have asked this before starting my new SMP, but I knew I was nothing without my GPA. And I knew I wasn't giving up just like that. 

tl;dr I got a 3.2 on my first SMP and I'm doing another one. Will it make up for the bad GPA? Or just look bad?

Edit: I wanna thank all of you for the points you brought up! I can't explain to you how much I appreciate the honestly and feedback, regardless of what it was. ❤️ I hope I can come back on this forum one day with an acceptance. "

She smirks, everything about her facial expression and body language indicating that she is in control, and she knows it. Her white blouse stretches and strains to contain her ample, c cup breasts. She didn't bother with a bra. Her red tartan mini-skirt satisfies the uniform requirement in the most tantalizing way.

&amp;nbsp;

Already, even though this is only your third day, you've heard more than one debate as to whether Miss Kurosawa wears panties. No-one seems to know for sure.

&amp;nbsp;
The whole class watches, waits and listens as you answer the question. NO matter where you look, you see a pair of young female eyes, ready to judge you. A few of them seem to betray pity, but no-one seems like they would be willing to take your place.

&amp;nbsp;

""It is, after all, your own fault - whether you meant well, or it was an honest mistake, you're here because of something you did, aren't you?""
You hesitate still, and the sultry Japanese teacher lashes out, whipping her hand across your face, slapping your cheek. You are surprised by the sound a split second before you feel the sting.

&amp;nbsp;

The crowd erupts in giggles, titters and gasps, which soon die down. Unlike you, they all know better than to be disruptive in Miss Kurosawa's class.
She leans down, putting her face level with yours, giving you a whiff of her expensive perfume.

&amp;nbsp;

""Come on, little white pork bun. Don't be shy. Tell the class and I what you did, so we can move on to your punishment.""

&amp;nbsp;

**The Perfect Weekend.**

&amp;nbsp;

Daddy would love to pat you on the head, and tell you what a good girl you are, straight after he cums down your throat. That would be the way I would always end Date Night, after taking you out to dinner, groping and fondling you every chance I got.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I would cuff you to the bed, and feel you up, bringing you closer and closer to orgasm, then stopping.

&amp;nbsp;

After tormenting you like that for an hour, I would turn the light out.

&amp;nbsp;

In the morning, I would be ready to go again. I'd mount you, and ride away, until I was ready to blast a load into your pussy, spraying your cervix with cum.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I would uncuff you, and have you lick and suck my dick clean. You would cook me breakfast, then I would take you out for a walk, to our favorite quiet, private spot by the river.

&amp;nbsp;

**The best money can buy.**

&amp;nbsp;

You strip down, and step into the full-body scanner, the only way into the facility.

&amp;nbsp;

You have little choice - the small screen on the wall shows your instructions, and states clearly that the machine won't start unless you strip naked, and place all your clothes in the provided compartment.

&amp;nbsp;

You comply, and hear a telltale woof of flames as your clothes are incinerated. Then, suddenly, the lights are out, and you hear only a gentle hum, see nothing, as the machine works its magic. After a minute or so, you feel a small prick in the side of your arm - you were told about this. Your implant.
The door on the opposite side of the small round chamber opens up, revealing the only way forward.

&amp;nbsp;

There is no-one to ask about your clothes.

&amp;nbsp;

You step into the lobby, the real lobby, of the facility. There are people all around, all in the uniform of The Service - a white shirt or blouse, black pants, or culottes.
Your Heads up display kicks in, the progress bar flashing across your field of vision in faint blue, before fading away, leaving only a couple of number in the bottom left.
Looking around, you see some of the staff looking back at you. They stare but don't let their eyes linger too long. You are naked, exposed, but they do not gawk at you like other would, your fans, the general public. Mostly, their gazes are cold, appraising.

&amp;nbsp;

The HUD puts a faint blue arrow right in the middle of your FOV. When you turn your head, it turns to point in the same direction.
After a minute of hesitation, a single word appears:

&amp;nbsp;

""PROCEED"" Over the next minute, it morphs slowly from faint, semi-transparent blue to solid red.
Then the mild tingling starts to happen, running all over your body, in waves, which emanate from your nipples or clitoris. You PROCEED just as the tingling starts to change into a mild shock.

&amp;nbsp;

You are met with stares, but silence, no matter what you say, as you follow the arrow, wandering through the large open lobby, it's marbled floors reflecting little of the white domes walls and ceiling.

&amp;nbsp;

Soon you arrive at my office, and the door opens, to reveal me standing there. ""Good afternoon, Miss [insert name here]. Would you like to get dressed before we begin?""

&amp;nbsp;

I hold out a pink lacy bra and panties, which you will find to be a perfect fit for you.

&amp;nbsp;

I wear the same black pants as all the other male employees, but a red shirt, and a black and red striped tie. I smile invitingly, but continue to stand in the doorway...

&amp;nbsp;

**All according to plan.**

&amp;nbsp;

have a little extra encouragement for my workout today.

&amp;nbsp;

As I lift, I see you on the treadmill. Te cute girl from the office. We have chatted a couple of times. I'm often reserved, but ever since you started, I've been even more so around you.

&amp;nbsp;

This is not because I dislike you, or even want to avoid you for any reason. Quite the opposite, in fact. I like you, I really, really like you. In fact, it's probably more reasonable to say that I am In Lust with you.

&amp;nbsp;

So many times, I have cursed how tantalisingly close you were. Eligible for free use, yet you always made sure to hurry home after work. You never teased or asked for it in the office. Sure, I could have taken you, but that would have meant trouble for me, and maybe you - our place of work has a strict policy against causing 'disruptions'.

&amp;nbsp;

When I found out that we went to the same gym, a plan begin to form in my mind. Today, I'm ready to go through with it. I paid off one of the personal trainers, One I'm friendly with, one who has helped me 'warm up' on more than a few occasions. I told her of my plan, and she just smiled, and opined in her usual bubbly way:

&amp;nbsp;

""Aww, that's kind of sweet.""

&amp;nbsp;

As you head into the showers, she follows you. While you shower, you hides your clothes, locks the towels away, getting every bit of cloth in th change room out of the way, making sure you'll have no choice but to go naked.

&amp;nbsp;

While she does this, I shower myself. I want to look and smell my best for you. I towel off, and change in to a pair of comfy black pants, no underwear, and a tight-fitting white t-shirt, with a thorny rose on the front.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm almost done lacing up my shined leather shoes when Sarah texts:

&amp;nbsp;

""She's getting near the door, tiger. Go get her ;)""

&amp;nbsp;

I hurriedly finish up, apply some cologne, and head out of the male change room. I fling open toe door to the womens, and look you up and down, enjoying the sight of your naked bod for the first time ever.

&amp;nbsp;

I smile, like a kid in a toy shop.

&amp;nbsp;

""Hello there. It's so nice to see you, and so much of you too.""

&amp;nbsp;

I grab your hand, pulling you in close, pressing your naked body against mine.

&amp;nbsp;

""I hope you weren't planing to offer yourself to anyone in particular, because now that you're mine, I don't think I could bare to give you up.""

&amp;nbsp;

**A new direction.**

&amp;nbsp;

On Saturday, as we sit at dinner, and you tell me of your problem, your declining viewership, I hardly realise what I'm saying, until after I have offered to help you gain some 'experience'.

&amp;nbsp;

For years, I've treated you like a daughter, being perfectly chaste with you, only ever offering tasteful advice about your cam shows. I treated you like a princess, keeping you safe and sheltered, allowing you to enjoy your chosen lifestyle.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm worried that you'll be upset, that it will make things awkward between us. But then you stand, and walk over, ready to do as I said, ready to be mine, just like that. I can't believe my luck, but it also feels far too soon. I grab you by the hips and pull you down onto my lap. I press my lips against yours, and softly kiss you, using a little tongue. It's a first for us - we have kissed, affectionately, lovingly, but never like this.

&amp;nbsp;

I finish the kiss, and look into your eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

""Let's take it slow, pumpkin. No need to rush into this. Let's spend a week winding each other up, getting used to the idea of our relationship changing.""

&amp;nbsp;

I give you the money, and clear away the dishes as you head into your studio/bedroom to do one last show for the night.

&amp;nbsp;

On Sunday, I take you out to an adults only park, a place where people can fully enjoy free-use. I make you wear the skimpiest outfit we could find in your cupboard - a top that barely covers your tits, leaving your midriff exposed, a pink tartan micro-skirt, Pink lacy panties. I hold on close to you, knowing that if I don't keep you to myself, some other man could claim you. Finding a quiet spot, with plenty of tree cover, I press you against a large tree, and yank up your flimsy singlet, exposing your tits. I make out with you, passionately, as I fondle your tits, taking that honor for the first time. After just a minute or so, I tell you to wait there, to masturbate if you like.

&amp;nbsp;

I return minutes later with a naked woman, who looks a little like you, Similar curves, but larger, D-cup tits. Laying her down on the soft grass, I mount her, sliding my pants down and sliding my dick inside her. I build up speed, until I am soon hammering away at her, making her tits bounce with every thrust.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't last much longer than five minutes, before I am thrusting my dick into her one last time, groaning with delights, holding myself inside her as I shoot my load into the woman I have just met. I finish this enthusiastic pump and dump by pulling out of her, dragging my cock over her chest to let the last few drops of cum leak out, then zipping up, saying just a single word to her.

&amp;nbsp;

""Thankyou""

&amp;nbsp;

I take your hand, and whisper into your ear: ""I thought about you the whole time.""

&amp;nbsp;

Monday, I have work. but before I leave, I enter your room without knocking, while you are changing. I make out with you, and again fondle your tits. After a minute of this, I let my left hand stray down between your legs, and gently explore the silken folds of your virgin womanhood.

&amp;nbsp;

""I hope you're as excited about your birthday as I am.""

&amp;nbsp;

I gently explore, but don't let my fingertips stray more than a quarter inch past your lips. I spend a couple of minutes gently fondling your pussy, before withdrawing my hand, and offering it up in front of your mouth to lick clean.

&amp;nbsp;

""Another first for us.""

&amp;nbsp;

I smile, kiss you goodbye on the cheek, and leave for work.

&amp;nbsp;

That night, I bring home a girl from the office, an intern. One I've been with before, One I know is a screamer. Normally, I stuff panties in her mouth (one time a pair of yours), or do her when you're not home, or take her elsewhere. But that night, I really let her have it, and I hope you hear every word of it.

&amp;nbsp;

On Tuesday I again feel you up in the morning, going a little further, letting my finger slip an inch past your lips, holding it there for almost a minute, as i gently, ever so gently, rub your clit with my thumb.

&amp;nbsp;

That night, I join you in the shower, soaping you up, spending much longer than is necessary, letting my hands wander over every inch of your body. I spend an inordinate amount of time on your chest, but hardly any between your legs.

&amp;nbsp;

On Wednesday, your collar arrives. You don't notice the courier, as you're busy doing a show, so I find the package on the doorstep. I open it as I sip on a beer on the kitchen, smiling broadly as I see what you spent my money on.

&amp;nbsp;

I wait until your finish your show, until the light we rigged up outside your bedroom door, which lights up in red, illuminating the words 'Girl at work', fades out. Se set this up long ago, so I would never accidentally ruin one of your shows, by knocking on your door, or bursting in.

&amp;nbsp;

""I opened your package, Pumpkin. I feel so honored, that you would label yourself as mine like that.""

&amp;nbsp;

Taking you by the hand, still naked and sopping wet from your show, I lead you down into the living room. We make out again, and I have you kneel on the floor as I sit. Smiling down at you, I gently put my hand around your throat, holding it firmly, though not tight enough to restrict your breathing.

&amp;nbsp;

""You're so amazing, pumpkin. So cute, so sexy, so fuckable.""

&amp;nbsp;

I make a big deal out of putting the collar on you, slowly securing the leather band, closing the clasp. I make you go upstairs and pick out a pair of heels to wear for me - I have always been a sucker for heels.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I take your picture. I have you pose all around the house - bent over, smiling, pouting, sitting, standing. Always naked, except for your collar. I then have you play with yourself, and take more pics.

&amp;nbsp;

""We got some great pics - I think I'll upload the best to your blog. Your fans will love the idea of you getting a little kinkier. Every one of them will want to be 'Sir'""

&amp;nbsp;

You blog is an official website that I set up for you. I have put a lot of effort into it, promoting you, uploading teaser clips from your show, and still frames. I even had more than a few glamour shots done of you.

&amp;nbsp;

On Thursday...

&amp;nbsp;

**A night like this.**

&amp;nbsp;

Just as you finish dressing, your mother knocks on the door, and then enters without waiting for your answer.

&amp;nbsp;

She wears a red bikini, the smallest one you have ever seen. It shows off plenty of her ample D cup tits. The bottom is so tiny that it would show off a lot of hair, if she weren't waxed.

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh wow, you look amazing, so cute, so sexy, so fuckable!""

&amp;nbsp;

Closing the door behind her, she walks over to you, and hugs you, tightly.

&amp;nbsp;

""I can't believe my sweet little girl is all grown up.""

&amp;nbsp;

She lets go of you, ending the hug, and sits on your bed. She runs her hand over the quilt, as if a little nervous.

&amp;nbsp;

""This is it, sweetie. It's about to get really serious. I know you didn't always like Jack, but I'm glad that you trust him. He really wants the best for you. Will you promise to be a good girl for him, to let him train you, to do whatever he asks of you, even if it doesn't feel right? He really is your Daddy, and he knows best.""

&amp;nbsp;

She hears you out and then stands.

&amp;nbsp;

""OK sweetie, I'll leave you to play with your Daddy. Be good for him, OK? I'm off to the beach, a private beach party. I've been assigned to take care of five of the male guests. They are going to be spit-roasting me, bending me over, putting me over their knee, and using the shit out of me all weekend. Can't wait.""

&amp;nbsp;

She giggles, almost like a schoolgirl, then leans in close for a few parting words.

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh, and by the way, we saw what you got up to last night, with your toy. We were both so glad to see you enjoying yourself for once. You should keep it up.""

&amp;nbsp;

She kisses you on the forehead, and then turns and leaves before you have a chance to ask her anything else.

&amp;nbsp;

An hour later, I knock on your door, but unlike your mother, I wait for an answer.

&amp;nbsp;

""Pumpkin? Are you ready to let me in? I think it's time to get started.""

For example, there's a big 4 in tech (Apple, FB, Google, Amazon), and there's a big 4 in accounting (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PWC). Then there's top notch finance firms like JP Morgan, Goldman, etc etc.

Is there such thing for LSci majors? I know there's big pharma, but do they even hire undergrads for summer internships? It seems like it's just research? Am I missing out on something here?"

7e0tp1,122,2017-11-19,I've got to stop - serial makeup and skincare addict.,whattheghoti,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/7e0tp1/ive_got_to_stop_serial_makeup_and_skincare_addict/,"Long post ahead - I've wanted to stop lurking for quite a while, and to officially admit that I have a problem.


I'm /u/whattheghoti, a college student, and I'm addicted to buying makeup. I've always had a slight nagging feeling that I had an addictive personality since I was 13, when I started getting really into skincare - I bought tons and tons of serums, lotions, sheet masks, you name it, I probably had it. What I bought didn't necessarily change over time, it sort of snowballed with shifting ""poisons"" of choice: I had phases for nail polish, hair products, sneakers, boots and knit sweaters (I live in a tropical country and definitely don't need the 40-odd sweaters I own), lipstick, eyeshadow, you know the drill.


My buying or online browsing, based on a comparison of my credit card statements, tends to spike around my exam and midterm periods in university, or whenever I went through a breakup, or stress at work during my internships. I also have body dysmorphic disorder with comorbid depression (which has leant into disordered eating at some points), which does influence my buying habits somewhat. It lends to my tendency to focus a lot on ""external"" buying of things that ostensibly ""make me less ugly"", although I understand logically that this is a toxic mindset heavily influenced by marketing and consumerism. This need to be in control all the time, coupled with high-functioning depression and my need to seem ""above it all"", like the ""perfect"" girl who has her career, academics, looks, and social life all in order, is a toxic cocktail I need to let go off. I defend my makeup/ shopping addiction as a ""lesser"" or ""invisible"" addiction or vice, but is it really that much less of a problem?


I've tried to get it all under control, but have backslided this year, with a high-paying summer internship that enabled lots more buying than a college student can typically afford, which came with a high-stress start-up environment and volatile screaming boss that stressed me out on a daily basis. I have realised grudgingly that shopping as an unhealthy coping mechanism is one way I try to seek ""control"" in high-stress situations and times when I feel helpless, and it lends itself to hoarding and developing poor financial habits that would hurt me in the future.


After some time lurking on MakeupRehab, I made an inventory, and was horrified how much I'd I spent - between an extensive AB routine and a penchant for colour cosmetics, I've spent more than $2000 this year alone. I'm going to be real with myself - very few college students (or normal makeup users who aren't pro MUAs) need this much makeup, or should be spending this much. The same with my skincare: does anyone really need to buy 30ish sheet masks a week, especially when they use at most 3 in the same time period? No, no, no.


I recognise my privilege that my family is doing ""comfortably"" money-wise, my parents are putting me through college (so no student loans or debt of any sort), and that I don't really have much overhead costs myself, but I should be saving and acting more responsible with my money and most definitely not be spending at the rate I do. Just because I have that money doesn't mean I should be blowing it on things I don't need - and definitely not in a ""just because I can"" way.


Why I'm posting today? 15 minutes ago, I almost checked out a $300 cart on Sephora with a particular matte mid-end palette that received a B- on Temptalia along with two other matte quads, was about to get out my credit card, and realised I had to stop: I have a 15-pan custom MAC palette and many other palettes with higher quality dupes of those same shades. I was already struggling to rotate those palettes I have to give them all the love they should be getting, did I actually need these same shades just because they were in a packaging I didn't already have? No, good Lord, no.


I've been on a no-buy this month, and am looking to continue this with the exceptions of replacements for absolute necessities - only my HG products when I've panned everything in those categories - my MAC Pro Longwear Nourishing foundation, KVD brown Tattoo Liner, and NARS RCC - though I might not repurchase this as it's too warm but passable under foundation. No dupe-hunting, no impulse buying, no ""I'm-bored-at-work Colourpop hauls"", none of this and no more excuses.


I guess I just wanted to share my experience to anyone willing to listen, to start constructively moving towards rehab, and to get some advice in general. If anyone has recommendations on a community challenge for a rehab beginner, I would be so grateful!
Thank you, for reading this far and bearing with my rant of sorts."
7e10mv,5,2017-11-19,Better education vs. Special friends,makeevolution,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/7e10mv/better_education_vs_special_friends/,"It’s gonna be a long read; please bear with me if you will.

I’m an international student just graduated from bachelor’s in Melbourne uni. Currently I’m back home doing some internships, planning on coming back to melbourne for masters. I also just got accepted to another uni in Holland (TU delft) for a masters, which from my research, is a very good school compared to Melbourne uni. I really want to go and do their mechatronics masters program, also escaping Melbourne uni’s bad teaching and poor engineering education.

Thing is, I really miss my friends in Melbourne who are still studying/working there. 

I used to come to a weekly church service back in Melbourne, and the people started to ask me to hang out etc., but most of the time I reject their invitations because I feel that their jokes and the way they talk are just different to me and so I closed myself out. I still went to the services but I dont associate myself that much with them.

I didn’t have any friends at uni, and so I fought my way through it alone. The loneliness was perfect; I can plan my day exactly without any disturbance from friends, no unnecessary human contact, no crappy small talk, it felt like the introvert utopia. However when exams or assignments crop up, things become highly depressing; looking at others in the library chatting and laughing while doing their assignments and here I am stuck with my stuff and no one to ask help to or at least chat my sorrows with. My marks always turn out good, but still I feel this depression inside me that I can’t figure out. As years progress it got worse, and I realized that I can’t live by myself; I need to somehow let my ego away.

I started opening up to the church people, tolerating our differences in jokes etc. It was hard to break into their bubble, but after two and a half years I finally did it. I became actively involved in church, and all the pain about exams, although still there, doesn’t make me depressed anymore.

What made them so special to me is how we share the same moral and ethical ways in doing things. I realize this would be weird to the people here at Reddit, but it’s so nice for me to be around people who don’t swear, who don’t talk/gossip about others (when someone tries to do it, there’s always someone else who tries to change the topic; it’s very charming), who tries their outmost best not to lie or cheat even if their other friends do it, all the “conservative” stuff. Probably this is why I’m having a hard time making friends, since the people I usually engage with end up not being “conservative”; oh well that’s probably the way the world is now. Not even my parents are as conservative as they are! 

To me it was well worth the effort of tolerating all the cringy jokes and awkward moments that often crop up in my interactions with them. They were the first people in my life whom I share my introverted awkwardness with, like how I always avoid those who gives you flyers on the street or offers insurance policies because I always feel bad at saying no and that in the end I’ll yield to their offers, and all other weird abnormal things similar to that.

I’d really like to come back there. Our friendship was only for a mere 6 months, but they are already saying how they miss me being around. Oh how estatic it feels to be missed. 

I know education is important; especially a chance to go to the top 20 uni in the world for engineering is a monumental blessing that I can’t simply turn away. But, I just realized how sweet friendship is, sometimes even sweeter than my best times being alone in my thoughts. I’m afraid that I won’t meet people like them again, who understand my ethical/moral codes and actually acts them out with me not just understanding it for formality, especially in this increasingly liberal world where everything becomes “ok”. I know that one day we’ll move on and the friendship will dissolve away, but I just want to taste that sweetness with them little bit longer. I’m afraid that in Holland I’ll never meet people like them again, or even more for the rest of my life. 

If you were me what you’d do? Do you choose a better education promising a better future, or friends who have rare qualities that resonate to you? I’m currently tending towards education, because objectively speaking I know that my friends might have changed when I come back, or the harsh truth that all good things come to an end, and in the end I’ll beat myself up for not taking a masters at a better university. 

But then what’s all the knowledge in the world for if I’m not happy? Is it me who needs to change; realize that this world doesn’t revolve around my wants and that I just gotta suck it up and break my own moral codes?"

Coming from unranked/local state school. 3.15 gpa. Done a hand full of internships wasnt crazy about. Trying to decide if I should go the masters route or 2nd bachelors. 


I feel masters logically makes more since I already have the B.S. but I feel with my position it'll be hard to get into any respectable program becuase of gpa plus a non comp sci major



The bachelors route is possible as well. Feel at the Bachelors level I could get into a more respectable program as well as getting a more foundational education. Especially since I have looking for work purposes not for science/research. 



Any thoughts/opinions would be appreciated.



P.s. aware a lot of online programs exist out there but would really prefer in classroom if anyone has recommendations "

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

To be noted, my first 3 months in this company are going to be probation period and I am told that I would be giving some sort of training. 

During the initial days, it was going fine and great. One of my senior colleagues who helped me a lot to understand docker, git in depth and some other stuff about the company. I was doing fine and could response in terms of need during first two weeks. That senior colleague had left the company on my second week in that company as he upgraded his career. Meanwhile, a new project has been initiated which was based on NUXTjs and for frontend vuetify has been used. I am completely new to these technologies. I was being told to do some task which I had to search for in google to resolve but I found less documentation or tutorial about vuetify which led me to not finishing the task. I am completely deadlocked with a lot of tasks where I never expected myself to be. I am new to this situation and now feeling guilty as I am not contributing enough. The CTO has already warned me saying ""Still nothing much has been delivered"". I am feeling like I am into a dead end for this job. And my guilty feeling is making me in taking the step in quieting my first dream job as a software engineer. I totally understand that the industry is moving forward. To adhere with this pace, I need some time and directions which I am not getting. 

I always believe progress comes with patience and times but it is not something corporate world deals with where it is being told ""move fast or go home"". I can push myself, I can 16 hours/day but I need instructions and some conversations on how can I improve myself. "
7e1px5,1,2017-11-19,"New to this sub, so be gentle. I’ve already been helped by other subs and friends and family and other outside influences (seeing a psychologist off campus). Here’s what I’ve got. Here’s what I have to say. Here’s what I’ve said....Her name was Sarah",sagealexander97,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/7e1px5/new_to_this_sub_so_be_gentle_ive_already_been/,"I’ve been writing a lot over the last three months since the break up (relationship was Oct. 2014 - Aug. 2017). She was my best friend, and the love of my life. Everything about me and us is down below. Waste your time reading through three months of writing at your own discretion; but let me know what you guys think. Thanks. 




I️ know that you don’t have any reason to talk to me, and I️ know that you really don’t want to. But these past few months have been really hard for me; because I️ haven’t gotten over our relationship. I️ wake up and fall asleep feeling like absolute shit wanting nothing more than to talk to you, but I️ can’t for fear that you’ll call the cops on me. I️ don’t know what I️ did to deserve that threat, because I’ve never harassed or cajoled you in any form of communication whatsoever that would warrant that threat. Please, call me, text me, email me, please Sarah give me something here. Please. I️ still love you. I️ still love you so much with everything that I️ have. And I️ can’t help but find myself crushed under the pressure of wishing I️ could explain myself and show you who I️ truly am, and not what you’ve decided to label me as. I will never forgive myself for what I️ did to us. But I’m still here, and I’m still waiting. Because you still mean everything in the world to me. And then some. I️ love you. Please call. I’ll be here whenever you decide to. 

Over these last few months I’ve tried to pin the 
relationship on you. I’ve tried to wonder why and how you are doing as well as you are because it really does look like you are doing so much better without me and that hurt me for really really long time. But I know that it’s not your fault. Obviously completely wrong move to just immediately try and find out how you were the one who fucked it all up because it was me; as you and I both know that it was me and everybody who I’ve talked to knows that it was me it was my fault. 

When I was hanging around Bijou, I️ tried to tell myself that time shouldn’t have a priority over happiness, because for the last couple of months I have been believing that I meant nothing to you and that the last three years also meant nothing to you and now I know that that’s simply true. I know that you did love me, you did care about me you totally completely utterly wanted to follow through on all of our dreams together just as much as I do. But I deluded myself into thinking that I was happy being around Bijou instead and I wasn’t happy with you. Therefore happiness overcame time and for a brief moment our relationship didn’t matter to me. Sarah; I am so sorry for that, because I will never love again. 

I will never truly have the happiness and the corroboration and the the love and the trust that you and I had. You were my first girlfriend, my first love, my first everything and now it’s all gone because of what I did to us. And I accept that. I️ accept that is my responsibility and it is my fault and it is my duty to fix it anyway that I know how. But that little inkling of sadness that little hole in my heart has been filled by you, the realization of the happiness that you are the one and only person that I am truly meant to be with, and that you are my one and only love. And I have come to the conclusion that I’m just gonna have to keep waiting. 

I’m going to wait as long as it takes for you to truly forgive me for my mistakes and to truly move on because I don’t want to start over. I don’t want to forget about this. I want to learn from it, mature from it, and make myself better for you and you alone in the future because that’s how love works. That’s how I️ work. And don’t want to spend my days without you. And with one final chance, I️ want to show you that I will never make the same mistakes again. This is Sage 2.0, this is new Sage, this is Mr. and Mrs. Sage Alexander call it whatever you want to, but Sarah; baby, I’m back. And I am never ever going away. I promise you for as long as it takes to the end of my days. 

Even if I have to do it alone okay? Because I will. 

Because you’re worth it to me. You are worth so much more, so much more than I ever let you see. But I am never going to skip out on my love for you ever again. And for the rest of my life I am going to spend all of my days in each and every last breath showing that.  

Because I love you with every fiber of my being. With every beat of my heart, with every breath I take, every move I make: all of me belongs to you. So you take all the time that you need. Live your life, take a break, be happy. But if you ever change your mind; your boyfriend, your best friend, your one true love, your man will be here waiting. 

Because forever Sarah: I love you.

I️ know that I️ hurt her first. And moreover because I fucked over the both of us saying “you don’t have to be scared of me, I won’t hurt you”. And I know she’s trying as hard as she can to get over me and get rid of the pain I caused her. But no matter what she says or does and no matter how she tries to push me away I can’t get her out of my head. Days are spent thinking about her and worrying and wondering if she’s with another guy. And it sucks it really does. Some days I pray for peace and others I pray she’ll come back to me. I️ don’t know why. I can’t say why. I wish I knew what the hell was going on. 

I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I put so much into my relationship with her. She was my first girlfriend. She was my first love. She was my best friend. She was my first kiss. She was my first I love you. I based my identity off of she was my first everything. And now that she’s gone, so is who I am; or at least: was. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I invested so much into the idea of what the relationship made me. I invested everything in the fact that this was my first relationship, this was my girlfriend, this was my best friend, this was my wife. I thought of how lucky I was, and I saw what had happened with us and thought how incredible was it that I could find my soul mate in high school and take a deep sigh and say “okay, I’m done.”  Without having that in my life, I’m so fucking lost. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

We were supposed to get married. I told her that. I told her we were meant for each other that we were soul mates. And she believed me. I found her and I said “you’re beautiful, and I’m gonna marry you.” She was the first girl I said “I love you” to. And she was the first one to say it back to me and mean it. I really really thought she loved me. And now I’m losing her to somebody else. Whoever else that may be. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I can’t even talk to her. Did I mention that? She made me wait 30 day intervals to be able to talk to her. She said don’t talk to me for a month. And so I didn’t. We talked a month later. She said again, don’t talk to me for a month; but she added, if you want any sort of chance if you want any brownie points in my mind if you want to even start to maybe being my friend again, don’t talk to me for a month. I respected her boundaries and we talked a month later. Then she said, “don’t ever speak to me again. And if you try to, I’ll tell the cops you’re harassing me”. I can’t even try to make it better, I have no option to even explain myself or speak to her for fear that she’ll point to me and force a criminal record on me. I can’t even talk to her for fear of this damning mark that would stick with me for the rest of my life. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. 

I think I’ve been discussing something with my therapist that I️ really haven’t been telling anyone else.  It’s kind of a motif that’s come about in the last two sessions. People think that the biggest problem I️ have with the break up is trying to find out “who I️ was” before it or who I’m supposed to be after it. And it has to do a lot with school or work or my relationship with God, hobbies or whatever else I️ do And I️ think that all of those yes are a part of my identity, but they’re all facts of life that I’m already well aware of and, really, already have them taken care of. And the one thing in me that hasn’t gotten attention and that is lacking is my love life. But that’s what it is I️ have all my shit taken care of. School, work, hobbies? Whatever I️ have all of my ducks in a row everything except my life with Sarah is taken care of. And I️ have this one thing that’s missing now and I️ don’t know what to do. I️ was still in the infancy of my relationship it was still growing and all of a sudden it got SUDS and died. This is kind of like losing a child I️ guess I’m saying. It was something that is new to me and my life and I️ haven’t developed fully yet. I already know where I️ am and where I’m going in school and I️ already know what I️ want to do after, I️ have my friends and family relationships and my relationship with Sarah, now null and void, is quite literally the one thing thats come and gone without being completed or “taken care of”. Everything except for my life with her is set to fall like a domino effect lying out the final product (what all the dominoes look like when they’re pushed down). The final product being me and who I️ am. And that’s why I️ feel like I’m the only one who believes in the cause to get her back that’s why I️ feel like I’m alone in this when I️ can’t conform to what everybody else is telling me to do “move on” “distract yourself” whatever. Why I️ chose to replace my Sarah domino with my Bijou domino is temptation and sin. And something that I️ shouldn’t have allowed in my mind life and relationship with Sarah. I️ should’ve incorporated our faith in our relationship a lot more than we did. There were only a few times when her and I️ would pray together. And when I️ say few I️ mean “unable-to-pinpoint-exactly-when-over-the-last-three-years” few. 

I'm sorry. 

I'm sorry for causing you pain this past 3 years. I'm sorry for all those fights. For being over dramatic and territorial. I'm sorry for questioning your loyalty. I'm sorry for flaring up and not being able to control myself at the worst times. I'm sorry for doing my part in the controlling aspect of this relationship. I'm sorry for not communicating properly. I'm sorry for all the poor and detrimental decisions I have made in this relationship and I am sorry for causing what ever pain I did. I'm sorry for everything I did wrong these past 3 years. And I'm sorry I was the sole purpose for all of it ending. It was the best three years of my life, but I don't want it to end. I can't live without you in my life. I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks, time and time again I've proved to myself that I can't live my life to the fullest without you. I want my life to be a part of yours and I want your life to be a part of mine. I'm sorry I was disloyal to you. I'm sorry I lied to you, I'm sorry that mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake I made you deal with the same shit over and over and over again. I was a hapless bully to you and a witless punk to your parents. I manipulated and abused you. And I chastised you for seeing right through me at the worst of times when I doubted our relationship. I regret that. I regret taking you for granted. I regret not holding you tighter, not hugging you longer, for not kissing you more often. I want to be better, I need to be better in order for this to work; and I'm trying. I need you in my life I need you way more than you need me, I understand that. I'm sorry that I hurt you, and I don't ever want to do that again. I don't ever want to make you cry again. I've missed you. I've missed you so much throughout these last few weeks. I've convinced myself before that I was better off without you, that I shouldn't have wasted your time as long as I did. But I don't want to look at our relationship and see a waste of time, because it wasn't for me, it wasn't a waste of time. I have heart aches and pains every single day without having you here for me. I hate having no one to talk to, no one to back me up, no one to advocate for me, no one to stand up for me, to support me, to have all the time in the world for me like you did. You called. You texted. You FaceTimed. You told me that you loved me. You made time for me, you spent your time off school here for me. Here for the both of us. And forever in my heart will I cherish our times alone that we had together. Getting to take you to class, kissing you goodbye before my day started with classes or my night started with work, coming home to see you there laying in my bed, watching my tv or on the computer. I loved being there with you and playing house. I love you Sarah. I want to make your heart melt again. I want to love you again. You are an amazing person with a lot to offer anyone who comes in proximity to you, let alone gets to know you. And I'm sorry I became one of those people you hung up your feelings on and treated you the way that I did. Because truth be told, I wasn't worth your time. You have incredible things to offer people whether it be your ability to teach anyone basic manners and proper demeanor and disposition or it be the positive outlook you have on practically anything. You're smart. You're humble. You're kind and you have a lot more to offer than you care to realize. And that's why I love so much about you. So many people thrive off of the positive energy that you can have. The way you interacted with me at any point during the day isn't anything I should have passed up. I had fun spending time with you, and it's abhorrent that not every single time I interfaced with you did I have the common decency or sense to understand why you mean so much to me. Because you have absolutely no idea just how much I would give up just to have you back in my life again. I want you to understand why I'm telling you this and how I want to show you I've grown and become better from all of this horrible shit I've put you through, and all of the horrible shit I've been through. I’m sorry. For the times I hurt you, for the times I lied to you, and for everything other reason I’ve given you to be mad at me. I know my apologies might not mean anything to you, and that I’ve put hurt and devastation on you far beyond instant repair, but beyond from that all, all I can tell you is that I promise to try to be better for you in the future. If there is a future. I love you. I just want to tell you: thanks for everything. I know I haven't been an ideal person to be around in general but I really love and respect you even though I rarely show it. I don't know if you've noticed but I haven't a single friend and my family life is not. You are a significant bright spot in my otherwise dismal being and even when you get short tempered with me I know at the end of the day you still have my back and I thank you for that. I love you. And I want nothing more than to show you, with one final chance. That we belong together. And that for the rest of my life; I love you.

Sarah,

I’m here to tell you that I respect your decision. I apologize for everything I have done to cause you hurt. I have heard what you have said and I will be doing some soul searching (and work) to make sure I do not repeat my mistakes in the future, and so I thank you for that.  I wish you nothing but the best and I will always cherish the time we spent together. 

I know we’ve had a lot of differences and disagreements before, during, and after our break up, and I’m sorry for pushing your buttons and boundaries as much as I did. Sarah, you mean everything in the world to me, and I am so sorry I didn’t take advantage of our relationship and our happiness when I had the chance to. 

But that’s all I can offer you, is my deepest and sincerest apologies, and to promise in the future that it will never happen again. Because I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am sorry you believe that I belittled you and abused you. I’m sorry that you would see me as a threat to your safety, because I would never. And I know deep inside you know that that’s just not true, and I’m sorry you’re putting that on me. I am absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and very perplexed that you would think that but I can’t change how you feel; but, I will take responsibility for your feelings and I am very sorry. You know me Sarah and I would never hurt you and I know you know that. 

Nevermatter, I will forever cherish our time together. Being high school sweethearts, Friday night lights, school dances (Sadie Hawkins and me flying home for your senior prom being my personal favorites), the time we got together over last fall break playing house together and our time together over Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks too. I know the summer wasn’t everything we had hoped for, and I know I had a lot of shortcomings and faults over the last few months. But beside all that, I want us both to remember the good, because I know that we did have good in our relationship; and I’m sorry you’ve decided to carry the burden of remembering only the bad. 

But, I digress, I can’t change that about you, and if you decide to live that way and see us as that then I can’t control that either. And I can’t change the way you see me, at least not overnight, and I pray and hope you do eventually decide to change that thinking; wherever or whomever it may be coming from. I wish you could see us how I did and do now; and I hope one day you’ll truly forgive me for my mistakes. 

I did love you, Sarah; and I still do. I do truly love you. I know you don’t ever want to see me again, and words can’t describe how deeply that hurts me. And I am really hopeful that one day you’ll change your mind, as a friend or otherwise. Please remember that we did share a lot of amazing times and dreams together. But I’ve come to the realization that it is time to let you go and see what’s meant to be. 

If you ever need to talk, I’ll be here. And if you ever change your mind, there will be a man waiting here for you. And if I’m ever blessed enough to have you back in my life; I’m never letting you go again. 

Until I get to see you again; best wishes, Sarah Brown. 

With love, your best friend, your Livewire: 
- Sage

Sarah:

I know you didn’t want to hear from me, but I’m sending this to try and express to you what you mean to me, and what this break up has been doing to me over these last few months. I’ve wanted for so long to call you or to text you or to contact you some how. But was unable to, for fear that you would report me for trying to do so and would leave me here left with a damning mark on my record. But now I’m here taking a leap of faith, and would hope that you would just hear me. 

I apologize for everything I have done to cause you hurt. I have heard what you have said about taking our time apart and I will be doing a lot of changing and soul searching (and work) to make sure I do not repeat my mistakes in the future, and so I thank you for that. I wish you nothing but the best and I will forever and always cherish the time we spent together. I know we’ve had a lot of differences and disagreements before, during, and after our break up, and I’m sorry for pushing your buttons and boundaries as much as I did. 

Sarah: you still mean everything in the world to me, and I am so sorry I didn’t take advantage of our relationship and our happiness when I had the chance to. Every day I’ve woken up and gone to sleep wasting away inside and out aching over what I did to us. It wasn’t because I was unattractive to you, it wasn’t because of the distance, it wasn’t because we had too many disagreements or fought too often; no. This happened because I betrayed your trust. This happened because of me and my faults. And instead of communicating to you properly as I should have done as the man I wanted to be in your life, I drove you away and ran the opposite direction. I can’t believe I’ve hurt you like this. I promised you, I told you, and I made sure that you believed that I would never hurt you. I should have kept my word to you, and I hate myself for breaking all of our trust, promises, hopes, and dreams we spent so much time building together. Sarah, I am so sorry for what happened to us. And I am dying every single day wishing that I could have you in my life; and that I could be called yours again. I wish that I could do it all over again, that I could go back and change who and how I was, and be who I was supposed to be to you.

I pray, plead, and beg with tears in my eyes and pain in my chest every day and night that one day, God will bring you back to me. But all I have been told to do is to accept that all of this pain and all of what is happening to me and my mental health will lead to something amazing in my life, whether that be with or without you. I can’t sit here and tell you that I’m over you, because I’m not. And I know it will take everything that I have and an extremely long time for you to get out of my head. Because you are everything to me. You were my best friend. My first love, my babygirl, my high school sweetheart, my honey, and my one and only. And I am absolutely outraged, disgusted, and torn apart inside and out that I became so blind and selfish that I lost sight of that. 

I can feel who I was dying inside. The hopeless romantic, the guy who believes in love at first sight, the guy who believes that firsts are everything, the one who believes in saying things like “you’re beautiful and I’m gonna marry you”. I can feel him wasting away, and I don’t want that. I don’t want to lose that part of me, because that part of me is who got you in the first place. I didn't really have an identity before our relationship, and with you in my life I invested everything I have and everything that I was into the relationship. I put so much stock in being the guy who married his first girlfriend, that were the high school sweethearts who made it, that for me, it was one and done. And now that you’re gone, so is that identity. I don’t know who I am anymore, and I know that I need to invest a lot of time and energy working on that. 

I put so much hope into our future. I loved planning out the rest of our lives together. Starting from where we would get married, to Santorini, to what my last written words to you would ever be after I’m gone. That plan still holds value in my life. People have been telling me to move on, to find someone else, and to find value in other aspects of my life, and ultimately, to distract myself with work, school, and my career prospects. And to a certain degree, that is true that I should focus my time and energy in that, rather than wallowing in the mire over what was and what could have been with us. But you know what kind of guy I am. I have all of my ducks in a row. School and work are taken care of and my future career is looking up just as we had planned, and I wanted nothing more than to share my recent experiences with you. I wanted to tell you about the meet and greet I had at the police academy here and I wanted to hear you tell me “good luck”. I wanted to tell you about the new details I’ve gotten about my internships with Northwestern or Bain and hear you tell me “good job baby” or “I’m so proud of you”. I want to talk to you, to communicate with you. For me to tell you about my day and you tell me about yours and us have interest and conversation about what’s going on in each other’s lives. I had so much hope in our plans, and I still want to be the man in your life that gets to say “I do”. There’s so much in my life right now that is solidifying and I wanted nothing more than to share these experiences with you and follow through on all of the plans that we made. Like the times we used to joke about us getting you the best, newest, biggest truck on the market, lifted to the moon, and all decked out with the perfect pink and teal paint job and all the details and accessories you wanted so that you would able to show off to friends, family and guests, while on the other side of the garage, I’d tell people “yeah I got a new window motor” in my old ass truck, just because we could, and were that different and had our own personal tastes and dreams that we adored in each other. Those were good, fun, wholesome times having those plans and those jokes with you. 

I know that I can’t change your mind, but I want to extend an olive branch to you, because that’s all I can offer you: is my deepest and sincerest apologies. And I want to promise you that in the future, what I’ve done will never happen again. Because I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am sorry that I belittled you and that you would think that I abused you. I’m sorry that you would see me as a threat to your safety. Because I know, deep inside, you know that that’s just not true, and I’m sorry that you’re putting that on me. I am absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and perplexed to the point of pure torture that you would think that, but I can’t change how you feel. But, I will take responsibility for your feelings and I want to tell you that I am very sorry. But you know me Sarah, and you know that I would never hurt you intentionally like that, and I know you know that. 

I loved having you in my life and as a part of my family. And every single one of my relatives you’ve met and assimilated with before have agreed that you were a really really good fit with all of us. I loved knowing that my family adored you. My family loved and embraced you with open arms. But, even from the beginning, I always felt I wasn’t accepted into your family. I know and understand that I had a big part to play in that. But you can’t discredit that regardless of my shortcomings, and regardless of what I did and said to make your parents not like me, that I never tried. I did try, Sarah, and you and I both know that no matter how much I didn’t like it, I tried. Maybe my efforts weren’t enough or maybe I wasn’t good enough. I could tell you that maybe your family environment was too far opposite compared to how I was brought up, but maybe also I could have done more to compromise. And I know that I could use some maturing in that field as well. I never should have expected you to try and keep the peace between your parents and me. I understand that you, yourself, were trying to stay off the radar, and had your own struggles keeping the peace between yourself and your parents. And I’m very sorry that I added to that stressful part of your life. 

I won’t ever forgive myself for destroying everything we’d built up, and throwing away all the time we spent together. But, like I said before, I will forever cherish our time together. All that I have been able to do since August is look over our memories with fondness. Watching the video of you opening the prom-posal I made for you, watching the video of me surprising you when I flew home for your senior prom, the thousands of pictures I have of the both of us, the text messages, the scrapbook from fall break last year: it’s all still here and it all still really means something to me. I haven’t been able to let you go. Us being high school sweethearts, ‪Friday night‬ lights, our school dances (Sadie Hawkins and your senior prom being my personal favorites), the time we got to spend together over last fall break playing house, our time together over Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks, and having you as a New Year’s kiss too. All of those hours and miles spent in my truck, driving to and from the beach, all of our little adventures, date nights, and super-date days. And every single time, without fail, you’d take the middle seat next to me. You loved being there, and I adored having you there with me. And I should have shown you more love, appreciation, time, and affection for all that you did to and for me in our time spent together. 

I know the summer wasn’t everything we had hoped for, and I know I had a lot of shortcomings and faults that fueled fights and conflict between us over the last few months. As I should, I take full responsibility for that, and I won’t ever forgive myself for losing out on you. The time I’m having to deal with now, is like the time I had to deal with before after our first breakup. All that time with you is now gone  it’s passed, it’s over, and I wasn’t there. But besides all that, I want us both to remember the good, because I know that we did have good in our relationship; and I’m sorry you’ve decided to carry the burden of only remembering good memories tainted with bad ones. But I can’t change that about you, and if you decide to live that way and see us as that and nothing more than a stepping stone or a learning experience, then I can’t control that either. And I know that I can’t change the way you see me, at least not overnight. But I pray and hope you do eventually decide to allow me to change that thinking; wherever or whomever it may be coming from. I wish you could see us how I did and do now; and I hope one day you’ll truly forgive me for my mistakes. 

Words can’t express what you mean to me. Because if I could take everything good that I have in my life, all my experiences and all my happiness, and joy and good that I have, and put it in a bowl or something to offer it up, and say “Here. Just give me one more chance with her”. I’d be okay with that. I did love you, Sarah; and I still do. I do truly love you. I know you don’t ever want to see me again, and words can’t describe how deeply that hurts me. And I am really hopeful that one day you’ll change your mind, as a friend or otherwise. Please remember that we did share a lot of amazing times and dreams together. But I’ve come to the realization that it is time to truly prove that I do love you and let you go to see what’s meant to be. 

I know that there's a lot of pain and suffering in this world; and you and I have seen and experienced it first hand with the time we spent out of the country. I also know it’s a long shot to hope that this letter will help or change anything, but if I am to really and truly let you go and move on, I hope that this letter will at least facilitate us ending on a semi-good note so that we aren’t left feeling vulnerable to the worst parts this world has to offer. I really do hope the best for you and I hope that you feel the same way for me. Because that’s all I want, is for you to be happy. And at the end of the day, reality wins. And the reality, is that I’ll always love you, no matter what.

If you ever need to talk, I’ll be here. And if you ever change your mind, there will be a man waiting here for you. And if I’m ever blessed enough to have you back in my life again; I’m never letting the same mistakes come between us. 

Until I get to see you again:
Best wishes, Sarah Brown. 

With insurmountable love, your best friend, your Livewire:

7e21i4,1,2017-11-19,"26M, Profile Review for Active Duty Officer &amp; Advice on GMAT",CoastieKid,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/7e21i4/26m_profile_review_for_active_duty_officer_advice/,"Thank you in advance for the comments, feedback, and advice.  My goal is to enter business school in the Fall of 2019 after my military commitment ends. I realize now is the time to prepare for the transition.  From what I have gathered so far on this sub, Magoosh is one of the better GMAT preparation programs, but would like to know if there are others that you would recommend.

**Background**
*Work experience:* 

* Deck Watch/Electronics Officer - Served 2 years aboard a ship as a deck watch officer and the electronics officer. As DWO I was responsible for the safe navigation of a ship with 100+ crew members, execution of search and rescue, drug interdiction, and migrant interdiction operations, and served as the direct representative of the Captain. As the electronics officer I supervised 11 technicians and was responsible for the maintenance, casualty repair, and installation of electronic navigation, communications, information technology, and fire control systems aboard the vessel.  

* Field Intelligence Officer (by summer 2019 this will be 3 years).  Served 3 years executing all phases of the intelligence cycle.  Collected and reported, liaised, and briefed maritime intelligence within an interagency construct to safe guard largest port on East Coast of U.S.  against global &amp; domestic terrorism, cyber threats, criminal activity.  Strong public speaking, interpersonal, rapport building, and analytical product generation skills. 

*Extra curriculars:*

* Runs with various running groups 3-4 times a week, beginning to serve as an organizer within one of the groups

* Partner dancing, swing/latin mostly

*Undergrad school/major:* U.S. Coast Guard Academy/Electrical Engineering

*Other education/coursework:* N/A

*Race/nationality:* Asian/Native American (born in US)

*Sex:* M

**Stats**
*GMAT Score (include breakdown!):* N/A currently (Wanting to see where I'll have to score in order to have a shot at this)

*Undergrad GPA:* 2.63 (pretty bad I know. I was originally a political science major but switched to electrical engineering as I thought a STEM degree would be more useful than poli sci.  Service Academies are pretty rigorous so I'm hoping that this will be considered by an adcom).

**MBA Info**
*Goal of MBA:* 

*Industries:*Consulting, social enterprise, tech, IB/finance.  

*Aptitudes:* I enjoy creative problem solving, am extroverted/social, and providing decision advantage in an advisory capacity. Based off my aptitudes and interests, it seems that the first two of my options may be the best direction for me, but I recognize that having a BS in electrical engineering and the ability to communicate is sought after.

*Overarching goal:* Ideally, I would like an interactive, financially rewarding career in which I can use my soft skills and divergent thinking to resolve issues and innovate for a better world.

*Target schools:* Stanford GSB, Columbia, Anderson, Haas, Stern, Booth, McComb, Darden.  I would put Harvard/Yale/Wharton but those seem to be extremely big reach schools with my GPA

**Additional Information:**

*Post 9/11 GI Bill* 

* I have the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which will pay for all tuition/fees at a public school, and significantly reduce the cost of attending a private school depending on said school's Yellow Ribbon Program.  Due to Congress forgetting about USCGA, I am entitled to this generous benefit (normally you have to serve 36 months after the service academy commitment before you accrue time towards it. USCGA grads who graduated in 2014 or earlier earn it when they hit 3 years of service).

*School Location* 

* I'm stationed in NYC, which is why Stern &amp; Columbia are in my target schools list. The Veteran's Network in NYC seems to be extremely strong, and the proximity to the financial services/consulting industries is attractive as well as the fact that I ""know"" this city.  I'd hope to go on terminal in the summer of 2019, work an internship with a bank/consulting firm, and then enter business school.  I'm attracted to California b-schools due to social enterprise and ties to tech industries.

Thanks so much, and please let me know what you recommend for the GMAT. I recognize that I'm working at a disadvantage here with my lower GPA, but hoping that preparation, my interview skills, and veterans status with access to the Post 9/11 GI Bill will help me win admission to a great school."

This time, I needed thunderbolt 3 compatibility so I could connect an external audio interface.

So, without further ado, [THE MAGIC](https://imgur.com/a/jo51P)

Specs:

 - GTX 950 (GPU)
 - i7-7700k (CPU)
 - 750GB Hybrid Drive
 - 16GB Ram
 - Z170X-Gaming 7 Gigabyte Motherboard
 - Clarett 8pre Audio Interface

Extra info:

I originally was going to use a newer motherboard, but after four choices, none worked with thunderbolt. I went to the hardware store and was going to pick up an Asus motherboard to use with their Thunderbolt EX expansion card, but I lucked out and someone had just returned a Z170X, so I got that instead.

I first booted to windows, and installed the driver/bios updates, then I opened the bios and set my default hackintosh settings. 

To make it work with the external device, I messed around in the thunderbolt bios for a bit.

For a finale, I installed macOS using clover, and ran the migration assistant to transfer files from a laptop. I then used EFIMounter to mount both the clover EFI from the USB and the hard disk efi. I copied over the efi from the USB, and now it boots perfectly without it!"

#### Quotes on examples of the passion, dedication and sacrifice that went into the PS2 project:

&gt; [dcarey](https://np.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/2vs5gl/ama_david_carey_former_ps2_producer/cokhv9n/) [speaking *generally* about higher ups / management in the industry and non-public facing figures] that the people who REALLY bust their ass and do the work don't get the public recognition. The 'faces of the franchise' are usually home by 6 while the designers, artists, and coders you never hear about haven't seen their family awake in weeks.

&gt; [Higby:](https://np.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/46gs3d/matt_higbys_unfiltered_views_on_planetside_2/d05fvnj/) people worked crazy hours with no overtime..

&gt; [Higby:](https://np.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/42dioe/fft_is_planetside_2_really_the_best_multiplayer/cza248p/) ..crazy smart, hard workers who were routinely throwing 60+ hours a week at the game even 2 years post launch

**So this is an opportunity to recognise and reflect on all the people who contributed to making PS2 the PS2 project what it is.**
****

After launch a massive team was supported by the player base (PS2 was operationally profitable by Jan 2015 and pulled it's weight as the flagship game of the Studio). Players continued to support the project and the studio in good faith during long times of working on PS4, the transition to Daybreak before H1Z1 took off, and up-to present date where steam averages have only dropped by about half compared to Jan 2015."

I have the opportunity to spend 5 months at a university abroad and I've chosen to come to Canada!

I am a 24 year old male Dutch student currently going for his BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration). In my 4th and final year (which is next year), I have the option to study abroad for 5 months at a university almost anywhere abroad! While it would be a hard choice for many, I instantly knew I wanted to come to Canada! 

Unfortunately i do not have the freedom to pick any university in Canada, but limited to:

1. University of Manitoba 
2. University of New Brunswick 
3. Nipissing University, Northbay

Unfortunately these are not the highest ranking universities in Canada so it's very hard to base my decision on that. My university has prompted me to rank my three preferences(I'm thinking about listing all 3 canadian universities, unless you think I shouldn't), so I really hope someone can help me. 

What I want from these 5 months is just to have an extremely social experience, make friends and experience the true Canadian (student) life. A university with a lot of social activities and one that's really open to international students would have my top preference. 

Feel free to message me or ask me anything!

Edit: Some more info. The exchange will be from mid august untill Christmas, would love to experience a real christmas! About unsafe cities: I really don't mind, I'm from a small city in the Netherlands and do my study and internship in Rotterdam! For me it's all about the social experience, quality of classes are kind of my second priority. 

Edit 2: Thank you all for your insights! I have a lot of thinking to do apparently. Currently I'm leaning towards New Brunswick and scrapping the other 2 and check my other options in other countries. If anyone can help me get a partnership between our universities please don't hesitate. Thanks all!"

Ive dabbled with Java in class before and its really hard to wrap my brain around some of the things in there like methods. So Ive decided to focus on web development as I find it easier at the moment to learn and work with than Java. But even then I cannot make a site look the way I want.

The only opportunity within the program was to list wage increase and not other QOL increases.

I know that not a lot of people will care about my issues as a lot of people believe in corporate/government entitlement to labor and any goals I want to achieve are additional to labor I have to perform.

My issues were that my parents were heavily recruited into the process immediately thus I was not able to give proper consent as it would put my living situation in jeopardy.

The program used resources that I could have devoted to other things that I was more interested in.  There is not much to even teach in software testing, it's mostly just learn about the program being tested.

After being in the internship I could not opt out of a position because I did not want to go back into the program.

I was recruited basically as a ringer rather than actually helping people get opportunities that are more severe on the spectrum.

My diagnosis as not afforded me one accommodation aside from shorter working hours which should be provided to everyone who wants it.  The others in the program do not have abnormally short working hours(16).  In fact my diagnosis has hindered me as it is used to obtain publicity and a diversity award.  A lot of people don't understand autism and it is a spectrum disorder so this could lead to being treated differently.

The leader of the program has advertised autistic people as being favorable to software testing due to their ability to engage in repetitive tasks.  This is exploiting compulsion and not improving QOL.  Autistic people should have the same goals and aspirations as anyone else.

Corporations/government agencies should lower their barriers to entry in general and have more non-degreed positions/less rent-seeking.

7e2gyn,80,2017-11-19,RW Tracker - Full-scan Edition,vexnon,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7e2gyn/rw_tracker_fullscan_edition/,"Hello Keepers,

Some of you are probably tired of these posts so rest assured, it's the last one in the foreseeable future.

So, as you know, I was working on updating roaming warrior tracker to do a full-scale scanning instead of checking only those which were added manually to the list. After a week of testing, as far I can see, there is no visible issues so I can conclude that it's ready for general use.

So, what has changed in past few months?

* **Changed domain name and hosting.** Before it was hosted on free OpenShift service but at one point it was announced that it will move to new platform with unreadable hostnames so I would be forced to buy some domain name. I decided that it's probably a good time to move to some proper hosting place so I spent two months temporary on one hosting and at last moved to permanent one few days ago. I hope you won't encounter any issues with it.

* **Calculated synergy.** Before in order to know RW stats for some realm, the tracker had to request the data specifically on that realm. The good thing about it was that the data was 100% precise, the bad one - it required significantly more time to fetch data if you do it for every realm (so, multiplied by number of realms). In order to minimize it, both in sense of time and bandwidth, I investigated a possibility to calculate it in some way, and I found some compromise approach for that. The drawback of that approach is that I have to keep a list of relic (thanks to /u/Enlir spreadsheet, it's feasible) and character stats up to date which affects tracking for JP server. While relic stats are calculable pretty fine with little exception (see below), I couldn't find a reliable approach for characters so I have to semi-manually collect that data from time to time for every released character for every 119 levels. Still, it works and stats are 99.9% correct as long the based data is up-to-date.

* **Full-scale scan.** Before the tracker was checking data only on those players which were manually added by users. The problem was that a lot of players were mostly interested in variety of provided soulbreaks which sometimes couldn't be covered by registered RWs so I had to spend time to find some solution to expand the selection. I had to rewrite most of tracker code to make it possible, like increase fetching speed (the main reason why I added calculated synergy), storage (until now, the data was stored in plain text file) or consumed processing resources (I did some experiment with porting it to some other language). The resulting tracker is now running on MySQL with a number of cut corners to be usable on low-specs server, like removed options for sorting or number of results on one page. While it shouldn't be that big deal, it's still really unfortunate in my opinion but I hope you understand it, with current sizes of data - almost 3 million records in JP database, and every record has 57 fields - it was inevitable to keep it have reasonable low-latency to user input. I actually have more stuff I could tell about but the post is already pretty huge. Feel free to ask in comments if you're interested.

* **Minor UI changes.** While user interface still looks like a poop as before (I wasn't blessed with skills in that area), the tracker now has dropdowns for character and soulbreak selections, with filter capacities, making it easier to find SB you're looking for. Also, some fields which weren't used that much - names and damage - were removed, the switches for server and language selection should be more sensible now, and the tracker in general should load noticeably faster now because it doesn't load the whole data at once.

Thank you for reading! I hope you like this new version of [RW tracker](https://friends-ffrk.com) :)

&amp;nbsp;

Some notes:

* Like I mentioned earlier, there were a few exceptions for calculated synergy. The culprits are Flamberge (V) and Diamond Armor (V). These two pranksters have non-linear stat growth so you can't tell for sure which stats they have at some level unless you actually know it. It's not a big deal for Diamond Armor because it doesn't affect atk/mag/mnd but Flamberge makes calculations for its bearers slightly off. I'd appreciate if someone has those relics at level 1 and is willing to spend a bit of time to help me with collecting their stats. Btw, both these relics were released in same event, so I guess it was some intern miss :)

* I'm not that knowledgeable about databases so I assume that my choice of DB or its settings are far from perfect. If there is some keeper who is knowledgeable in databases and could lend a hand to try improving the tracker in that area, I'd appreciate it!

* There might be some migration issues, hopefully nothing serious.

* I consider to open source the tracker at some point if there is enough interest from you.

* Tomorrow - November 20 - the tracker gets its happy birthday, being two year old! Time flies…"

7e2ipp,1,2017-11-19,Resentment,gaethjekeeper,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/7e2ipp/resentment/,"A few years ago whilst I was still in university I realised that I would need experience in order to try and set myself apart from the thousands of other Accounting graduates that Scotland churns out every year and with the limited number of internships going, there was no way someone like me was ever going to get chosen for one (I went to one of the lowest ranked uni's in the UK). So I decided to go for some volunteer roles.

One in particular was perfect, it was nice and easy monkey work, literally all you had to do was copy stuff from a piece of paper onto a computer, glorified data entry work. I was called in for a chat in which the ""chat"" turned out to be an absolute grilling, ""what do you think you can bring to this role"" ""what experience do you have"" etc.. which ultimately ended up in me not getting it because I didn't have enough experience (the story of my job search for the last three years), I didn't even have enough experience to work for this shitty charity for free doing a job that you could pick any idiot off the streets to do. What was an even bigger kick in the teeth was that the lady who interviewed me went on to tell me in her rejection email that she gave the role to a retiree! She actually gave the role to someone who was just looking for something to do with their day and passed up me and god knows how many other people who actually needed the role so they could get a job in the future. I was pissed off so I somewhat immaturely sent her an email back explaining what she did and then got an email back from her with the classic sage advice of all people who started their careers in the 90s and early 00s which was to simply get a temp job, because that's what she did back in 1995, so obviously things are still the same for people in 2013 (they aren't).

I'm 30 years old now and still haven't managed to get an accounting role and to this day I resent and partly blame that Scottish Sports Futures, because who the fuck do they think they are, actually seriously interviewing people for a role that they're doing for free, and I also still resent that woman, who even after admitting the role wasn't difficult and that it provided experience for people, still gave it some cunt OAP.

I really shouldn't harbour resentment for people but with the crap predicament I'm in right now, I think of things that went on in my past and stew over them for way longer than what's healthy, especially because that one role was seriously what could have made the difference between me having a job and doing well and not having one and doing completely shit like I am now."
7e2uk7,1,2017-11-19,Advice for an Msc master internship decision,FnafMissingLink,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7e2uk7/advice_for_an_msc_master_internship_decision/,"Hi everyone,


I'm currently a Biology Msc within a cellular and development specializaton. This is also something that I want to pursue for a later carreer as the field is quite interdisciplinair and close to my preference for (eco)toxicological research.


During my Bsc I had the best internship I could've wished for, which focussed on assessment of particle effects in larval zebrafish. I also came to love zebrafish larvae a model organisms and would've loved to pursue research on them. However, even though it was a great collaboration that fitted me perfectly, I wasn't allowed to pursue this research for my Msc internship, as students have to broaden their perspective.


So for my Msc internship after lots of oriëntation and introductory talks, I found myself torn between 2 internship opportunities, both who adressed  possible interest in having me. I'm quite at a loss of what would be the best choice for me on account of my personal feelings, and my future career. I'll go a bit into detail on both of them.


The first one is actually from a physics deperartment who looks to built a microscope that is able to detect particles within zebrafish larvae. They were in need of a biology student that would dedicate himself to injection of zebrafish larvae (a skill that I've always wanted to learn). For this study they do collaborate with the chemistry department as the chemistry deparment has a research to the blood brain barrier that would benefit from tracking these particles in vivo (a really interesting resrearch!), and that faculty would give me an intensive training on zebrafish larvae injection. However, the huge downside to this is that it would be literally all I would be doing. I would be able to pick up on some of the details on the research of the chemistry department, but I would mainly be used to inject zebrafish larvae so the physics department could test their equipment. The physics faculty kind of threw me a bone saying that perhaps I could help with other parts of the study later on. However that was only when I notified I had to able to write a thesis on the study and thus also have to have some contribution to the development of the study. They did not specify what I could be doing. They did also admit that their main interest in me was because injecting zebrafish larvae isn't really a job for most physics phd'ers, and thus they specifically had need of someone for it. They also seemed quite strict on having me at their workplace all the time (although I don't have to inject all day) which felt quite uneasy as there are also courses I want / have to follow in-between. Although the skill is valuable, I'm thus not quite sure if this would help me develop for actual research, and my main worry is that I might be a bit abused.


The second study was from the biology faculty. It was a research that used micro-ct, tomography and hybridization techniques to uncover developmental pathways of a fish larvae with a parasitic lifestyle (no zebrafish). The supervisor seemed quite nice (although she was quite hard to understand due to a heavy chinese accent). However, my exact role in the study was quite vague (even after the introductory talk) and it also seemed she was quite hasty with her research, as she would depart just a month after I would end my internship. The techniques seemed okay, as I would learn something new. Although as I've said, she was quite vague on what I would be using them for, as it seemed she already did some of the things herself, and was mainly focussed on someone for the micro-ct part, which I found a bit less important. However, The research itself was quite interesting, and I felt I had a bit more contribution to the development of it! She did seem quite nice, so I guess she wouldn't be that harsh on me following courses as well, but she also hinted that their research group tends to have their breaks together and people would notice if someone didn't show up quite often. So with this study I think I would also learn some techniques (that are a bit less valuable), but it was quite vague what would be my purpose in the study apart from doing micro-ct (which at first glance doesn't seem as valuable, but perhaps I might be wrong).

tl;dr 

So now I'm quite torn up between both positions as both are interesting, but also have their downsides. The first one felt as if they would be abusing me, although learning zebrafish larvae injection really fits me. The second one seemed quite vague, but I think I would be able to have a bit more contribution. I know I won't have the perfect internship I had during my last year, but it doesn't make it easier to pick. The internship will last for half a year, and during my next year I'll also be able to do an internship.


Thus my goal with this 'rant' was mainly to ask for advice on this decision, especially regarding my future career. I really  do want to continue in (eco)toxicological research and work with zebrafish as a model organism. However I'm also open to other developmental research, as perhaps my perspective isn't fully formed yet since it's based on one good internship.


I'm looking forward to your opinion, even if it's a small one! If any of you have questions about me or anything I've mentioned, feel free to ask them! I do want to thank you guys in advance. Of course if my choice ended up being the wrong one, it will be just for half a year, so there no real worries. However, it doesn't make it easier to choose.

7e3pop,3,2017-11-19,I'm soon to graduate with a B.S. in CS and unsure how to make my first steps into a career.,bounceyboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7e3pop/im_soon_to_graduate_with_a_bs_in_cs_and_unsure/,"Hi everyone! I've been a lurker here for about a year, but honestly the majority of what people say goes over my head and I'm hoping asking more specifically about my situation will help.

I'm about to graduate from Rutgers with a B.S. in CS. I'm behind because of a major change and some failed classes, so I'll be graduating after a Summer class, meaning my official graduation date is in October 2018. My GPA is terrible and I've had no internships or any work in the field (except for a couple years working for the Rutgers computer labs, but that wasn't programming at all.)

I have a pretty interesting resume I believe, I've been a decently successful Twitch streamer for the past couple years, which is why I haven't pursued a coding job, and I have very good interview/personal skills. That said, because of my lack of experience and technical knowledge I worry that when I graduate I'll have a very difficult time finding a real coding job. I am good at programming and related stuff however, so I believe that I could be successful in technical interviews by the time I graduate.

Another issue for me is that I'm super behind the curve for most seniors. Rutgers has a requirement of 7 CS electives that usually students do spread throughout their last 4 semesters, but I'm taking 3 this semester and 4 next semester. This will leave me with little time I think, as well as me not having the knowledge that I believe most employers are looking for when hiring seniors. For reference, I've learned up to Computer architecture and a lot about formal logic/CS theory. I'm currently in a software class, a systems programming class, and a programming languages (theory) class. Most of my classes use and used C, I have a little experience with assembly, and my software class uses Java.

My question is this: How can I optimally prepare for graduation at this point? I'm certain that I want a career in CS, and I'm worried that since I haven't applied myself really until my senior year it's going to be difficult. I'm considering working through leetcode, doing my own programming projects to put on github, and applying to jobs. I don't have unlimited time though, and I'm wondering which of these would be the most efficient use of that time, or if there's something else entirely you all would suggest.

Thanks for reading, sorry I know it's a lot, just seems like very few people in a similar situation to me post here.

tl;dr - I'm a senior with my most important classes this year and I have no experience outside of schooling. How can I optimally make use of my remaining time in school to allow me to find a job when I graduate?"

I graduated from university with a B.S. in biotechnology (biochemistry with a little bit of programming), with 26k student loans and worked for a year at a company making 40k$ pretax. However, it requires very odd shifts (ranging from morning, evenings, and nights) and has very little prospects of moving up. Due to family situation, I had to quit and move back home. I saved up 6k$ in the meantime. I've been looking for jobs but its very limited with not much to look forward to. Lots of science entry level jobs for my experience pays little (12-17$ish) and also has odd shifts. I really can't see myself continuing with this career path for the next 40 years so I was thinking of returning back to school to pursue a 2nd bachelors for computer science. I am doing this because I find the subject very interesting and I tried to self study/learn from boot camps but my friend told me that I won't be getting the proper knowledge needed besides ""code monkey"" related work. Since I already finished up 1 degree, it would cost me 6k$ (financial aid) to get the other one and I would plan on working part time to pay my living expense. I figured with better knowledge and strong determination since my first time in college I was fairly immature and didn't take advantage of my resources, I could try to land an internship and grow my resume from there. Is this the right idea? I see a lot of people saying that returning to college isn't worth it but I think the proper guidance for learning programming correctly could really help me out. Also, the usual starting salaries around my area is 60k which is 50% higher than what I was earning and if I really am able to get better opportunities the salaries would be higher of course. Any advice is appreciated and I will try to comment to give more advice!"

I will be graduating December 16th with a Bachelors in Business with a concentration in Human Resources. I love the HR field, I have been lucky enough to have had a summer internship with a large cellular company's headquarters. 

I am extremely nervous and anxious about graduating in one month with no job lined up. The HR market in my state is awful. The pay is even worse. I am open for relocation but would prefer not to.

I guess my question for the HR professionals here is this: If I am unable to get a solid paying HR job as soon as gradation comes around, is settling for an HR receptionist position that lets me assist with benefits and various other HR tasks a suitable way for me to gain experience while i wait for the right job to open up either in my state or anywhere else really?

About me:
I am 27 and graduated from a master in finance in Denmark. During my last semester (September 2016 - February 2017) I got an internship at a fortune 500 firm. During my internship my manager loved me and made sure I stayed at the company.

The trigger
After finishing the internship I decided to stay at the company in a different division (February - November 2017). Nevertheless the new manager and I could not work together and he ended up firing me. 

The reason he told me was not because I didn't deliver good results it was literally because we could not work together. 

For me I have no hard feelings about it , as my mangers boss has written me a great letter of recommendation, co-workers I have been working closely together with are providing me with references  and I have been looking for new jobs prior to the firing. 

My feelings 

After I graduated I haven't been very satisfied with basically everything which resulted that I had negative feelings. 

From the outside it seems that I have a great life. 
My degree is a above average and I easily found a job. I have a great girlfriend and couldn't wish for better emotional support from her. 

However from February to November everything became worse when I started to work for my new boss. He has not been manager that enabled his employees he was more a leader that pushed his employees in a more destructive manner. This made my emotional state worse. I had a slight upside when I decided to look for a new job however the weather during Autumn makes you get a winter depression, so all in all I felt miserable from September to October. After my manager fired me I felt even worse and my world was collapsing.

Nonetheless I started with a new daily routine after he fired me because I was afraid of falling into a deep emotional hole. 

Mirror game:
In the morning I start to tell myself that I love myself and that I am going to have a great day.

Suggestion game:
I take a page and write repeatedly several sentences.
Eg I love myself. 
That I have a great job.
I succeed in my daily doings.

Meditation game:
Each day I close my eyes and imagine a great day where I work successfully somewhere. Enjoy the time with friends and my girl friend. 

The result: 
Today I feel balanced. I feel neutral and I feel slightly optimistic. I don't feel 100% good at the moment, due to the fact that I got fired but I feel somewhat in control. 

Questions:
This is the first time I have done this, did anyone experience anything similar?
What can I improve in regards to my routine?
Are there any negative side effects?

Since I had pointed my wife to this sub I deleted my previous two topics just in case.  She read the ""understanding"" post.  I was hoping she would continue to read the board but it's obvious that hasn't happened.

TLDR: Me 33HLM, wife 28LLF, married three and a half years.  Amazing and wild sex for three years prior to marriage, sunk like a rock as soon as the honeymoon was over.  She's in veterinary medicine school, is on an SSRI for depression, we did six months of couples counseling, I've had the talk two, if not three, dozen times over the past two years, and she has used ""suicidal thoughts"" to deflect the conversation back to her needs nearly every time I have a serious talk with her (which only pisses me off).

Marriage, starting vet-med, and starting the SSRI all happened in basically the same month.  She has a regular psychologist and therapist and has for many years.  She has no hobbies, a couple friends, and spends 100% of her free time sitting on the end of the sofa drinking, smoking weed, and dicking around on her phone while ""we"" watch TV together (but hey, at least The Punisher got released so I actually want to watch Netflix now!).

NO KIDS!!!

As for me, was active duty Army in a combat arms MOS for seven years, multiple deployments, but luckily no PTSD.  My dick works, I sleep fine, and my back is fine.  Pretty rare I guess.  Parents divorced when I was 13, relationship between them seemed fine and loving prior to that, mom cheated on dad, I got used as a pawn against my father, and when the dust settled my dad had really stepped up and sacrificed a lot gain sole custody of me.  He's my biggest hero.  

After a few years as a co-owner of a used car dealership I decided I had to fix my dumbass liberal arts degree mistake, went back to school a few years ago, got a degree in computer science, and now I'm a programmer who landed my dream job from my internship last spring.  I'm normally incredibly confident, pretty fit but have really been pushing it to the next level lately with weight-lifting.

Back to what the sub is all about.  Sex tapered off pretty quickly.  She doesn't initiate.  In an act of hysterical bonding after a particularly bad fight about six weeks ago she wore lingerie for me for the first time in two years and the sex was great.  Amazing, actually.  

But that was the entirety of her effort.  I guess since I thought it was good it meant that the relationship flank was covered or something.

We're in a textbook over/under-functioning relationship, me over, her under, and I'm really sick of being the maid, the ATM, and the chef.  She's the type of person who would ask you get to her a drink even though she's twenty feet closer to the kitchen.  Actually, a great example was from last week when I got up to grab a bowl of ice cream and she asked for a drink, a prilosec, and scrambled eggs all in three different requests within thirty seconds.  Drink and the pill were fine but the ice cream was in the bowl when she asked for the eggs.  I of course said no and even told her it was a fucked up request.  She complained that she had gas.

So two weeks ago I created two private twitter accounts; one for me, one for her.  Sexy profile pics, sexy background headers.  I set it up on her phone.

Had her come into my office and I explained that the account was for sending naughty tweets to one another.  Text, pics, videos; whatever.  We were to use it at least once per day BUT whomever was the last poster meant the other person had to post next (so if I posted something she had to respond before the day was over and vice versa).

We even made up some fun sexual rules as ""punishment"" for failure.

First day was great!

...and she never posted again.  Which fuckin' hurts.  Just something that isn't even large or a particularly big deal but it hurts even more than the rejection.  It feels like she can't even be bothered to acknowledge my existence.  Such a HUGE feeling over some twitter accounts.  The brain is weird.

I haven't bothered to even bring it up and I don't know if she's just completely oblivious or is aware but just hoping I don't ever bring it up.  The last time we had the talk I explicitly told her I never plan to have that conversation again and I don't plan to.  The time for commo for is over.

During the hurt I created a fake okcupid account.  I don't message any women, or even send likes, but I created it just for browsing.  I pretty much log into it whenever I'm feeling particularly down as an escape.  I also can't help but think how much I would crush it on there.

Just really wanted to vent today.

I plan to have a consultation meeting with a divorce attorney sometime next month whenever my bonus comes in and see what his or her recommendations are.  For our entire marriage I've been the sole bread-winner, even when I was in school, and nearly everything in the house is mine from before the marriage.  I don't plan on doing anything to jeopardize a divorce though, oddly, I think she would also want to get it over with as soon as possible.

Thanks for reading."

I used to be very worried about my grades, anything below a B was basically an F in my mind. However after my internship, I got a view into the actual world of engineering. My mentors told me to relax this next year and have some more fun.

7e4gyu,45,2017-11-19,I (24F) got an internship that I've had to temporarily relocate for. My boyfriend (24M) that I've been with since I was 17 has put us on a break because of it,intern3130,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7e4gyu/i_24f_got_an_internship_that_ive_had_to/,"I went home last weekend, which was my first weekend back at home since my internship began 2 weeks ago and my boyfriend was behaving coldly towards me. We haven't been able to talk as much on the phone as we'd like because I've been much busier than I'd anticipated, but we text in the morning and we speak on the phone for at least 30mins before we go to sleep. He'd mentioned the lack of contact at one point but I apologized and made more of an effort to stay in touch so I thought things were okay.

There weren't any major incidents at the weekend, he was just off with me. I know when he's angry because we've had a lot of problems with how he's treated me before so I recognize the signs. For example when making physical contact would be rough with me like snatching things from me if I hand them to him. Little things but I know what they mean. I kept asking him to tell me what was wrong and he denied anything was wrong. 

When I was due to leave he walked me out to my car. I tried to kiss him goodbye and told him I was gonna miss him and that I couldn't wait to see him next week. He was like, ""yeah right you're not gonna miss me"". I said of course I will and asked what he meant. He then accused me of not having time for him, for prioritizing everything and everyone else over our relationship which isn't true. I put my boyfriend first all the time. He's close to my family and ever lived with us for a while in high school because his home situation wasn't good and I've never spoken a bad word about him to my parents, despite the things he's done to me to protect HIM and to protect one of the only stable relationships he has with people that care for him. I moved to a college nearer to home because he asked me to back when I was in college. I always always always put him first. Don't get me wrong it's a two-way street and he's done a lot to take care of me and make sure I don't want for anything but it pisses me off when he pulls this stuff. I didn't say any of this to him of course because I don't want to throw things in his face but it upsets me because I do make him my priority.

After that I left feeling like crap. I called him when I got home and he ignored my call. This whole week we have barely spoken, just a few texts here and there and whenever I ask if we can talk on the phone he has some excuse. Then he called last night and told me maybe we should take a breather. He said he can feel that my focus is elsewhere so he wants to allow me to concentrate on my internship without feeling obligated to him at the same time.

I told him I didn't want to be on a break. He said he can feel himself resenting me and he doesn't wanna be angry with me. He said when I was with him last weekend he felt like he couldn't just let go and be loving with me because he could feel his anger brewing. I was like what can I do to make things better and he said we just need space and we'll see what happens after the internship. He said when I visit home on weekends just to let him know and he'll go stay on a friends couch. I literally begged him to try and work through it with me. We've been together 7 years and we live together, the holidays are coming up, how is it so easy for him to disconnect? I'm so tempted to drive home and say fuck this internship or at least see him face to face and get to the bottom of this. We’ve been through similar things before but I'm scared that this is permanent this time.

Advice would be really helpful please.

Ever since graduating college almost two years ago, I just feel lost. I worked a retail job at an Apple Store for about a year and that was alright. I did an internship too that I kind of hated... I’m now in a PhD program and it’s just so damn boring and unfulfilling. And it just sucks up all my damn time. I also have a girlfriend that I don’t know if I love or not... That relationship sometimes feels fulfilling, other times not... And my anxiety is killing me. I have moderate agoraphobia that while it’s gotten less debilitating because I’ve been working on it, it’s still there and really limits me. Dealing with that is just so exhausting and depressing. The agoraphobia plus relationship dependency issues I’ve developed because of my parents just make me feel so limited in what I can do and where I can go, because I’m scared to do a lot of things and I’m scared to do things alone... This has only been over the last 18 months or so, which sucks because this isn’t how I always was.

Now I’m just starting to lose interest in everything. I’m starting to feel worthless again, and I’m starting to somewhat isolate myself and things like cleaning up around the house have just become so damn hard.

I just don’t like where I’m at at all and I don’t know what to do to get out of it... I also don’t know where I want to be relative to where I can be (because of anxiety limiting me), so I just feel really lost right now."

- When I was 18 I went to a friend's 21st and then when the night ended, for no real reason behind it, I went to a see prostitute. We didn't have intercourse.

- When I was 19 I started seeing a woman that was more than twice as old as me, as kind of a friends with benefits thing. It just kind of fizzled out.

- At the beginning of last year, I came home after a bit of a night out and my parents were angry at me for staying out longer than usual. For some dumb reason, I cut my arms up pretty bad. I have scars all up and down my arms which I feel self conscious about.


-When I was 22, I had a manic episode - which I feel was brought about by me getting into spirituality. This was followed by a brief depressive period, but I'm feeling better now.

-I don't have a job (like a proper job). I've had several part-time jobs but I haven't gotten an internship at an engineering firm like I'm supposed to have gotten as a part of the requirement for my degree. This may be because of my below average marks, and the marks are low because I don't really apply myself. It has improved somewhat however, I'm doing honors next year, and this year I got pretty good grades.


- The relationship with my parents and family has completely changed as a result of my fuck-ups. When I got unwell (psychosis) I told my parents everything. They don't really trust me and are much more controlling. They always tell me to pray and to believe in God, but I just don't and I can't see myself ever being a believer. 

- I don't have many good friends. It feels like I'm just going through the motions right now.

- I've never had a girlfriend. My parents after my psychosis completely cut all my friends out of my life and then a year after my episode sent me overseas for a year to work.

- I see a clinical psychologist weekly to help me. She is the only other person aside from my parents and grandparents that knows.

What I'm trying to get at is that ... I've done all these things. It's constantly in the back of my mind. And my parents (they're good people...) keep bringing this up. 

- My parents say that when I get married or begin a relationship that I will have to tell the person all these things I've done.

Despite all this I continue to get up in the morning and feel thankful for all I have in my life and the people I have that support me and love me.

- I've had discussions with my parents where they've said they've forgiven me for my transgressions but they do say what I've done is sinful and an affront to God. I think this is also because at one point in time I was a bit 'experimental' with my sexuality and did things with guys. My parents know about this too.

I still feel positive about the future. I'm somewhat happy. But my parents are still kind of 'living in the past'. My dad thinks I have a bad character. My mother tells me he sometimes cries over the fact that he used to beat me as a kid (sometimes) and feels partly responsible for the state I'm in. I don't blame him at all. 

I guess I'm bringing all this up now because I was having a chat with my mother and she said ... 'you'll have to tell (the girl I'm seeing) eventually'. 

To add to this my dad hasn't had the easiest time either. He has been on/off employed for the past 5 years. He lost his job recently due to redundancy and my mum especially has the view that 'children should be support for their parents'. As in once a child has grown up he/she should be a 'good' member of society and should be earning and capable of supporting a family and helping others in need. 

-My mother keeps saying I can't tell 'right from wrong'.

I always compare myself to the people around me, and realize I've gone off the 'right track'. I keep thinking, 'when will things get better?'.  No one calls me, no one texts me, no one asks me how I'm doing or how my day has been (aside from this girl I've gotten to know over the past year, and my psychologist). 

Again to reiterate, I'm not looking for sympathy because this is all my doing. I'm not 'unhappy' but I'm not 'happy' either. I realize that life is what you make it but the date with this girl has me anxious and scared. 

What will people think if they know the truth about me? I feel like I'm a liar and a thief, and to a degree I am. I feel like I can never get close to anyone because they will judge me. 

TL;DR - I've done things in my past that have taken a toll on me. How do I move forward and stay positive. How do I make life better? How/when do I tell people about my fuckups. Do I need to tell them at all?

Thanks for reading. I think this post was better suited to r/offmychest but, whatever. "

7e5x0x,1,2017-11-19,"[M4A] Mama, I'm coming (at) [Home]",ForPostingSmut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7e5x0x/m4a_mama_im_coming_at_home/,"*Sorry for the weird title formatting, but I wanted to include the theme and an Ozzy reference.*

Zach received an ominous text from his sister Jenna as soon as he switched his phone off of airplane mode as his flight pulled into the gate. ""Just a warning - things here are a little different now."" 

He had been eagerly awaiting his return home for Thanksgiving break. It was his first time seeing his family since early summer. At 22 and a senior in college, he spent most of his time at his university focusing on classes and internships and preparing for his eventual graduation. He checked in with his family often and everything seemed to be normal, so he had no idea what Jenna could be talking about.

As he grabbed his bags and waited for his Lyft to arrive he arrive his thoughts jumped from one unpleasant thought to another. His mom and dad couldn't possibly be getting divorced. At times they seemed obnoxiously in love. His family's house is an old house with most of the door frames slightly out of wack so it's not unusual for a closed door to pop open. It's something the family has always been used to and since growing up, they were always taught to be open about their bodies and sexuality. It just wasn't a big deal to walk past the bathroom and see someone stepping out of the shower, dripping wet and naked. There were a few times, coming home late after being out with friends that Zach walked past his parents' room when they were clearly in the middle of making love. On time in particular he saw his mom riding his dad in reverse cowgirl and pulled the door closed to give them some privacy. He heard his dad call out ""Thanks!"" and his mom just winked as she bounced up and down. Since that's what he has always known, he didn't think it was weird and since there were nothing but signs of a happy marriage he was hoping his sister was alluding to something else. 

Zach tried to push away his worries and regain his excitement for his visit back home. Jenna's birthday was a few weeks back, her 18th, and he decided to just wait to give her her gifts when he got back for Thanksgiving. He picked out a hoodie for her in the college bookstore as well as a few giftcards and was looking forward to catching up with his little sister. Thanksgiving was always his favorite holiday, less hectic than Christmas was the focus just on being together, eating, watching some football, and enjoying each other's company.

Everything seemed normal as the driver dropped him off in his driveway. Both his parent's cars were in the driveway and it looked like Dad had already gotten started decorating for Christmas. All good signs. He opened the door and called out a greeting and heard his mom's cheerful voice reply, ""I'm in the kitchen honey. Welcome home!"" 

Zach dropped his bags in the hall and headed to the kitchen, but froze once he entered. His mom was busy, bowls and trays all around the counter - a sight he expected. What he didn't expect - his mother was clad only an apron. ""Oh Zach, I've missed you sweetie!"" She gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek as if everything was normal. Mom patted his arm affectionately and she seemed to be reading the confused look on his face. ""Jenna and your dad are upstairs and they want to see you as soon as you get home. Check her room first.""

Zach left and made his way upstairs, confused with his mom's attire, still worried about the text and concerned about the urgency with which he was sent to see his father and sister. His bewilderment grew when he heard his father say with a laugh, ""Don't tell your mom, but I think you might be able to take me deeper than her. That little mouth of yours...damn."" 

He heard a muffled giggle from his sister and followed the sound of their voice to Jenna's room and saw his father and sister, both completely naked. His dad was sprawled out on his daughter's bed and there was Jenna, bare ass in the air as she slid her mouth up and down her father's cock. Zach's dad noticed the arrival of his son and propped himself up with a grin. ""Glad your home son!""

""Since Jenna turned 18 we decided we should be even more open about sex and stuff you know? Your mom and I always taught you kids that sex was nothing to be ashamed of and should be shared with people you care about and totally consensual."" He gave Jenna an affectionate pat on the head, ""And is there anyone we care more about than family?"" Dad struggled to explain the recent changes in the family in between moans and sighs of pleasure.

Jenna pulled back, letting Dad's cock slip from her mouth. She wiped some spit from her lips and smiled. ""Zach, I thought it was a little weird at first too, but after I thought about it made total sense. We couldn't wait until you got home to tell you all about it. And show you too."" She stood and approached her brother, still standing in shock in the doorway, and wrapped her arms around him in a sensual kiss.

*****

Thanks for making it this far! I wrote this up as third person, but could be done in first person if that's your preference. Open to replies at any point, for short- or long-term play. I just wanted to create a fun, incest-themed Thanksgiving prompt that's dirty, yet sweet and playful as well. Open to adding other family members as well such as older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles, maybe even grandparents.

Kinks are mostly vanilla - oral, cum, light spanking, dirty talk, and certainly open to others. I see this as being playful and fun with genuine affection between the characters. Not exactly freeuse but very sex-positive.

Limits - noncon, futa, pain, bathroom, animals, drugs."
7e62qv,3,2017-11-19,A Statement of Purpose for a Biostatistics M.S. Please critique!,Douglas_McFloofer,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7e62qv/a_statement_of_purpose_for_a_biostatistics_ms/,"I desire a graduate degree in biostatistics in order to solve problems in the dynamic and growing health care industry. The road I traveled as an undergraduate at the University of XXX included both academic research and an industrial internship in medical device security and quality; that experience provides me the foundation for successful graduate study. The University of XXX’s excellent biostatistics curriculum provides a fundamental education in statistical methods such modeling, regression, and longitudinal analysis while allowing me to customize my education with the cadre of electives available. Upon receiving my M.S., I intend to work in the health care industry designing experiments and clinical trials to validate medical devices and techniques.


Statistics’ use in validating scientific research and predictive modelling interest me most significantly. My career up to this point has largely focused on using statistics to validate studies on industrial equipment and to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. Having studied engineering as an undergraduate, I’ve applied statistics to improve manufacturing processes in the automotive and medical device industries. Working in highly regulated industries such as those has given me an appreciation for the need to statistically validate the quality of our product at every stage of the manufacturing process. With a graduate degree in biostatistics, I can take the leap from designing manufacturing processes to designing scientific and medical studies.


The PI in my first research internship inspired me to supplement my engineering education with a statistics minor. I was responsible for working with files from an FDA medical device database to create a graph grouping thousands of devices by function and similarity. I learned the fundamentals of UNIX shell scripting to accomplish this goal; working with medical device databases from the beginning of my undergraduate career portended my passion for both statistics and the medical device industry.


One statistical technique I’ve used throughout my career is the gage repeatability and reproducibility study (gage R&amp;R). The purpose of a gage R&amp;R study is to validate that a measurement device (gage) is capable of producing consistent results when different operators measure the same part. This study involves taking a sample of manufactured parts, then having three operators measure the same parts three times each. This study is blinded so that operators do not know which parts are measured at any given time. Once data is collected, the statistician uses ANOVA to determine the percent of total variation between measurements that can be attributed to the operators, the parts, and the gage. We perform this study to demonstrate to our customer that our gages do not significantly contribute to any measurement variation in our product.


Most interestingly, this technique was applied identically in both my internship at a biotech firm and my current job at an automotive supply firm. In both jobs, our customers required all of our measurement devices be validated by gage R&amp;R by demonstrating that our gages contributed to less than ten percent of the total process variation. Whether the device was a high-powered spectrometer or an ordinary tape measure, our company was responsible for convincing our customer that we can verify the quality of our product. In my current role I am responsible for managing the machine operators’ data collection then presenting an argument to our customer that our gages are as accurate as we guarantee. During the two years in XXX’s biostatistics M.S. program, I can combine this leadership experience with advanced classes on experimental design to kick off a career in clinical research.


Examples like the above are a microcosm of why I’m passionate about statistics as a career. As John Tukey once said, “the best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.” Not only can one work in virtually any industry or research organization with a statistics degree, but one can work in virtually any sector of an organization. While I desire to work in the health care industry designing and validating clinical trials, I appreciate the flexibility associated with a biostatistics degree and the litany of electives offered at Michigan with which I can expand my knowledge of the field. I intend to select classes such as biostatistical computing and computational methods in statistics because the ability to manipulate and extract information from data sets is paramount for a modern statistician.


Finally, I appreciate that XXX’s M.S. program prepares its students for doctoral study, even offering a curriculum for students who wish to pursue a doctorate after the masters. I desire to work in clinical research, and a doctorate unlocks the doors to a future of leading scientific studies and the privilege of conducting original research. Although I do not yet know if my academic journey ends with a masters or a doctorate, I appreciate that the M.S. program can put me on the fast track to further study.

7e6oh2,0,2017-11-20,[M4A (playing F/Futa)] Seduced by RoosterTeeth,Nmarshall273,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7e6oh2/m4a_playing_ffuta_seduced_by_roosterteeth/,"Hey DPP! I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

7e6ygb,217,2017-11-20,Tips for College Freshmen,mabdel511,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7e6ygb/tips_for_college_freshmen/,"I wrote this as a comment in someone's post but decided to make it my own. Basic but great tips for College Freshmen, or College students in general.

1. Don't take classes lightly just because you're a freshman, study and go to class. Don't listen to those who are always acting cool and bragging because they skipped class.

2. If your professor assigns homework, and it isn't graded, do all that homework and make sure you do it all right. Those questions will 9/10 times appear on your exams and/or quizzes.

3. Take breaks when studying, not 80 hour breaks, but reasonable breaks for long study hours.

4. Don't, Don't DONT DONT DONT DONT DONT Procrastinate, they say money is the root of all evil, in college, procrastination is the root of all evil. If you have an exam in 2 weeks, plan for it, study slow, take your time, 3 days before review, day before review, and then take the exam. Don't wait till its 8pm on Sunday while you're watching Friends on Netflix and still considering studying for your 8:30am class. Don't do this, trust me, trust me, trust me, it hurts and it hurts alot when you knew you had the chance but wasted it.

5. If your stuck, ask for help.

6. Make study groups, join study groups, start a study group.

7. Don't sleep on trying to get internships early and getting your game on, you will look way way way better than all the current freshmen with you. Just try, you won't lose anything. Go to career fairs, network with people there, even if you don't want an internship right now try to get some companies interested in you, show that you're serious and of value.

8. Don't be the that person who goes all 4 years not socializing or talking to anyone, it hurts. Join clubs ( I didnt join clubs even though I wanted to so badly, I'm an idiot for not doing so, I completely regret it, well I still can tbh lol ) You'll make friends, gain experience while having fun, be involved, and enjoying your time. Note that clubs are not your only option, talk to random people on campus, people in class, go to school events, have lunch with a stranger (who knows he might be into all the weird any crazy stuff you're into), if you can, try to join a sport, go to school games, etc. 
My freshman year I was sick of keeping myself in my comfort zone and literally walked around campus talking to completely random people I have never met or talked to before in my life. I would ask someone where the library was just to start up a conversation, when it was in clear sight in front of both of us, lol.

9. Get some part-time job, it'll teach you responsibility, I'm still in college and I started working more this year and it is indirectly helping me plan and implement things, and manage my time. Preferably a job or volunteering related to your major, paid or unpaid the experience and responsibility is way more valuable than the money.

10. Stay physically healthy, go to the gym, workout, run, exercise,sweat, swim, this will keep your body and mind healthy. 2 birds with 1 stone, don't miss.

10. Have fun, its college, if you don't feel like going to parties you don't have to. I never went to a college party, currently a Junior, and don't really intend on doing so. Theres so much more you can do, plan a guys or girls night, movie night, go skiing, game night, go out to NYC, see if any cool events are going on on campus, play ball at the gym, swim, go bike riding, explore campus (this is actually fun to do alone, you'd be surprised with what you can find) 

Overall Story: Don't waste College, have fun, enjoy your time, use it wisely (USE YOUR TIME WISELY, WISE-LY, W I S E L Y)

**People are talking in the comments and saying how I shouldn't give advice because I don't go to college parties and that I'm not implementing these because i don't go to college parties. It was my decision whether or not to go to parties, I have friends who go to parties and have no problem with them. I was friends with the DJ at the parties and still didn't go. I was childhood friends and still currently am friends with one of the frat leads, but I still didn't go to party. I simply don't want to go to one and prefer having fun in different ways. Having ""fun"" doesn't only mean going to a party, there's much more you can do. If you feel like going to a party, go ahead, if that's what you like and enjoy, then do it. If you don't, there's nothing wrong with that too.**

During the undergraduate course, I came across the fascinating example of a simple digital computer in our digital electronics subject. Wanting to learn more, I applied at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre as a research intern. The internship gave me a hands on lesson on C and device drivers. Galvanised, the next summer I applied in Indian Institute of technology (IIT) Kanpur and worked on a parallel architecture for natural language processing application on FPGAs using VHDL. I decided I wanted to make a career in computer engineering and joined University of Florida for a masters program in the same field. I could vividly see how coding is essential for solving seemingly impossible real world problems. System software was the right amalgamation of my interests then, working with architectures and software at the same time. 

After graduation, I got a job at Intel for developing some of the fastest storage devices. In my 3 years at Intel as a firmware developer, I gained deep insights of ARM architecture, writing production code in C and python. In conjunction, I took part in Spacex Hyperloop challenge and was a firmware developer in avionics at rLoop, an open source team. We won the 2017 design innovation award.

Being a regular attendee in seminars in Silicon Valley I was introduced to the far reaches of Machine learning from medical imaging in cancer to understanding our genome. Fascinated, I took an algorithm course on Coursera to start the CS journey and enjoyed it thoroughly. This has been my motivation for applying to the OMS CS program, to move to a research based career in algorithms and machine learning and at the same time continue to deepen my knowledge of software and product design."

I am a Strategic communication major in my first semester of junior (third) year. This semester, I am taking Calculus I and Python to prepare for the CS minor in the remaining three semesters. Long story short, last semester, I decided to pick up CS. I have had three decent internships in communication. My ultimate since the start of college goal is getting a paid internship in Media and work in a firm. That goal has changed because my personality does not fit with that flaky media relations world. Now, I am gearing towards technology or academia.  The possible careers of interest that combine communication and CS are data journalist, data analyst, or professor ( talk about that later in the question ). The thing is, I almost finish my degree at a university rank 115 nationally located not near a tech hub. To complete a double major, I will graduate in 6 years, which is a no for me. My current university has a mediocre Computer Science Department. And I am sick of staying at the same place and ofc, finance.


So here are my questions for you:

1. So another option is going to grad school in Communication field where programming skill is useful in research and become a professor. It fits my personality more than a media person is, even though grad students are sadly poor and affected profoundly by the recent 300 % tax raise. If I pick a good grad school program for communication, I need good and real research experience. A bummer: internship and research program application conflict in deadline in Spring 2018. 

1. Should I continue applying for internship summer 2018 in Communication like I am doing now? 

2.  Given the ability constraint I demonstrate in my Python class and slow learning nature,  it's difficult to compete with other skilled programmers. I have this book called ""Python for everyone"" by Hortsman with lots of great exercises each chapter.  I don't succeed in running them. #discouraged. Do you guys have any tips practicing CS exercises? (Tips other than ""Persistence"")

CS people with experience, please give me your insight. Thank you for reading."

I'm more looking for someone with a good idea of the business part but I also like working with other developers! In a perfect world I would love a project involving some ecological or humanitarian values.  

Oh and I'm french so I would love to have some english interlocutors so I could practice!"

2. Rooster Teeth: Pretty straight forward I'm the new intern at RT and one or more of the rt girls is a futa and takes a liking to me

3. Maisie Williams (she plays Arya on GOT if you didn't know): This on will simply be I meet Maisie at bar and try my luck and to my surprise it works and she takes me back to her hotel

4. A real life friend of mine. For this you would a play an actual friend of mine (I have photos). You and I would be driving to my parents beach house to meet up with our friends where we would be spending the week together but our friends bail and don't show so we have the place all to ourselves

7e917k,1,2017-11-20,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7e917k/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7ea8ra,1,2017-11-20,Coworker talks badly about our boss. Small department.,the_wandering,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/7ea8ra/coworker_talks_badly_about_our_boss_small/,"I just started this job in January. Before then I did an internship there and based on that my boss gave me the job. 


I never had any dealings with coworker: A. She remained tight lipped and never spoke to me during the internship. Now since I've been hired, A has been giving me bad vibes. She says things which I believe are lies.. like she was the reason I got hired etc. I went to school for our profession, she did not. She trained on the job. I needed a little bit of instruction and I was good to go. If I ever ask our boss a question in front of her she runs out to answer it. And boss lets her.

Heres the thing. She complains constantly. And I feel as if *she* wants to manage me.. especially bc shes trying to arrange it so I sit directly in front of her. I would be sitting with my back to her. She already makes me uncomfortable so I havent agreed or requested to be moved.

I try to stay on her good side by dropping by ever so often to chat (mostly about her). The last time we chatted she pulled out her certification exam score report and bragged on how well she did on the exam (we both took). I was only a few points under her but didn't say so.

Shes held this position for 5 years. Recently she let me in on the fact that shes looking for another job and all but hates our boss. The negative talk is getting to me as it is really harsh at times.

This is a new job for me and I want to stay out of the negativity. But I feel like my coworker is ramping up. She actually recently obtained my number and called me at 8am to tell me I needed to sign a form. 

Im doing my best to ignore her. Has anyone else ever dealt with an unsavory coworker?"

He calls, I answer, and as so many times before - silence. This was on my iPhone 5S running iOS 11. I hang up, call him back, he answers - silence again.

Luckily, I still got the internship, despite the embarrassment.

Fast forward to today, my boss is sitting next to me, and his brand new iPhone X starts ringing. He answers - ""Hello? Hello? I can't hear you"".

*He has paid 1200 euros for the most advanced and expensive iPhone ever and it's shipping with software so buggy he can't even make calls reliably.*

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Apps crashing constantly, RAM problems, battery problems, you've probably heard all the stories before. It doesn't matter who I ask, everyone I know is having problems. It simply amazes me how Apple could have shipped software that is filled with so many major bugs. Not minor bugs - major, major bugs that affect peoples lives. It is simply unacceptable.

Are heads rolling at Apple HQ right now? How could they not see this coming? Why wasn't it postponed? How could a company known for having the best software in the world steep so incredibly low?"

This is my first post by the way, I mean literally my first post ever.

I don't know what course to take. It might sound dumb but, at the end of the day, all I want to be is financially successful.

I've been thinking of taking an IT course (Information Technology)or computer science or CS, but it's the fact that theses courses might be crowded and looking for internships are gonna be a competition to find. I'm very clueless on what to do during college and when to start applying for internships, any advice on how to start my college life will do. I thought of taking aeronautical engineering but the board exams scare me ( I know it sounds pitiful, hahaha) the same goes with my idea of taking a Pharm. D course ( Being a pharmacist is my second choice after computer science).  

I just don't want to waste any time in college and make the most of it for a (sure?) future that will be financially stable and where I don't have to worry about being unemployed when i reach my 30's

It's haunting me so any advice is greatly appreciated, Thanks :)"

I've been reading this sub to try and get some advice but I don't think any threads have a pinpoint on my exact situation. The basic rundown: I have a form of Muscular Dystrophy (SMA type 2) and am a December 2016 graduate in CS from a state school in my hometown. When I graduated I immediately cracked down and started looking for jobs or internships, anything I could find. However, life kinda threw a curve ball and a drug came out that was the first of its kind to treat my condition. Because of this I had to put my job search on the back burner to deal with doctors appointments, insurance and all the treatment schedules, etc. Afterwards I didn't really resume my job search till September-ish when I was fully recovered from all the treatments (lumbar punctures yay). I got a couple of interviews but none ever went to the second stage. At this point I'm wondering if its even possible to break into the workforce as a disabled adult. When I go into interviews its always a little weird even if I tell the company I am disabled and need accommodations (shoutout to the one company who had my interview in a building with no elevators). Its also kind of awkward since I have to have my mom or brother drive me to interviews since I cant drive. If I were to get a job with a schedule I could get a driving assistant through the state but as of now there is no point to having one. Even the application process is off putting. Most jobs require a ""High paced, independent worker"" which is pretty much the exact opposite of me. I can type about 60 wpm but not for long periods of time and I have to take a lot of breaks to stretch my hands and back. Ideally, a remote job would be best for me but I know that entry level remote jobs are very unrealistic. In general its just very hard. My parents have been very supportive and told me to stop stressing so much on finding work. Most people in my situation don't even go to college but I feel like a drain on society just sitting here not giving anything back. Do I have a realistic shot at ever obtaining a job? My plan was to work as long as possible before I eventually had to stop due to my condition progressing but now with these new drugs coming out its allowed for my condition to slow considerably or even stop which allows for me to have a long career. I have so many questions on the process. Some people say I should not self identify as disabled on applications and some people say I always should. There just doesn't seem to be a lot of advice out there in terms of applying to the tech sector as a disabled individual. If anyone could offer their advice I'd greatly appreciate it.

7eaxia,115,2017-11-20,My [29M] girlfriend [28F] doesn't want to do anything in our apartment and let's her son[13M] make decisions I don't think he should be making.,relthrowaway245,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7eaxia/my_29m_girlfriend_28f_doesnt_want_to_do_anything/,"This is going to be a bit long.

We have been together around a year and a half and she moved in about 6 months ago. Before moving in I cleaned everything as it was just my apartment at the time. She had surgery and I footed the bill initially and during her recovery, I took care of her and shortly after that she moved in.

After she moved in I feel like things just started to get really messy. I work full time and she is doing her masters and also doing an internship. Her ex wouldn't let her go back to school for her masters and I had told her I wanted her to be able to go to school and get to where she wants to be in life.

We have a pretty small three bedroom apartment, one room is setup as a living room, another is ours and the third is a spare room that our cats(we adopted them together) have and her son stays in when he is here.

Since she moved in she may have cleaned the apartment at max 5 times, any other time I have done it. She's never done the cat litter, despite wanting the cats, rarely does the dishes, never puts the laundry away, never takes out the garbage, never cleans the bathroom, leaves things she drops on the floor, etc...

Initially when her son was coming over, I only had a blow up mattress and we had put it in the living room and her son was staying in there. Then the cats popped it and that was the end of that, so I decided that I would buy him a cheap mattress and a platform and set him up in the spare bedroom with a playstation and a tv. Now I had the cat litter in there in a corner and I bought a cat rug to keep the litter from moving all over the floor and the litter does not smell bad nor does the room because I clean it regularly. At some point she claims he had asked if he had to sleep in the same room as the litter and she said no. She did this without speaking to me and it caused an argument between us because I didn't feel like he should be making decisions in MY apartment. Somehow the litter is now in our bedroom when he is over and I hate stepping in it. She used the excuse of him already being uncomfortable coming here and he shouldn't have to sleep with the litter for the two nights he's here. I felt like it wasn't a big deal for him to sleep with it for two nights since its not his regular room. But I lost this argument. OK

We compromised that when he is over, she has to move the litter into our room and has to clean any litter the cat's spill on the floor because I don't want to step in it and that she must bring the litter box back in the room. After her son left, she didn't move the litter back in or clean the floor up.

Two weekends ago, her son was over and I don't know what the fuck happened, but somehow shitty toilet paper ended up in the bathroom garbage. I have heard people doing this before, but this is not something he has ever done previously while being here. I also seemed to find a little streak of shit on the floor in the bathroom and also a streak on the toilet paper. I didn't bring this up to her initially, but she had said to me that it smelled like shit in the house and I asked her if she had put shitty toilet paper in the bathroom garbage, her answer was no. I guess she put two and two together and she removed the bag from the garbage can and then was going to proceed to put it into our kitchen garbage to which I told her no and that she had to bring it out to the garbage on the side of the house. After some whining from her she did it.

For the last 6 months or so, there has been a punching bag on our stairs. She had bought this for him awhile ago, I have no idea why, but she did. This thing must weight 60-70lbs and her son is maybe 5'11 but is as thin as a rail. The bag is probably half his weight. Friday night they both walk in, and hes asking if they can bring it up and she tells him they will bring it up together the following day. She tells him he can go punch it on the stairs. About five minutes go by and the next thing I know is he's dragging in this punching bag and saying how it wasn't heavy. Now I'm standing there washing the dishes after having cleaned the entire apartment and I'm waiting for her to yell at him. Nope. Nothing. I couldn't believe it. He literally could've lost balance and fell down the stairs while bringing it up. Now it is basically sitting up against a wall and I am waiting for the cats to start scratching it up or for one of them to run and jump on the side and for it to fall and crush one of them.

I have discussed with her previously about the apartment needing to be cleaned and she had started crying because I was apparently being an asshole about it. Things did however improve after that and she started doing the dishes and putting the laundry away. I am starting to get annoyed again though because of the lack of her cleaning and seemingly slipping back to not doing anything again. I feel I have done so much for her and I ask so little of her and it really is just starting to get me angry.

The way she describes her childhood sounds pretty bad so some of the things she does I feel are very child like and I feel like she wants to be her son's ""friend"" more than his mother. She had her son young and he was premature and either has Aspergers or mild autism. She knows this, but has never had him tested because she doesn't want him to be ""labelled"".

I don't feel comfortable correcting her son. I don't know when or if its even appropriate.

I don't know what to do about her lack of doing things around the apartment. I feel like I have had this conversation with her before and it should be understood she needs to do things. I try to be nice about getting her to do things since I was ""mean"" about it previously, but when I'm nice about it, it seems nothing is done.
 
  To top everything off, she has also made me give up porn, gone through all my email accounts and looked at pictures that I had been sent by girls long before I knew her and somehow this was all my fault that she did it right during our anniversary and her birthday.  For the record, I was not actively looking at the pictures of any exes, nor did I even remember of their existence.  
  ---   
  tl:dr my gf doesn't want to do anything in our apartment and lets her son make decisions he shouldn't be making.  I've been over some of these things with her before.  What should I do?"

I am an international student currently a senior and have been offered an internship position at a pretty big company. The only thing is, as an international there are a few limits and restrictions such as only 20 hour work weeks in the spring and fall and the fact that the job search once I graduate is using the OPT which many of you are familiar with. I have three issues:

1. The job offer I just received from the hiring agency says it's 40 hours but when I interviewed we discussed 20 hour work weeks.
2. The CPT(permit for internships for international) can only last 364 days of less and my job offer lasts exactly tat. But I graduate in May 2018 and have to look into an OPT so I'm not sure how that one year can affect that.
3. I'm a computer science major and the interviewer told me I'd be doing  a lot of things with engineers for design and programmers for the code. Which is perfect, but the job description they sent me is of a BT Drafter / Design and I'm not sure what to expect of that if it really will help me as a programmer. 

Please I really need some guidance here.  "
7ebhs0,4,2017-11-20,"I’m very good at my job but because it’s considered to be “bottom of the totem pole” at my workplace, I get treated as such. It’s ruining my mental health and causing unbearable social anxiety.",missmatchedsocks88,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7ebhs0/im_very_good_at_my_job_but_because_its_considered/,"I take 30 mg of lexapro for my depression of anxiety each day and had previously been taking 20. My stress and anxiety have been so bad that my doc had to up my dose. I have never really suffered from social anxiety until recently and it is nearly crippling. I wake up most days and just want to cry because I have to go to work and deal with, well, bullying. As a 30 year old woman, I’m dealing with bullying and I never really had to as a kid. There were a few meanies but not to the extent of what I’m dealing with now. 

I work as a cashier at a pharmacy. I’m currently trying to get certified as a pharmacy tech because state laws where I’m from don’t require schooling to complete certification, they just require employment at a pharmacy and an 80% on the tech exam. I just started my “journey” if you will to certification. This is just one of many things I’m ridiculed for at work. 

•I’m not entrusted to accept payments towards patient accounts or to go get change on my own, even though it is in the cashier’s job description. I finally confronted the tech that wouldn’t allow me to do this and, after 8 months of working there, she is allowing me to do it. 
•I am constantly corrected and nitpicked over every patient interaction I have. One of the techs, “R”, will watch me from the corner of her eye all day and if I say something in conversation other than “Date of birth? Have any questions?” she will correct me. Sometimes I’m the only true human interaction that the patients get. Sometimes they like being joked with and talked to like a person, especially in a hospital setting. My boss loves my interactions with patients and they love it too. I never cross lines asking them what they are in for or anything too personal. I’ve worked in sales and retail before and am an extrovert. I know how to talk to people. Patients know me and they love that I know who they are and have a smile for them when they come in. I don’t understand what is wrong with being friendly and genuine to people. 
•When I ask for help or insight while studying for my exam (my boss allows me to do so in my downtime at work) R makes me feel like the biggest idiot in the world. She talks to me like I’m a child and straight up said “You will never be able to get this on your own. Just take the course.” I already have a bachelor’s degree but in something I realized I didn’t want to do half way through my last semester. I know how to study and I have a pretty sharp memory. It really pissed me off that she would say this. 
•R and one of the pharmacists, D, are *very* passive aggressive. If you do one thing wrong, they will act short and rude to you for the rest of the day, no matter how small the mistake. Example:
      -We were planning a joke on one of the other pharmacists by replacing a full box of flu shots with empty ones to see her reaction. I asked her if she had any flu shots today and both R and D pulled me in the back room and reprimanded me for “ruining the joke”. I didn’t ruin the joke. The other pharmacist hasn’t even opened the box or even made an indication that she knew what I was talking about. All I did was ask if she had done any shots. That was it. R hasn’t said one word to me since she chewed me out and D is making me feel about 2 feet tall every time I have to talk to her. 
•Rules change. One day it’ll be ok for me to study and ask questions, then the next day the girls are mad at me because I’m studying and “not doing my job” aka standing at the cash register waiting for a patient to pick up their meds. Sometimes an hour or two will go by with no patients and I can only dust and stock so much before I run out of stuff to do. Again, my boss gave me the go-ahead to study so I’m not breaking any rules. 
•I’m not allowed to take an afternoon break. The other girls do and can but if I try to, I’m called back to my post every time a patient comes in. I’m legally allowed to take two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. It was in my contract. This also applies to bathroom breaks. I go to the restroom for two minutes (do my business and wash my hands) and they’re screaming for me to come back up front. That’s right: some days even going pee is unacceptable. 
•They talk about me when I leave the room. I’ve walked in on it several times. Sometimes they won’t even wait for me to be out of the room. If I make a mistake, they whisper about me while I’m in earshot. I feel like minor mistakes are treated as major, unforgivable mistakes. 
•I’m treated like their bitch. I’m ordered around all the time. “Put the drugs away” and I’ll go to put them away and get yelled at for not watching the counter. “Refill the vials” so I do and they are mad that I didn’t leave one or two at the pharmacy station in case they need it during the whole 30 seconds I’m gone to refill them. 
•I get blamed for every little mistake. The computer system crashed a few weeks back and it was my fault for not calling the company to fix it. The thing is: it has never been my responsibility to do this. Every time we had problems with the system, a pharmacist or the tech person (who wasn’t there that day) would call and get it fixed. I’m not a computer person and not once have I ever been in charge of fixing the computers. I was frozen out by the girls for two days following the crash. We also had an intern that week. She was putting drugs away in the wrong spot. Guess who got corrected and blamed for that? That’s right: ME. 

I honestly just don’t know how to socialize with people anymore. I have been corrected and reprimanded so many times by my coworkers that I’m terrified of conversing in any other way other than the robotic questions and conversation I have to make now. My patients have caught on and I’m constantly asked if I’m ok to which I respond, “I’m fine. Credit or debit?” It physically and emotionally pains me to have to be so reserved. I feel like I’m not allowed to be myself. My friendliness and people skills were something I was very proud of. Now I feel like an annoyance and terrified of interaction, not only with patients but in my personal life as well. I am treated like such a failure and a loser and an annoyance by people that are supposed to be helping me. I want to finish my tech certification but I also do t want to deal with the amount of mental turmoil and social anxiety that has been brought on by daily torture. I’ve never, ever been afraid to talk to people and never felt so socially anxious and depressed in my life. I don’t know what to do about it. It’s getting to the point where I’m withdrawing and not socializing anymore because I’m starting to wonder if I’ve just been annoying all along. 

TL;DR: I’ve been a social butterfly my whole life and have always felt like I did good work at my jobs. My coworkers’ constant reprimands and corrections towards my job and socializing with my patients is causing overwhelming social anxiety. I basically feel like I can’t be myself and have to pull my personality way back. It’s ruining my self esteem. 

I’ve spoken to my boss many times and she doesn’t know what to do either. Shes very passive and doesn’t want the confrontation. She’s talked to R about her behavior Towards me many times and each time, it just gets worse. I hate that when I make a small human mistake, that I get frozen out for the rest of the day. "
7ebpag,3,2017-11-20,Need Opinions on Insurance Internship,cuervor14,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/7ebpag/need_opinions_on_insurance_internship/,"Hello,

I am a junior in college and was recently offered an internship at Northwestern Mutual as a Financial Advisor. When I went to the office it was really nice and everyone treated me really well. When they interviewed me I felt like they covered their internship program really well and really wanted to get to know me. I felt that they were extremely professional and ready to succeed.

However when I went and asked around to people who knew insurance and looked online I saw a lot of negative things. I saw a lot of people say how it is a ""pyramid scheme"" and how all they will have you do is ""sell to your friends"". I saw people say that they would basically try to brainwash me and try to get me to sell everyone I knew insurance that they didn't need. 

Going into the process I had a very high opinion of Northwestern Mutual and I thought that they would be a really good option as an spring internship, especially as since they are in the top 5 internships in the nation. I thought that it would be good to see if I liked it and if I didn't like it I still would have time to change my mind. But after reading online I am very hesitant. I think some people online and in person are very turned off by the requirements needed to sell insurance or sell in general. I don't think they know that it is a lot of hustle and see that hustle in a a negative way, thinking that sellers are basically trying to scam you. 

So here I am wondering if anyone can give me guidance on what Northwestern Mutual really is, what to expect, and what I should do. Thank you guys. "

Forgive me, I need to vent and I really need some advice or encouragement. 

I graduated in Dec 2016 (in three and a half years) from a state school (in top 20 for CS). I double majored in comp sci and math and graduated with honors. I have three years of internship experience (literal years, I worked while getting my degree) from reputable places where I did things that mattered. I was offered a full time gig at my last internship, but turned it down because I thought I wanted to go to grad school at the time. I went through the new grad process with Google and made it on site. I think I'm a pretty good developer, but I'm definitely at the new grad stage of my career.

I've been applying to places for 9 months and have gotten 3 interviews. I've had people review my resume here and by developers I know and they say it looks good. Admittedly I've gone through a few rewrites but I've sent out about 50 applications with my most recent resume (maybe 200 total). [Here's a link to my resume if you want to take a look](https://imgur.com/a/MNQwI) Most places don't even get back to me with a no. I've been applying to positions in Chicago, SF, and Seattle to no avail. I write tailored cover letters for each position. 

I've tapped my small personal network and even reached out to distant classmates whom I've never spoken to hoping to get a referral where they work, but most people don't know me well enough to feel comfortable doing that. 

Is there anything I can do to stand out? Should I go into offices? Should I stalk recruiters on linked in? Is there something wrong with my resume I'm missing? Please I'm desperate here. "

I'm also currently trying to find an internship in Baton Rouge. Even if I end up putting a simpler system in place, I plan on keeping the AADS to practice with. I know that this is a professional forum, and I apologize if this is out of line.  

Is it possible for me to program an AADS to become essentially what is an auto switching multi-channel amp? We have an AADS with 3 APADs, and I'd like to modernize it with iOS control. Rather than creating a custom Mobile app, I'm planning on connecting three Airport Express stations, each with a room name. That way anyone on the network can simply start streaming from their iOS device to whatever room they want. As it sits, my family would rather use a bluetooth speaker than a wall panel controlled system. Airplay lets them choose a source and volume level all from a phone. Right now, I just have the three zones always on at a fixed level. 

My thinking goes like this:

If Input #__ 'on', then Output #__ at volume 60.

If Input #__ 'off' for x seconds, then Output #__ off. 

Of course, I'm not sure how I would go about implementing that in terms of SIMPL logic. If this unit can't detect RCA Line in level, perhaps I could use a [Crestron ST-VS](https://www.crestron.com/products/model/ST-VS)"

I don't really like consulting, and have been putting in applications here and there in fields I am more interested in.  The other day I got a promising first-round interview, which led me to ask this question.

The problem: In fall of 2019, my SO is planning to start grad school. Depending on where she gets in, it is likely that will require us to move to a new city.  Assuming I get the job I interviewed for, that means there's a good chance I'd have to find a new job again less than two years from now.  Am I right to worry that switching jobs today will make my resume look much worse when that happens?

7echrw,290,2017-11-20,"[Unresolved Disappearance] Nearly 7 years later, Indiana University student, Lauren Spierer, still missing",septemberfriars,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/7echrw/unresolved_disappearance_nearly_7_years_later/,"This is my first write-up, so my apologies if I screw anything up. The disappearance of Lauren Spierer in 2011 initially piqued my interest because, at the time, I lived about half an hour from her family. However, I’ve sporadically checked on the case and find it baffling that her fate has never been revealed. Everyone seriously considered to be involved/have knowledge of the case was a college student, so I find it unlikely they carried out the perfect crime. Anyway, getting ahead of myself. Here is a write-up for anyone unfamiliar with the case.

Lauren Spierer was last seen during the early morning hours of Friday, June 3, 2011 walking in the direction of her Bloomington, IN apartment complex. At the time she disappeared, Lauren had just finished her sophomore year at Indiana University, and was taking a course at a nearby community college before returning home to New York for a summer internship. It should be noted that when she disappeared, IU’s spring semester had finished and most undergraduate students had gone home for the summer. Lauren’s boyfriend of three years, Jesse Wolff, was a student at IU but was reportedly at home sleeping when Lauren disappeared. He has passed multiple lie detector tests and I believe his alibi is backed by cell phone records.

On the night she disappeared, Lauren attended a pregame at Jay Rosenbaum’s (another IU student) townhouse - he had a friend visiting for the weekend, hence the party. She was accompanied by her friend, David Rohn. According to Jay’s initial reports to LE, either Lauren or David stated that they had consumed cocaine and the anti-anxiety drug, Klonopin, prior to arriving at his apartment.

The party relocated to nearby Kilroy’s sports bar at approximately 1:45am. Lauren left the bar 40ish minutes later in the company of Jay Rosenbaum’s neighbor, Corey Rossman, without her shoes and cell phone. The duo headed back to Lauren’s apartment complex where they ran into a group of guys known to at least Lauren – some reports state they were friends of Lauren’s boyfriend. At this point Rossman was carrying Lauren because she was too inebriated to walk, and a physical altercation ensued between the group and Rossman. Never entering Lauren’s apartment, she and Rossman retreated to his townhouse where the night had begun. CCTV footage captured the duo walking towards Rossman’s residence at 2:51am - Lauren fell at least twice on her head, so drunk that she did not reflexively put her hands up to brace for the fall. This is the last confirmed sighting of Lauren Spierer. 

Corey's roommate, Mike Beth, had stayed in to do work that evening and confirmed Corey and Lauren made it back to their room. However, after getting sick, Mike put Corey to bed and delivered Lauren to Jay Rosenbaum's room in the same townhouse before retreating to his own room. Jay's visiting friend was asleep in the apartment. Two calls were placed from Jay's phone, presumably from Lauren, to two of her friends (one of them being David Roh). They both went unanswered. In his statement to police, Jay said he noticed a bruise under Lauren's eye. When asked, she said she was unaware of how she had gotten it. He claims he last saw her walking in the direction of her apartment complex at 4:30am, never to be seen again. 

A few things to note:
- The bar, Kilroy's, apparently is covered with sand so the fact that Lauren took her shoes off wasn't deemed unusual
- Corey supposedly told friends he was romantically interested in Lauren prior to her disappearance, however this is not confirmed
- Lauren was reported missing on June 3 by her boyfriend when a text he sent to her phone was answered by an employee of Kilroy's sports bar
- Lauren's boyfriend's parents have publicly attributed Lauren's death to her longstanding drug problem 
- Lauren had long QT syndrome, a rare heart disease that may have amplified the effects of any drugs she may have taken intentionally or unintentionally
- Lauren was arrested 9 months before her disappearance on charges of public intoxication and illegal consumption
- Lauren's parents filed civil suits against Beth, Rosenbaum and Rossman, however these were dismissed by 2014

IMO, the obvious assumption is that she accidentally overdosed and these kids (or one of these kids) freaked and covered it up. If that is the case, though, where is her body? From what I know, cadaver dogs were brought in but nothing was found in the townhouse where she was last seen. What do y'all think?

7ecp6t,2,2017-11-20,How to learn database design / general IT projects in practice,jopoAT,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7ecp6t/how_to_learn_database_design_general_it_projects/,"Well, might be that i am totally off the path in this sub (hints for better surrenders welcome :) ) ...
My ""problem"" is, that i landed a job which is rather mixed and/or not well defined in a small company, and i feel sort of lost with not knowing where to start or how best practices would look like. Sometimes I feel like i am an intern only, despite i should behave like being a professional employee with project experiences. The guy above me in hierarchy got decades of work experience but he is not really a technician, so often we have like ""exchanged roles"". I got an unlimited work contract, but it is my first fulltime job after studies.

Some more background info:
I did not study informatics at all, but i am involved with IT/coding/networking/admin/database stuff since more than a decade during school and as a hobby, but i never did bigger projects or got to work within a company ""framework"" (framework in terms of guidelines, prepared build environment, project managers, IT infrastructure and so on)

So what i am definitively good at (and already proved multiple times with the company) is finding the level of a problem and providing possible solutions and alternatives... So if something is broken i need a minute only to distinguish if its on the database side, or a DNS entry was wrongly configured, or if we do have an outage of our internet connection...

So one of the main problems where it starts that i get lost, is that i work sort of my own, have all the possibilities from the opensource scene in any domain that would be possible, have a lot of not good documented legacy systems and no real infrastructure (we are working like 15 years ago, excel sheets on fileshares, reply-to-death mailconversations) and new upcoming projects.

Its not that the company would not want to spend money for new staff so we could build up a team. But currently, as it is a remote location, there is just nobody available on the market who would fit.
So of course I want to do my best, build up some practical knowledge and have this inner goal to make everything as well documented as possible so a possible future employe with lots of work experience would then have an rather easy start to get the big picture during onboarding.

Currently i have to model a database for a new project, where we work together with another company. So it looks like the managers do have only a vague vision of the final product they want to have and im not only in the role of the database modeler but also in the role of the ""requirements engineer""...

So how can i imagine modelling a database for a project in a big company? Is it then just ""stupid"" working for the database engineer?  Like That the requirements are split into modules and every team member models (normalizes, defines primary keys, columns, constraints etc) a part of it and via version control everything is put together in the end? How is/should the communication between management, project manager and the actual database engineers be established? And who decides, what kind of application logic should be handled on the database level (RDBMS provide really sophisticated methods which are decades old established code) or in the application (where it often happens in the modern WebDev times that the ""wheel is reinvented"")...
Or am i just kind of too fresh after studies and its as chaotic behind the scenes everywhere and all i am ranting about is just the way having a job is about, and i need to get used to that? :)"
7ecqa1,2,2017-11-20,I [29m] keep thinking of breaking up my seemingly 'OK' relationship with my gf [33F[,Freefire88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ecqa1/i_29m_keep_thinking_of_breaking_up_my_seemingly/,"**edit** because I read this back and think I come across a bit too whiny. To be clear: I love her, but lately it's turned almost platonic. I feel like leaving, but can't bare to hurt her! Also, just want to be sure this is not just a case of ""the grass is greener on the other side"". Have any of you been in such a situation? What did/would you do?

I've been thinking about this for a long time but I just cannot seem to figure things out or make up my mind. After seeing others get helpful advice here I decided to post and share what's troubling me.

So, a little background:
My girlfriend and I have been together for 4,5 years now and living together for about 3,5 of those years. We met at university, when I was initially with another girl. We were classmates and nothing ever 'happened' between us in those days, btw. I did a long distance thing with my ex which ultimately didn't work out. Then I started hanging out with my current gf. It soon turned into dating and after graduating we moved into an apartment together. We were both pretty much broke and without a job. This was 3,5 years ago.

Things have changed, some for better some for worse. I found a decent job that I enjoy and which provides good career opportunities. She has not. She got stuck in internships initially and never really managed to get a proper job. Major factor in this is that she does not fluently speak the local language (not English). She was an international student and basically stuck around here for me. I am able to support her financially, but this does not help her self-esteem...

The pressure of not being able to get a job, combined with some health issues took their toll on our relationship in general and our sex life. I can't remember the last time we had sex... I have told her that it is an issue for me, but this only made her feel guilty, causing me to find it hard to discuss it again.

Lately, I have been doing quite well at work and I feel that in general I have grown a lot as a person. She, however, seems to be somewhat stuck. We talked about this as well and she is truly working on it and trying to be more positive.

The thing is, I keep thinking of breaking up with her, even though I deeply care for her and she has done nothing wrong. I find myself not making plans with her as much anymore, looking for excuses like hanging out with colleagues or just working really late for no good reason. I do not dislike being around her, though.

She is truly a wonderful person and all my friends and family members absolutely adore her. They have no idea how I feel (I don't easily talk about my feelings).

I am at a loss here. Should I break up with her, disappointing everyone around me just so I can be free of the 'burden' I feel in this relationship? As I said, I am not someone who easily talks about such things, though recently her and I were able to discuss things so she is aware of my doubts. 

Not even sure what exactly I'm looking for from you guys here, but seriously, any support or advice is more than welcome at this point... So, thanks in advance!

**tl;dr** Having doubts about relationship which seems perfectly fine on the outside, but has in reality been troubled for a while. Feel like have grown/are growing apart...Help!"

7edbw4,1,2017-11-20,I've got so many skeletons in my closet I don't know what to do with myself.,128919820,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7edbw4/ive_got_so_many_skeletons_in_my_closet_i_dont/,"This will be fairly long, and I haven't told anyone about this so bear with me.

This post was prompted by my going on my first date which will be this Sunday ...

There have been things I've done in the past which I've regretted, and I feel like this will overshadow my entire life.

I'm studying engineering at a good university, but I've taken nearly 8 years to finish a course which should have only taken 5. 

The reasons are as follows:

I had a psychotic episode when I was 20 years old. This was brought about by mostly smoking pot, which I started when I was 17. There were a bunch of other reasons which were just bubbling along which I will go into now:

When I was 18 I went to a friend's 21st and then when the night ended, for no real reason behind it, I went to a see prostitute. We didn't have intercourse.



When I was 19 I started seeing a woman that was more than twice as old as me, as kind of a friends with benefits thing. It just kind of fizzled out.

At the beginning of last year, I came home after a bit of a night out and my parents were angry at me for staying out longer than usual. For some dumb reason, I cut my arms up pretty bad. I have scars all up and down my arms which I feel self conscious about.

-When I was 22, I had a manic episode - which I feel was brought about by me getting into spirituality. This was followed by a brief depressive period, but I'm feeling better now.

-I don't have a job (like a proper job). I've had several part-time jobs but I haven't gotten an internship at an engineering firm like I'm supposed to have gotten as a part of the requirement for my degree. This may be because of my below average marks, and the marks are low because I don't really apply myself. It has improved somewhat however, I'm doing honors next year, and this year I got pretty good grades.

The relationship with my parents and family has completely changed as a result of my fuck-ups. When I got unwell (psychosis) I told my parents everything. They don't really trust me and are much more controlling. They always tell me to pray and to believe in God, but I just don't and I can't see myself ever being a believer.

I don't have many good friends. It feels like I'm just going through the motions right now.

I've never had a girlfriend. My parents after my psychosis completely cut all my friends out of my life and then a year after my episode sent me overseas for a year to work.

I see a clinical psychologist weekly to help me. She is the only other person aside from my parents and grandparents that knows.

What I'm trying to get at is that ... I've done all these things. It's constantly in the back of my mind. And my parents (they're good people...) keep bringing this up.

My parents say that when I get married or begin a relationship that I will have to tell the person all these things I've done.

Despite all this I continue to get up in the morning and feel thankful for all I have in my life and the people I have that support me and love me.

I've had discussions with my parents where they've said they've forgiven me for my transgressions but they do say what I've done is sinful and an affront to God. I think this is also because at one point in time I was a bit 'experimental' with my sexuality and did things with guys. My parents know about this too.

I still feel positive about the future. I'm somewhat happy. But my parents are still kind of 'living in the past'. My dad thinks I have a bad character. My mother tells me he sometimes cries over the fact that he used to beat me as a kid (sometimes) and feels partly responsible for the state I'm in. I don't blame him at all.

I guess I'm bringing all this up now because I was having a chat with my mother and she said ... 'you'll have to tell (the girl I'm seeing) eventually'.

To add to this my dad hasn't had the easiest time either. He has been on/off employed for the past 5 years. He lost his job recently due to redundancy and my mum especially has the view that 'children should be support for their parents'. As in once a child has grown up he/she should be a 'good' member of society and should be earning and capable of supporting a family and helping others in need.

-My mother keeps saying I can't tell 'right from wrong'.
I always compare myself to the people around me, and realize I've gone off the 'right track'. I keep thinking, 'when will things get better?'. No one calls me, no one texts me, no one asks me how I'm doing or how my day has been (aside from this girl I've gotten to know over the past year, and my psychologist).

Again to reiterate, I'm not looking for sympathy because this is all my doing. I'm not 'unhappy' but I'm not 'happy' either. I realize that life is what you make it but the date with this girl has me anxious and scared.

What will people think if they know the truth about me? I feel like I'm a liar and a thief, and to a degree I am. I feel like I can never get close to anyone because they will judge me.

TL;DR - I've done things in my past that have taken a toll on me. How do I move forward and stay positive. How do I make life better? How/when do I tell people about my fuckups. Do I need to tell them at all?

7edc6z,1,2017-11-20,[M4A] I didn't expect to enjoy my sister's Sweet 16 this much!,ForPostingSmut,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7edc6z/m4a_i_didnt_expect_to_enjoy_my_sisters_sweet_16/,"Zach received an ominous text from his sister Jenna as soon as he switched his phone off of airplane mode as his flight pulled into the gate. ""Just a warning - things here are a little different now.""

He had been eagerly awaiting his return home for Thanksgiving break. It was his first time seeing his family since early summer. At 22 and a senior in college, he spent most of his time at his university focusing on classes and internships and preparing for his eventual graduation. He checked in with his family often and everything seemed to be normal, so he had no idea what Jenna could be talking about.

As he grabbed his bags and waited for his Lyft to arrive he arrive his thoughts jumped from one unpleasant thought to another. His mom and dad couldn't possibly be getting divorced. At times they seemed obnoxiously in love. His family's house is an old house with most of the door frames slightly out of wack so it's not unusual for a closed door to pop open. It's something the family has always been used to and since growing up, they were always taught to be open about their bodies and sexuality. It just wasn't a big deal to walk past the bathroom and see someone stepping out of the shower, dripping wet and naked. There were a few times, coming home late after being out with friends that Zach walked past his parents' room when they were clearly in the middle of making love. On time in particular he saw his mom riding his dad in reverse cowgirl and pulled the door closed to give them some privacy. He heard his dad call out ""Thanks!"" and his mom just winked as she bounced up and down. Since that's what he has always known, he didn't think it was weird and since there were nothing but signs of a happy marriage he was hoping his sister was alluding to something else.

Zach tried to push away his worries and regain his excitement for his visit back home. Jenna's birthday was a few weeks back, her Sweet 16  and he decided to just wait to give her her gifts when he got back for Thanksgiving. He picked out a hoodie for her in the college bookstore as well as a few giftcards and was looking forward to catching up with his little sister. Thanksgiving was always his favorite holiday, less hectic than Christmas was the focus just on being together, eating, watching some football, and enjoying each other's company.

Everything seemed normal as the driver dropped him off in his driveway. Both his parent's cars were in the driveway and it looked like Dad had already gotten started decorating for Christmas. All good signs. He opened the door and called out a greeting and heard his mom's cheerful voice reply, ""I'm in the kitchen honey. Welcome home!"" Zach dropped his bags in the hall and headed to the kitchen, but froze once he entered. His mom was busy, bowls and trays all around the counter - a sight he expected. What he didn't expect - his mother was clad only an apron. ""Oh Zach, I've missed you sweetie!"" She gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek as if everything was normal. Mom patted his arm affectionately and she seemed to be reading the confused look on his face. ""Jenna and your dad are upstairs and they want to see you as soon as you get home. Check her room first.""

Zach left and made his way upstairs, confused with his mom's attire, still worried about the text and concerned about the urgency with which he was sent to see his father and sister. His bewilderment grew when he heard his father say with a laugh, ""Don't tell your mom, but I think you might be able to take me deeper than her. That little mouth of yours...damn.""

He heard a muffled giggle from his sister and followed the sound of their voice to Jenna's room and saw his father and sister, both completely naked. His dad was sprawled out on his daughter's bed and there was Jenna, bare ass in the air as she slid her mouth up and down her father's cock. Zach's dad noticed the arrival of his son and propped himself up with a grin. ""Glad you're home son!""

""Since Jenna turned 16 we decided we should be even more open about sex and stuff you know? Your mom and I always taught you kids that sex was nothing to be ashamed of and should be shared with people you care about and totally consensual."" He gave Jenna an affectionate pat on the head, ""And is there anyone we care more about than family?"" Dad struggled to explain the recent changes in the family in between moans and sighs of pleasure.

Jenna pulled back, letting Dad's cock slip from her mouth. She wiped some spit from her lips and smiled. ""Zach, I thought it was a little weird at first too, but after I thought about it made total sense. We couldn't wait until you got home to tell you all about it. And show you too."" She stood and approached her brother, still standing in shock in the doorway, and wrapped her arms around him in a sensual kiss.

Thanks for making it this far! I wrote this up as third person, but could be done in first person if that's your preference. Open to replies at any point, for short- or long-term play. I just wanted to create a fun, incest-themed prompt that's dirty, yet sweet and playful as well. Open to adding other family members as well such as older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles, maybe even grandparents.

Kinks are mostly vanilla - oral, cum, light spanking, dirty talk, and certainly open to others. I see this as being playful and fun with genuine affection between the characters. Not exactly freeuse but very sex-positive.

Limits - noncon, futa, pain, bathroom, animals, drugs."

I'm a current junior at a fairly well known University but not a tech school. I never coded before I came to college and throughout my classes we've learned pretty much the basic concepts but haven't really had much experience with different fields of programming, just the basics of Architecture / OOP / Algorithms and stuff. I applied to Microsoft and didn't end up getting a second round interview and I'm sort of torn on where to look now. A lot of the other internships I'm looking at are asking for experience  which is just can't get in my classes and I don't know where to start. 

I would love to work in a game development studio but have almost none of the experience those undergraduate internships are calling for and it stresses me out a good bit.

How did you all figure out which place / type of job was right for you and do you have any advice for a newbie like me?

So, I’ve graduated a few months ago with a BA in Advertising and it turned out I don’t really like advertising. I’ve did some internships during my studies and I couldn’t find a job in the industry after that. 

I live in London and I’m now working part-time as a sales assistant for a company that sells luxury stuff and it’s not that bad. I mean, I’ve good colleagues and I get some money in commissions on top of my standard salary, by it’s not definitely my kind of job (I’m a shy person and to do good costumer service you can’t be shy).

I’ve always wanted to work in the movie industry but I’ve never done anything in that regard so far. I feel like I still don’t know what my real passion is and I feel like I’ll have to try many different things before finding it.

I’ve took this part-time job so that I could have 4 days per week to work on my personal projects, but it’s been a month and a half and I haven’t done anything at the moment. I’ve a good contract with this company because I can ask to work more whenever I like, but I’m not compelled to work more than 3 days per week.

I’m 26 years old and I feel like I’ll never be able to find my passion and have a job that I really love. Also, I still don’t know when I’ll be able to buy a house, a car and raise a family with my girlfriend.

What should I do?

Thank you!

I am also writing this after a 48-hour cry session and manic depressive episode of hysteria. You will now find out why this has occurred: 

A little about myself. I have always dreamt of studying at the University of Oxford's MPhil in International Relations &amp; Politics. My plan was to finish this program and then go onto a PhD and enjoy a lovely career in academia. I have worked every summer on attaining prestigious internships in the U.S. and Canada to work in government institutions, non-profits, and embassies as a policy analyst/research associate. I have also accumulated a solid 0 to 1 friends (I don't know if he considers me a friend to be honest) during my time at University. This was done so that I could put an intense focus on school and applying and receiving all of those cool internships. I was hungry and, since the age of 18, this dream of attending Oxford was the only thing I wanted in my life. After waiting for a solid 2 months, I received acceptance into my dream program as well as information about bursaries/scholarships I had potential to receive. Things were going incredible. My family was overjoyed. I also let off some steam from school and have been hanging around more people this month (in the hope I can make some friends). Everything was on the up as I was living in this incredible daze of happiness.... 

Then, about two weeks ago, I decided to have a look at my university winter schedule. I decided that my social science statistics course was a bit too early for my liking. I had noticed that there were two social science statistics classes that semester and the other class was much later in the day. I thought that this would be a cool change from taking early classes my entire life and sleeping in for once. The long mornings of spending hours on essays, case briefs, and analyzing notes were over in my undergraduate degree I thought. So I decided to switch the Stats-A course for the Stats-B course. In order to add the Stats-B course, I had to drop the Stats-A course. I do this with no issue, BUT I forget to look at the reserved list for both Stats-A and Stats-B. So when I tried to submit the change it said a big ERROR. All of the seats had already been reserved and the waiting list was completely full. I was now dropped from both the Stats-A and Stats-B course. At first, I laughed. I thought that this would be an easy fix and the department would provide me with an override to take the course. I am a senior, right? I have a high gpa, right? They know me, why would they not provide the override? 

Well it turns out that the ENTIRE waiting list was an accumulation of 3rd, 4th and 5th year students waiting to be entered into this course. It should also be noted that this was a 2nd year course and a required elective (hence why it was so full). The department could not provide an override for me as it would put a bias on me as a student over others. FUCK. 

So then I go to the department. I get the same cold-blooded response. I then go to the dean. I get the same cold-blooded response. Lastly, I go to the head of admissions. The same freaking response. At this juncture I should probably also mention that nobody has a personal vendetta against me. Yes, I did explain to them that I received acceptance into graduate school programs. At the end of the day they did not care. Not one single tiny iota of a fuck. 

I then got in contact with the Department at Oxford. They gave a similar response in the vein that if I did not receive my undergraduate degree, regardless of the circumstances, I would be omitted from the program and all scholarships and bursaries I had applied too. 

Anyways, this is my life right now. This process has made me realize that I am just some number within academia and a pawn to get money out of. Thanks uni :) 

TLDR: Accepted to Oxford, but cannot go because I mistakenly dropped out of a required course that had no possible way of re-entry. 

Edit: Thank you for all of the advice everyone! I sincerely appreciate it. 

Edit: I should also note that I go to a small university in Canada. I would have been the first student from my university's department to have gone to Oxford. 

Edit: I am on a full-scholarship that lasts only 4 years. The stats class is only taught once per year. As a result, I will have to pay it myself (if I have funds available). "

Please keep in mind my ACT request when answering.

Clarification: I'm not applying until next year, hopefully through the Questbridge program.

**Demographics:** White, Female, family of three, 20k/year net income. First generation college student. *Currently a Junior*
Intended Major: Cognitive or Political Science

**Academics:** I took high school algebra in 8th grade and got a B, which lowered my GPA off the bat. I started taking College Courses through my local university during my Freshman year. Received 3 A's and 1 B on a 4.5 and 3.5 scale respectively. On track to earn A's in an additional college course (through another university) and two honors courses, also on a 4.5 scale. 
This is by far the most rigorous courseload my school offers.

Weighted GPA: 3.941

Rank: 6/90

ACT: 26 (as a sophomore) 32E, 26R, 23E, 23S, 7W. I know that is the worst aspect of my application and am taking monumental efforts to get a higher score. *I would appreciate it if you could chance me with a hypothetical 32 as that is what I realistically expect to be scoring soon in the future. Also how would the chances change with a 34?*

**Extracurriculars:**

Football (Before you ask, yes, the all male team. I am the first girl in my school's history. I am a defensive Lineman.)

Track and Field (I throw shotput and discus. I received a varsity letter my freshman year. I compete three seasons out of the year: Winter and Spring for my school and in the summer for Junior Olympics through USATF. My Freshman year I was one place away from nationals in two leagues, both AAU and USATF. I also received all-academic county team my sophomore year.)

Choir (Vice President of Concert Choir, which has won OMEA district superior ratings the past two years, and am also in show choir. I have participated in Chamber Choir as well. I personally have earned a superior solo rating in addition to an ensemble superior rating in OMEA solo and ensemble competition. I can say I will likely be President next year.)

Drama/Theater (I am a member of the Internation Thespian Society. I have done two shows in which I have been both cast and stage crew. I can safely say I will either be President or Vice President next year)

Scholastic/Academics Team (Not much to say, we are a small and selective group who goes around the county to compete.)

Yearbook Staff (I am the head photographer for our school's yearbook. I am responsible for taking a majority of photos while organizing people to take photos when I cannot. I am also an editor and will be head editor as well next year.)

Youth Philanthropic Board (Give out grants to nonprofits in the community. It's group by nomination only.)

Student Council (Again, not much. It's a standard thing.)

County Youth Leadership Board (One of two school representatives. We go around the county observing community issues and make plans to help county government fix them.)

I am pretty confident that I will also be a member of National Honors Society.

**Awards/Recognition**

2018 USSYP Finalist (United States Youth Senate Program. Prestigious and difficult application/testing process that results in $10k and a week with the US Senate, showing your state's representative. I am one fo thirty, for my state, who are waiting to find out which two have won in December.)

2017 HOBY Alumni (Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Conference)

Appointment into my university's chapter of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (I did not accept the nomination because I was a young and dumb sophomore. Also I am not sure if this is worth noting.)

Head of English Department Recommendation to my university's Dean (I did an extremely in depth analysis of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" for one of my college English classes)

**Work/Volunteer**

I have worked acting food service for two summers at my local medieval faire. I also undertook an internship at an intercity apartment community this past summer (Shadowed property manager, saw what intercity life is like.)

I currently have about 30 volunteer hours helping officiate track and field meets for middle schoolers. I'll have about 50 volunteer hours at the end of the year for Peer Mentorship in English.

**Schools:** My dream school is Yale. I even took a nine-hour drive there last year.

**Questions:** Other than my current ACT score, what do you think I can improve on or do going forward? What do you suggest I write about it scholarship or common app essays?

**TL;DR:** Just skim down the *left side*, everything in parenthesis are explanations and awards. Please keep in mind my ACT request when answering.

Edit: spelling, also my English professor will be really solid for my LOR. (I've had him all through highschool and he has seen my development both as a writer and student grow immensely.)

(first generation immigrant family so i didn't have all the pieces to make a career decision BEFORE going to college)

I have a bachelor's in marketing. Not to knock on marketing, because i love and appreciate business, especially marketing. But I know marketing isn't the end of the road for me, because i love the challenge and reward of programming, and I want to pursue something in the CS field (maybe data science, machine learning, info security, or computer graphics).

After getting a marketing degree, i realized that what i'm really into is working with code and computers. So i enrolled and completed a coding bootcamp. I learned web development and how to program practically. (FYI the bootcamp was one of the greatest decisions in my life, it turned my life around and gave me a lot of programming knowledge. I would recommend a GOOD bootcamp to anybody).

Currently, I am working at an internship. But again, deep down i feel like i need to pursue something more in CS. I feel like I'm missing something

I've been thinking about going back to school for a post-bacc (a second bachelor's) in CS. This is because:

- I know some programming, going back for the actual theory, calculations and practice will be more fruitful with the experience i gained at the bootcamp and at my current internship

- More (relative) job security, because the industry is a little shaky right now regarding bootcampers, and because I fear not having a degree would cap my career at some point, and not enable me to expand and mature my interests in CS (not sure if i want to be doing web development forever!)

- Employers can't use the lack of degree to pay me less for the same work

- I want to get the CS foundation not offered at a bootcamp

- I may want to pursue a master's afterwards

- I want to be an overall better prepared developer

-----
Currently, I feel like I'm at a fork in the road. My options are:

- Keep working for a couple of years, and save up to go back to school for CS. Con -- graduate a little later in life, and possibly lose opportunities to younger competition, lose time i could be working and getting some experience, gain debt. 

- Go back to school next year for foundational knowledge and get the degree sooner, and give up the opportunity to learn more at my current internship. Con -- back in debt, back to school for a few years and not making money/strides in my career, losing the chance to dive deeper at my current job. (it's a startup so lots to do and lots to learn)

- keep working and not go back to school at all, not get any debt but risk losing potentially higher positions later, always feeling like i have gaps in my knowledge, always the question of why I didn't go for it

- go for a master's degree in CS. con -- feel like i'm missing out on the foundation, and some things (maybe alot of things) might go over my head


Does age really matter in the industry when trying to get a good job? Is it vital that I get the degree as fast as possible? I've been researching this for a while and the answers range all over the spectrum, now i'm hoping to ask you guys and girls with experience directly. Please help!

Thanks in advanced! :)

Watched all my friends get good, high paying jobs in the Bay while I failed to find full time work. Got rejected by another couple of companies after interviews and had to move back in with my parents in Montana. Now I’m broke and have my first student loan payment next month.

I lack the motivation/discipline to consistently apply for jobs (probably applied to less than 50 so far), in part due to sheer insecurity about my qualifications and hatred of rejection. Even looking for openings feels like an exercise in frustration, because most jobs want years of prior work XP. My self-esteem is gone, my defensive rage is on a hair trigger, and I don’t know how it came to this - let alone how to fix things. I’ve got a few interview processes in the works, but I just don’t believe in myself anymore. The last straw was today, when I blanked about an appointment with a career counselor my parents helped arrange. An honest mistake, but a really poorly timed one.

On some level I know I’m choosing to be entitled and discouraged, but no one seems to get that just keeping my own mind in check has always been a massive challenge. I thought I’d paid my dues during school and my internship - maybe not all of them, but at least enough to get my start in the industry. Instead I have a piece of paper that I’ll be financially enslaved to for the next 5-10 years and a sense that I’m a still a hack when it comes to programming. I know that nobody will hand me a job, but I’m feeling hopeless about my own ability to land one at this point. I should be feeling proud about being the first person in my family to have an engineering degree; instead I’m broken inside and angry at the world for not being the oyster I was expecting."
7eh4er,3,2017-11-21,[UK] BSc with prospect worries,CompSciUGThrowaway,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/7eh4er/uk_bsc_with_prospect_worries/,"Hey guys, I'm current doing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Hull (UK) and am in my first year. I'd initially applied to Liverpool, Manchester and Lancaster as I studied Maths, Physics and History at A-Level but missed out on my grades and got a place at the Hull instead.

I was excited to study at Hull, but am now a bit concerned by the course only covering C# as a language (with a potential for Java for Android dev only as a 2nd year module - whereas other Universities studied C++ and Java in year 1, or Prolog if you take the AI module), this worries me as I'm concerned it's a bit outdated, and as I've looked for internships (around Manchester/Liverpool as it's closer to home) all have Java, NodeJS or C++ as prerequisities and none of these I am going to be taught.

In terms of my first semester I'm studying Computer Systems (fundamentals of computing, adders, PC/Mac/PS3 architecture), Quantitive Methods for Computing (maths essentially; A-Level recap, vectors, matrices, set theory) and Programming 1 (basics for C# like and how to use Visual Studio).
The course is solely Windows based, with no Mac/Linux presence at all (different to other Uni's where Linux was dual-booted or at least encouraged outside of classes).

I'm a bit worried that not learning the modern languages within the course will affect my ability to get internships in industry in the summers. I intend to go on to do a masters at a Russell Group University after my undergrad degree. 

Will my chances of getting a placement and jobs in the future be severely influenced by this or will I be alright to continue my degree, or should I seriously consider a transfer to another University (is this possible within computer science), if they'll accept me at the end of first year with my exam scores?

Thank you."
7ehec0,376,2017-11-21,3 years ago we started a digital agency and you roasted us. It inspired us to work even harder. Case study inside.,DonDrapeur,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7ehec0/3_years_ago_we_started_a_digital_agency_and_you/,"**Oliver from Kreatix here.** 

Back when we started our little agency in Belgium, we posted various case studies on Reddit. You guys were harsh. We received a lot of feedback, some were nicer than others. But we appreciated it. You can't learn if everybody tells you you're doing a great job. 

We've been receiving mails and DM's on a monthly basis of people saying our post inspired them to start their own agency. https://imgur.com/a/C0Nl3


**It's high time we did a follow up.** 

Business has been going great for us. Through trial and error we have determined what to do - or rather not to do. Now, we work with over 150 companies, and occasionally reel in larger clients. 

We moved into our own office in 2016. After working for 1,5 years in the cloud - in our garden or in the kitchen - it was time to step our game. We lease a small space in a corporate building for around €1000/each month. It's expensive, but it offers a central reception, utilities and free parking lots. https://imgur.com/a/vHowm

This affected our business considerably. Our clients began taking us more seriously and our productivity spiked.

It's still only William and me (Oliver), but we rotate interns. They're highly motivated and they love working here - or at least, that’s what they tell me - as they’re offered a chance to see different side of the business. We include them in every process and value them for their advice and opinion. They join our meetings, they receive client feedback and they are responsible for their own little projects. Interns are an amazing addition to our workflow. It's a win-win. If the project demands some custom work that’s out of our reach, we hire a freelancer. Way better for overhead. https://imgur.com/a/H7qpj


**We've expanded our services.** We're still doing websites and webshops with Wordpress/WooCommerce and themes. We mostly use them as frameworks now. We're also offering a full scala of digital marketing, PPC, email and more. About 10% of our time goes into graphic design. Lately we've picked up something new and that's LinkedIn consulting. It's probably the best converting social media there is for B2B. I've gone viral a bunch of times just by telling a story. About 80% of our meetings in the next few weeks are thanks to LinkedIn. It's been madness. I get about 900.000 - 1.000.000 reach every month. Some of my posts had 4000 likes. And I only post in Dutch, it's hard mode. 

Local CEOs and marketing managers are picking up on this trend and we're consulting them on how to perform on LinkedIn. It's been amazing. We love building products like websites and webshops, but the satisfaction from seeing your clients go viral is awesome. https://imgur.com/a/uwha6


**How are we making this work?** We're honest. We welcome clients who are dissatisfied with old school agencies. They hate the secretive attitude. Invoices with no clear explanation. They call them for support and they immediately receive a bill afterwards. Deviations from project fees, no clear timeline for when the project will be delivered. We're trying to be as transparent as possible and it's working. We explain why we charge this or that amount, we offer coming over personally and fixing an issue. We give a timeline estimate. We're not saying we're better than other agencies. They have way more experience than us. We just believe we can make a difference in service, and the market seems to agree. 


**How do you start an agency?** Pretty simple. You get your hands dirty by either doing free work (don’t hate on this, if you’re starting out and your portfolio is empty, this is the way to go) or, if you want to offer multiple services, find people who want to join your team and maybe work commission-based. Make sure you nail your marketing. Be honest, underpromise and overdeliver. Follow up, call your client when it’s their birthday. You have to be their partner. Make sure you don’t fake this. You HAVE to be their partner, you can’t fake being their partner. You need to make sure you treat their business like it’s yours. Go the extra mile. You don’t even have to start an agency. You could do this on your own, then expand later on. I’d rather see you do something, than being stuck in the ‘wantrepreneur-lifestyle’. 

I’m often asked for public speaking gigs. I love going to schools and inspiring the people in the room. Entrepreneurship is harsh, but fun. I want to show them that. 

I also started a local club called ‘Jong Ondernemerschap’. That’s ‘Young Entrepreneurship’ in English. Our Facebook-group has more than 600 members and we have already held a meetup where people could pitch their project. https://imgur.com/a/HJukL


**We started our adventure as total noobs**, acting way more experienced and successful than we actually were. We’re happy we did that. It allowed us to get so much feedback and make so many mistakes in order to prevent them in the future. 

We’re glad you guys roasted us pretty thoroughly. We learned a lot. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I’ll disclose as much as possible. 

There’s no ask, there’s no link. Our site is in Dutch anyway. I just wanted to share a follow up to our story, because it was total crap, and even then it inspired a lot of people. 


**Thanks for giving us this opportunity.** If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email: oliver@kreatix.be

7ehjn8,1,2017-11-21,Help convince me I don't need to be perfect to find success.,missedtheboataway,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7ehjn8/help_convince_me_i_dont_need_to_be_perfect_to/,"Sorry in advance for the long post. If you don't feel like reading it all skip to tl;dr at the bottom.

I am currently a senior at George Washington University majoring in International Affairs. It's an undergrad program in the top 10 in the world, and I am on pace to graduate with a GPA somewhere in the 3.75-3.8 range. 

The problem is that's not good enough. I have no chance of getting a job here in DC after I graduate unless I make it through some highly selective alternative to traditional employment, such as getting a Boren scholarship or volunteering in the Peace Corps. I don't believe I'm a competitive applicant for those programs for the same reason I'm not competitive for jobs: I lack work experience. I've interned the past two summers and did a work study one semester, along with working a non-intellectual summer job for a few years. This pales in comparison to other students at my school, even those who aren't the most ambitious, and in international affairs work experience is everything.

Unfortunately, I simply am not capable of interning during the semester and doing well at my schoolwork. I know now the reason I haven't been able to keep up throughout the years was undiagnosed ADHD. I also know that once I was diagnosed and put on medication this semester, no one prepared me for a side effect of spending way, way more time writing papers (think 10 hours a page even with an outline) - apparently this can happen if you're already detail-oriented and prone to perfectionism.

Intellectually, I know I shouldn't blame myself for not being able to maintain a busy schedule when I have a disability that directly affects time management. 

Intellectually, I know my self-worth shouldn't be based on grades. It shouldn't affect me to know people who graduated with 3.8s while working and interning, but it does. It makes me feel absolutely worthless. I've never seen myself as a genius but I figured I was smart enough that if I struggled in a subject I'm good at, most people who are not geniuses would also struggle. Clearly this isn't the case if people can get GPAs equivalent to mine or better while doing 100 other activities. Being hard-working and intelligent are right below being a good person in terms of my identity and self-worth, and I'm being so outplayed by such a large group of people that it doesn't feel accurate to call myself either of those things any more. This problem relates to being a good person too. I didn't come into this field looking to be the Secretary of State or make a ton of money. I just wanted to study conflict and development and hopefully use that knowledge to make the world a slightly better place. Unfortunately tons of other students want that too, and thousands of them are better than me in every way an employer can measure. I've lost (or more accurately, am being crushed by the knowledge I never had) the chance to make even a small difference in the world in a field I'm passionate about, and I can't even be mad or jealous because plenty of my fellow students are perfectly nice and compassionate. I don't believe life overall is a zero-sum game, but at this stage of my life getting an entry-level job is. I don't have the goods, other people do, so I've lost.

Intellectually, I know people don't need a 3.8 GPA to stand a chance of getting anywhere after graduation. But I feel I, personally, have absolutely no room for error. One bad sentence in one paper bumps me from an A to an A- in one class? There goes summa cum laude, which would prove I'm an exceptional student to grad schools thinking about whether to take me a few years from now (even the grad schools want a couple years of relevant work experience) or employers thinking about whether to give me a shot at an interview despite my lack of experience. My GPA is literally all I have to make me competitive, and even a 3.8 (not my current GPA and very unlikely to happen at this point) wouldn't put me over the people who have a 3.8+ and better work experience. Anything under 3.8? Even worse. 

At this point I think my only option (barring Peace Corps etc) will be to move outside of DC and take a job in something unrelated to my field. It kills me to think about because I feel not only is that tantamount to failure, I'm never going to be able to make up the difference between me and the people above me. The fact that my fate could have been sealed in some way for getting a B in a class I took at 18 or for not pushing myself through an internship even if it meant sacrificing everything else (health, any social life at all, etc) kills me too. Now all I can do to try to make up for it is be as perfect as possible...which is incredibly, incredibly difficult at this stage in the game and is eating me alive.

**tl;dr: My above-average GPA is not exceptional enough to get me anywhere, and I don't have the work/internship experience necessary to succeed in a field where unpaid internships for people with Master's degrees are a dime a dozen. Please help me understand how to cope with the enormous pressure I feel to do well at academics - the one thing I know how to do - and help me see my life won't be over when I can't get a job after graduation.**

[P.S. To anyone else reading this who may be considering this path: This is what it's like. I wished I had known before I got into it, even though there is nothing else I'd rather study.]"
7ehpqg,3,2017-11-21,New grad salary after stock/bonuses/etc?,bornagainprophet,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/7ehpqg/new_grad_salary_after_stockbonusesetc/,"Before you say ""check Glassdoor"", Glassdoor doesn't take into account any bonuses - it only lists the base salaries.

For example, Google does about 120k/year for new grads but provides 240k in stocks etc over a period of 4 years. 

Facebook also reaches around 170k yearly compensation after stocks etc (and signing bonuses of 60k-120k (up to 120k for returning interns) on top of that).

This is all in SF (high COL). Clearly higher than Glassdoor - because Glassdoor only takes into account *base* salaries (for most of the listings).

Now I know I can't expect IBM to compete with the likes of Google and FB. But **after bonuses**, what can I expect, or what should I negotiate towards?"
7ei7br,2,2017-11-21,Time to move on or time to get down to business?,Versace_Shades,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ei7br/time_to_move_on_or_time_to_get_down_to_business/,"Hi all,  

I graduated with a BS in Finance in 2015 and have been working in the industry since. I started as an intern for a local branch in which I worked full time for two summers while I was home. After graduation, I was hired as an ‘analyst’ by the company for $30,000, in which I was simply running performance reports and managing Excel spreadsheets.  

The company went through a rough patch from early 2015-2016, and I was essentially thrown into a trader position. I now head the trading department (I am the trading department) in which I am responsible for the rebalancing and trading of about $50M in AUM, and there’s opportunity for big growth so it might not be long before I’m responsible for well over $100M and have to hire someone to help me. I am still considered the ‘analyst’ too, so I work about 2-3 different roles at this company now.  

I’ve been extremely loyal to this company, and my boss has been loyal to me. I’ve made mistakes, but found them and corrected them. I’ve taken on new responsibilities, I work hard, I’ve created protocols and procedures, I’ve managed client gatherings and firm parties, I wear multiple hats, I don’t gossip, I help my boss outside of work with various projects, etc. It’s a small company. Tight knit, relatively drama free, and we stay very busy. I work 8-5 M-F, so it offers a work-life balance unlike a lot of my peers have. Best of all, I work literally 5 minutes from home. I can go home for lunch every single day.  

All that said, it wasn’t until a month ago that I was offered my first raise - 20%. Now, this would be nice if I got this kind of raise every year, but it’s my first raise in two and a half years, so less than 10% per year. I know I can be making more money, and I’m coming up on my 25th birthday so I know I have to be making more money. However I would potentially have to give up a pretty lax lifestyle as well. I would potentially have to give up a non-hostile work environment to make more money. I would potentially have to move to another city/state (I’m in upstate NY) to make more money. I’m ok with all of this, but I’m looking for insight as to whether it’s worth it. Or whether I should stick it out where I’m at, hoping for a solid financial future for the company which should in turn result in a better financial future for me. Or should I do what’s uncomfortable and leave my job that needs me, for a job that probably doesn’t, simply for more pay? I would leave this company without a trader, putting them in the position to have to hire a new trader that would not only have to be trained on the platforms, but learn how I’ve set up the platforms to begin with (essentially putting the ‘trading department’ on hold). I feel like I’d be burning bridges by leaving, but at the same time we need to do what’s best for ourselves as human beings, so I might be ready to take that next step too. I partially blame myself for the position I’m in as I have not done a good enough job negotiating my compensation. I’ve gotten comfortable, as my dad likes to say. Add that to a year long financial rough patch at the company and I’m not putting the blame on anyone except myself. We’re finally seeing greener pastures here and maybe getting a raise was a sign of that, but at the same time I don’t know when the next one will be.

7ej0bv,1,2017-11-21,"I am in my early 30s, and im afraid of doing anything outside of comfort zone, a job opportunity is presenting itself, and I am terrified of it.",Itseffingcold,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ej0bv/i_am_in_my_early_30s_and_im_afraid_of_doing/,"Simply put, I am terrified of any opportunities or changes that get made to my life. 

I am stuck in stagnation, and I find myself only mildly happy with my life and how things have turned out for me. Simply put; I find myself always ""okay"" with how things turn out for me.

What is prompting this; well, I have landed an internship with my own company, I actually have done this once before and was less stressed out about it a few years ago, because I didn't anticipate any expectation of commitment, it simply became an opportunity to work somewhere else and do something different for a short duration of time. By the time it was over I was excited to be coming home and going back to my old life. 

Apparently this experience, my work ethic and attention to detail was very noticed, and about a year later a new program emerged, and by the encouragement of my management team I applied again, just for fun.

The program I applied for I got passed on, simply because they were looking for someone different during the next round (seemed silly to bring the same guy back for the same thing). I was stressed by the whole interview process, but relieved after it was over thinking ""welp, I tried."" 

Fast forward a few weeks, and another department seemed to find my resume and was intrigued by it, I received a surprise email and was asked for a short interview. I figured ""why not? I get to learn something new, which is something I always enjoy."" During the interview our conversation felt natural and actually quite casual, they asked some questions about my resume and previous experience during another internship, the whole thing lasted a little under 30 minutes, and I walked away thinking nothing of it. 

A few days go by, my management team sits me down and tells me that I was selected, and I was met with immediate mixed emotions that I am having a severely difficult time decoding. Anxiety levels skyrocketed, but I kept reminding myself ""great opportunity, good resume builder, juice is worth the squeeze, etc..."" My supervisor then informed me that this program is heavily looking for people who want permanent employment, and they are wondering if that is what I am seeking, the catch is; its on the other side of the country. It would mean I would have to sell my home, move my girlfriend (whom is on board with this) and dog to the other side of the country. 

Not only is it a gigantic hill to climb, but I find myself being afraid of leaving what I am already comfortable with, I have a home I like, I have cars I enjoy (and tinker with) and a style of life/finance that I know I can afford, plus all of my friendships and family members live relatively close by. 

So, the fear came back up, I loved the idea of it being a no commitment, half of a year opportunity to learn, and if I felt comfortable or happy with the job/living situation, I could make the decision, pursue a permanent position, and if they liked me, than it would simply happen.

Simply put; I make one argument for comfort, I know my job like the back of my hand, im good at it but im in a dead end position with no real opportunity for growth or movement where I currently live, and I know I am worth more than I currently make (not that I am struggling financially, I get by find and can afford *some* luxuries) 

On the other side of the fence; opportunity always is met with some kind of risk, and I can't ever gain anything without risking something. I struggle with the idea of living on my own for half of a year, away from loved ones and I am afraid that I simply wont be able to do the work that is expected of me once I start this internship. 

Am I thinking too far ahead? Should I not be worrying about what hasn't happened yet? Is it unreasonable for me to be thinking so far into the future when I haven't even started the job? Would it be bullish of me to start the internship knowing full well that I have no intention of taking permanent employment? (as it seems like there is some expectation of interest). To top it all off, I still have thanksgiving and Christmas to be worried about before any of this happens, so I am starting to feel very overwhelmed. Maybe being overwhelmed is simply clouding my best judgement and putting my mind into a survival mode? It seems like all of my other emotions are clouding something I should be excited about.

Sorry for the long winded posting, there has been a ton on my mind, and I just cant seem to find inner peace because of all of it, its starting to feel like I spend my days simply just trying to get through it. "

Leaning towards the latter, as I think that it will provide better opportunities to grow into a prominent role and worry about parts of Bloomberg's tech stack. But, curious about industry perception/prestige, will the ""startup"" make it more difficult to get interviews as an industry hire? For context, will graduate with 3.6-7 GPA at a top school/CS program with previous internship at Google.  
  
Secondly, with regards to negotiation -- the BB offer is slightly higher (&lt;5k) in terms of 1st year compensation, but that difference grows to ~15k when ignoring signing bonus, not to mention the difference in time value of money as the start up offer has significant equity portion which doesn't begin to vest for a year. Is it a reasonable line of negotiation to state ""{insert startup name} presents an exciting opportunity where I can see myself growing for years, but I worry that compensation post-first year isn't as competitive"" and ask for increased salary or equity?

I'm an avid photographer / videographer, music producer and a mechanical engineering student. I'm currently lugging around an old [17"" ASUS ROG](https://www.amazon.com/G750JX-17-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-VERSION/dp/B00COQIKKA). It has everything that I need/want (**Drives**-1.25 TB 
**RAM**-16gb **GPU**-3gb ) it just is not portable ~ it weighs 10lbs and is just dumb big.

I'm headed to China for 4 months for an internship and will be doing a lot of traveling so I want a more portable machine that will meet all of my needs.

I would like to stick to PC because I plan on building a desktop upon my return to the states and want all of my programs and files to be seamless (mainly referring to music stuff, some of my samples and plugins I don't have Mac equivalents for). 

I've been leaning towards an older [2015 Razer Blade 14""](https://www2.razerzone.com/eu-en/gaming-systems/razer-blade-2015)

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
USA. 
$1000ish - I don't mind finding something used on /r/hardwareswap though.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life.
Accurate screen colors.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
With traveling a lot, this is a pretty big deal. I would like it to be thin but also I want it to be sturdy. Most likely will have it in a hard case/ sleeve to help keep it protected.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows, but I could probably be convinced to go Mac.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
15"" or under.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
Ableton Live 9 Suite.
Solidworks 2017.
Adobe CC - Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator.
MatLAB.

Talked with the recruiter again at my school's career fair and mentioned that I was interested in going back to the company. She said I should email her with my updated resume and she would get back to me. She has not gotten back to me.

For a little more context, I served as a data engineering Intern at a big company in Cupertino. I had to leave about 3 weeks early due to a death in the family, but overall really enjoyed my team and had an awesome time while there, and I think my team really enjoyed me as well.

I got back in contact with the recruiter after my internship at my school's career fair and talked to her about wanting to come back. She said that the company would love to have me back, so I emailed her. She asked me if I was planning on going to get my Master's degree, to which I told her no, and there has been no contact since then.

I've since received offers from other companies, but am generally unhappy about the vision of the companies as well as their compensation.

This degree, while interesting, is not something I really want to do (no med school, no research). I took a computer science course this semester, and I really enjoyed it. However, it's too late for me to 1. get a double major or 2. switch my majors (again). I'm going to ask for a 9th semester so that I can take some more computer science classes and get internships. However, after that, I'm not sure what to do. My university offers a 5th year Masters in Biotechnology, which is really enticing! I would get an Ivy League Masters in Biotech in 1 year, and if I wanted to, an extra semester for co-op. It's easier for students who are at the university to get in the Masters program than for non students applying. It also allows me to take classes that are interesting, like stem cell engineering. It sounds like a sweet deal. However, I'm unsure about job prospects and getting paid well. On the other hand, if I don't go to the 5th year Masters program, I could find a job related to tech and then get in to a Masters program in Computer science. However, I have already signed a lease to stay at my university's city for another year, because I had assumed I was going to stick with the biotechnology choice. Now, I am unsure what I should do. Should I get both? A degree in Biotechnology and then get a degree in CS?"

What about an academic career?,IWillFailCalculusAga,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7elkzu/i_will_fail_calculus_i_for_the_second_time_how/,"I like math and I would say I'm good with it, I don't have a hard time understanding mathematical concepts, but I joined a top 3 CS course in my country without knowing high school math. I had severe depression during high school and didn't studied all the ""pre-calculus"" I should had studied, I've been learning all this stuff that I should already know by now, but I don't think I'll get to integral calculus before my finals. I'm sure I would at least know all the math needed to do calculus with ease in the next semester.

I didn't fail any other of the classes I had, and my grades are mostly A's and B's, I've been even doing some good research assisting one of my professors, and that's what make me uneasy. I'm doing research on the data mining field and during this journey I met some awesome dutch people which offered to help me to get a data-mining internship in Netherlands. But well, I don't think any company would hire a sophomore intern who failed calculus two times, so I took those internships out of my list of possibilities at least for 2018. My main question is: if I failed calculus this semester and got an A on it next semester, would companies still look with some resentment to me? And assuming I graduated with a 3.3+ GPA, if I tried to get a master's in CS, would this double-fail in calculus still be a burden for me even if I got A's on Calculus I and II?"

7ely33,1,2017-11-21,"Broke up with first LTR, now stuck in small town with dissatisfying life. Feeling trapped, isolated and unsure.",Shaney96,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/7ely33/broke_up_with_first_ltr_now_stuck_in_small_town/,"**My question is:**

How does one go about finding some purpose and finding happiness in everyday life when their job is dissatisfying, opportunities are scarce, and even those opportunities you take still seem to leave you unhappy?

**My current life situation is:**

Found TRP last year, had my first every date with a girl, that turned into a year-long LTR that ended a few months back. I'm currently on an internship (year out of Uni to work) in a small town where she also resides. My job is dissatisfying and it's a very bland area of my field of study (Computer Science). I'm here until July and I don't want to quit since it's brings a great deal of experience and I'd have nowhere to go, and it helps pay the bills. Due to it being a small town, I have to make and find my own opportunities. I'm starting BJJ this Thursday, I gym 4 times a week, I'm busy every weekend, and I play football every Monday. 

The thing is, I feel fucking lost. Since this job is so demotivating, I don't feel I've got a purpose as, when studying at Uni, I was enjoying the studying and the assignments, but now I can't help but feel like all I'm doing is making the rich richer. This is due to me not being sure that I want to stay in this sector all my life and that the work is pretty mundane. You know, I was enjoying my journey of self-improvement while at Uni, but now, the opportunities seem rare.

There's 4 females in the company, 3 of them are married/with kids, and the other is a HB3/HB4 who I've gotten off with on a night out - that wasn't the best experience. Yes, I go clubbing at weekends and, for example, went out a week ago, clubbing completely sober until 4am and had this HB7.5 (who was with her boyfriend) who was saying ""it's a shame you live so far away"" and then invited me back to hers with her boyfriend. Yet I still feel dissatisfied? I don't feel like I'm progressing, even though I smashed my DL and squat PB two weeks ago and am still on a cut?

I think about my ex every day, simply because I'm deriving my sense of self from the external world and have little of interest going on in my life. It's definitely oneitis and I definitely recognize it for that, hence why I've not gone back, even thought she states how she hopes I'm doing well and shit. I've blocked her on everything but it's not helpful when I see her drive around now and again.

 I sit in front of a computer screen coding from 9-5 and feel pretty drained and lackluster when I get home. I tried ""shitting where I eat"", just to make the mistake, but that didn't happen (thankfully), and going around the town in the evening hoping to find a girl or two to cold approach is too difficult for me, and I feel setting that expectation for myself will end in misery.

Now, I've given some 'rationalizations', but I don't see them entirely as that. I can accept that some stuff is too difficult for me, but I have done some stuff recently that shows how much I want change (visited my Uni city a few weeks back on a train with a winter coat, a wallet and my phone with the intention of either getting with a girl and sleeping at hers, or sleeping on a park bench). The main problem I feel is I'd like to find some purpose. I feel I'd like to start designing and creating clothing, however I'm experiencing a shit-load of resistance here and am reading The War Of Art at the moment and trying to take baby steps to help overcome this.

&amp;nbsp;

I am 32 years old and dropped out of school my Junior year almost 11 years ago. I had family issues at home and I needed to be there. There was no excuse for not finishing, and I got a job through an internship I had and never really looked back. A few years later, I interviewed at a big bank and was offered the position. Turns out, the background checks don't care why you left school, just that you didn't finish. This happened 2 more times. I would go through an entire interview process at some of the biggest banks, be offered a job, and then it would come crashing down. And yes, I told them my situation prior, but sometimes HR and the hiring manager are on two very different pages. 
&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I was at a real low point as I have my certifications (series 7, 66, etc) and was at a great job, but I had a ceiling. I couldn't get to the 'big boys' because of that one year I left after my father passed. 
That was until I found WGU. I was skeptical, but I thought what the hell. I finished up VERY quickly as I tested out of almost everything and finished in June. I still thought the big banks would frown on a degree like this, but gave it one more shot.. I interviewed again for one of the large banks (Morgan Stanley) and again got offered the job, during the background check I was waiting daily for that call. But this time when it came, it was to tell me that everything checked out and gave me a start date. 
&amp;nbsp;

It is worth the hard work you put in. For anyone questioning it, don't think, just act. If something has been holding you back, don't let it. I FINALLY said fu*k the excuses and all of a sudden my ceiling has been broken through.
&amp;nbsp;

If anyone has any questions, feel free to PM me. As I said above, I thought some people could use that extra push from my experience that it is within your reach."

I live a half hour from Manhattan. I didn't have a solid internship experience in college, and missed an opportunity to get a job in public at the end of my senior year of college. I graduated in may 2016. In the time since then I passed REG, failed FAR and just took Audit. Waiting on results. My 18 month window to pass all 4 parts expires in August 2018. I want to work in audit in public accounting, preferably at a top 25 firm, and aspire to someday be the controller / CFO of a company. Just some background info.

Here's the problem. I've been working at a small but very profitable manufacturing company in a billing position for almost 4 months to the day. It's the only billing position at the company. Today was my breaking point. My boss is a terrible human being. I was trained for just a week by the person I replaced, very much less than the amount of time needed to be trained for this position, which I now realize in hindsight. For the past 4 months, my first 4 months at the job, my boss and her assistant have demeaned and belittled me at almost every chance they get. I am a male working with 4 catty females. They will explain an entire process to me one time, show me how to do it on their computer so fast that I can't watch and take notes fast enough , and then I don't know how to actually do it because i just watched them zip through it. Then when I ask a question about it the next time, they freak out on me because ""I was taught how to do xyz"". Today my boss swore up and down that I was taught how to do something by ""a million people a million times"", which I was never taught by the person I replaced or her or her assistant (the only 3 people that know how to do my job) and she proceeded to go into a menu of the software that I didn't even know existed. I was never taught how to do this and she went on the entire time, making faces at me like I'm some kind of idiot and huffing and puffing the whole time teaching it to me.

I'm wasting my talent here slapping bills of lading to P.O.'s to invoices and stuffing envelopes, and slowly becoming miserable in the process. I don't even dislike my job. My boss hates her job and is making me miserable though. She hasn't taught me anything significant at all. I'm afraid to ask her a question because she has never answered a question of mine without making me feel like an idiot.

What kind of next job should I look for that will set me up to successfully interview for an audit position? I was placed at my current job through RobertHalf Accountemps. I am considering going back to them and saying that the job doesn't match what I'm looking for, and try to possibly find some kind of part-time accounting work, maybe as a bookkeeper or something. Then I would have more time to study too.

All I know is that I'm not getting the accounting experience I'm looking for by getting 80 invoices together and sending them out every day. I'm considering even barbacking part time or doing something part time so I can focus on studying, but I don't really think that I'm going to finish the CPA exam and jump into public accounting with little to no true accounting experience.

I apologize for the long post. Any advice would be appreciated. I understand that I should put my foot down, but this job means nothing to me and I would rather just leave. I can't get moved to a different team or department because there is not another team or other department. My boss is not going to get fired because her and her husband are best friends with the owner. It just is not really worth it to stand up for myself, I think it'll only make things worse the next time I don't understand something I was already explained."

I started dating this girl Senior year of college. We had a project together and hit it off. We started sleeping together, and she would come over every few nights. We started seeing each other more and more, until we started dating officially. I helped her get her first apartment, she helped me get through my internship. I told her I loved her about four months in, she took a bit to return the sentiment, but she was never weird about it. I spent time with her family, she met my extended family. 

About a year after we graduated, we moved in together. It was great. We never fought. We had disagreements and differences of opinion, but we always talked through them. No one ever shouted. She was seriously amazing.

Around the half point of year two, I got a job offer in a different, large city. I knew I wanted to move, and I asked her to come with me. She said yes. The details worked themselves out very quickly, probably too quickly for her tastes. Moved about a month later.

She worked remote for her same job. She never really fit into the city, always talked about how much better she felt when whe would go back to work in the office. I loved the city. I felt more at home there than I ever did anywhere else. It was my dream.

About six months in, she told me she was thinking about moving back. I was not surprised, but I was stunned by how casually she brought it up. I had mentioned I didn't want to have a long distance relationship without a specific end date (like moving for a class or so,etching). She said she wasn't that serious about it at the time, but the more we talked about it the more serious it became.

Now the last few months had been rocky, I could feel us drifting apart. I like to think we still loved each other, but there was just something missing now. I assumed it was just her unhappiness at the current living situation.

Eventually she found an apartment and was going to move back home. I was understandably upset, and she was just totally casual about it, and I told her how upset that made me. We had long talks night after night, and she assured me it wasn't because of me, she just couldn't live here, and she couldn't ask me to give up my dream to move with her.

The next month was the worst month of my life. We knew we where about to break up, but we still lived together and spent time together. We had a good last month, went out to dinner and reminisced about our last three years. It was extremely bittersweet.

The day she left was the hardest day of my entire life. Just remembering it still makes me tear up. I walked her to the car, after a very long talk, we where both in tears, she told me she loved me and we kissed. I turned away and heard the car start up, and I couldn't bear to look back as she drove away.

This was about four months ago. I've been doing as well as can be expected. I've started dating a little bit, just getting drinks with people, having occasional sex. But I'm still hurt and lonely, definetly not anywhere near ready for another relationship. But I've been trending upwards.

Until a few weeks ago when a friend asked how I felt about this mutual friend and her dating. I hadn't heard about this since I unfollowed her. Of course curiosity killed the cat, and I went and looked. She's been seeing this mutual friend from college for about two months now. I know I have no right to be angry, but I've just felt so hurt and betrayed, I don't know how to move on. 

Obviously I know the truth is she fell out of love with me, at least enough that it wasn't worth putting up with the city she hated to be with me. But I'm still so hurt that she could be dating seriously again this soon. Every time I hear something about it from mutual friends I get this hot ball of anger inside. I can't stop going and looking to see what they're up to. I know this is a terrible idea, but its just this morbid curiosity.

How can I stop giving a shit about what she's doing, and move on with my life."

I like Rice but I don't feel sufficiently challenged in my current environment. I'm also extremely interested in finance and would definitely consider a financial engineering major.

1. What's the salary range for this position? Is it negotiable? I've already checked Glassdoor, they have several 'Application Developer' salaries listed, but they don't have anything listed specifically for a 'New Grad' position.

2. I've been told that this position won't actually start until February. Hypothetically, if they were to make me an offer and I accepted, would I still be allowed to keep job hunting in the meantime? (I've never been employed, so I'm not really sure how these things work.)

3. I understand that they use proprietary software for this position; how badly will this screw me over when it comes to switching to a SWE job elsewhere? Is switching to a SWE position within Workday possible? I don't have any prior work experience (a minor internship, and a handful of non-trivial iOS projects) and I've been unemployed since I graduated with my CS degree (the past 8 months), so I'm getting pretty desperate.

Cool. It's not a huge deal, but I didn't plan on wasting another summer retaking a class. Good news : it looks like I'll get a 4.0 and a 3.0 (or a 3.5 and a 3.0) in my other two classes. But I have a piss poor GPA, one of which I know I won't get any internships with.  I'm a economics and statistics double major and I used to love math/physics and especially calc but this class just killed my love for it and is making me second guess everything. Im worried I won't have a job when I graduate due to my low GPA or even worse I'll get below a 2.0 and get kicked out of the university. 



I wanted to major in civil engineering but my advisor and family always told me to ""pick an easier major"" ¿? if they don't even believe in me how can I believe in me? Even if I manage to get into the engineering college how the fuck will I get a job when my GPA is below a 3.0? I'm a failure and I'll end up broke and jobless. It's too late to drop the class, and if I knew I was going to fail this bad I would've never took this class. I want cry, on top of failing my class I realized my friends are gaslighting pricks so I cut them off. Now I feel terribly alone, they were all I had. I have no one to talk to, I'm failing a math class, and there's no way in hell I'll be able to get into STEM, this is the second fucking math class failed. How did I go from being the smartest person in AP calc, to failing college algebra and calc 1?!? The calc class is a weed out course, but even then it can't be that bad to explain why I'm such a failure. Other people are getting like 50s and 60s on the tests (with an average of 63) and what do I get? A 27. 


So I can change my major to something ""more easy"" and be a failure, or get into STEM and be a failure with a low GPA. 


About my friends : when I mentioned to them I don't like how they're treating me they said ""shut up and stop playing the victim card"" ""you're overreacting"" ""we just hung out with you, why would we hate you?"" 
Keep in mind the ONLY thing I asked for was to be added back to a groupchat and they refused to saying ""you did this to yourself, you deserve it"". As a joke my friends and I would kick each other out of GCs when we said something stupid but we'd be added right back, I was kicked out for a month before being added back by asking and then my friend thought it would be funny to kick me out again. Then I messaged one of them saying ""haha who kicked me out?"" and they said who and added me back, but guess what? I got kicked out again. So I left all the group chats I had with them because I was pissed. Probably bad on my part but this was after being kicked out 3/4 times so I just said ""fuck it/them""



Then my friend told my roommate ""X never falls in the groupchat"" so I messaged one of my friends saying this and they said ""lol we don't even use that groupchat""
Okay BS. When I asked to be added back he told me ""just make a new one"" ???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!???!? You obviously use the groupchat. When my friend told my roommate I don't talk in it and another friend said ""oh we don't even talk about you in the groupchat"" when I said how I don't like 3 people in our friend circle because they seem fake. Maybe I want to be a victim so bad but it seems fishy to just bring that up when I didn't say ""I think they talk about me behind my back"" I just said they seem fake...

So then I was randomly added to a different one and again asked ""hey, can you add me back?"" and they said ""no, be happy you're in this one"" and I said ""but why not? I feel like you guys don't like me, is it that hard to add me back?"" and then they told me I'm playing the victim. 


Lmao also keep in mind these are the same people who always make jokes about ""let's just leave her home"" while I'm in the car with them, or saying ""I wish you didn't come"" or calling me names (ho, slut, thot, comparing me to ugly celebrities, ect) and if I ever say I don't like it they tell me I'm overreacting and I should ""be happy we at least did x with you"""

Okay, so currently I'm doing an internship at a maritime engineering company and my assignment is to make a model to calculate the maximum loads at every single point for the pontoons they use.


Here's the problem, to calculate the maximum load on the colums in the ship I'm calculating Euler's buckling stress by using:

Fa=(𝜋^2∗𝐸 )/〖𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥〗^2 


with Smax being the maximum slenderness regarding the moment of inertia over both axis.


Yet this isn't the formule used by the example excel spreadsheet I got handed. 

The one that is used there is either this: 

𝐹𝑎=([1−(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅^2 )/(2∗〖𝐶𝑐〗^2 )]∗𝑌)/(3/5+(3(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅))/(8∗𝐶𝑐)−(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅)^3/(8∗𝐶𝑐^3 ))


for Slenderness &lt; Cc


or this: 

𝐹𝑎=(12𝜋^2∗𝐸)/(23(𝐾∗𝐿/𝑅)^2 )


for Slenderness &gt; Cc


Since I'm in my final year of a bachelor in mechanical engineering and this is part of a Masters course this is over my head . I did some digging and I get how slenderness works and how it relates to the colum constant but my question is, what is the theory behind these 2 equations and why should I use them over the standard Euler Buckling Equation?


I sincerely hope someone has the answer for me!

(edit, I tagged this post a Civil Engineering problem since I presume that's what fits best for structural problems)

It is a big company and I thought that it would be the best that I could do. However, that same night, I got contacted by company B for an interview. I was very surprised by this as I never would have thought of being offered an interview there. Company B would be a dream come true for many people, including myself, so of course I accepted the interview. Two days later, I got contacted by company C, which is at the very top. I couldn't believe it! Of course, I told the recruiter that I wanted to begin the process as well.

The only reason I haven't gotten a written letter from company A yet is some work authorization stuff that they are going over. They are not sponsoring me or anything, but they are still putting some additional effort into me by working with their immigration department. They are sort of just looking into what it would involve and will send me an offer letter once that's sorted out. According to them, it is not something that I should worry about. Also, they have expressed how they are really looking to have me there next summer.

If I happen to bomb the interviews for B and C, then it's no problem, as I am sure that I will be happy at company A. But if I get an offer with either of them, I will be in a very difficult situation. Interning at either B or C would open an immense amount of doors and make my dreams come true. However, I do not want to be unprofessional by rejecting A after all the effort that they have put into me.

I asked one of my professors if it was okay for me to do this, as I am still going through the background check of company A and have not been given a written offer yet. He said to stick to A but still interview with B and C to at least get the interviewing experience and get my resume in their records for the future. Is this good advice? Or should I accept either B or C if given an offer? How would I break the news to A then? Also, if I am still interviewing with B or C by the time that A gives me a written offer, what should I tell them?

7epsv1,12,2017-11-22,On Being a Crime Scene Investigator: Part I,life-finds-a-way,forensics,https://www.reddit.com/r/forensics/comments/7epsv1/on_being_a_crime_scene_investigator_part_i/,"#What Background Do I Need?

* Education: BS in a Science (Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry)
* Experience: Preferred (Internship, Ride-Along(s), Workshops, Training Courses)

#Why Do You Require That?

Education is (at best a threefold) answer:

* There was sort of a Forensic Science degree bubble in the past. Many of the degrees failed to include a sufficient amount of science course hours. 

* Majors like Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, etc. are fairly uniform. Employers know what they're getting in an applicant. They can also interview and hire an applicant with confidence that they have taken the right courses. 

* While there haven't been any recent major breakthroughs in crime scene investigation techniques, advances in the field (and science in general) have shaped the way we respond to and process scenes. Those with full science degrees are more inclined to be critical thinkers and can adapt to change. Crime Scene Investigators are the first people to come in contact with evidence, and they should be at a place where they are aware of the change around them and the possibilities available to them and to analysts. 

Experience is a bit more simple or complex, depending:

* It's always easier when you have new people who have done the job before. There are aspects and elements of the job that can't be taught (dealing with death and dying, being around dead and decomposing bodies, compartmentalizing) and it helps an employer when they know how you'll do if you have been exposed to those situations before and want more.

* Relevant experience shows your interest in and your passion for the field. You're not untrustworthy if your only experience is in a lab environment, you're just untested. That's a big enough gamble with nothing to go on in your favor.

#What is a Typical Day for a CSI?

Work is anything but typical. If you have time, you finish out any tasks hanging over from the previous work day/night before going out to new scenes. The job description tasks happen while you're investigating. There is a considerable amount of paperwork involved that nobody tells you about.

###Here's an example of what one night might be like:

* Write report from a scene the previous night (two houses got shot up, evidence and projectile defects everywhere)
* Enter the evidence collected into the RMS system (15 cartridge casings, 5 projectiles)
* Package, label, and seal each item of evidence collected 
* Prepare items (above) for the crime lab
* Prepare items collected on previous scenes for lab analysis
* Send items received from the crime lab to the evidence/property storage facility
* Send items collected on scenes to the evidence/property storage facility (no lab analysis possible/required)
* Respond to emails from detectives about previous cases
* Respond to lab analysts' emails about evidence items submitted
* Wait to respond to calls or scenes

All bullet points except for #3 and #10 involve a report or a form that must be printed out and included in the case file. Then the activities you've taken must be written and accounted for in the case file. Evidence forms that accompany all items might be written on with actions taken. That might be signed. **Nobody ever mentions the amount of paperwork.**

###Let's take a step back and go over a two day period:

* You have a homicide. Outdoor scene, body has been transported prior to your arrival. With an extra set of hands, you clear the scene after 6 hours and make it to the end of your shift.
   * You get back to the office, offload your evidence onto your evidence table, seal what you can for the morning, label things so there's no confusion or the need to open a bag, start a rough evidence log, upload your photos, and go home. 

* You walk into work the next day. You have someone taking calls for you so you can get caught up for the day. But they're not there. Why? Your coworker has had a homicide and your relief person is with another coworker at secondary scenes. Your coworker with a homicide is the only one at the office and there's an aggravated assault call that has just come in.

* Luckily things get worked out and you can work your part. You write your report, create an official evidence log, create a measurement log, enter your evidence into the RMS, prepare what needs to be prepared for lab analysis, and send other items to the evidence/property storage facility.

   * You're now at a point where you can work on everything that has been holding since before your homicide. And you can now help out and take calls for your coworker, as they also need a day to get everything together. 

#What is it Like Working a Scene?

It's tedious, time-consuming, dirty, scary, thrilling, puzzling, painful, dehydrating, scary, fun, really cool. There's little to no thanks for it sometimes. There's high praise for it in others. Conditions can turn on a dime. Things were under control, but now something's happened and you have to make a decision two seconds ago.

Here's an example of what a scene might be like:

* House has been burglarized. There is damage to the front door where the unknown subject(s) kicked it in. All the Christmas presents have been taken from the residence. The victim saved up for months to give their children a nice Christmas. You process for shoeprints and latent fingerprints, but come up with nothing. The mom's been following you around the whole time and is waiting for good news.

* House has been shot up. Cartridge casings in the street, several defects in the front window and throughout the residence. A few projectiles and fragments dispersed throughout. It's a bit windy. Some of your evidence markers are even moving around! You collect the evidence pretty quickly (this isn't even your first or your fifth rodeo) and have to take measurements of the defects. You're almost done when you hear on the radio that there is a gunshot disturbance somewhere else in the area and there is a similar scene waiting for you. Nobody knows if it's related, but why would you have your coworker go all the way out to respond? What's another residence and another hour and a half?

* Apartment has been burglarized. It's ridiculously hot. Seriously, do they have the heater on full blast? It's summer. You process the living room and a few bedrooms. Sweat is dripping into your eyes and your glasses are getting dirtier by the minute, as the powder you're using is forming a paste with the sweat on your glasses. You're just about done processing. Just one more thing. Oops! The camera around your neck swung around and knocked over your black powder container. There is a mound of powder on the victim's rug. Good luck corralling it before people notice. And good luck bringing it up to the victim!

* You're out on essentially a nothing scene. There has been a hit and run crash. No vehicles, victim, or much of anything. There's a pool of blood and maybe a small screw. You take your photographs, collect the few items there and are about to clear the scene. But then you're jolted by squealing tires and a large, loud boom in the distance. A vehicle has somehow fallen off a highway overpass and has struck a tree in a grassy embankment. There's a cloud of dirt and debris rising up and everyone's rushing over to the scene. You're probably not needed, but since you're already at Traffic's disposal, you're photographing and going into the city to photograph the victim at the hospital."

And on the end of the school no one was telling me if it was good or no, they just said me in september, we need really important paper and if we don't get it the school will not be paid, after almost one year of battle they told me this and at this time i almost already dropped school cause i was supposed to find an internship but any company answer me or was interested with me, all the pressure from the school keep telling me i won't be able to come next week if i don't pay was too hard and i was having some family problem...

And now i'm doing nothing, no school or work and my familly problem goes worst and the general ambiance is so painfull, my stepmother keep saying thing like i'm a dumbass, someone who can't do anything, saying also that young people wont live old cause they're too lazy to do anything, she's looking the smallest thing to always fight with me and i can't keep it anymore i'm at a point where i want to hit something and myself to throw away my anger and want to just go away and leave everything...

I also hate myself, i find me ugly, stupid, useless, and having those word everyday is the worst thing, i wanted to try to start ""like myself"" to stop being an asshole with myself but i can't just, with this i can't...
I talked to my best fried today of my problem and i don't know if she's right or no, i'm a total looser who can't really do anything but she tell that if i don't face my step-mother for all the thing she can say i can't complain then, i have to act, and she's telling me that i'm just good to complain and don't know what to think if she try to make myself react or no...

And today is another day where i don't know what to do, i'm lost, start wanting to cry or i don't usually cry, i'm only talking to one person, my best friend, i don't go out, i don't know if i want to find another school in anything else, or i want to work, cause always when i'm saying that i will work instead of doing nothing my parents are saying me that it's stupid, find a school you will see how this hard and you'll want to stop but now i'm doing nothing just being at home and feel bad at home, i'm afraid to wake up, to do anything because i'm afraid if this will start another quarrel for anything, at least i have an appointment for my orientation next wednesday, but they're telling me that will be useless if i don't know what to do...

Hope this is not too shitty and hard to read, don't know if this post is okay since i'm pretty new on reddit..."

So before I start, I would like to give some background information about me. I'm currently 24 years old this year, and I'm studying a private degree in Information System &amp; Computing in the first year. I come from Singapore, so we basically have to serve mandatory National Service for 2 years.

So after National Service, I worked for 2 years as a Software Engineer at multiple startups until this September where I quit to start studying for a degree. The thing is that, I never really cared for a degree. The only reason I wanted it is that it served as a back up plan for any mishaps, and it opens a ton of doors such as moving out of the country, or even as a sense of recognition of discipline (That's what I think?)

So, I have always wanted to be a 'Startup' guy, hence the reason why I have only been working in Startups. I would love to work in Google or Facebook though, but that's a dream. (I'm applying for a Data Engineer internship in Facebook!) 

So anyway, 2 weeks after I start school on September, I got a recommendation for a Frontend Developer job at a Startup. Well, at this time, I pretty much blew all my savings on the hefty school fees, and a new maxed-out Macbook Pro. (Note that I'm not a big spender, but I respect Technology and I believe that a Chef should always buy the sharpest knife. You get what I mean?). So, I went for the interview without expectation, as who would want to hire a full-time student anyway? But apparently, the CEO and the development teams seems to like me. They offered me a slightly better pay than my previous job (I can't complain here as I'm studying full-time).  

I took the job totally believing I can handle both the full-time job and study. It has been almost two months now, and I believe I have been managing it decently, but not perfectly. But the problem with me is that I'm an unrealistic optimistic person. 

As I took up the full-time job, I joined the DragonBoat Club as well. Boy, they have a really tough commitment schedule, literally Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Some weeks even 5-6 days, one training session can take up till 3-5 hours.

I have recently dropped the Club because I just wanted to give it a try, and it was taking a toll on me. So now, I have always wanted to build my own Startup since I was a teenager. For the past few weeks, I have been spending some time (even neglecting some school work or work), to work on my own Startup idea. Since I'm only one man, I'm doing everything, from the research, to the design, to the development. 

I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and run my own business, (and move to New York :D). I would like to drop my full-time job, and focus on School and my Startup idea instead. The risk is that I will lose my income, and I don't really have much in the bank left anymore. My family members are very independent so we don't really ask for financial help from each other, nor have I took any parents from my parents since I can last remember.

Do you guys think that I should quit? I'm really hesitating due to my financial state, and I have to get ready another 10-12k by next September for year 2's school fees.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I signed on with the company I interned with because it was the best financial decision for me given other local offers, but I've since realized that

* I don't want to live in milwaukee, or the midwest. I'd really like to live as close as possible to the pacific north west, or the rockies. Denver / Seattle etc..
* I want to at least try out other popular tech in a professional environment. I have plenty of project experience with Rails, Java, Python (data science and django) and unix, but no verifiable professional experience.
learning and using other technologies is important to being a well rounded engineer and truly being able to discern the right solution for any given problem.
* money maximization is not a justifiable reason to sacrifice having new experiences.
* I'd really like to end up working at a non-profit or something at least environmentally focused.

The problem I'm facing is that it seems like most open job positions listed on indeed, or even peeking through the monthly hacker news ""who's hiring"" posts ask for at least a few years with tech I have no professional background in but would love to (Java, Python, PHP, Rails). How do I even get through the mass resume scan process if my background in rails is a year long school project and a github project I slapped together in an afternoon?
Should I try to start smaller first by finding something closer to me to build resume years of experience numbers, or would it be better to get into a different location with a .NET job until I can network and find something closer to what I'm looking for?

My biggest fear is getting pigeonholed to the point where I can't achieve one or any of my bullet-ed goals or experiences I'd like to have above.

Any and all advice appreciated."

I'm in an interesting scenario at the workplace where I was thrust into the head of IT for my office simply due to the fact that I knew the most about computers after our previous guy left.  My primary position is actually something else in a completely different realm of the office, and it's something that can be time consuming, especially if something goes wrong...just like IT, so god forbid something goes wrong on both ends.  I have no team and have a very remedial knowledge of the career.  I do enjoy learning about everything and problem solving though.

With that being said, I'm considering approaching my boss about an IT intern, or two during our high season.  If approved, I'd honestly probably hand them the reigns of the operation and oversee where and when I can (it'll be daily, not like check in every couple weeks).  The hesitation from our end is that we're very budget driven and a sales heavy operation, so we bring in interns with an ""everyone can sell"" mentality.  I'm not sure how that'll be taken.

I guess I'm just curious if you guys think this is a reasonable idea, and looking for feedback on IT internships, if anyone has done one or has run an IT intern program or anything like that?  Or is it a terrible idea and unfair to put that on a college kid's shoulders?  

*It's worth noting that we do have a partnership with an IT company that we outsource to, but they're a reasonable distance away and getting them here for hands on help is difficult sometimes."

I'm in my 4th year of engineering about to finish my 4B this Winter, but I've been having second thoughts. I've never really enjoyed engineering but stuck through it because it looked stable to me, hoping I'd eventually find a job or industry that I liked. Now that it's coming to an end, I'm still unhappy with engineering and I've started to worry. I've been looking into a different area of study over the past several months and became really interested, so I'd like to take a break and delay my 4B by doing a non-degree term to try different courses while I attempt to apply for student internships. My main concern was being ineligible for student internships after I finish my 4B, which is why I'm making the choice to delay my graduation.

I'd still like to finish my engineering degree however since I'm only 4 months away from it. Also, my 4th year design proj is still in progress so I'd like to finish it this Winter instead of next year by myself or with new people.


My question is for anyone that has done non-degree terms before or know people that have done them. I understand non-degree terms are usually for people that failed a term or people that want to transfer to a different dept. Is it possible to do them when you don't have much of an intent to transfer? Also, can I continue my 4th yr design proj while doing a non-degree term?


Academic advisors would obviously know best and I have already emailed a few, but I'm still waiting for a reply, and I would like to hear about anyone's experience with this while I patiently roll in anxiety.


Thanks!"
7esmmj,1,2017-11-22,Thoughts on difficult decision,nasacsthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7esmmj/thoughts_on_difficult_decision/,"Hey all,

I'm currently a junior and go to a mid-tier state school and have recently been offered a pathways internship position with NASA.

I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with this program but completion of it (~640 hours of work) guarantees you a full-time position with NASA after you graduate.

The issue is that they're wanting me to start in January, and in order to meet the pathways requirements I would have to take that semester off to work, go back to school the next semester, and so on and so forth until I graduate. Doing so would push my graduation date back by at least another year.

In addition to that, I interned at a fairly large company in the Bay Area last summer and they have since given me a return offer to go back (pays ~15 dollars more hourly than NASA). 

I'm also currently working as an intern with a large defense contractor, while taking classes, and will be finishing up with them in May before I would start at the Bay area internship. 

If I were to take this pathways position I would have to burn a bridge with the defense contractor (promised two semesters of work), which I feel like would be a very bad idea. Also, the Bay area company wants a response back in ten days (just received both offers yesterday).

It's always been my dream to work in space systems and it's weird because despite always dreaming of an opportunity like this, now that it's here I'm feeling like this isn't the right move for me at this time. My parents are also against me deviating from my graduation track and it just feels like there's more incentive to decline rather than accept.

I realize how incredibly competitive these positions are and I'm just worried that I'll be missing my only opportunity to work with NASA if I decline this.

But on the other hand, I feel like if I accept this position then I'm really putting all of my eggs into one basket and am sacrificing a lot for the opportunity.

Ultimately, I'll be making the final decision about this but I really just wanted to receive some input from you guys.

Thanks in advance."

Both are 10 weeks in NYC, pay roughly the same amount, and provide a nice housing stipend. In BofA, I would be on a primarily mid-office / front-office team, while for CS I would be on a team that does ""pricing calculations"" and would potentially be working on a machine learning project. Other than that information, I don't know much about either internship.

Does anybody have any advice on which one I should take? I'm really at an impasse here. My number one goal is to get a new grad offer from a prestigious tech company, and I already have a nice internship with FireEye under my belt. Given this, which opportunity would set me up better for the future?

What has made a difference is not so much as the nature of the work, but my manager who cares deeply about each of her employee's mental health status, takes time to do individual weekly check-in meetings to discuss the weekly workflow and/or workplace or personal burdens, always has food/snacks/candy in her desk to share. 

She has no issues with me having ADHD and does her best to facilitate an environment where I can do my work in a way that suits my learning/working style. Most importantly, she reminds me to BE KIND to myself and take snack breaks, walk breaks, listen to music at work as I need &amp; never hesitate to ask for help.

This post is sounding like a manager-appreciation post Lol, but for the first time in my life I can work with my ADHD-self to develop organizational skills and efficiency and I am not ashamed of my short-comings, rather can work with my employer to develop practical strategies to overcome them.

After deciding that graduate school was not the path I wanted to take, I am looking at picking up a CS degree.

I am currently taking four classes at my local CC to see if I like programming.  I am doing great and I really enjoy the coursework.    Next semester I'm taking four more.

I plan on applying to the OSU program for the Summer term of 2018.  I'll have finished programming I and II which will have given me a solid understanding of Java, as well as a few web courses in HTML, CSS and Javascript, assembly language, databases and a systems design and UNIX class.

Is it possible to transfer credits to this program?

I would ideally like to do the program in one year.  I work a part time job that pays decent and is flexible with my hours so I could dedicate a lot of time to this.  

Or, those in the program, would you recommend the two year track so that I would have time to grab an internship?

Thank you all and have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!"

Last summer I interned at a utility company as a C# developer. I actually enjoyed it a fair amount - kind coworkers and boss, decent tech stack (I've found myself really enjoying Angular, Typescript, Entity Framework, LINQ, etc.), relaxed atmosphere, good work-life balance.

They recently gave me a return offer and I'm still conflicted on accepting it. The pay is a little low (but it is a LCOL area) and developers will always be very low on the food chain there. It would be great if I could start my career at a software shop instead. I haven't had any luck landing a job at a big tech company as I'm from a tiny college and don't have stunning side projects.

Anyway, I will be graduating this spring with 3 internships and some decent school projects, so I shouldn't have too much trouble getting another job I'd think. What would you do in my position? I could either accept, try to negotiate pay, accept and renege later if I got something better, or decline...and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to figure this out."

I realize there are a lot of student posts on these forums, but I really need advice. 

First, a little backstory: I am a junior chemical engineering major with a minor in material science. A computer memory manufacturing company visited my school about a month ago for a job fair and I was interviewed for a MDE process engineering intern position. Much to my surprise I was selected for the position; my goal from the start of my degree was to work in something materials science related while still having a process-engineering feel to it and I have a real interest in semiconductor manufacturing. This is basically the best internship I could have asked for.

The only problem is that I have absolutely no idea what to prepare for. The job listing on the application I filled out was very generic and I didn't get any good pointers on what software or manufacturing techniques to look up from that. I asked my HR contact to send me topics or literature to study in preparation for this job and while he did reply my email, he didn't give me anything helpful to look up. 

Are there any MDE process engineers out there who can give me some sort of a basis for what I should be preparing for? I really would like to work for this company long term and there's nothing worse than being the only idiot on shift who doesn't know what's going on."
7eu9hb,1,2017-11-22,Should I take the offer or hold out?,spoopypoop69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7eu9hb/should_i_take_the_offer_or_hold_out/,"Hello CSCQ,

I go to a top 10 university with a top 25 CS department. I'm in my junior year as an undergrad CS major/Finance minor. I've been undergoing the recruiting process and have been apply/searching for internships since August. I've been fortunate enough to get responses to my applications and have completed several hackerranks and interviews (on-campus recruiting has helped immensely). 

I've been  granted interviews with a few big name companies, but I keep getting rejections in the end. Some of them were even expedited to final round because of OCR and I still haven’t been closing the deal. I'm not completely sure why because I can explain my resume/projects well and complete technical questions easily while explaining my thought process. A company even put me in limbo until they know how many people accept their first round of offers (essentially I'm the second choice/backup option).

Approximately 2.5 months after interviewing on campus, I have finally received a single offer from a Fortune 15 company (2 letter name) for their technology leadership internship program. The offer is for a division I’m not super interested in but the company probably has a lot of things going on, so I would hopefully find a few teams doing something I like (though from what I’ve read on this sub, there might be a possibility I might not be doing dev work). The offer is fairly average ($30/hr, 1.5x for OT, $150/week housing stipend), but in a less than ideal location in the Midwest (WI). At least the COL is low, so I would be likely be living pretty comfortably though the housing stipend isn’t great. The offer was given a deadline of 2 weeks and requires a minimum GPA of 3.00 + passing a drug test (30 days before internship = sober spring semester).  I’m pretty close to the GPA cutoff tbh and I’m have to get through this semester without dipping below.  If I were to get an offer for full time, it would likely be for a rotational program the company offers, which is something I am not entirely interested in because I might not be doing Software Engineering. I would likely be hunting for full-time roles next year targeting mid-size/growing startups in the bay area.

I’m very conflicted in taking this offer. I’m currently in the early stages of the interview process with the premier internship program at a three letter, older tech company and the rainforest company. The three letter company said it takes 6-8 weeks from first phone interview (scheduled for after thanksgiving) and the first rainforest OA was just recently sent to me (I’m guessing &gt;2 weeks from OA to offer).

It feels like I’m in a bird in the hand situation. I feel very conflicted between accepting the only offer I have after a few months or continuing to interview at more companies (the two above + startups in the Spring). I really want to be in a major city on either coast after graduation. Having this company on my resume would likely be a good move in terms of career development (Strong name recognition, probably means more than a no-name startup), so should I just suck it up for a summer and take it or should I pursue other opportunities? It’s kind of demoralizing when my classmates/friends are finishing up recruiting and getting offers from the Big 4 + some companies I interviewed with on-campus for Bay Area/Seattle/DC/NYC, but I'm fortunate enough to have something I guess. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone!"

Finance or economics, with interest in some sort of computer science/engineering program.

**Academics:**

GPA UW 3.6, GPA W 4.2, ACT 35 (36E, 36M, 33R, 35S, 10Essay), SAT 1510 (730RW, 780M). 800 on the SAT ML2 exam, 720 on the SAT USH exam. National AP Scholar with nine APs taken so far. My school does not rank.

**Senior Year Courses:**

AP English Lit, Solid State Electronics Dual Credit, Ind. Study Thesis Class, AP Calculus BC, AP U.S. Government, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry, AP Physics E&amp;M, Ind. Study Computer Science.

**EC’s:**

* Run my own donation-based [walking tour agency in Dallas.](https://dalwalk.com) I am the sole person involved with it and thus have created everything for it, from flyers/videos/other promotional material to an active blog.

* Founder/president of the first entrepreneurship club at my school.

* Co-president/competition lead of school's Junior World Affairs Council - sort of a social studies program that culminates in a national trivia competition.

* Presentation lead at school's robotics team. As the team advanced to state competitions, I would create websites and PowerPoints and coach a dedicated group of presenters. The judges, even at state, would often describe the sites as some of the best they had ever seen.

* Dedicated musician with an [acoustic solo project](http://nazaruk.bandcamp.com) and a [garage rock band.](http://instagram.com/theboojisband) I play guitar, bass, and piano, and I sing/write most of the lyrics for the band as well. I have become acquainted with several musicians, promoters, and producers in the Dallas scene, and my band is set to record and release a full-length LP next year.

* Summer internship with Ambit Energy. I applied to a rigorous internship program offered by the City of Dallas and had to go through several interviews and offers before eventually picking an IT position there. I self-taught myself SQL, a language I had no prior experience in, in a week and even earned a novice certification in it. From June to August this year, I used it to help an experienced DBA team migrate data to updated servers.

* Work at my parents' small lighting/retailing business. My work is unpaid, but I have gained enough experience from performing financial tasks for my mother (who was once an auditor at Ernst &amp; Young) to develop a relatively solid base in finance and microeconomics.

* Editor and regular contributor at school's newspaper.

* Regular volunteer at various cultural initiatives/establishments in my city, from art museums to independent K-12 teaching programs. I'm also active with the entrepreneurial culture of Dallas, having participated in several business meetups and ""hackathons"" in the city.

* Quite active with sports: been into boxing and muay thai since the age of 9, as well as dirt-biking since 8 or so. I also took up weightlifting just recently and hope to pursue it in college in addition to tennis.

**Essays:**

* Common App: 9/10. I wrote this essay about a relative who was poisoned by the Russian Mafia after attempting to start a fair banking system in Armenia, yet somehow survived with substantial damage to his condition. I talked about how realizing his condition made me understand that justice does not come as a definite equal but rather varies by individual. In retrospect, it's a very well written, intelligent essay, but I could have made it flow just a tad more.

* Supplement 1: 10/10. My personal favorite, this one had a powerful hook and a snarky yet clever discussion of the ""contradictions"" that make up my life. I submitted it to several of my top choices.

* Supplement 2: 8/10. Just a recount of the funny story of how my band came to be. I submitted this one as part of several ""activity""-related prompts.

**Recommendations:**

* 10/10 English teacher

* 8-9/10 Pre-AP/AP computer science teacher

* 10/10 Boss at summer internship

* 8-9/10 Counselor

**Extra info:**

I am particularly looking at schools in the Boston area and in the West Coast, for I feel that those two regions are the best for entrepreneurship and development in the country. I've moved around my whole life, so I wouldn't be too comfortable staying in Texas; even after college and grad school, I'd like to move somewhere totally different for a fresh start. Essentially, I'm looking for the university that would give me the freedom to experiment with a wealth of resources (most typically in the form of a powerful liberal arts education) and thus develop the ""world entrepreneur"" in me."

Not sure if it matters, but I go to a good school in the DC area(location is part of the reason why I'm interested), overall get very good grades, do related extracurriculars such as robotics, and know Python.

This is my backstory concerning an issue I’m having- I’ve had a very regular 25 day menstrual cycle (ovulating between days 11-13) since I started menstruating at age 12. The only times I’ve deviated from this pattern was when I was anorexic from ages 15-18 (I didn’t menstruate at all, I lost it when I was eating &lt;800 calories/day on a vegan diet, my weight eventually went down to 90 lbs. I recovered from AN and my periods returned normally when my BMI got up to 23).  That was 10 years ago and my periods have been normal since then...until this summer. 

This past summer, I decided to clean up my eating and cut down on junk by going on a 1500 calorie diet and increasing my running habit. I lost 20 lbs in three months along but I also lost my my sex drive, and period. In august I went to a gyno who (without knowing my past medical/eating disorder hx) told me my ovaries had some follicles on the peripheral edges and I most likely had PCOS. I panicked and revved up my exercise even more. Then she suggested a blood test which revealed that I don’t have pcos. Unfortunately, I lost my health insurance because i got into a dietetic internship which means I can’t work, and I can’t even afford Medicaid. 

I started to read up on hypothalamic amenorrhea and it sounded like what I had. Over the past month I’ve increased my calories dramatically, cut down on running (increased weight lifting though as to gain some muscle as I gain fat), and this month I’ve had signs that I ovulated this month, breast tenderness, and I actually have a sex drive again! But I still haven’t gotten my period back and I can’t shake the fact that maybe I actually have pcos. 

I’m now probably around the same weight that I was last year before I lost the 20 lbs and I’ve gained it all back in the past month or so in an effort to get my period back. I feel so disgusting in my skin because I’ve been bingeing and eating 3500+ calories/day some days just in an attempt to get my period back, but since that’s clearly not working...

How should I get back on track with not bingeing and trying to slowly lose this weight? I’m thinking maybe 1500 cal/day is too low but I’m not sure.  Anyone else deal with a similar issue? "

The plan was to stay two weeks, traveling from London to Liverpool, then to York and Edinburgh. 

I don't exactly know why but I kind of feel like going home already. Maybe solo travel just isn't for me because I've always loved being home and having my own space (pretty introverted but don't have trouble meeting people if I want to). I really loved meeting all those new people so far, but I kind of miss my friends with which I have a real deep connection with and I also feel very aimless I guess... I just can't really think of much that I want to do here anymore since I already did so much sightseeing and went a little overboard on the drinking/partying. 

I could actually get a flight home for just around 30 Euro and haven't booked my stays in advance so money wouldn't be the problem, I spent way too much already anyways. 

The thing is that I dont know what I should tell my friends/family/coworkers about leaving early. I feel like it's going to seem as if I failed and had the worst time no matter how I tell them.

Google EngRes seems like it would be a better long-term investment. It seems like it would be easier to change companies with the Google name.

Compensation-wise, Bloomberg pays substantially more, and it's all in cash (no stock / golden handcuffs, which I like). Google Engineering Residency is practically the same as intern pay. Google EngRes has a near 100% full-time conversion rate after 1 year. I have a feeling my compensation is going to be lower than the average new grad after conversion though, since I'll have no leverage whatsoever.

Google seems to be the better company overall in terms of engineering quality and work-life balance, but I can't help shake the feeling that I'd be undervalued at Google, but maybe I'm just being silly. I applied for the EngRes program directly, but in retrospect wish I had applied for regular new grad since I think I would have had a good shot at it.

I hear bad stories with legacy code in Bloomberg, but I think I could manage to land a team that uses modern tech. Most teams I've talked to sound like they're on the cutting edge. I think the work generally sounds super interesting, being at the intersection of tech/finance/law.

Both locations would be in NYC.

Any advice would be appreciated!"
7evvhc,38,2017-11-22,DISCUSSION: Cyborg in Justice League (and more?),alsott,DC_Cinematic,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/7evvhc/discussion_cyborg_in_justice_league_and_more/,"Ray Fisher's Cyborg impressed me in Justice League and he was a character I was most worried about. He's not Teen Titans Cyborg necessarily, but I think Fisher spun a bit of poetic stageplay in his characterization--a bit of a mix of Frankenstein and Elephant Man-- and committed to it very well. The character himself impressed me how well he can stand on his own knowledge-wise even next to geniuses like Batman and the wisdom of Wonder Woman.

I think, oddly this movie has achieved what the comics do not in making Cyborg seem like an actual member of the team instead of an intern.

Though I do know that some may not feel that way as I have heard from others he was the weakest part. Regardless though, I would hope we see Fisher again as Cyborg at some time in the future.

Assuming a Cyborg solo is out of the picture as well as JL sequels, for the time being, any thoughts as to any possibilities we'll see him again?

- was abused by my mom who had a form of narcissism where she would pretend her kids were disabled or abusive to get attention for herself
- was also bullied
- was rescued by CPS and lived with my dad and my brother who fought with each other. My dad was verbally and emotionally abusive. My brother was too, sometimes physical.
- my brother moved out. Now my one sister has ocd and can't be near anything that triggers her, which includes her family.
- my other sister is showing traits of narcissism and everyone can see it and she takes it out on me
- I have depression, OCD, anxiety, and along with my OCD I'm very paranoid, and very introverted 
- I have no financial support other than my dad so I don't know how I'll move away
- sister who is narcissistic bought house that I was abused in. Put all of my stuff into storage. Lost it all. She doesn't know where any of my art or even legal documents are.
- she invited my dad and I over to decorate her house for thanksgiving. In recent events my sister had ruined them and bullied me along with others. I actually took a multi hour bus ride home just to get away from her abusive behavior. 
- I told my dad I don't want to go. My dad says he doesn't want tot all about thanksgiving anymore and says I have a ""fulfilled prophecy complex"" where I expect things to happen so they do. I just know shit is going to happen because it happens. Every. Fucking. Time. He says he wants the family to get together. She didn't even invite our brother. It's all or nothing for him but it wasn't even all in the first place.
- the holidays make me want to kill myself. I hate Christmas. I hate thanksgiving. Everyone's so happy and blissfully ignorant, and while even though I know others have it worse, I just want to hang myself. I'll get really intense visions of me hanging on a noose, or me bleeding out in a bathtub. It's all I think about. My dad knows I'm depressed. Calls me ""negative"" and ""over dramatic"" and ""hyper sensitive."" I want to die so badly. I want to die. I don't focus ONLY on the negatives, I'm just honest. He just pretends there are no negatives. And he seems to forget I'm depressed, he even pays for me to go to therapy.

Some more problems:
- my uncle recently threw me under the bus when I asked him for help. He told me he'd convince my dad to get me a car so I could escape the house whenever my dad would get a abusive. Accidentally texts me saying that I'm being a brat, saying that my dad is right, and although I'm being annoying I need a car. I told him to fuck off and that I didn't want the car anymore. My uncle got mad and said he did it for me, when I now know he was protecting himself. All he did was enable my dad, and make me look worse. And my dad found out and still thinks genuinely about what my uncle said, who knows, maybe he meant it.

- my friends in college have already moved away, found apartments, found internships, and I know we are only freshmen, but I'm so behind. I'm so behind and no one knows that I cut myself. What and I going to do? Have my dad walk me into the hospital? Call CPS when I'm legally an adult? Move out when I am going to school full time? What am I going to do? What am I going to do?

I'm so fucked. I'm so so fucked. I don't want to die. I'm just extremely fucked right now. I'm so sincerely, genuinely, fucked. I want to tell the world. I want to help others going through this, but as long as I am financially dependent on my dad, I must be silent, and it's killing me."

We have lived together for 2 years and he is currently paying the rent.

I take full responsibility for what has happened. I saw the warning signs and didn't act. I thought that I was being superficial, or afraid of trying something different. My boyfriend is not a bad person. Of the two of us, I believe that I should shoulder more of the blame for our current situation because I am more experienced and am the one that is unhappy. I have been unhappy for over a year. At first I thought it was just a phase, but I don't think so. 

We met at the beginning of our graduate program but I believe that we are different people and want different things. Plus, I am indifferent to spending time with him. He was my best friend during the program and I wish we had just stayed friends. I wanted to try dating a different kind of man. I wanted to date the guy that I could talk to freely, that didn't reek of male arrogance- a nice guy. We get along fine, but I have never had more than warm affection for him. I thought it would change, that I would learn to appreciate how good he was to me. He honestly just wants to make me happy. 

Our families still help us out with finances since we are still in school, but he has taken on more personal responsibility since he has been hired by his internship. It has been a year and I have told him that I am uncomfortable with him spending his personal money paying his part of the bills because when I wanted to break up with him he said, ""I have delayed finishing school so I can work so you don't have to, it is unfair of you to break up with me now."" As soon as he told me this, I made it up in my mind that I was leaving him. I don't need him to pay bills, I have savings and family to help me. It's MY apartment (I never put his name on the lease). He insisted on moving in together (I was hesitant and never gave him an answer-his leave ran out and he just moved in) I realize that this is more of him being insecure, but I refuse to stay in a relationship with him. 

I just need advice on how I can break up with him without feeling like I have taken advantage? Should I save up money and give him a lump sum when my lease is up and I need to move in 4 months? I just know that he's expecting me to move to another place with him and I am sick at the thought. I don't have any real reason to leave him other than I just don't feel much for him other than warm affection (and more recently mild disgust). I don't want to lead him on but whenever I try to tell him how I feel, he becomes extremely upset so I apologize, then he tells me that I am wrong for toying with his emotions?! I really do feel bad, I don't want to hurt him but I can't keep living like this.

7ex54f,0,2017-11-22,How do I get a job?,Howzer_663,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ex54f/how_do_i_get_a_job/,"I have been unemployed for 1 year and I can seem to find a job either because I don't have a Bachelors or 20 years of experience in the field. This is something that really frustrates me because I tech is my passion, and I know there a lot I need to learn from hands on experience.


To put things is prospective let me add some context.

#)I graduated with a 2 year diploma from an institution outside of the United States.
#)I am currently seeking employment in the United States.
#)I have a 3 month internship at new organization working with their in house applications as well as their Android and iOS applications.


My skill set:
#) I can developer asp.net applications
#) I am very proficient in Java (I am currently developing my own android applications).
#) I have studies Systems Analysis
#) I am also good with database design and implementation using SQL (I am good with CoreData but I have not had much experience with it.)


My problem is that I can't even seem to get a low paying job just to get experience under my belt, and internships are mainly for students who are currently enrolled which I am not due to financial reasons. Basically what it comes down to for me is I need a job to get experience, I need the experience to get the job.

I am open to any advice or suggestions."

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me  a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits.
-Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget.
-Body odor which no matter what i do still remains.
-i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this.
-i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting.
-i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes.
-i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with.
-a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

However, I'm still wondering why some University's programs are better than others. Is it that they teach better content or they teach the content better?

We met 10 years ago when he was in high school and I was doing an internship at this school. I used to think that he and his twin were cute but they were like 17 and I was 22. 

He added me on fb after they graduated and  I moved to another city for grad school and was living with my then boyfriend (we were together for 9 years). We would occasionally talk but we were never friends. 

On oct´14 my ex and I had a very nasty breakup and I moved back to my hometown. I was a mess and I hated all men. About 5 months later this guy (Lets call him C) texted me out of nowhere and asked me what I was doing that night. I told him that it was my day off and that I wanted a beer and he invited me to a bar to have one. I went out with him expecting only to hang out with someone new. We had a great night and when he took me home he told me that I was his HS crush. At first I had issues with the age difference (by then he was 26 and I was 31) but I had a great time with him, not only is he hot but he is also very smart and has an awesome sense of humor. 

We dated for a couple of months until one day he asked me what I wanted and expected from the relationship. I had to be very honest with myself and although I liked him a lot I was still very hurt from my break up so I told him that I couldn't give him a relationship. A few weeks later he met another girl and I told him to give it a chance with her, I needed to heal myself first.

Well, they dated for 2.5 years and about 2 weeks ago I heard rumours that they had broken up. Two days ago I got a friend request for him on instagram and I accepted him but that was it. Tonight I saw his profile on fb and that meant that I was unblocked (his ex made him block me) so I added him and said hi to him. We talked like in the old times.

Girls, I would love to have a relationship with him. I want to take things slow because he just broke up with his ex and I know from experience that one shouldn't rush into things after a break up but during this time apart I realised that I have strong feelings for him. I have only dated 2 other guys and I have been single since march, Im a different person than what I was 3 years ago.

This guy has RP tendencies and I would love to hear any advice you have to make this work. Thank you!

I'm 20 years old, I recently moved after two years of school to another state. I did not enroll for this past semester Fall 2017 since I was getting my stuff together. Now, I'm going back and enrolling for the Spring 2018 semester. This won't affect graduation date since I'm ahead in credits. 

I applied for an internship and it looks like I'm about to get it. I'm in the final stage and the interviewer joked that most interns are coming out of fast food (I have almost three years of IT enterprise experience). 

The problem is I'm not yet enrolled and the internship is supposed to start before I'll be enrolled. What I hate is that the first interviewer stressed a few times that this is for currently enrolled students and I lied saying I was currently enrolled.

How common is it for employer's to ask for enrollment verification for internships? It is a paid. 


Thank you so much. I'm kind of afraid of them finding out but I guess the worst case scenario is they find out and I don't get the position. Not the end of the world.

I've been wanting to go back to an asian metropolis (like Shanghai, Tokyo, Taipei,...). 

I've been looking on LinkedIn everyday to see if there would  be any job openings as a webdev. There are tons of jobs out there, but mainly for mediors or seniors (+ 3 years of exp).

How did you guys go about this? Should I just apply anyway (what's the harm, I already have a ""no"" anyway) or are there no reaslitic chances of landing international jobs as a junior?

7ezbs5,23,2017-11-23,Why I Read QC,lookingforfishes,questionablecontent,https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/7ezbs5/why_i_read_qc/,"This is an opinion piece, blah blah, I'm not speaking for anyone but myself. 

I started reading QC when I was a freshman in high school, over 10 years ago. It meant a lot to me then. It was my first webcomic along with Doctor McNinja. I read it however often it came out then (3 times a week?), and always talked about it with my best friend at the time. 

I had fallen in love with him (the best friend) and saw us Marten and Faye as some what of our story. Then Faye and Marten have [The Talk](http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=500) and that summer my best friend came out to me. 

It was a shocker, but I was the first person he told so I got over it (the part of me ""being in love"" not him being gay) and became hopefully an even better friend. 

I'm not sure when I kind of sort of stopped giving a crap about what was going in QC but it's been a few years. This doesn't stop me from reading everyday though, in anticipation I will get the same feeling that the early stuff did and still does, give. 

I read. Every day. I reread. And buy the books and reread from the beginning. 

I've lurked here a bit, posted with some other accounts and seen a lot of conversation about old and current arcs the ""good years"" vs now (we all sound like bitter old people) but wanted to leave this here as just why I have stuck around. 

As much as I haven't cared for Claire or Clinton, Brun, Elliot, Renee, Jim, Veronica becoming more-ish of a regular figure... I still read. I still mostly enjoy the story. If I had stopped reading when I lost interest around The Interns, I would have missed on Bubbles, who even though I don't think is a good romantic pairing for Faye, is an awesome character. I would miss out on any new characters that are more interesting than Tibbles or whatever their name is. 

Question Content has been such a part of my life and daily routine for so long I would miss it. So I keep reading. And sometimes I complain about it, and sometimes I praise it.

----------

You expected him to look.

His intent was obvious, when he asked you to pick out the file from the bottom drawer. So you gave him a show.

With a graceful flourish of your ponytail, you bend at the waist and give your boss a long, deliberate view of your ass - making sure to give a coy little wiggle in your tight pencil skirt. 

You can almost feel his eyes on you. Predatory. Ravenous. It was expected.

But his strong hand running up the inside of your thigh is a complete surprise.

Goosebumps race up and down your limbs. The iced lightning of adrenaline floods your veins, and every little hair on your body stands on end. Shock twists together with sheer excitement in your belly, and hot, wet heat blooms immediately between your legs.

You straighten, and your back meets the toned outline of his chest - your two bodies separated only by layers of cloth. The outline of his suit is distinct. Crisp, tailored wool. Charcoal. The rich burgundy of his tie flashes through your mind.

His hand gives your ass a playful squeeze, and your ruby lips part sensually in mock surprise. You've spent so many months carefully painting them every morning, waiting for this exact moment. You shift, preparing to turn - to press your lips firmly against his, to show him how desperately you've been craving him.

But his arms tighten around you.

With a single shove against the small of your back, you're bent over his desk. The mahogany is cold and hard beneath your hands - you can feel it through your blouse, against your belly and your breasts.

There's a sudden, harsh tug, and your skirt is up around your waist. His fist tightens around your ponytail, and pulls. A gasp is torn from your throat as he forces your back into a sensual arch - your ass pressed outward, grinding against the growing bulge in his slacks; your slick, black pumps shaping your curves against him.

There's the distinct sound of his belt buckle. The soft rasp of leather on wool. Your panties rip, torn from your body in his burning need for you.

An excited giggle bursts from between your lips - the pent up desperation from months of fantasizing being released all at once. From the moment you stepped through his office doorway on the first day of your internship, up until this very moment - every second, of every day, you've craved him. A desperate, overwhelming yearning. 

You can feel it now, growing at a fevered pitch, deep in your belly. It's a coil of lust, twisting about itself with growing tension. 

When you feel the swollen head of his cock at your entrance, it snaps - a low moan is drawn hoarse from your lungs, and you can feel your own hot juices trickle down your inner thighs.

He thrusts.

With a fistful of your ponytail in one hand, and a grip on your hip with the other, he penetrates you. Your soaked, burning sex welcomes him, and you can feel each granite inch of his cock as it sinks into your body.

When your lips are finally wrapped tight around the very base of his shaft, with his full, heavy balls pressed up against your clit, you can feel the muscles of his thighs flex against your ass.

The power of his body is intoxicating. You push back into him, savoring the rigid feeling of his toned legs and abs flush against your skin.

He thrusts again, and your knees quiver. 

Again. And again. The thick, hard length of his cock plunges into your body, claiming you. It's everything you've been dreaming about, and more. No amount of daydreaming at your desk could have prepared you for this. 

There's a fluttery, tense feeling in your belly. You can tell that a wave of orgasm is about to crest, but it's something more than that. There's a new craving from somewhere, deep in your most primal, ancient instincts. 

Those lush, ruby lips part, and your lashes flutter in surprise as you realize you're hoping he cums inside of you. 

The thought of it sends you over the edge, and the wave crests - a sudden cascade of intense ecstacy that sends ripples of pleasure coarsing through your body. Instinctively, your pussy grips him - the powerful contractions of your soaked, searing walls milking him hungrily.

All the while, he continues to thrust. Deep, powerful strokes that leave you gasping and begging between heaved breaths. 

You're his now. You know it. He knows it. A cute little plaything - young, pretty and eager for her boss.

His muscles tense. They flex. He bottoms out inside of your with a final, aggressive thrust, and you can feel his balls against you as the entire length of his cock gives a single promising throb.

He erupts.

With a rough growl, the first, thick rope of his cum splashes into your tight little slit. The heat of it fills you. A second hot splash, and a third. It coats your walls, floods your womb, and drips slowly down the insides of your thighs. 

In the coming months, you'll look back on this moment as you stroke your swollen belly and grin. But right now, in the moment, your mind is blank - focused only on the animalistic fire raging between your legs. 

The feel of his seed is overwhelming, potent and thick within you even as it coats your thighs. You tighten yourself, tensing, gripping his shaft in rippling waves of pleasure.

Your tongue peeks out from between your lips and grazes your teeth in a knowing grin as the last drops of him are planted deep in your belly."

I wasn't really great at anything and I often would get depressed about not having a real purpose in life. 

I knew I liked business and knew entrepreneurship was the only thing I could ever see myself doing, but just felt like it was something I could never actually do. Sophomore year of college I had the opportunity to take an internship that was very different from the others. It was a painting company that was ran entirely by students while they would be taught on how to run the business through training and a mentor. It sounded like the perfect opportunity for me and I was fascinated by what this internship offered. It was also very intimidating/scary for me because i really had no confidence in myself. 

I talked to people who went through the program before me for a couple hours and got a date for an interview. It came and I was shocked when the vice president of the company hired me on the spot. I was very happy but also confused as to what he had seen in me. I was still nervous as hell too. Training came and they sent us out to a hotel. For 12 hours 3 days in a row we were hammered with information and expectations on how to run our business. It was already exhausting but I had already fallen in love with the high energy positive attitudes these people had right off the bat. The whole atmosphere was like something I had never experienced in a classroom at business school. And then they throw us into the fire pretty literally. I was suddenly in charge of an entire county for this company and I did not know what in the fuck I was doing. They had mentors for all of us rookies that we would call many times.. often 2 to 3 times a day. Anyways they laid out the systems for us on how to generate leads, do estimates, book jobs, hire painters, produce the jobs, etc etc. Every aspect of the business was in our hands. Long story short I finished the summer selling and producing $92,000 worth of jobs completely on my own. Holy shit was this summer by far the craziest and by far best time of my life. By the end of it I had a level of confidence in myself i never thought i was capable of having. I worked non stop especially in may/june where 80 hr weeks would become a normal week. The biggest thing that i noticed though was that during the first few months spent marketing and first month of summer i had put in tons of hours of work without a single pay check.. yet i didn't even care. I literally forgot i even got money from doing this. I became so focused on improving myself in so many ways and trying to learn the business. I loved it. I fell in love with the whole process because every night i went to bed knowing i had improved myself in some way and that i had overcome another challenge. I now understood the high constantly working energy that they had at training. I had acquired it too. I saw that facing your fears every single day to improve yourself was the most motivating thing in the world. There was always a new challenge to overcome. Its all about your mindset.

Now I see clearly how and why very successful people become who they are. Your mindset is by far the most valuable part of anything you become. With the right mindset, you literally can do anything. I made $15,000 over the summer and got a free trip to mexico. I actually was running the top producing painting company in my whole county. School is completely fucked they need to redesign it from the ground up. There are probably so many others that will never see their full potential because of the restricting mindset our schools have created. Anyways I hope this story inspires others. I want to help others out there that were like me so don't hesitate to ask for help."

I feel like I'm under pressure from all sides and helpless at the same time. I have a German Shepherd Dog who is my only companion but at the same time I am struggling with her behavior. She has been barking and reactive towards people and dogs. This must've been because she has this fear after being left with my aunt (who abused her). Taking her is a panic attack for me. An actual nightmare. I cried so much yesterday and a while back when I took her down for her business. When I spoke to my mom about getting a trainer, my parents have been dismissing that idea for a year now. She is my first dog and I love her so much but I am starting to feel like I ruined her life by not standing up for her. I am also having doubts about finding a job here. I feel like it'll never work out. I'm currently finishing my Masters but I like in Istanbul and I don't speak fluent Turkish to find a job or internship here. I have been working for a year with this guy who is designing an app, but he hasn't paid me because he complains about not having the funding yet. I am alone and I can't speak about my mom about this because she'll tell me to stay positive, which is not what I want to hear. She complains about money being an issue but we are really well off. I'm just stuck and can't find a solution. I feel like every time I think about either of these problems I lose a portion of sanity and I hate myself even more. I contemplate suicide but don't want to because I want to believe these are just problems that will solve in time. But at the same time I am losing hope with every second that passes. I just need someone to talk to and someone that can possibly help me think of alternatives. I don't know. Thanks in advance."

I was wondering if anyone can lend some advice on my not so ideal situation. I’m graduating in a couple weeks here. 

My girlfriend is applying to med schools right now (all over the country) and the plan is to relocate to wherever (if) she gets accepted to. If she gets accepted then I could start applying in the area, but we’re giving until about February before she moves on to another plan. 

This means I’m very hesitant to apply for on-site jobs seeing as I would have to tell them there’s a chance I’m relocating in half a year. I don’t want to get settled in to a company to and have to leave shortly after. I’ve been applying to any remote jobs out there as that seems like my best bet right now. I’ve got an offer from a startup company BUT they are only offering an internship for the time being due to waiting to see if they pass the next funding round - they can’t afford to hire me full time yet. The company is exciting to me, but I also need to think about living/paying off my loans. Also, I’ve already worked a really good internship through my school - hopping from internship to internship doesn’t seem ideal. I know I’m prepared to start contributing as a full time employee. 

I’m going to keep applying for remote jobs I come across but I think I’d gain a lot more from a full time onsite job unfortunately. Also, I don’t see a lot of companies being keen to having a fresh grad start remotely. I’m really struggling to decide if I should accept this other internship if no full time remote opportunities arise or risk waiting for my girlfriend to get accepted and have a potential gap in employment. I really just want to start working as I’m very passionate about my field and getting towards graduation is getting me excited to start my career.

I know this is probably hard to give advice on, but I’d appreciate anything that could help give me some more certainty.

So I started my first job as a case manager out of school (this is like bachelor level) which includes group, individual, and family counseling, and case management. So we had a major accreditation agency coming in to survey all our work, comb through old charts etc and so everyone had to be on top of their game. The day this started was my first day working with a new client, my first client ever, which, think back to how you felt.



It was such great timing to become very sick with a fever and the works the day before. So I roll in to work just feeling like I can barely even think straight, I'm dizzy, just feel awful and was just remembering back to my internship when my supervisor would come to work sick, though probably not as sick as I am now. 



So I meet with my new client and have a ton of documentation we need to complete because the clt is new, there are surveys, assessments, master treatment plan etc. Client shows up on time asks to call mom which I of course allowed, and all I will say is that this went really bad, the client had to take a break or insisted on it and took a PRN medication. By the time the client came back plus the phone call a good 15 - 20 minutes had been burned up, out of a 50-60 min session. I sit the clt down try and crank out what I can and we completed about half the documentation, other time was spent processing with the client because of the phone call and other things that came up that were clearly triggering. My plan had been to spend some time building rapport, which I think some headway was made, but there wasn't enough time to do everything for me. I was feeling like total crap, sweating, fever, etc and had some anxiety to put it mildly about everything going on, and I think it all lead to me just not doing my best work in terms of my notes. I went back later and reviewed my work and was like, wow, I was not careful enough or something cause there are errors and it looks rushed.



So then they assign another client later that day, I briefly meet this client right as the client is being transported out, never get a chance to start documentation. I go  home and just got really sick since then. I asked my supervisor what she wanted me to do and she said to stay home so I did. So then I find out my new clt relapsed, and not crap I can do about it from home so I'm just sitting there like, great. What sucks is that I'm getting sicker, I saw a doctor and the doctor was like ""well could be a virus or a bacterial infection if you don't get better"" (not getting better) and all the while they keep adding more clients to my caseload and I can't do anything to get started. So now on Friday I'm planning to go in, I'm still sick as heck but I've got 4 clients I need to set up that day and get going.



I'm just feeling overwhelmed by the situation, it's awful to have your first week where you want to show what you can do, to an agency who is paying me more than some other case managers are making there, that I am a good investment but I feel like that's not what is happening. I'm just so pissed off that I got this sick right now, I'm not even going to Thanksgiving because of this, but tomorrow I'm going to work, I don't know what else to do at this point and just am looking for some support or if anyone can relate. Thanks.

Background: I live in a small community (Davis Islands, Tampa, FL) where many residents already own golf carts that they use to go from their houses to the restaurants and bars in our downtown strip. Traffic is light and the max speed limit is 35 mph.  I think this neighborhood would be perfect for a driverless golf cart service. Golf carts aren't nearly as regulated as regular cars. 

It seems like technology has reached a point where it should be relatively easy to install ultrasonic sensors, a radar, and cameras on a cart. Add some computers, a drive-by-wire control system, and software, and I should be able to get a cart on the road relatively easy... at least that is what I think. The tech has already been done many times before; however, I don't know the extent of funding or manpower required for those projects. 

I am a mechanical &amp; aerospace engineer, helicopter mechanic, pilot, and know some computer coding. My budget is $30k for the cart and hardware, plus another $20k to hire some interns to help me with coding and testing. 

So my question is: Is this feasible, or am I being unrealistic???


If this is feasible, then what do you think will be my biggest technical challenges? And any other advice or references that people could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. "

Long post.,throwawaysuicidaltho,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7f2n9w/dealing_with_daily_life_is_becoming_more/,"good afternoon everyone, this is my first post here, and its a long one. i am having suicidal thoughts (not to the point of planning to act on them, but to the point they are making my life hopeless and depressing), this is gonna be a slightly long post, but please bare with me, i am in dire need of help.

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits. -Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget. -Body odor which no matter what i do still remains. -i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this. -i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting. -i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes. -i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with. -a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

He'd be mad if he found out that I'm asking on here
2. I hope here's the right spot to ask these kinds of questions, if not, please point me into the right direction

I'm not gonna describe the situation in detail since I don't want anyone to be able to find out my identity, but to sum it up: my boyfriend  and I graduated from high school this year. Since we're from different countries with different languages, it was decided that we'd go to uni in an english speaking country. A few months ago he decided that he wanted to take a gap year off. Since it would've been rather complicated to switch universities between countries, I didn't really have a choice but to take off a year as well, which I do not like at all.
I had to make plans for this year last minute and it was a really hard time for me, however, I was able to land a half-year paid internship at a nice company in the field that I want to work in later.
My boyfriend moved in with me and my parents and that's where the problems started. He doesn't speak the local language, neither does he want to learn it. My parents made him go take language lessons, which he reluctantly did, but he put 0 effort in it and after 3 months he's still not any better. From the start he said that my parents didn't like him and that they were gonna throw him out. But that is not true. Here's the thing: he is not willing to do anything at all. I pushed him to message places where he may get a job because we also need to earn money for university. I do not want to HAVE to earn money while going to university since I know myself and I know that I may not be able to handle the stress, which is why I have already saved quite a lot. He does not understand that. In his mind, we can just work a 10h/week job and get by this way (with parents support) and, initially, he was not willing to ease my fear by trying harder to  get a job. I know it's hard for someone who doesn't speak the language to find a job, but whenever he""tried"" to message people, I could just see how much he did not want to do that. He always told me how he is taking a gap year and did not have or plan on doing anything. He is working an online ""job"" now doing surveys etc. where he earns around a thousand a month. 
My parents aren't really happy about that either. He barely leaves the room and they feel that he is holding me back academically, because he is also very slow and lazy when it comes to university applications.
I'm already so afraid that my job prospects are ruined because of this year, so for him it must be much worse. I'm always thinking about how he could possibly justify this year in his CV but I always end up thinking that his life is already ruined. I don't understand how he can do this, that's why I wanted to get in a second opinion. Did he already ruin his life or am I projecting my fears onto him? "

I've been unemployed for months and months and don't know what I can really do. I just want an office job but can't find any that i'm qualified for that aren't analyst roles which expect statistics and programming skills. I I've been told I'm overqualified for basic admin/clerical positions (Biology degree and MPH).

I've got some community health experience (hated it - don't enjoy that amount of people focused work and constant changing of environments) and I do some spot jobs assisting a public health researcher. Mostly compiling/collating etc. Not learning anything new. I cant afford to do any more unpaid internships.

I'm not picky on the focus of the job. Obviously a beggar cant be a chooser.

Anyone I've seen on LinkedIn with entry level roles in say the NHS or public health England all seem to be epi grads with years of undergrad/graduate research assistant experience/previous employment before landing those roles. I'm very confused as to what I can aspire to without going down a health promotion route which i regret specializing in.

7f3m7o,5,2017-11-23,Thinking of moving to Canada due to Visa issues next year. Seeking advice.,george_soros_cs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7f3m7o/thinking_of_moving_to_canada_due_to_visa_issues/,"&lt;LongRant&gt;
As you probably might have guessed. I am an Indian in USA with a master's degree in computer science seeking an H1B visa. Before you click the 'X' button on the tab, let me assure you, I am not one of those infy/cognizant type consultants. I genuinely enjoy what I do and I went to a decently ranked college for my master's degree. Not IVY league but 3 ~ 4 years ago, it was a top 20 school for computer science. I had two full time offers. Of which I picked one. I make close to 150k(bonus + base) and I am working for a really well-known company. 

Now there were 60 Indians in my class and everyone who had an offer before the lottery, got an H1B, except for me. I know its a lottery but my irrational mind sees two reasons why something like could've happened.

1) I was rejected after 3 rounds of interviews two years ago for an internship, by the same company I joined. In the final round, this year, I told my interviewer a joke. He started laughing and I told him I really badly wanted this job and he gave me the job. Maybe I was given the job to prevent bad PR? Maybe they never filled my H1B and just wanted to keep me around for a year or two? Do companies do that? Like lie about filling H1B?

2) By master's degree standard, I have a low GPA - 3.33.  If you get a GPA below 3 for two consecutive semesters, your visa will be revoked. To be fair, the program was insanely tough. A couple of courses I took involved reading like 40 research papers and there was quizes/exams on them. One of the course I took, natural language processing made us implement a shift-reduce parser whose ""actions"" were learnt by a perceptron. We had to read a paper on this, understand what we were doing and write code in python. I did all the programming assignments without any problem. But the math in these courses really killed me(""We don't want to invert the hessian matrix, in this case, because of the huge cost involved, so we went with this approach"". ""If we had N training samples, by this weird probability trick, this algorithm has a lower bound of epsilon on the training error"". ""Hence you can see, Fourier transform is the same as Laplace transform"" ). My American friends say that the master's program was very easy, but when you have to work for 15 hours every week in a burger shop to make the rent and study for these exams too... This just doesn't work. There are people who made it work. But sadly, I am not one of them. I tried my best, it just didn't work out for me.

Honestly, I want some certainty in life. I will probably work for a decade or so and go back to India. I am losing sleep over the H1B lottery thing. I have been considering going to Canada to evade this ""prosecution"" of sorts. Every day there is a news article regarding how the H1B process is going to change. It's taking close to a month to have your Visa stamped on your passport. I really want to buy a computer this year(One of my dreams in life is to buy a computer with an unlimited budget. I had a computer since 3rd grade, and most of the computers I had very shitty). I am really very tempted to order parts for 1800$ but I refraining to. Cause if I am forced to leave the country, I would have to toil for 6 months at least to earn that much in India. I am not even able to focus on my work, because of this uncertainty.

How much of a pay cut am I looking at, assuming I manage to get into Microsoft/Amazon next year in their Toronto branch or something? I will work my ass off. If I don't make it this year. I will try next year and a year after that before my visa expires. I will tell my interviewer a joke again and see if it works :D If it doesn't I will have to go back lol. I will probably try from India too.

Can I return to USA if I get like a citizenship there? I heard people make up to 300k with 10 years of experience in well know the company. Do you think that is possible in Canada?

I grew up in a relatively ok middle-class family with a couple of other siblings. However, I wasn’t a decent kid in school and frequently got into fights because I had a stick up my ass/anger management issues and at several points, the police were called in and I was threatened with juvenile prison. What hit me the hardest was some of my relatives saying I wouldn’t amount to anything and of course, my parents were incredibly disappointed to say the least.

I cleaned my act and managed to go to college, but I was still a fucking brat. I fooled around, sinking my GPA while I just kinda went with the flow. I was a real fuckhead to my parents, demanding them to sponsor expensive college overseas trips and for more pocket money while I continued to be a fucking bum. I was really unaware that my parents had made some bad financing decisions of their own and had a mountain of debt to deal with. Not to mention, my siblings would soon be entering college and that was another fuckton of debt. 

It was one of those cold nights where I had a sudden reckoning. I don’t know how to put it, as a Christian, it was like God speaking to me inside. I asked myself what the fuck I was doing and just how much of a fucking shit I was throughout. I decided I had to get my shit back together. My college majors were on the liberal arts side as a result of me fooling and fucking around because I wanted ‘easier’ modules to clear. This wouldn’t cut it.

I had some interest in the finance sector because I loved working with quantitative data and the pay was a great way out but my lack of internships and experience was a real pain. In addition the application dates for the bulge bracket banks summer internships had already passed. I caught up with a few of my school friends and I was encouraged to network actively and revamp my resume, which I did. I got around to speaking with seniors who got into banking from an arts background while participating actively in case competitions to hone my skills. I managed to land an internship with a boutique firm and no words could describe how relieved I was. I studied in the days before endlessly while memorizing every technical aspect needed, and got my friends to practise mock interviews with me. I was really thankful that my boss saw the hunger in me and chose to overlook my shitty GPA and lack of experience. It was also a half year internship that required a leave of absence so that probably worked in my favour by culling half the competition.

It was a great step forward and I learnt a ton (over many sleepless nights at the office) while working on many live projects but the small nature of the firm meant that they weren’t open to hiring graduates at this point. It’s ok, I still had another summer to go (delayed graduation). As the opening dates opened, I got right in to applying for the big bulge bracket banks and just about anyone in that industry. I managed to get into a few superdays and it’s all a blur now. Whether because I was nervous and it showed or I was just plain terrible compared to anyone else, I didn’t get a single offer that summer. Both bulge bracket banks and just about any firm. It was really fucking devastating and crushing to my self esteem as even unknown small accounting firms passed over me for other candidates. I had alot of self-doubt and was wondering if I made the right choice to move in this direction. 

So how did I spent my summer? My last chance to get a top internship to boost my job prospects? As a fucking waiter because I couldn’t find a single internship. Anyhow, the bills had to be paid and I wanted to send my parents some cash so off I went, working my ass off everyday. I wanted to make full use of the summer and not waste it/have something to show for it so I got started on learning programming and it was really great fun as I completed modules after modules while working on mini projects.

School came about and this time it was time to find a job. I applied for the same banks again (why not?) but this timr my resume was far behind the pack with a gaping hole for the summer and I only made it to the first couple of rounds. At some point in time, I kinda didn’t gave a shit as I contemplated just being another speck, working something ordinary with just enough to survive. By virtue of luck, I came across an ad for a graduate position with an algorithm trading firm that had grew rapidly over the fast few years with a monstrous pay package to boot. They were rather resume-blind for the initial hiring process but had a series of complicated maths tests under a short duration of time to sieve out candidates. Somehow honestly, I managed to pull through. It was just such a relief and soon I could see the silver linings. I rehearsed every day, preparing a pitch that would help explain why the fuck I was being a bum for the summer. I struggled with it and decided that I really should just be honest. There was really nothing to lose for me at this point. Who am I? Shitty college undergrad with a shitty resume that managed to make it this far alongside far better candidates. And also, a generic pitch probably wouldn’t be enough to allow myself to stand out. 

So off I went, with the HR and directors. I showed all my cards. I told them that I’d made a number of bad decisions during my junior years and I was desperately trying to make up for lost time. I didn’t get a summer internship but I spent nights slaving away in front of the computer after trying to make ends meet with programming codes, demonstrating some of my mini projects. My shitty GPA couldn’t be erased but for the past 2 semesters I had scored a perfect 4, with A+ in quantitative finance modules. I had no experience whatsoever in this role but I was desperate for an opportunity and I would do whatever it takes for me to find the solution if there were any questions. 

I left the interview red-eyed and feeling rather shitty about myself, embarrassed that I went on a seemingly emotional rant. As I was pondering over my next steps earlier today, I received a call, with an offer from that company. I could barely conceal my delight as I was read out the full compensation package, which was a fucking load of money. I had never seen so much fucking money before and it was definitely going to be a load off my parents’ shoulders especially since they’re getting old and stuff. I don’t know what to say as I’m still in a whirl now. I’m grateful that there’s someone watching over me from above, for having parents that put up with my fucking bullshit when many others would have just thrown me out, for having friends that were willing to go the extra mile etc. Anyway I accepted that offer without hesitation and for once, I seem to be right back on the path again. I know some of you might ask me to go and give my parents a big hug or something but we aren’t that sort of people. We’ve never been one to talk much and I hope that coming right home and passing them a chunk of my pay check every month might just make up for a fraction of the pain I dealt them throughout these years.

Sorry for the long ramble, just getting it out. Also haven’t cried a like a baby/from joy in ages.

Long story short, he could not handle leading a big team on a big restaurant for the first time and was fired on the first week of October.

I've continued to work there while looking for opportunities, since the the restaurant is not the type of place I want to work at right now and I went there mainly because of said Chef.
We have a new chef that has started a about a week ago and is doing a good job fixing and organizing everything. I've been learning a lot this last week.

My dilemma: I've been called for an interview tomorrow at a place I really want to work at, but the talk I had with the chef de partie gives the vibe they need someone to start right away.
I'm not legally bound, but it is against my nature to leave before training someone/ waiting for the new chef to find someone to fill my shoes. I don't want to (and won't) miss the new job but also don't want to be the asshole who leaves an already understaffed team at no notice at all (common practice here is 1 month notice with reduced working hours or 3 weeks with normal hours, you do not need to give notice if you present a letter from a new employer).

**TL;DR:** New job possibly wants me to start right away, by law I don't need to put notice but I don't want to screw the new chef who already has an understaffed team. How to proceed?

For the most part i use R (ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr) I don’t feel super comfortable with it yet but I’m getting the hang of it. 

I have taken some stats courses for grad school but not as heavy on the stats as a more technical field.

SQL ( I could prob pick this up relatively quickly with online courses)

Background:

I'm a junior studying computer science. I attend a ""good"" CS university but I don't have any connections to refer me anywhere. My GPA is 3.4 which isn't stellar by any means. I've bombed every single coding screen I've ever done, even the relaxed time generous ones. I do 5-10 hackerrank and leetcode questions a day but it doesn't seem to get me anywhere -- I've always been a ""slow"" coder and have only made it through because I dedicate my spare time to my classes. 0 tech internships. I would say I don't have the ""brain"" for CS problems because I've never been good at them -- I'd start assignments earlier and think about them longer. 

My whiteboarding is much better than my online skill, simply because I've found interviewers to be generous with would-be compiler errors and just look at your overall logic. I've also found that in-person interviewers will take whatever language whereas online screens are often in my weaker ones.

Can someone like me even make in industry, or am I just deluded? At one point I thought I could because I don't mind staying at work an extra hour or two to make up for my lack of speed, but it looks like I can't even get hired. Is there any field in which ""slow"" coders are more welcome?

7f6bbl,3,2017-11-24,I feel out of place and really depressed lately.,cantletparentsknow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7f6bbl/i_feel_out_of_place_and_really_depressed_lately/,"Hey everyone,

This is my first time ever telling anyone. I haven't told a friend, family member, teacher or anything before because I just can't. I've been told recently by my family and friends after I let out a sentence stating a feeling of helplessness to see a psychiatrist and I just can't do that. They want me to talk to the psychiatrist I'm seeing about adhd about this as well and I don't think I can physically do that.

One of the main reasons I've felt depressed is that I've felt out of place my entire life. I'm Northern African but I grew up in an almost entirely Asian neighborhood in the silicon valley. I also currently attend a University that is more than 50% asian (which I didn't know about when I committed to the college). It was always weird to me because I always felt out of place no matter where I went or what I did, seeing as I was northern African and everything I heard was about Asians. I was even called by a lot of my friends ""More Asian than them"" which kinda attributes to my parents living in japan for many years before I was born. It's always made me uncomfortable because I would always reply how I'm Northern African and all that.

Even back home, all my friends are either chinese or Taiwanese and I sometimes feel like the only reason I'm friends with a lot of them is because in there words, ""I act Asian"". It always makes me uncomfortable especially because I have a pride for my culture and I never get acknowledged as it. It always comes down to the same thing that I know many other people go through with, in the comftorable in my own skin. Sometimes my brain just has the thought ""what if I was Asian. My life would be so much better"" or "" It's all cuz I'm African"". And when I have those thoughts I just hate myself even more.

Another issue that has always come up has been my weight. I became overweight in High school due to never going outside and always staying inside and playing League of Legends. I went to an extremely competitive high school being ranked top 10 in the nation for SAT/ACT scores and it was very uncommon for people to go outside during freshman-junior year. Most my friends just stayed home and studied but I was always a terrible student. In middle school I got straight D's, I was one of the few of my year not to make honor roll because of my terrible grades and I just never felt like doing it. It never helped due to my older sister being extremely smart and applying herself. I've always had the thing where I was really good at numbers and science and was above average at retention of it so I never needed to study for tests, but I never did my homework or projects or anything, which always tanked my grade putting me at the bottom 10% of my school with 3 gpa only netting me average Universities whereas my sister, who's always been good at studying applying herself was a very good student getting into top 10 engineering universities and actually getting to choose a good university she wanted to go to. My parent's always complained that I never applied myself and I should work harder and it never helped that they would compare me to my friends and family friends who attended the school about how they all get home and study and I'm being useless and wasting my time only playing video games. Over time it just developed into a routine of me getting home, eating a ton of food, playing league, sleeping going to school playing league sleeping going to school, and I never enjoyed a day of it. I only played games because it got me through the day, not because I enjoyed them at all. And it's happening again in College. All I do is eat fat foods now that my parents don't watch me, I got my gpa up fortunately and am doing better with filling my resume with internships and works, but I feel worse now than before.

In University it just makes me envious of all my friends here and back home. How open they are and how much happier it makes them. They all seem to enjoy life so much, partying, drinking, smoking, all with friends and enjoying life. A lot of my friends open up to me and always feel comftorable with me around telling me personal things and have always gone to me when they're having issues with their parents or significant other or school and I personally want to tell them my issues but I just can't. I can't drink or smoke not because I think it's bad, but because my parents are muslim and I consider myself one and follow the faith although very liberally. I always have differing views on life with my parents like me and my sister are pro-lgbtq whereas my parents are against it. But my parents are very liberal in thoughts like my dad being such a big proponent of mental health issues but I still can't talk to him. I don't want to sadden him as it's already hard enough for my parents having to take care of my severely special needs brother.

It's especially hard for me in University because I wanna talk to people and really wanna better myself, but I've locked myself so much that I can't even tell my closest friends what kind of girl I like. This semester I started to actually scream at myself and started hitting myself when my roommate was out and I would hit until hurt so much that I had to force myself to go outside cuz I knew I wouldn't hit myself in public. 

I began to have suicidal thoughts and actually at the beginning planned how I would kill myself and have it all end and wouldn't feel anything. When I thought of that I thought of how good of an opportunity my parents gave me, and how I was wasting it which made me want to hurt myself even more because I was a piece of garbage that can't even get ahead with all these boosts in life. 

I don't want to have these thoughts anymore. I really don't want to die and I wanna stop being sad all the time. I can't remember the last time in life I was happy but I want to feel what it's like to enjoy life like my friends at school do.

I honestly don't care if no one reads this but this is the most I've been able to open up to anyone. Not a single person truly knows me and I always feel even worse because I can't tell anyone anything."

The doctor even kept asking his nurse to take my weight, height, and blood pressure...which never happened. Though I told his intern about what was happening with my body, it doesn't seem like he actually read my chart or anything. He told me to continue on the BCP despite my concerns over it, and ordered some more tests (and a prescription for some meds but he told me only to take it after the bloodwork/ultrasound results).

Things have gotten slightly worse, with the bleeding being a constant stream, and it's very messy and gross. I've got cramps as well. I also have a slight fever with cold symptoms but I *think* it's unrelated. Basically I feel like hell right now. 

I don't feel comfortable speaking to my OB-GYN again, and I'm not sure if the endocrinologist is going to help (I feel like he's just going to ask me to wait until the tests are done). My General Practiioner has already tried to re-route me toward the OB. I could go to the ER but it doesn't feel like an emergency, not to mention that it's very expensive for me.

I guess I'm asking for some advice on what to do at home. I finished the first month of BCP and am currently on placebo #1. Are there any remedies or medications I can take over the counter? Or any sort of exercises I can do? Anything? I feel desperate, and I'm not getting much support in real life from people around me so this sub is all I have right now..."

Black Friday sale at DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers!,Stylus_Index,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7f7t76/siege_ends_black_friday_sale_at_dena_royal/,"This is Midgar News Network live! Good morning viewers! Hello, I am Aren Gee and I will be your news corresponder for today. Here is brief view of our headlines for today:

 * The Siege at Shinra HQ has ended!
 * Sephiroth's ""army"" disperses! Disturbance in Midgar Highway.
 * Shinra Corporation under fire from Clone Rights activists!
 * The on-going BraBra concert is smashing success! Spoony Bard sighted among the attendees!
 * Black Friday sale on DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers! They're latest campaign: G3 on 11-pulls - buy now!

With that done, let us head to our main topics...

&amp;nbsp;

After roughly two weeks of never-ending minute-log sieges, the battle area surrounding Shinra HQ Midgar branch has finally fallen silent, leaving only carnage and the roaring flaming wreckage of Shinra's warmachines. And about time, just in time for Thanksgiving day, this will be worth a celebration!

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, Sephiroth's ""army"" has left Midgar as quickly as they came and was last seen moving in their own separate ways, leaving behind Sephiroth and Cloud Strife on one of the Midgar highways. There amidst bystanders and passersby, Sephiroth and Cloud Strife dissolved their temporary truce to once again engage in combat with each other, a battle that seems reminiscent of the duel between Earth's Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro. While the duel was largely inconclusive, female onlookers were seen fainting by numbers at the sight of Sephiroth's toned body after removing his trench-coat, while male onlookers were seen pestering Cloud Strife about his two-timing relationship with barkeeper Tifa and the local flower girl Aerith. In the end, the duo hurriedly left the Midgar highway in separate ways after being pestered enough by the on-lookers, declaring that they will finish their duel another day.

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, the Shinra Corporation is currently under heavy fire from Clone Rights activists, with the recent siege from Sephiroth's ""army"" throwing light and revealing the Shinra's unethical cloning activities. One of their Clone Rights activists' representative, Mina Tchuu, has this to say: ""Shinra Corporation is the worse! They are cloning people without a care for the Clone's civil rights! These clones are being using from test subjects, moving targets, and also being subjective to horrible living conditions!"". Meanwhile Shinra Corporation Press is silent and no official statements has been issued since this incident. However, the current and presumably-soon-to-be-ousted-maybe-in-their-dreams Shinra Corporation President, Rufus Shinra, has a different thing to say about the recent events.

""It has been brought to my recent attention, as early as last month before the siege, that the Shinra Corporation R&amp;D has been doing several controversial things without my knowledge."" Rufus Shinra said calmly but with a frown on his face. ""Rest assure that the main culprit, our own heretical Prof. Hojo, has already been arrested and will soon be facing charges as appropriate."" he added quietly as he presents as a video clip dated not so recently...

*a shaky and slightly-blurry video clip shows a group of ""adventurers"" with Rufus himself on the rear, fighting a horribly disfigured and mutated Prof. Hojo in his laboratory, with the video ending with an unconscious and heavily beaten-up Hojo lying on the floor*

""As you have seen yourself, I am terribly against the questionable action of employees, let this be a lesson to those who wish to step out of the line of my standards."" Rufus proudly said and all the while pointing his shotgun at the camera. ""Now, get out of my office, I have some 'cleaning' to do.""

Despite this controversial statement, rumors of Rufus Shinra being seen by several-but-now-missing-witnesses that he was intimately collaborating with Sephiroth's ""army"" weeks ago, joining in at least several skirmishes with his shotgun. But, also, what of the clones? Time will only tell. For the sake of neutrality, we on the MNN will not deny or confirm about these rumors regarding Rufus Shinra, we will leave that to your imaginations and personal safety.

&amp;nbsp;

In entertainment, after the smashing hit with the Mesmerizing Melodies BraBra collab-concert, Nobbio's returns to the stage and to head The Gilded Concert BraBra collab-concert. With all the tickets sold out, our on-field corresponders have reported that they have witnessed many famous people from the Bard and Dancer Industry in full attendance of the concert, among the celebrities sighted was the Spoony Bard and Princess Sarah of Cornelia. On the other hand, while the details regarding the incident was sparse and hushed, the Gysahl Greens Shop Inc. owner Fat Chocobo was also seen at the venue. However, the reports claim that Fat Chocobo was involved in an altercation with a certain fairy, causing a small yet ground-shaking disturbance within the concert venue. Fortunately, a number of adventures, who were in attendance of the concert, quickly took action to calm both sides, resulting to a quick resolution and leaving the concert uninterrupted. In either way, The Gilded Concert BraBra collab-concert is a smashing success, with Nobbio hinting at a third collab-concert soon! Better save up your tickets to get a chance to watch him live next!

In other news, DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers has recently announced their Black Friday sale gimmick for this year, a G3 on 11-pull Black Friday Grab Bags! While we all know that this won't top the fiasco that was G11 Collection Bags handled by one of their interns, DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers has guaranteed aspiring Adventures and Keepers that those who will buy this year's 1-time Black Friday 11-pull Grab Bags are guaranteed to at least 3 highly quality items, what the contents are exactly is what you will have to buy and find out yourself. While the marketing was seen as a huge trap by many, several Adventurers and Keepers interviewed said that is fair priced and reasonable, considering that its 3 highly quality items now that Mythrils are hard to come and many trying save up due to the upcoming seasonal and highly anticipated goods in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, many other Adventurers and Keepers have ridiculed that the Black Friday 11-pull Grab Bags as nothing more than a commercial trap and with one Keeper, who agreed to comment but wants to remain anonymous, said: ""This is an obvious trap! You! Don't get caught by their shady marketing, its a trap I say, a trap! 3 highly quality items my foot! They'll be giving out surplus Tiny Bees I tell ya! Expect 3 Tiny Bees for RNG sakes! Heck, it may even be Revolvers and Barbuts if they can sneek them in!"". While DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers strongly denies the claims and statements of the disgruntled Keepers, one thing has been assured by DeNA Royal Academy of Keepers' spokesman and as he stated, ""We highly assure the public that the items within our limited time Black Friday 11-pull Grab Bags are of the highest quality, containing mostly of the recently developed goods over the year, and you may even receive the rarest of 6-star class items as part of the Guaranteed 3 kupo! So, please buy your Black Friday 11-pull Grab Bags ASAP, before they are out of stock kupo!""

&amp;nbsp;

While the G3 on 11-pull Black Friday Grab Bag sure is tempting, be sure to check up your budget before committing to these stuff people, the holidays are coming in soon! Well, it looks like our time is and that'll be all for now, this is Aren Gee and saying... May the RNG be with you!!"
7f8500,35,2017-11-24,Something I've noticed about applying to top colleges.,grimreaper27,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7f8500/something_ive_noticed_about_applying_to_top/,"#### What I noticed
Just a general impression I've gotten as I've researched and applied to colleges. For the top, really selective colleges (Ivies, Stanford, MIT etc.) having incredible awards/ECs can definitely make up for meh grades, and can often improve your chances significantly. 

However, if you don't have such impressive ECs or awards, and just happen to do well in exams and school with decent ECs only because you started late (*cough* junior year *cough*) and never took part in competitions because you never understood its importance... 

Well you're not shit outta luck yet, it just becomes a lot more uncertain and crapshoot-y, and a lot more dependent on essays, how you think, what kind of person are you. 

#### Guide

So if you have motivated, driven kids you know, the best piece of advice I can think of for them is:

1) In freshman/middle school, figure out what you love as early as possible by trying out new things. Focus on one to two things at a time only. Give it up without getting invested if it doesn't really appeal to you. 

2) Once you figure out what you love, start learning as much as you can. Coursera, Udacity, textbooks whatever. Get as deep as you can within that area. Focus most of your free time on this, and since you'd love it, you will have fun. Get standardized testing out of the way around now. 

3) You should be in late sophomore/early junior by now. Here on out take part in as many competitions - or its equivalent - as you can. Try to aim big and *prove* your knowledge essentially. 

4) Come senior year, write great essays. Start in the summer and plan your time. You should be in a perfect position to apply for college around now.

All this while maintain *decent* grades like GPA &gt; 3.7 uw and use smarter techniques like many AP classes to boost weighted GPA, and essentially study smart. 


#### Conclusions

So breakdown:

GPA &gt; 3.7 uw and 4.2 w

ACT/SAT &gt; 34/1530

ECs/Awards: excellent

Essays: excellent

LORs: good 

Interview (lots to talk about, this much EC involvement would also tend to give you incredible experiences and make you a much more interesting person): great

That, imo, is the best 'formula' you can get, if you're aiming for top colleges and are a driven, motivated student. 

This is from a combination of mine and my friends experiences. I wish I had started earlier and managed to follow this. I didn't put much effort until junior year and that's when I really got good grades but I didn't have time to do much else. My friends on the other hand... Some have been preparing for years b/c siblings or parents (and pretty much doing the above) and their applications are honestly incredible and the best I've heard of. National awards, years worth of research with a published paper in a reputed, top journal, great essays, top grades (not valedictorian but that's the point, you don't need to be the absolute top, you just need to be *good*). These are the kids who have a shot at Harvard and the like, and a decent shot at that. 

Now obviously, not everyone wants to or can do this and that's perfectly okay. This is just something I've noticed and some advice I've formed outta that. I give this advice to my friend's younger siblings and what not. 

I'd like to know what everyone else thinks of this. Hope you enjoyed this.

TL;DR: To get into a top college, best method is *good* grades and test scores, exceptional ECs/Awards, great essays (exceptional not required) and to start early.

EDIT: Many people have said that preparing for college isn't really a great childhood, and I agree. But the point of this isn't getting into college. That's just a byproduct. What you figure out with this is what you love doing, what gets you outta bed in the morning, what you're passionate about. Learning more about all that and diving into what the world has to offer in that field... To me that's something wonderful and really fun. 

For example, I love CS and AI and ML. I realized this in my junior year summer, where I had an internship with a startup. I currently regret not taking the time from other summers doing research in a university program, taking cool CS classes at uni, or working on open-source projects. I regret not going to conferences and hackathons. I regret not attempting competitions to see how much I had to learn and what I could do with it. I wish I had worked on cool projects *before*, like that app I really want to do but I'm super busy at the moment. Freshman and sophomore years are years without the stress of college and applications and the future. I wish I had the time I lost, and I think what this 'guide' helps you do is make the most of what time you have. 

Also guys look:

&gt; would also tend to give you incredible experiences and make you a much more interesting person

&gt; most of your free time on this, and since you'd love it, you will have fun. 

&gt;  figure out what you love as early as possible by trying out new things.

What's not to love about those things? 

EDIT 2: Jeez, this is controversial."

The BA in Math/CS (school doesn't offer BS in CS for some reason) will allow me to graduate 1 semester earlier and it will cost less.

If you don't feel like reading it all skip to the tl;dr at the bottom.

I am currently a senior at George Washington University majoring in International Affairs. It's an undergrad program in the top 10 in the world, and I am on pace to graduate with a GPA somewhere in the 3.75-3.8 range.

The problem is that's not good enough. I have no chance of getting a job here in DC after I graduate unless I make it through some highly selective alternative to traditional employment, such as getting a Boren scholarship or volunteering in the Peace Corps. I don't believe I'm a competitive applicant for those programs for the same reason I'm not competitive for jobs: I lack work experience. I've interned the past two summers and did a work study one semester, along with working a non-intellectual summer job for a few years. However, none of these jobs or internships were specifically in my field. This pales in comparison to other students at my school, even those who aren't the most ambitious, and in international affairs work experience and connections are everything.

Unfortunately, I simply am not capable of interning during the semester and doing well at my schoolwork. I know now the reason I haven't been able to keep up throughout the years was undiagnosed ADHD. I also know that once I was diagnosed and put on medication this semester, no one prepared me for a side effect of spending way, way more time writing papers (think 10 hours a page even with an outline) - apparently this can happen if you're already detail-oriented and prone to perfectionism.

Intellectually, I know I shouldn't blame myself for not being able to maintain a busy schedule when I have a disability that directly affects time management.

I also know my self-worth shouldn't be based on grades. It shouldn't affect me to know people in my major who graduated with 3.8s while working and/or interning, but it does. It makes me feel absolutely worthless. I've never seen myself as a genius but I figured I was capable enough that if I struggled in a subject I'm good at, most people who are not geniuses would also struggle. Clearly this isn't the case if people can get GPAs equivalent to mine or better while doing 100 other activities. Being hard-working and intelligent are right below being a good person in terms of my identity and self-worth, and I'm being so outplayed by such a large group of people that it doesn't feel accurate to call myself either of those things any more. This problem relates to being a good person too. I didn't come into this field looking to become the Secretary of State or make a ton of money. I just wanted to study conflict and development and hopefully use that knowledge to make the world a slightly better place. Unfortunately tons of other students want that too, and thousands of them are better than me in every way an employer can measure. I've lost (or more accurately, am being crushed by the knowledge I never had) the chance to make even a small difference in the world in a field I'm passionate about, and I can't even be mad or jealous because plenty of my fellow students are perfectly nice and compassionate. I don't believe life overall is a zero-sum game, but at this stage of my life getting an entry-level job is. I don't have the goods, other people do, so I've lost.

Finally, I know you don't need a 3.8 GPA to stand a chance of getting anywhere after graduation. But I still feel I, personally, have absolutely no room for error. One bad sentence in one paper bumps me from an A to an A- in one class? There goes summa cum laude, which would prove I'm an exceptional student to grad schools thinking about whether to take me a few years from now (even the grad schools want a couple years of relevant work experience) or employers thinking about whether to give me a shot at an interview despite my lack of experience. My GPA is literally all I have to make me competitive, and even a 3.8 (not my current GPA and very unlikely to happen at this point) wouldn't put me over the people who have a 3.8+ and multiple publications, better work experience, and more. Anything under 3.8? Even worse.

At this point I think my only option (barring Peace Corps etc) will be to move outside of DC (where most of the best friends I've ever made will be living) and take a job in something unrelated to my field. It kills me to think about because I feel not only is that tantamount to failure, I'm never going to be able to make up the difference between me and the people above me. The fact that my fate could have been sealed in some way by getting a B in a class I took at 18 or by not pushing myself through an internship even if it meant sacrificing everything else (health, any social life at all, etc) kills me too. Now all I can do to try to make up for it is be as perfect as possible...which is incredibly, incredibly difficult at this stage in the game and is eating me alive.

**tl;dr: My above-average GPA is not exceptional enough to get me anywhere, and I don't have the work/internship experience necessary to succeed in a field where unpaid internships for people with Master's degrees are a dime a dozen. Please help me understand how to cope with the enormous pressure I feel to do well at academics - the one thing I know how to do - and help me see my life won't be over when I can't get a job after graduation.**"

However, there were a few who acted within their own belief systems and world views, therefore I could at least see their motivations despite not fully empathizing with them. With that said, if you were to make a list of specific characters that in your opinion were not only unlikable but lacked any redeeming qualities, who would you select? For me, they'd be:

- Thatcher - I completely understand that Ellis wasn't necessarily an easy person to try and spend your life with or raise a daughter with, but man, he was a jerk to Meredith even in adulthood, EVEN after Ellis passed away. And that slap over Susan's death...I loathed him for it. There has to be something deeply twisted in you to slap a woman like that in anger, especially your daughter. I don't care how sad the news was.

- Lucia - She was intentionally hurtful to Callie despite her own religious requirement to act with love. Her decision to reject her own daughter AND grandchild is so far outside my own view of acceptable. Callie was right, you can't pray away the gay.

- Ava/Rebecca - She wanted Alex so badly yet she pushed him away a lot. Then she comes back more than once and expects him to smother her with devotion and attention. The only good thing that came out of their toxic relationship was that it lead to Alex confessing to Izzie that he used to take care of his mother the same way he took care of Ava. But then again, that was a scene he shared with Izzie and not Ava.

- Minnick - Besides an extremely arrogant attitude, she consistently failed to act within the best interests of the people she was charged with caring for. She literally ran away from Edwards right after the death of a child. Rather than helping Stephanie and behave like a teacher, she ran off to cry.

- Sadie - An annoying intern who had no clue what she was doing. Rather than learn from her mistake, she was allowed to stay because of who her dad was and continued to struggle to keep up with her class.

- Hahn - Always wanted to come across as better than everyone else, and treated everyone poorly. She was also supposed to be a teacher, but instead spent the majority of her time inexplicably punishing Cristina.

- Leah - Continually disrupted people’s lives and was clearly unstable. Made a pointless return last season. Thankfully, it seems like the parking lot goblin got her."

I am trying to decide between transferring to Georgia Tech, Georgia Southern, and Kennesaw State University. I've almost completed the first two years of classes required for transfer while still in high school (I'm a senior). I really want to go to GT, and I'm pretty sure I'm a good candidate for them (I'm at a 3.37 cumulative GPA but my math and science GPA is around a 3.7), but they're pretty selective.

On the other hand, KSU and GSU are both ABET-accredited like GT, but obviously don't have the same brand reputation as GT. GSU has the advantage of being super close to where I live (southeast GA) and both of those schools are pretty affordable.

Which school should I go for, and will it ultimately matter in my future career?

Thank you! And also, I might be doing an engineering internship with Gulfstream by next spring, so would that possibly increase my chances of being admitted to GT?"
7fbvd6,0,2017-11-24,General question about symptoms,CityGirlSass,optometry,https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/7fbvd6/general_question_about_symptoms/,"Hi all.

*I want to start by saying I have seen an opthamalogist twice since August.*

Back in August of this year I started experiencing blurry vision in my left eye and having issues concentrating. At first I thought it was from eye strain since I spent a lot of time on a computer over the summer for work and internships. Best way to describe what I was feeling was that my left eye was compensating more than the right. I was having trouble moving my eye (left) from side to side or up without this weird pulling sensation.  I immediately made an appointment with the eye doctor, had my eyes dilated and nothing was seen and she said my eyes were completely healthy. 

This in turn caused major anxiety because I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me and why I felt so off. I even saw a neurologist due to the migraines I was experiencing and there was nothing seen there. Since then the migraines have stopped. 

I struggled with this vision issue and trouble concentrating all through September and finally in October it got better and I thought everything was fine. I needed to go back to the eye doctor to have my prescription done in order to get new glasses. Thank god I did, because I started seeing quite a bit of eye floaters which was totally new to me. They are clear and mostly noticed while outside or against white walls. 

My eyes were dilated again and once again nothing was seen with my eyes. She couldn’t even see my floaters. I’m 23 so she says that she cannot see them due to my fluid still being pretty intact. 

I accepted the floaters and I’ve been dealing with it. But for whatever reason the weird pulling sensation is still present in my left eye and I’ve noticed that the eye is often red and just uncomfortable. 

My main question is, could it be possible that all of this is tied together and is part of something bigger? Like Uveitis? Is it normal to have floaters at 23 accompanied with a pulling sensation and dull pain in the same eye? Is there something I can ask the eye doctor to look for or would she have noticed any sort of inflammation in my eyes when they were dilated? 

TLDR: I’ve been dealing with eye issues since August. Started with blurry vision and trouble concentrating (brain fog), followed by pain and discomfort when looking from side to side or up (left eye). Which then led to noticing more floaters in the left eye and having redness and discomfort.  Anything the eye doctor could be missing or could this be something more? Just looking for guidance and what to do next. "
7fc3ne,3,2017-11-24,Reneging on FT return offer concerns (while still working for them remotely),urgot88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7fc3ne/reneging_on_ft_return_offer_concerns_while_still/,"I interned at a large tech company last summer (not big N) and received an early return offer from them (was given in my last week, had two weeks to respond). At the time I accepted it and fully believed that I'd be returning, as I enjoyed my team and they offered me more than most new grads. My manager also got special approval for me to continue my internship remotely part-time, so I was thrilled. 

I applied to a few prestigious companies (mostly big Ns and unicorns) just for fun and surprisingly ended up with a lot of job offers, each of them offering far more than what this company is offering (which is still nothing to scoff at). I've pretty much made up my mind and plan on reneging, but I'm terrified of the conversation with my manager since she had to jump through so many hoops for me, so I've been procrastinating. I also want to keep my part-time job as long as possible, since it pays very well (and I can work in my PJs).

So, my questions are:

- How can I renege in the most polite and appreciative way? (I have a good relationship with my manager, and don't want her to hate me even though I don't plan on working there in the future)

- Can I tell her where I'm going, or is it possible that she will rat me out to them?

- What is the latest reasonable time to renege (so they can find someone to replace me), since I want to keep my remote job?"
7fcb3y,16,2017-11-24,Has anyone ever contemplated quitting their job?,KaDeCh,RantsFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantsFromRetail/comments/7fcb3y/has_anyone_ever_contemplated_quitting_their_job/,"As the title says, has anyone ever contemplated quitting their job? Did you say that you were going to put in a two weeks notice and then decided not to go through with it, only to get so mad/annoyed a couple days/weeks later that you said you were definitely going to quit?

Well, that's been my situation for the past 13 months. It hasn't been a huge thing that got me mad/annoyed. It's been small things like managers being hypocrites/strict, coworkers being bitches, empty promises, busy and stressful days, etc. By the way, I work in the Deli. 

In the 13 months I've been here, I've called out a total of 5 times, once in December 2016 (2nd month), once in July 2017, and 3 times on November 15, 22, and 24, 2017. Except for December, the times I've called out were because I was contemplating quitting. 

November 21st was my breaking point. Once I clocked out for the day, I told my mom I was using up all my sick time then putting in my two weeks notice. I've used half of my time these past two days and I was planning on using the other half next week then putting in my notice. 

Remember when I said ""empty promises"" above? Well, what I meant by that was me asking to be put in a different department and my manager said they would do that. I was in that other department for a total of two days in the span of two weeks. Then, I went on a pre-planned two week, unpaid, vacation. 

When I came back the 3rd of October, I noticed that I wasn't scheduled to be in the other department and I still haven't been scheduled to be in it since then. Also, at my performance review, my manager asked what departments am I interested in and they said they would put me in there come January but I doubt they'll do that. 

Also, I'm starting an IT internship in January, but 6 weeks feels like too much to stay at this job until I start. That's why I'm contemplating. I don't want to look for another job but I also don't want to go to this job working full time hours for the next 6 weeks. 

Anyone else ever feel a similar way?"

7fd3vg,62,2017-11-25,Got into an exclusive party at the Cannes Film Festival by pretending to be a young celebrity,SoManyFlamingos,ActLikeYouBelong,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActLikeYouBelong/comments/7fd3vg/got_into_an_exclusive_party_at_the_cannes_film/,"When I was 17 I took an internship at the Cannes Film Festival as a resume booster/experience. I had already been pretending to be an 18-year-old college freshman, since it was a college internship program and I was the only high schooler there, so when it came time to extend my fake identity I was already in deep enough to stay cool. 

After most of the big premiere nights, various clubs around the main festival area in Cannes will host exclusive parties thrown by large movie studios promoting their new films. This was back in the early 2010's. We were often gifted free tickets to premiers/screenings by the program and were told to bring tuxedos and formal attire since the larger screenings all had strict black tie dress codes. I'm a pretty good looking guy and have a well-defined face/jaw that I've been told resembles a fair number of male celebrities and in my tuxedo, I looked like someone straight out of the ""Hunger Games"" background cast.  So after a few drinks, I started to get cocky and thought I'd try my hand at convincing a nightclub guard that I was a celebrity in town for a premiere to get into an exclusive party. 

A few buddies and I had already had a little fun pretending to be ""celebrities"" and ""paparazzi"" by staging fake news scrums and photo shoots in crowded streets to see if we could convince the local media / star seekers and it had worked much better than we'd expected. So I downed another beer, grabbed another actor-looking friend and started to plan. Basically, we figured if we grabbed two of the best looking girls we'd met in the program and just waltzed straight past the lines to the front -- acting like we belonged -- we could schmooze our way past the guards and into the hottest party of the night. I won't say which production company it was but their namesake owner/founder has recently come under fire in the media... 

So with ladies on each arm, the 4 of us strolled straight past the line of people waiting to outside the club and up to the first guard in a line of security. We didn't speak any French, and they didn't speak much English, but we had memorized the names of several prominent Hollywood agents who we knew were in town and told the guards we were up-and-coming actors who's agents were waiting for us inside. We even made up a fake Cannes-sounding film name for added insurance. Amazingly, we were let through the first line of defense without question, and continued on towards the next line, past a line of international paparazzi. 

Now me being pretty drunk thought it would be hilarious to approach each of the reporters and give impromptu interviews about my ""new movie"" premiering at the festival. I made sure to laugh a lot and make a scene of having a good time with the reporters to draw as much attention to myself as possible. Somewhere out there, there's probably some footage of 17-year-old me talking about how great of a director Cameron Crowe is on a Malaysian news site, which I've always found funny. 

After that, the next two sets of guards breezed us right through the line, assuming we were just a couple of young stars they'd never heard of. Soon enough, we were up to the last checkpoint and came face to face with the head of PR / promotions for the company. Trying my best to keep my cool, I calmly dropped the name of my ""agent"" and mentioned that he needed us inside to meet with another producer about a project and that'd we'd been distracted by these girls at another bar. She glanced down at her clipboard, gave us a once-over, asked for our names again and then unhooked the velvet rope and ushered us inside. We spend the rest of the night drinking complimentary champagne and rubbing elbows with the stars there. Never got caught. 

TL;DNR a friend and I posed as up-and-coming actors, complete with ""model dates"" to get into an exclusive Cannes party.

7fd7h0,1,2017-11-25,[Debt] [Budgeting] Funds are drying up. Credit cards are close to max. About to be unemployed.,DumbCollegeGradMan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7fd7h0/debt_budgeting_funds_are_drying_up_credit_cards/,"I am a 21-year-old independent student and have no ties to family, therefore I do not have the will, nor ability, to ask family for funds.  I need help, advice, etc. budgeting and tackling some bills before I graduate. 

I will be done with school in May 2018. As of right now, I have an internship that will officially start on January 5th. However, I have come in on my days off to help out and learn a few things here and there. Since I have been doing that, the firm said they would hire me on when I graduate as a paralegal. 

I had a huge hiccup in finances a couple months ago. My truck ended up being totaled, not at fault, and I had to get a rental during this time. The “reimbursement” for my truck pretty much paid for the rental unfortunately. 

I finally had enough and put $3500 on a credit card as down payment for a used car with low mileage and decent fuel economy (Truck got 8 city/15 highway and this car gets 18 city/30 highway). 20/20 hindsight should have never bought the car and should’ve bought another beater.  

Following that, my area had a “historic flood” which flooded my new to me car. I had to pay a deductible of a $1000.00 from my savings (I haven’t had an accident since I was 15 so I didn’t lower my comprehensive deductible, again 20/20 hind sight). Insurance went up by $9 dollars the following month because of this, they didn’t total the car, but they replaced carpet and what not and now it’s a flood car instead of a no accident car. 

Attached to all of that are the hours I had to take off work, and the rental I had while my car was being fixed which came out to a lovely $697.39. Unfortunately, I did not opt for the rental coverage, again 20/20 hindsight. The deductible and rental wiped my savings dry. 

Another problem I have at the moment is that the internship, which is required per university requirements, is 9-5 Mon-Thurs and 9-12 on Fridays and is unpaid. I usually work a part time job that brings in around $300 (plus or minus $50) dollars every 2 weeks. 

When the internship officially starts I will have to pay bills and other expenses. The employment hunt still continues, but I am focusing on budgeting and making it till January when I will get a refund check for my loans. 

Here is my current break down of student loan return, checking, savings, and debt:

School Loan Return (will receive the second/third week in January)- $5,475

Checking: $220

Savings: $0

Credit Card 1: 
Outstanding Balance - $2605/3100
Minimum Due Dec 7th - $0
Interest – 19.15%
Cash Advance – 24.99%

Credit Card 2:
Outstanding Balance - $5175/6000
Minimum Due Dec 17th - $133.00
Interest – 20.24%
Cash Advance – 25.99%
Balance Transfer – 20.24%

Credit Card 3: 
Outstanding Balance - $1171/3900
Minimum Due Dec 7th - $75
Interest – 0% if paid off in 13 months

Credit Card 4:
Outstanding Balance - $0/5900 (Paid Off)
Balance Transfer Offer – 14.99% with one time 3% Charge


Here is a breakdown of my monthly expenses:

Rent + Utilities - $685 (Due Dec 1st and can use a credit card to pay)
Spotify bundled with Hulu – $5.33 (Due Dec 1st)
Cellphone - $48.40 (Due 15th)
Insurance - $104.42 (Due Dec 15th)
Car Payment - $262.04 (Due Dec 22nd)
Renters Insurance – 12.06 (Due Dec 22nd)
Gas - $50
Food - $250
Miscellaneous - $50

TOTAL – Approximately $1470.00

Other notes:

I have to buy more professional clothes for the internship so this is another expense I will have to make soon. I’ve been trying Goodwill and thrift stores but I am 6’5 with a 40 waist and 32-34-inch inseam. I’ve got a huge chest (about 60 inches), Large neck at 18 inches and long arms so all the button downs don’t fit right unfortunately. I have only been able to find 2 shirts and 1 pair of pants so far in the past 3 months. I also need a pair of dress shoes as well.

I will luckily be pulling a full 40-hour work week for one week before my place of work closes for the holiday (20th-31st). I currently make $7.85 an hour. 

I am looking for a higher paying job, I have one lined up that is 10 dollars an hour for Friday and Saturday 10pm till 7am. However, the search continues. 

I know I have been irresponsible with the purchasing of the car and I wish I had not made so many poor purchase decisions in the past. However, I have never missed a payment and all three credit cards (from 3 different banks) have given me a FICO score between 666- 683 (Although 666 popped up twice, lucky me).

My lease is up in July, however, I found someone to rent from me May 15th –July 31st. I will be finding a cheaper place then. I have spoken to the people who my car loan is through and it can be lowered interest wise from 9.6% (Remaining balance of 13,435.01) to a lower rate in a month. 

My health insurance is $1240.00 (Due a week after I get my loans), however, I can get a “refund” for that through the school that will be returned to me about a month and half later. 

I am selling all of my fishing poles, some tools that I can part with, speakers, stereo, pictures, etc. to get some extra cash. I have everything I own in my apartment, and it kind of hurts to see some things go knowing this is all I have. The only thing that I’m still highly contemplating is my box of Lego. I haven’t used/played with them in about 7 years, but they brought me joy growing up and I would want my kid (currently single as no funds to date) to have them. I priced some of the sets, and the weight of the bulk and I could bring in around $1000 to $1800 for them. This doesn’t include shipping, eBay and PayPal Fees. I would sell them as a means to keep me off the street only. Other than that, I don’t have to many other assets. Mainly TV, Xbox, Laptop, Phone, Headphones, books, and some things I picked up from trips that mean a lot to me but are worthless.  

School loans total currently around $35,000 and will be around the $40,000 mark when I graduate. All loans are through the government.

These Numbers will Change:
Sub – $16,250 
UnSub – $16,734 
Current unpaid interest - $1204.65 (Interest rates vary depending on which loan)

Again, I am looking for advice, guidance, help, and so forth.  My parents were horrible with money and I swore I wouldn’t end up like them. I know I have made poor financial decisions in the past, I am looking for the path to financial security till I get a more permanent job and I can really start tackling debts and planning for the future.

So, short background: I obtained an intern position at my school district's IT department, doing IT in all the schools, and tech support, of course, comes along with that. Also short aside that it's entertaining that the Tech Director has asked me how to do things like Group Policy and the like, so that's always fun. 

On to the actual story.

One day a few months ago, a teacher we will call random econ teacher or **$RET** submitted a ticket into {Fairly popular ticketing system} (not sure if I can use names of software/infra). I decided to head down to **$RET**'s room after school that afternoon to see what might be causing this issue. Of course, it took an impossibly long amount of time to even login, considering many of our faculty are running on slow Dell OptiPlex machines with Core 2 Duos or Core i5s with like 2GB RAM, which is barely enough to *boot* Windows 7, let alone run it *acceptably*. So, after waiting a very, very long time, I got into network diagnostics and waited. And waited... you get the picture. Eventually, network diagnostics told me there wasn't a cable plugged in. So, naturally, I *again* checked the cable, and sure enough it was plugged in. I checked the wall, and the same outcome. So, I replaced the cable and all was well. 

You might be wondering what was wrong with the cable. Well, after running the length of the cable I discovered that either a rat chewed partially through it and cut 3 of the 6 wires, or that some jerk HS student used a knife and cut through some of the cables. Pick your poison.

TL;DR: Teacher submitted a ticket saying her internet wasn't working, replaced cable, found sever in the original cable that was either caused by rat or by student with a knife. Go figure."
7fdg9q,19,2017-11-25,Its been 6 month since I left. Whats life like after?,shelbycanreddit,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/7fdg9q/its_been_6_month_since_i_left_whats_life_like/,"Six months ago I broke the vicious and abusive cycle I was wrapped up in with my uBPDex. If I can suggest anyone who has contemplated leaving their relationship but feel to far buried in this shit storm let me tell you your judgment and esteem is clouded by their disordered perception of the world. You may feel so helpless now but imagine a world where you feel total control of your power and emotions. Thats the side after abuse. 

But then again , I'm reminded that protecting myself is still a constant and fundamental task i maintain. A skill that seems to come so easy and second nature to others but for me, I lack certain skills to set boundaries and respect myself and thus i found myself in a relationship like one with a BPD. Someone that will manifest your entire wellbeing before you even think of setting boundaries. I ended up in a relationship with my ex for a reason. Its important to realize that after the healing has far from ended.

On a brighter note, Im doing exceptionally well following my breakup. I spent the summer months abroad talking time for myself and developing my own skills such as my Spanish and networking for future work following my post-grad.

Im currently interning for the child protective services agency in my state. My senior year of my bachelors has been filled with learning about human socialization and protecting the welfare of others and communities. I've particularly studied a lot on what happens to a child's brain when they are around domestic violence. Even if you think they don't know what happens, they do. the first five year of life are crucial for developing healthy emotion control, decision making and forming relationships with other. None of these skills are displayed as model behavior by a pwBPD. Please, if anything get out before your children are hurt. Your partner is hurting you because they don't know how else to manage their pain. You can end the pain and not pass it to others. I just thought I would throw that out there.  Just six months ago i was suffering in a relationship that was headed in the direction of the pain inflicted families i work with in my internship and today I know I would never be able to survive my job if I was still with my ex and Im proud of myself for ending this spreading of pain. I've healed, I plan to keep healing. And now, I hope to help others heal. But the first step is ending the long line of pain.

I wrote earlier what I've noticed happen to myself a month after abuse and now six months after abuse i'm happy to share even more happy changes. 

My life is no longer consumed with thoughts of my ex or processing what I had endured in my relationship!- This is so freeing. To go days without thinking of my ex or the things he said or did to me. I give my credit to time and being honest with my emotions from the beginning. I allowed myself to mourn over the lost idea of a relationship that was never really there and I have reached acceptance.

I no longer feel exhausted.- At some point at the end of the relationship I was constantly fatigued but never did anything. Im an avid long distance runner that had gone several months without running, I couldn't find energy to do my simple basic tasks like grocery shopping or going to class. I only later realized it was the constant fighting and attacking that would mentally drain me&gt; Your body isn't designed to be in crisis mode ever day. Its exhausting.

I speak up for myself.- I no longer am scared to fight for what I feel is right. My life used to be centered around serving and accommodating everyone around me and I need to find a more selfish balance than that.

I still NEVER cry.- I mentioned this before but this is still huge. I don't remember the last time I cried. Im not a crier but for the whole year in my relationship i cried almost every day. Weird what one person can do to you. 

I am not fully healed. -I don't know if you are ever fully healed but i sure know I'm not there yet. Ive stayed out of a relationship and plan to for more time. But my few romantic flings so far I already see bad patterns in myself come back. I can't find boundaries to set. I can do pretty well speaking or advocating but around boys I like I cannot speak my mind. I let boys let me down (over much smaller things but still). Its these small recognitions that help me realize Im not ready for another relationship and still need a whole lotta healing. but im working on it.

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

7fdjst,13,2017-11-25,"There is too much bull shit posturing, and almost no real value any more",Murpett,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7fdjst/there_is_too_much_bull_shit_posturing_and_almost/,"I've become really fucking annoyed with the current culture of posturing surrounding success lately. To a large extent, I believe in putting action before words, but every other person seems to believe otherwise, it seems. I work in the Software/Finance field, so this is pretty fucking common for me to see. Here are a few observations of the bullshit I've seen:

The ""self-taught"" idiot:
So many god damn 'self-taught' investors and programmers lately, who wear 'self-taught' like it's some kind of badge of honour that shows their self-teaching abilities make them as smart as Einstein. Sometimes there are good self-taught programmers and finance people. But 99% of the time, they're just programmers who learned one set of tools, or finance people who turned a profit during the greatest bull markets in history (but still can't calculate a dividend yield without investopedia). I had one client who works in the music industry try to get in to running a Blockchain project - the latest software fad - even though he had 0 knowledge of software, and claimed he would ""learn on the job"" while running the project. 

The resume-padder:
During university, there were so many people who were trying to hack their resumes. They would strategically take extracurriculars, go to networking events, and network on LinkedIn. You know what they didn't do? Actually do valuable work. The finance resume-padders couldn't hold a conversation about their thoughts on market valuations, and the CS resume-padders couldn't finish a single challenge on HackerRank. 

The Life-Advice'er
I read and listen to a lot of people who give life philosophy. But Thai Lopez and Gary Vaynerchuk are just motivational tools that give you shallow, generic advice for success, without making you address actual habits. But the worst people are those that are 21 and posting career advice on LinkedIn, and I've seen it multiple times. 

The Risk-Taker:
These are your wannabe entrepreneurs and ""high-risk"" investors. They don't do due-dilligence, or invest in fundamentals - they just chase whatever looks like it will make them rich. They don't actually care about creating a product or service. I worked an internship with one guy who was *convinced* he would retire by 30. He would start a company, make millions, and retire. He didn't have an idea for a product or service, just a delusional level of self confidence. Don't even get me started on crypto currency and ICO ""investors"". 

I'm just annoyed. Everybody thinks they're so great that they lead with bullshit and sometimes follow up with substance. I really wish people would just keep their fucking mouths shut until they actually accomplish something.

Problem is, as I went on with the process, problem just seems to appear out of the blue, stretching the time needed to get the visa. Another problem is, all my calculations told me I’d spend at least 1000 euros on this but now it’s closely to the 1500. I am very worried because I don’t think I will get the visa in time and my employer will be highly disappointed - and rightly, mad at me. Plus, there’s always the possibility that I will invest all that and will not get the visa. 
If I tell him I’m sorry and I quit now, will he be more or less mad than if I quit when I don’t get the visa?
I’ve don’t know what to do, I’ve been having several panic attacks throughout the day "

7ffs18,1,2017-11-25,It ended when I started to focus on creating my own happiness,trwwy321,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/7ffs18/it_ended_when_i_started_to_focus_on_creating_my/,"I was one of those folks that never had a friend of the opposite sex, they were merely acquaintances and classmates. I went through K-12 and college without ever experiencing the “normal” milestones such as going to school dances (no one ever asked me nor I asked anyone) or going on dates. I never kissed, held hands, or really any physical thing with the opposite sex.

I remember thinking, “Surely there is something wrong with *me* since even the weirdo people could find a boyfriend/girlfriend.” It didn’t help that I was quite depressed in high school and constantly wanting to die. 

College was a tad bit better when it came to socializing, but I was a commuter student and never was in a large group of friends like those that lived on campus.

Life for me started after college. I think enough was enough and I wanted *change*. I remember seeing this cheesy motivational magnet in a store, “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I’m like god damn it, I want to do something I would never in a million years consider doing—I don’t want to be boring anymore. If I’m going to be single forever, at least I want to live a life filled with adventures.

At age 21, I decided to apply for internships that were out of state (I’ve never lived anywhere but at home with my parents), and I moved across the country. Was it scary? Fuck yes, my anxieties were through the roof, but it was also liberating. 

This newfound freedom and newfound spirit I didn’t know was within me motivated me to apply to serve overseas with the Peace Corps. I left my family and my comfort zone to go live in West Africa for 2 years where I met some of the most lively individuals. I had six months left of service and I ended up meeting a fellow volunteer and just decided to strike a conversation with them, thinking nothing will probably come of it. For the first time in my life, I felt an actual connection with somebody—an actual thing called *chemistry*. Side note: I was a 24 year old virgin and so were they. We didn’t find this out till later. Suffice to say, we were both was highly inexperienced when it came to anything bedroom-related because we’ve never done a single thing before (except knowing what porn is like). 

It’s been 3 years later and I’m still with them, we’ve been planning on getting married. All I know is that I was hopeless and felt like I was never going to find someone, but things really do fall into place when I least expected it."

I’ve just really been overthinking things especially from what my wife says. I don’t know, it just feels kind of like I can’t get my bearings straight.

It’s hard to make sense right now in my head because I have a lot of different thoughts going through it.

I’ve been specifically getting more anxious at night lately but I think it might be part of this break.

I’ve also been getting upset about things that I perceive is unexpected and not being able to hold a good conversation about it. This intern is led me to be really critical of my wife and things like that.

It’s also been really hard to orient myself to my current schedule since I don’t have anything set in stone I’m doing. It’s driving me bonkers.

I’ve also recently got done listening to an audible series and that makes me feel especially empty.

My eating has been thrown off because of all the Thanksgiving food and being around the house more.

In general I just feel really anxious and overwhelmed. I know it’s going to get better it just feels kind of like it’s going to explode right now.  I felt like this would be a better avenue to talk about the stuff rather than Facebook. It’s a little more anonymous, even though I know people can look at my post history when I post to other sub Reddit‘s.

As a little background: I've got an Associate's and a Bachelor's of Music. I found out a little late that I've got a real love for the various topics in EE and CS, and I've decided to return to school to get a degree in computer engineering. I'm currently in CT with my girlfriend as she gets her master's from Yale and I've got two options:

1) Head to the University of New Haven starting this spring. I've been awarded the largest possible merit scholarship and would be able to do everything in 6 - 7 semesters due to transfer credits. But, this being a private university, I'd be shelling out close to $10,000 a semester. So I'd be looking at a $60,000 to $70,000 education.

2) Wait a semester, continue my self studies, and head to a local CC next fall to get my Associate's in Engineering; something I could do in two semesters for in-state tuition (a total of $4,000). From there, I'd then transfer to University of Connecticut for $6,000 a semester and end up saving between $30,000 and $40,000.

Obviously option 2 makes more sense money-wise. But I've got some concerns. Will being at a big university for only 2 years hurt my internship opportunities? Will the inability to take advantage of all of UConn's electives be detrimental? I'd love to get a master's afterwards - would my options be hampered by this path? Are there any obvious downsides to either option that I'm missing?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Hoping to get some advice.,N6723P,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7fg216/thinking_about_taking_the_leap_into/,"Okay, I am going to be general and keep this as ambiguous as possible for obvious reasons, but here is some back story: 

I am 26, living in a mid-sized metropolitan area, working for an ad agency, making between 45,000 and 52,000/yr. Used to be solely a graphic designer, but have since grown my skill set from solely graphic design into motion, video, web, and more. I've even concepted and art directed a few commercials for broadcast. 

I have a slightly better title now, but I'm still paid like a junior to mid level creative. I've always wanted financial freedom, and feeling under appreciated makes me want to chase it even more. 

I've been within my cities marketing and ad  community for about 6 years, starting as an intern in a small marketing team, to recently being the lead creative on a major cultural institution. 

Something I've noticed, unanimously with every client I've ever worked with is, they are simply incapable of having marketing that keeps up with the pace of culture. There are maybe, at most, a handful of local companies who actually have good branded content, and even less who have a worth-while social presence. It's a huge gap, and in my opinion there is a lot of money to be made. 

Small companies are forced into a decision - pay a social media consultant between 30-50 grand a year to make often subpar level content, or hire an agency and pay huge prices for quality work that comes comes at a very slow pace.  

So, you see tons of small businesses with generic and tasteless social media content, because they are limited by the skills of the social media coordinator of an in-house branding team. 

Or you see companies working with an agency who's process slows down internal teams and hugely inflates the cost for simple services, oftentimes competing with the work an internal team does and muddying the brand's identity. 

With so many companies struggling to do social the right way, there is a hole to fill. I want to take the skills that I have, creating quality, multidisciplinary content, design, editing, social media coordination, etc. and combine them with the skills of my close friends - organization, photography, videography, account management, and create a content studio. 

A content studio focused on giving small and regional business the ability to have consistent high quality branded content that actually works and creates engagement. That actually adds value to the day to day cultural conversation. That acts like an arm of the internal team rather than a separate entity. 

I want to work the way of a typical agency, but much more nimble, working on set monthly rates or on a project by project basis. Cutting timely, costly, and unnecessary parts of the approval process, in order to work at the speed that 2017 demands. 

I want to offer brand managers an option that offers both high quality content and quick turn around. Give them options outside of hiring an internal social person, or an outside agency. 

However, I know nothing about a business plan. All I know is that I think I have all the pieces to build something successful. I just want to make sure I build from a foundation of concrete, and I'm willing to take it slow. 

I don't care to be a millionaire next month. I mean I wouldn't be mad about it, but that's beside the point. 

Hoping to see maybe some other similar posts, or complete how-to's, etc. Or if my idea is idiotic I suppose that would be helpful as well at this time. 





TL:DR:
I want to create a content studio, to give small to mid level businesses the ability to create quality, multi disciplinary content without the high costs and long deadlines of external agencies. 

But I don't know anything about starting a business.

7fgkgb,2,2017-11-25,Crush's friends are badmouthing me. Help!,shanky2304,AskMenAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/7fgkgb/crushs_friends_are_badmouthing_me_help/,"This could be long so sit tight guys. I am in the penultimate semester of my college and just got back from a 6 months internship at a bigshot firm, where I managed to get a full time offer as well. I'm 21[M] , 5'11"", average looking and kinda skinny. 

This needs some background story, in my first semester I started texting a girl in my class. I was just getting to know her to see the potential there but soon I realized she was too immature and frankly kinda dumb, so I kept chatting but almost completely shut down the casual flirting. In time, she started pushing me to ask her out, so I told her upfront I have no such intentions. She flipped on me and forced me into a situation where I had to diss her and I think I told her she wasn't intellectual enough for me(pretty shitty thing to say, right?).
Anyway she mocked me and told me about some girl who is super intellectual I should try on her(this girl barely talked to any guy, let's call her Machli ). After a month I got into a relationship with machli(obviously the girl who told me about her was pretty mad at this point ) which lasted for little more than a year. After that, I completely gave in to studies and focussed on my grades. I got selected for that internship and went away for 6 months.

Now I'm back most of my friends have atleast one job offer but frankly the companies aren't that good and more than 80% of them pay 4 times less than what I'm being offered. I'm cool with that but everyone else ain't most of my old friends can't have a proper dialogue with me. I understand that it might be difficult for them but I try my best to keep it on the low. So now with nothing to do for the next 6 months I'm thinking about dating again, I heard that a girl who I kinda had a crush on recently became single but I never had conversation with her earlier and since I was so low-key after the first semester, I had doubt if she even knew about me.

I got in touch via social media and everything was going well, until she asked me my branch and section. She probably asked around about me and next thing I know I'm blocked! Yep guys, turns out she has the same friend circle as the girl I was texting in the first semester, although she herself isn't around turns out she badmouthed me pretty intensely and apparently conjured up stories about how I had ""used"" her. So my crush's current friends are pretty anti-me, they told her how I'm a not a good person and I fuck up other people's lives and move on(apparently that break-up with machli caught too much traction) . Some of them are from my section and are quite obviously butt hurt that I did better than them. My crush herself hasn't done particularly well in the campus recruitment, but has an offer. Anyhow, she thinks I'm a complete douche and won't talk to me.

I tried routing through my other female friends but she isn't in their circle. One of my female friends told me that she heard she's a gold digger and shit but then why would she have a problem with my alleged character? What are my options now? How can I reason with her? "

7fhic0,273,2017-11-25,[Text] My best advice for turning your life around,FreakyCheeseMan,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/7fhic0/text_my_best_advice_for_turning_your_life_around/,"
So, first, why you might possibly want to listen to me: Five years ago I'd flunked out of college, been fired from the only shitty jobs I could get, I was broke, I was at the north end of obese (over 240 pounds), I was kind of an asshole, and I was sleeping on the floor of my mother's laundry room, spending pretty much all day on video games or the internet.

Since then I went back to college, drug my GPA from a 1.83 to a 3.05, finished a good internship, finished my undergraduate degree and started grad school. I've brought my weight down to under 180, I've traveled to three continents, hiked for five days to Macchu Picchu and spent a week on hallucinogens in the Amazon. I did this while taking care of both of my parents as, one after the other, they got diagnosed with cancer and died.

 Proudest of all (for me), my best friend is pregnant and named me the godfather, in the serious ""backup parent"" sense of the word. I went from full-on NEET to ""Guy you'd trust to raise your child.""

Okay, enough about me - here's a mix of my best advice and encouragement, for anyone trying to get their shit together.

* First, the big one: Do not worry about how long it will take. It won't. The time it will take to go from utter shit to feeling good about yourself? One day. If you're in a better place today than you were yesterday, you're winning.
* Humility is key. I'm gonna repeat this one over and over, because there's so many different ways it's true. A big part of self improvement is accepting that you're not trying to be the best, you're trying to be better than you are. I think this is one of the ways video games are unhealthy - so many of them put us in the role of the singular hero, so even the impressive things we could do in real life don't seem so impressive. Don't go to the gym thinking about ripped abs and girls swooning at the sight of you, go to the gym thinking about being less out of breath at the top of a flight of stairs.
* Your life is just this moment, every moment. Stop for one hamburger on the way home? You're not dieting, you're getting fat. Do one homework on time? You're becoming a scholar. Don't try to measure what you're doing now against the bulk of all the things you'll do or have done at other times: What you're doing with this moment is what you're doing with your life.
* It's not about willpower. A lot of you are going to disagree with me on this one, I think, but for me it's been true. I've never gotten anywhere by setting my teeth and trying harder. What's mattered has been recognizing my own mistakes, changing as a person through experiences, changing my motivations and building external structures and supports. I don't think I've ever done anything other than what was natural for me at the time, it's just that what was natural changed.
* Humility is key. A proud person will turn away from what works, because they think they should be able to do it the ""purer"" way. The first good choice I made when getting my life together was to move in with my father to go back to college rather than try to stand on my own two feet. My getting into shape accelerated a lot when I got a personal trainer, because I get more done when I have someone else to keep my honest and on track. If I'd stood by my pride, I'd be clinging to it with nothing to be proud *of*. I recognize that not everyone has these options - in a lot of ways I'm pretty damn privileged - but when you do have advantages, use them.
* Don't worry about being older. I won't lie, there's a touch of sadness when I think about all the time I wasted; it'd be nice to be starting into my mid-twenties with the advantages I've got now, rather than inching up on my thirties. That said, at the same time I like being a touch older and calmer than most of my peers, and and I'm proud that I could still turn things around this late (even though it's not all that late, as lives go.) I remember listening to a personal trainer talk about working with old people, and seeing a sixty-year old woman do her first pushup ever; believe me, she was happier about it than a twenty year old would be. Improvement is its own reward, it's not about how long you'll get to spend being improved.
* Humility is key. Pride is fragile; it can't stand to be tested where it might fail, and any failure strings and makes it retreat. If you're humble, you can fail utterly at what you think you're best at in life and not lose your stride. Pride demands excuses for failure, and excuses cover up the need for improvement: ""I did badly. How can I do better?"" is the only reaction you need. To quote a line from The Expanse, ""The magic word is 'Whoops.'""
* You've gained more than you probably think, even from ""wasted"" years.     Part of why I have an easy time in school is that I spent so long failing at it, I know exactly what things I need to be worried about and can direct my attention there. I've been every kind of asshole there is, and that makes it easier to be patient and empathetic with difficult people. All the times I've been misunderstood are reminders to listen twice to other people, rather than get angry/dismissive of what I *thought* they meant. Even just the really shitty days I've had provide a contrast to the good ones I can have now, and mean I don't have to be afraid; I know what I can come back from.
* Humility is key. This can be a tough one to accept, but please do: You have ideas that are holding you back. There's something, probably a lot of somethings, that you believe about yourself or about the world that are either wrong or just not helpful. Be ready to walk away from something you've spent years believing. As a mental exercise, I try to go into every argument with the assumption that I'm wrong, and just try to understand *how*.
* Be a good person. I wouldn't have made it through my parents deaths if I didn't believe I deserved to. I wouldn't have invested myself if I didn't think it was a worthwhile project. You should be humble, you should recognize your mistakes and your need to improve, but you should like yourself as a person, and that means being a good guy. "

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

7fjhi7,1,2017-11-25,"Saving for a car, when to actually purchase?",GrapesEnjoyPeople,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7fjhi7/saving_for_a_car_when_to_actually_purchase/,"Hi!

I have been really wanting a car. I currently don’t have one, and after research, I am interested in purchasing a new car that costs around $22,000 USD. 

I have decided that I do not want to get an old car that only costs a few thousand, as I would likely have to put in money for repairs ( I have had two cars in the past, each over 20 years old, one completely broke down after a year and the other gave me trouble until I sold it when I first went to college). Additionally, many used cars for sale in my area are not as good in the snow or on dirt roads which is a must.  If I am going to invest in a car I would like one that will last many years. When doing my research I found some used cars that I would like for around $18,000, but I feel it would be worth the extra money to get the exact car that I want. 

I am a college student and do not have a stable job, and have to get a new job for summers and often for new semesters. I am looking to find internships for summer or higher paying stable jobs throughout the school year. However, as I lack transportation, I am limited to only look for jobs on my schools campus, which usually pay around $9/hr, where other easy to get jobs (fast food, etc. that are always hiring) off of campus pay around $12/hr.  Additionally having my own transportation will likely improve my summer options.

My parents are helping to pay my student loans, and will help pay for a car instead if I decide to go that route.

Additionally, I have about $5,000 in savings that I could put towards the car.

Getting a car is a goal for the future and I understand I cannot go out and get it today, however, I am interested in any advice on how to make my goal a reality.

My question is how much should I be making per month before getting this car is a viable option? Should I put more into savings to have a larger down payment? What is the best way to budget for this purchase, and all the insurance and gas and other payments that come along with it? Is getting a car a bad financial option? Any advice?



Thanks!

EDIT: Clarification 

EDIT: I have seen quite a few people comment explaining that I am not in a position to afford this car right now. Thank you guys for trying to make sure I don’t get in over my head with a giant loan I can’t afford!
However, I am hoping for advice on how to save up for this car and how to get myself into a financial position where I could afford the car. 

Additional helpful information: I will be graduating in 2 years after which I will have a stable income of around $65-75k.
My parents are willing to co-sign the loan and help with the car and insurance payments if I decide to get the car. We should not have a problem getting a car loan, I am more worried about the payments of said loan. Also, if they do help with the car, they will stop helping with school loans. None of my school loans require payments until after I graduate, and they have an interest rate of about 4%. I am not knowledgeable enough in loans to know what the best option is.

Thanks for your help!"
7fjj6h,1,2017-11-25,"Mormon Doctrine subreddit first post Observations discussing The relationship in development of Mormon Doctrine, Church History and Apologetics.",DodgerGame,MormonDoctrine,https://www.reddit.com/r/MormonDoctrine/comments/7fjj6h/mormon_doctrine_subreddit_first_post_observations/,"Well fellow Reddit participants we have a fairly new sub here possibly patterned at least in part after some other subs we have participated in.

If you are one who says I know nothing of any other subreddit or of reddit in general, then perhaps you are one who tends to watch some of the videos on the Dodger Game channel where I've mentioned this subreddit of Mormon Doctrine several times in videos  I produced in the last week after having discovered it. 

If that is the case I encourage you to explore this subreddit because it seems to have a lot of very well sourced information as I have stated in the last couple of days in my regular YouTube uploads regarding Mormonism. 


If you'd prefer to take it easy and have me read this post combined with the continuation and post to just click on the YouTube link here and listen to it in its entirety. https://youtu.be/CJXw8zG_tiM

As most of us are well aware of the protocol we might find in a fast and testimony meeting at church we see that there is a certain set of guidelines promoting the bearing of testimony as the major focus of the meeting, however we also find that new members or visitors to a ward are encouraged to introduce themselves at the onset of their moments at the podium.  I'm not sure just how much that is encouraged here and I'm just going to briefly say that after extensive study of the history of the Church, America and the world, although I'm sure not every aspect by a long shot. However finding I was more apt to understand Truth by locating primary source documents or as close to that as I could find in all of these areas, I have noted that the truth tended to be quite different from what correlated materials would teach me, either within the church or within a nation or regarding world history.  

On New Year's Day of this year 2017 I uploaded my first YouTube video regarding the subject matter of church history Doctrine Etc I adopted the YouTube handle of dodgergame which is also the same handle I use here on Reddit which I recently discovered about 4 months ago. 

 I discovered this particular subreddit through the perusal of the Mormon subreddit where Pedantic God posted an invitation to come on down and check out a posting that he had made on the subject of judgment within the context of Mormon Doctrine, presumably the book Mormon Doctrine by Doctrine McConkie.  I commented without having read the community information and was perhaps a little abrasive in what I said as compared to what one might hear from the pulpit to the ears of a true believing member of the church. 

 As requested I smoothed it out a bit in certain areas which were pointed out as concerns through certain individuals interested in creating an atmosphere where all can feel welcome, if that's possible and it may or may not be but we're going to try.

Having said that I'll just say that I felt that there was a need to express some views and shed some light on church history and developing doctrines and practices within the LDS church in a format that might reach some people who might not otherwise be as effectively or easily&amp; QUICKLY.  informed through the written word. That Medium was through video uploads and so far has pretty much been on YouTube. 

I'm not the greatest with the written word.

 My grammar is not the best and I've had extreme difficulty with text errors from either voice to text or predictive texting Technologies to go along with my run on sentence issues to start with.  So the format that I chose in order to disseminate information that I deem valuable and important as well as some that I don't actually tend to see on a lot of our written formats is as I stated the video format, for which I have probably done a good 270 uploads this year covering just about everything involved with the subjects within the context of Mormonism. A few of those videos about 60 I think are on my other channel called Mormon truth videos some of which are redundant to the Dodger game channel and often slightly reworked hopefully improved.

So that's really where I make my main contribution to the subject of Mormonism however I do post or have posted a fair amount on Reddit and commented as well in various subreddits and I encourage people who locate my contributions of the video nature through Reddit posts to feel free and comment in both platforms so as to encourage success and interaction on both platforms and as I have stated earlier I specifically have mentioned to those viewing my uploads to come check out this particular subreddit for its high quality level of content and discussion so far as I have found it to be in my brief experience in Mormon Doctrine subreddit.  So there's my hello and I'll now head into the direction of what I wanted to talk about in my first post I apologize if I I'm not super condensed in communicating ideas in as few written words as is humanly possible but if you forgave Moroni if you're being not so hot in writing perhaps you can forgive me as well?

I see that the CES letter is mentioned in one of the posts here from the CES letter is not just Doctrine in itself it is not just church history and itself the CES letter is a document I would say that is designed to bring into one place a large number of concerns Within the history and developing doctrine of the church that tend to be either difficult or impossible to reconcile to the assertion that an all-knowing unchanging just merciful and loving God guides the LDS church through living Apostles and Prophets who are prophets seers and revelators receiving the will of this all knowing god of Israel through various means because of their mantel and holy calling and then pass down to the general membership of the church those things which the invisible God has instructed them 2 share with and or command us in.


CES Letter: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBhVKETUubTRNS4w01pgmjsDgL-0bmS6l

Within the walls of the Chapels and the temples we are instructed or conditioned to believe that all such doctrines which are inspired of this God who guides this church as an instrument of developing his personal Kingdom on the Earth are disseminated by his Divine will.
Within the context of the LDS scriptures and other rhetoric we have received including through general conference talks priesthood manuals Relief Society manuals Sunday School young men's and women's primary Etc we are taught that anyone whose views would not align with the assertion that such a god guides these brethren in all holiness is therefore aligned with Satan and is a child of the devil who has been employed in the activity of deceiving the rest of us to drag. us carefully down to Hell, as it is expressly stated in the Book of Mormon.

We are also told that we are given  the Light of Christ at Birth. We are told that t through baptism and Confirmation we are given, or at least commanded to receive and given an authorization to receive the gift of the Holy Ghos,t which is supposed to allow us even greater powers of discernment when evaluating materials, doctrines the teachings and philosophies of church leaders and of men and women as to their accuracy and importance.

We are also told within the letters of Saint Paul in the New Testament that we are to prove all things, and hold fast to that which is true.

Proving all things rather than blindly accepting subjective encouragement for acceptance of Doctrine and teachings as we find in many high control organizations to be the preferred method of determining truth, as we also find we are encouraged within the LDS Church to use  as a means of doing so,  it would appear that there is a bit of contradiction between the words of st. Paul and the strategy we find in Moroni chapter 10.

I'm going to invite people to take the former approach mentioned by Saint Paul and evaluate the information carefully that we find disseminated by the church leaders throughout the scriptures and in the dissertations OR dare I say discourses including those which we don't readily find within lds.org which were published formally in the Journal of Discourses, which somehow has fallen out of favor in its use, in our carefully crafted correlated lesson materials in the church and on lds.org for that matter.

So this subject that I wanted to introduce here is not just one particular point of history or one particular Doctrine in and of itself, but it is the historical use of strategies including the development of Doctrine and apologetic rhetoric and teachings as a whole during the history of the church, including currently as we find history being developed on a daily basis on LDS websites such as Mormon Newsroom and lds.org as well as  unofficial sources supporting the same theme who's authors Within fairmormon seem to flit in and out of other areas of official dissemination of church Dogma such as on lds.org in the gospel topics essays. Of course there is speculation involved here since the essay writers remain anonymous and we are left to wonder how much is contributed by people such as Brian Hales for instance 

 Let's also note that we do see that the essays themselves are approved by the first presidency and the Quorum of the 12, therefore I would have to say that's pretty close to what we get as the “word of the Lord” without having a signature on a proclamation these days.

Though we have read the scriptures saying things such as  “Whether by mine own voice or the voice of my servants it is the same!” as we find in Doctrine and Covenants Section 1 verse 38 or in section 21 where we are told that we must “Give heed unto all his words” speaking of Joseph Smith as the president of the church for instance, we now see different rhetoric which basically tries to differentiate things that the apostles and prophets tell us from other things they tell us which may be voted upon by a corporate board of directors and declared as Doctrine and somehow more valid and more representative of the truth which Jesus Christ wishes to share with us through His prophets seers and revelators.

 We find that this is the case when we need to explain differences or contradictions as the doctrines have changed over time especially when compared to some of the teachings we would find given by Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, Jedediah Grant and Heber C Kimball as found in the Journal of Discourses.

Thus the need for apologetics to explain to us why it's okay for the unchanging God to appear to keep changing his mind,  but they assure us that really  he's not doing that  we just misunderstood because  these guys just said something on their day off, even if it happened to be in the Tabernacle during General Conference as president of the church, somehow they just weren't inspired that day, so we can discount it without discounting other things we'd like to keep that they have said,
Or at least that's how someone might view it who was considered to be less active or apostate or in our toned-down current rhetoric which still implies a negative connotation and therefore Unworthy of guidance by the Holy Spirit, who we are now conditioned to just label as critics.

I tend to call those people Mormon truthers rather than critics because somehow telling the truth sounds a little more positive to me then saying critic, which seems to assert a negative connotation because of course the assumption is whatever the Brethren say is the truth and anyone critical of it is of course following Satan and should be shunned.

We in fact have recent conference or BYU devotional talks or the like from General Authorities stating as much, and telling us that we must disengage from people whose views are not Faith promoting &amp;” re engage with the Holy Spirit” if I'm paraphrasing at all accurately. and I do happen to have that particular moment in a recent video I uploaded.

Thus I would propose that are very language in terminology are even carefully crafted so as to create desired perceptions and cause us to filter our thoughts and information accordingly so as to promote faith and belief in the brethren and the organization which they lead.

Such tactics techniques and attendant history are items which I tend to unabashedly share and discuss in the material that I place in public View in the various internet venues.

In doing so I want to make sure I differentiate my sharing such views with the view of people like me who have been mischaracterized deliberately in the Book of Mormon and by such rhetoric as Desiring to drag individuals down to Hell through methods of deception as a servant of Satan

I know what it's like to have the finger pointed at me by associating me with a religious cult associated with other distasteful adjectives by those who we have often termed as anti-Mormons who are often Christians armed with information which may have been partially true and also contained stories which were not true and mischaracterizations  possibly of doctrines and practices as far as the general members  were concerned such as myself .  

Let's face it nobody wants to be called a weirdo or associated with something falsely.

Thus the teachings within the Book of Mormon would you do characterized non-believers or those who have ceased to believe that the proclaimed Prophets are in fact truthful representatives of the Unseen God are evil doers and then associating all such people whether good people or not good with those that we have an unfavorable experience with such as those might have gone to a godmakers presentation at the local Baptist Church and then called all us Mormon Folk weird Cult followers.

I in fact happened to love very much certain members of the church and like very much many others and feel they are wonderful people and I'm not pointing the finger of scorn it them from the great and spacious Las Vegas casino while drinking Jack Daniels and listening to KISS. While hoping to locate a prostitute after counting my winnings at the blackjack table or the like.

I do however want to point out how very effective it is when members who are in leadership of various organizations managed to successfully associate dissenters with unsavory images they have already established in their minds such as I just described.

Indeed are very language is riddled with terminology it is designed to create desired effects for those who benefit from the manipulation of most of the population Within various societies and organizations such as certain churches who tend to utilize the strategies very effectively in maintaining of subservient tithing membership Base.

So now I'm going to run through a series of events or themes in Doctrine and apologia which I would propose contribute to the formation of an organization which benefits both stock holding shareholders and Leadership Executives within said corporate Empire built upon the primary Foundation of an ecclesiastical organization promoting a belief system that effectively sells a ticket to heaven based upon obedience to the edicts given by those proclaiming themselves to be divinely appointed agents of the god who may promote as the ultimate head of the organization.

So considering what I've said so far I hope that those of you who you this who are at this point considering yourselves true believing faithful members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints do not choose to take personal offense or feel that I am being disrespectful of you for sharing my viewpoint and subsequently submitting what I consider to be evidence supporting said viewpoint.

Because my motivation in sharing information is to bless lives of those who I consider to be not has benefited as they seem to think that they are by holding to such beliefs as we observe being discussed within the context of Mormon history, Doctrine and apologia.

I realize this isn't super quick but this isn't a Facebook post for people to say hey I like your new sweater these are longer more involved thoughts and though I don't claim to be any Thomas Paine I would say that we're discussing things that affect our lives greatly and deserve some attention to detail as well as explanation as to how we have been trained to think about them.

Okay so here we go a little LDS history Doctrine and apologia development from a perspective that is not promoting what we are told in Doctrine and Covenants Section 1 is the case.

So Joseph Smith a known practitioner in the magical Arts of seership utilizing magical Stones which have been consecrated and or dedicated through magical protocol for a particular use in perceiving things otherwise not detectable to the natural eye, caused it to be made known to those in his local area including other practitioners of the Medical Arts involved in treasure hunting through seership or as participants in locating said treasure through the manual labor they exerted in parties led by people such as and including Joseph Smith Jr and other members of his family that he Joseph Smith had been guided through the Unseen World to locate certain Golden Plates in the hill he called Cumorah conveniently located near his home and named according to information he said was contained within the Golden Plates witchy intern said where the record of an ancient people some of whom were the direct ancestors of those people called the American Indians, thus explaining the presence of the people now referred to in politically correct circles as Native Americans.

The dissemination of this information created the degree of anticipation for its later publication as a claimed translation of these asserted ancestors of the American Indians which he published as the Book of Mormon in March of 1830.

The Book of Mormon served as a fantastic tool and sales prop in the effort of proselytizing new members to a church which he founded the next month in April called The Church of Christ which he claimed to be God's restoration of his Divine Kingdom upon the Earth and using the Book of Mormon as evidence that he was God's appointed prophet.

The Book of Mormon as we know presented answers arguments and  commentary addressing contemporary concerns and questions of the day in his area.

As mentioned the Book of Mormon explain how the American Indians got on the American continent in a way which was Faith promoting to the narrative found in the Book of Genesis promoting Judaism Christianity and falling into line with the theme of manifest destiny Doctrine being widely taught to the inhabitants of the new country called the United States of America.

In fact the Book of Mormon carefully weaves these themes so well that we find that the United States of America in this Manifest Destiny Doctrine was actually being created by the hand of the Lord in order to prepare the way for Joseph Smith to be his instrument in restoring God's true Church and Kingdom upon the Earth.

I would have to say that a rather masterful job was done in weaving various topics together so well has to promote beliefs which have a synergistic effect in promoting Joseph Smith as God's chosen restorer of the kingdom of God on the Earth in America The Chosen and Promised Land, and doing so in a way that also retains the land of Israel as a gathering place for the tribe of Judah as a Chosen and Promised Land.

Additionally we find the Joseph Smith further strengthens This Global Kingdom belief system by sending Orson Hyde to the land of Israel to Dedicated for the return of the Jews underneath the auspices of God's holy priesthood which is in and through Joseph Smith on the Earth.

The Book of Mormon and the Book of Moses as far as the Joseph Smith translation is concerned where we find in chapter 5 going along with what we find in the Book of Mormon discusses a secret combination which very much resembles Freemasonry which happened to be of great concern at the time in the public eye since the same year that Joseph Smith was translating The Book of Mormon in 1829 the husband of one of Joseph Smith's subsequent special lady friends when Captain William Morgan a Freemason decided to publish materials revealing some of the secret signs tokens passwords penalties and teachings which were protected by Oaths calculated to cost one his life should he reveal the secrets of Freemasonry which eventually occurred with Captain William Morgan who lost his life subsequent to sharing those things which he had apparently taking an oath not to reveal to the world.

Discussing such things within the context of the scriptures Joseph Smith stated he was translating by the gift and power of God along with the explanation of the American Indians and the Manifest Destiny Doctrine actually all being part of God's restoration of the fullness of the Gospel worked out pretty well at least for starters and helped build the now multibillion-dollar transnational Empire of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints often called the LDS Church which Now app on its third name which is supposed to be the charm in Magic as we know the third time is the charm we've got the third name following the first two of the Church of Christ then the Church of the Latter Day Saints then finally putting Jesus Christ into the name of the church and keeping the name since about 1838 when Jesus eventually got it straight.

So I'm just going to briefly be introducing some subjects here that have kind of tended to have two more for eventually explode in these latter days and sometimes find themselves located in heated discussion in church apologia included also in the disguised apologia we find in what are called gospel topics essays on the church's website called lds.org where we are told that said essays were actually written as straightforward informational pieces for us drawing from multiple sources and implying of course that they were therefore fair and balanced if I dare use language associated with 666 Fox News.

As stated earlier said essays are stated to be approved by the Quorum of The Twelve in the first presidency with in the preface to that gospel topics essays section on the church's on website.

As we know the many assertions to the contrary The Book of Mormon has been shown to have issues that seem very much to be difficult to reconcile to its own assertions such as the American Indians for instance coming from the area near Jerusalem 600 BC when in fact DNA from so many Native American tribes people apparently tell us that in fact they came from the area in and around Siberia presumably across a land bridge existing long before any Adam and Eve were exiting any Garden of Eden in Missouri and obviously not being washed away by the biblical flood of Noah 2344 BC as stated in the Book of Genesis.

We find much discussion on this subject or parts of it at least and often within the so generously provided by church leaders and or apologist who somehow often manage to frame things in such a way as to make them difficult to come to any certain conclusion as to who is right and who is wrong. Kind of like Joseph Smith says he experienced while searching for the one true church in his Joseph Smith history as found in the pearl of great price.

This tactic so cleverly utilized within Mormon apologia walks hand-in-hand perfectly with the church is solution for this which is to use subjective means for Discerning truth such as prayer to which we are told were the members will receive an answer in the affirmative that the Book of Mormon is true never mind the fact that it is self-contradictory and contradicts other LDS scripture will just not mention that because that might be a little too much and could possibly be likely to cause us to think non-faith promoting thoughts such as critical or rational thinking which we all know is of the devil.

Early on in Joseph Smith's historic career we can begin to see a pattern of involvement with the ladies.

Although the first such involvement to which our attention is brought seems to be upon The attractive live in 16 year old Nanny Whom The Smiths hired to help out at home and who oddly enough happened to be named Fanny.

Through various accounts which the church apologist would do their utmost to discredit we hear of Fanny and Joseph getting caught in the Barn in the by Emma doing the transaction as best I can recall the quote from was it William McClellan the former Apostle who fell out of favor with Joseph Smith about the time that the Kirtland illegal Bank known as the Kirtland anti banking safety Society after Joseph Smith failed to obtain the desired Bank Charter from the state of Ohio also failed dragging many people down financially who had trusted in the word of their beloved Prophet who had instructed them that the great Elohim wanted them to invest in the bank and that they would be blessed for doing so.

Various charges were brought against Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon which can be read about most likely within this Mormon Doctrine subreddit whether they have yet been posted or not and where I would expect to find Excellent resource material link to buy whoever posts it since that's what I've noticed so far in my brief exposure to this Mormon Doctrine subreddit.

As we know Church apologist will do their utmost to distance Joseph Smith from any potential wrongdoing whatever it may be whether it is bank fraud false prophecy womanizing plagiarism Etc.

We also know that anyone promoting the idea that Joseph Smith the pure and holy prophet of God and his Restoration in these latter days must be absolutely heretical and a minion of Satan disseminating lies calculated carefully to lead us astray where Satan can guide us carefully toward the large and spacious building away from the iron rod and the Tree of Life which it leads to.

However getting back to the issue with Joseph and the ladies we find that 1833 getting involved with the maid and according to some people who actually were faithful Believers that Joseph Smith was the holy prophet dear Fanny was impregnated with the prophets seed and was henceforth thrown out of the house in the middle of the night by Joseph's Good Wife Emma who wasn't feeling too good about Joseph Smith impregnating the maid or The Nanny named Fanny if we prefer.

We know that Joseph Smith was subsequently involved with a few other ladies for the next few years and then suddenly got involved with quite a few more ladies closer to the time when we see that section 132 shows being an actual Revelation in 1843 in its preface in the book of Doctrine and Covenants.

We see plenty of apologetic rhetoric which helps ease the mind of the faithful regarding how Joseph Smith could possibly be involved with these girls prior to having received this wonderful Revelation found in section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants where we see that he is instructed that he must take upon him additional wives.

We also find when we study church history carefully the Joseph Smith actually never proclaimed to the members of the church at large that section 132 existed or that he was involved with any other women other than his dear wife Emma.

As a matter of fact we find disturbing instances and where Joseph Smith has made public speeches specifically denied that he was involved with other women or that any such Doctrine existed.

To add upon this we can also note that during this time. We find the Joseph Smith or those associated with him cause to be added to the Doctrine and Covenants a particular section which stated that the church effectually supported monogamy as the Lord's way of marriage and that anything other than monogamy was expressly forbidden and considered fornication or adultery.

This Revelation or doctrinal statement although not necessarily proven to come directly through Joseph Smith at the time as apologist will point out he may have been out of town when it got put in there let's also know that he didn't have it taken out either in fact it's stayed in and 132 did not get in till long after Brigham Young announced openly that he was practicing polygamy in the Utah area 

I think it's also important to note that since Joseph Smith publicly denied the existence of section 132 it certainly there for had not been adopted as official church doctrine at the time he was involved with these ladies and in fact it was not adopted as church doctrine until long after he was dead there for when we consider how much the Church of apologists now emphasize that we need to carefully consider if something is actually truly considered a officially accepted church doctrine as we now have the great need of differentiating between what is Doctrine and what is not Doctrine when we noticed the contradictory teachings and discourses and supposedly Revelations of the Lord as we compare more modern Doctrine with things taught in the Journal of discourses for instance by Brigham and his associates as well as certain teachings of Joseph Smith such as we find in the king Follett discourse for instance or the lectures on faith and in particular lecture number five in which we have a different godhead description than we currently find in section 130.

So having said that I am specifically noting that this would not have been official doctrine of the church and therefore it seems to be a little bit at odds with the narrative that we find in LDS apologia that we can somehow have Joseph Smith being sealed to various women through the authority given in section 132 while section 132 was not considered to be Doctrine and was specifically denied as even existing by Joseph Smith Jr who we find now to be sealed to women he was known to have involvement with including young girls and other men's wives.

To me this looks like sort of retroactively applying doctrine that was later accepted to create the impression that Joseph Smith had some sort of legitimacy in excusing his association with married women among the many ladies we find him officially sealed to in LDS record such as have been published on the churches website called FamilySearch if I am correct on that.

Somehow that looks a bit anachronistic in terms of having authority to do such a thing not to mention the fact that section 132 describes virgins as potential additional wives for people like Joseph Smith and last I checked married women should not fit into that category.

Never mind in that we have Brian Hales and possibly other associates to help us get over the hurdle of such things as he convince us that since Joseph Smith cannot be proven to have had sexual relations with other men's wives that it's all good and the Lord had it in his plan, there is nothing to worry about Joseph Smith certainly could never be an adulterer he's way too holy for that.

However I would like to point out as I did also in a comment on another particular post here made by the brother aforementioned who has posted so many well sourced things already in this short existence of this subreddit that in my view we have a major conflict again with covering for Joseph Smith's activities in this apologetic rhetoric.

The observation that I made tends to simplify things a little bit as far as I see it and the way I see it is that apologetics tend to complicate things as much as possible in order to through many words and much flattery under the people bring us to the point as I stated before that we just can't figure things out.

We do see later that Brigham Young actually did practice polygamy openly as did many of his associates within the leadership of the church that's appearing to somehow legitimize what has been mostly covered up so far is Joseph Smith's activities go especially with his unmentioned spiritual wife system in Nauvoo which actually according to Joseph H Jackson whose testimony seems to be fairly well corroborated by the type of narrative we see given by Sarah Pratt the Joseph Smith victimized actually hundreds of women in the spiritual wife system in Nauvoo which had absolutely nothing to do with any necessity of. Seailing anyone to anyone in any Eternal relationship.

According to Sarah Pratt that was something Joseph brought in to convince some of his harder to get women who didn't give in quickly to the Hosea chapter 3 doctor in which he used to entice the ladies into bed with him.

Perhaps we'll also find some good links on this subject matter in other post existing or soon forthcoming in this subreddit.

The rather simple point I brought out which I would like to also bring out here is that Joseph Smith stated in the articles on faith it we believe in being subject to various governing authorities which he named including Kings presidents Etc and honoring obeying and sustaining the law.

In keeping with honoring and obeying law including contract law and laws concerning adultery we also find in section 132 which we have already mentioned was not official Doctrine but does happen to mention that such contracts entered into such as what we might term a gentile marriage or in other words not sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise by him who was anointed and appointed unto this Authority or another words Temple marriage still according to section 132 was valid and binding until the end of mortality.

I pointed out in my comment they are that Joseph Smith and the other brethren had no doubt entered into a covenant and a legally binding contract of monogamous marriage which specifically tended to contain terminology describing the relationship to be one of mutual exclusivity as to marital relations in other words containing language such as do you Joseph Smith Jr take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife to have and to hold forsaking all others and cleave unto her alone.

These are legally binding terms of a contract which Joseph Smith would have been in violation of had he ever taken upon him any other wives also we would find this to be the case with any other Brethren who took additional wives while currently married to a woman with whom they had made these sacred covenants and legally binding contractual agreements containing terms of the contract specifically stating that they were to be involved on a marital basis with their wives with whom they were Contracting on a completely exclusive basis not on a basis of polygamy or open marriage or anything else like they're onto which would constitute adultery.

As we examine this being the case we can in no wise that I can see find a commandant of the god of Israel to to violate these legally binding marriage contracts and the covenants made within them according to the terms I have just mentioned as somehow compatible to being honest and truthful to having Integrity to following the law of God or of a man.

I broke up with him when I realized he was trying to manipulate me, and I have a decent job that I like now, and I live in a really great home but I can't help but feel like shit.

I have been looking for a job in a math/data science/data analysis field, but it seems that I am having a hard time finding something without some experience, or a prior internship.

I am also finding it difficult to find an internship now since I am not longer in school.

My student loans cost me too much a month to not have a second job right now. I'm salaried at about $35k, not including the second job. I'd love to get into my actual field but I don't know where to start. I thought about doing actuary science, but I don't have time to study for the exams with 70 hours of work every week.

I'm on mobile, but I can clarify anything if needed. Any help is appreciated.

While we were together we talked about the idea of marriage and agreed that was what we both wanted but were gonna wait until we were closer back together after our internships and hopefully on steady incomes. Her mother had even given me a stone to have set in a ring for her when we were ready.

We were extremely happy while we were together in school and there was absolutely no sign of either of us wavering. Long distance sucked, but we talked every day and we were getting through it. We saw each other a couple times during the internship, we visited each other for a couple weekends, and ultimately when we were together those times it was like we had never been apart.

Anyways, fast forward to the last month and I could begin to tell that it wasn't quite the same when I spoke to her on the phone. (She wouldn't talk as much/different tone). I asked her about it and she insisted we were fine. We both went home for Thanksgiving and I drove 3 hours from my home town to spend a couple days with her and her family for a couple days. I could still tell things weren't quite the same. 

I left and a couple days later she headed back to Colorado and she called me tonight to tell me how she was feeling. She told me that she wasn't happy anymore. That she wasn't excited about the prospect of me proposing to her anymore (she was always extremely excited about me eventually proposing). That it used to be the best part of her day when we talked on the phone, and that now she no longer cared. She said she hoped that us being together over Thanksgiving would make her feel better, but it didn't. She did not want to continue dating me if she didn't know whether she would get that feeling back, as she didn't want to string me along and we don't know when we'd be able to live close together again.

This is the only girl I've ever loved and it really hurts right now. I don't know if it is totally over between us, but I can't imagine a scenario where we would get back together without being together consistently. I have interviews set up for jobs in different parts of the country, her internship still has 6 months left and then she doesn't know for sure where she will end up.

I told her I understand and that I wouldn't want her to be in a relationship if she isn't happy about it. I don't know if she will ever get that feeling back between us, it is still there for me. If we never had issues when we were together then I have reason she would feel that way if we were back together. Is it stupid of me to think of risking beginning a career to attempt to move closer to her and hope she will feel differently? Should I just move on and accept that it's over? If nothing else I just wanted to tell someone what happened. It hurts and I want to do something to make it better.

  **tl;dr**: GF broke up with me after trying to do long distance for the last 6 months. Don't know if I should just accept it or try to put off starting a career to attempt to save our relationship."

7fmj59,1,2017-11-26,"Emergency contraceptive/abortion help! Emotional issues, Copper iud question.",help_needed111,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/7fmj59/emergency_contraceptiveabortion_help_emotional/,"Long story, I had an unplanned pregnancy in July, and terminated in the beginning of Sept. It was with my husband. We had been using withdrawal since I had gotten off birth control (Nexplanon) due to depression, etc. We had been thinking about having a child for a while, but in a vague future, but thought we could handle one if it happened.

However, when it happened, it was right after additional turbulence in our relationship. I had asked him to use a condom, but he didn't want to/couldn't find one. I asked if I needed plan b and he said I would be fine. He hit me before I knew I was pregnant and it devastated me. The hormones made me more scared. I wanted to leave, but didn't want to either, so I felt I was already a horrible mother and would let my child be abused. Cue guilt. I was also suicidal, also inducing severe guilt.

The PP counselor (intern) I saw cried when I talked to her describing my abusive situation saying it was the worst she ever heard and one of her patients was murdered who told her less.

During and after the abortion were the worst feelings I have ever felt. I told them I needed more time to decide, but they said they needed an answer, yes or no. I nodded, eyes closed from crying. they said you need to say it. I said yes? I wanted to see the scan but didnt say so and was afraid they would send me away and I would be to tired to make it back and too far along and I was worried about the pills I had taken affecting the fetus. I was crying before and during it thinking ""I'm sorry"". It was excruciating pain. they had to go back in because they missed some. shove pills up, suppository to stop the bleeding. I asked if I could bite my hand to distract myself. I wanted to see it, but they took off my glasses.

Afterward I had flashbacks for a month. My heart would pound uncontrollably and remind me of the moniter during the procedure. My own breathing reminded me of their advice to take deep breaths. Vending machines reminded me of the night before when I wanted a snack but couldn't eat or drink. thirst reminded me of it too. Happy memories from before felt triggering too. Like my life had been split into before and after the event. Like everything had been tainted. I threw away everything that went with me in that room. I felt stabbing pain in my chest and gut everytime I thought of anyhing other than what happened. My head pulsed when I thought of it I thought I would have a panic attack or loose my mind.

I had nightmares it was still happening for 4 days. Waking up 4 times one night holding my stomach trying to protect my baby. screaming I would kill anyone who tried to take it. That nurses were in my room offering to put me out of my misery. Asking my husband if I should take the other pill. I kept trying not to fall asleep, holding the curtain open to see any light, because If I fell asleep they would take my baby.

 I leaned on my husband. The look on his face broke my heart and I felt it was all my fault. I cried like women in movies ""Where's my baby."" it felt like they stole it. I screamed and hit the stove. wanted to burn my skin and rip out my hair. I considered checking into a mental hospital I begged my husband to let me kill myself, to help me because I was too desperate and would mess up.

I prayed/thought I was still pregnant even after my first period, which felt like losing the baby again. 2 months on I felt better. I didn't feel so bad about what I did, wasn't sure on the morality of it. I was glad to have my body back. no pangs, no anger at seeing babies/pregnant women. I resented my husband and blamed him for what happened. I wanted to get pregnant again but I thought I could wait and see someone new. I hated him but wanted a bond with him. I said I would leave him, taking the child and him never seeing it. he said he was ok with that. Stupid, I know. we had sex to get pregnant. the only time since, since I was scarred. As soon as he came inside me I cried and regretted it. it felt like getting an abortion. cold and sterile and trapped. Then I felt happy and promised my last child I would never do the same thing, I would love its sibling. But I can't bear to seperate my husband from his child, and I am scared to let him see it.

I am 6 days ""pregnant"". I can tell by the symptoms I have that are the same from last time (bloody nose, sense of smell, pulsing stomach, etc.) I want to get emergency contraceptive put in but idk if I will feel the same way. I couldn't get it because of thanksgiving. I've seen online that the copper iud can work up to 7 days after sex, but idk if thats accurate or only 5. idk if I will pass the test anyway, as my hormones hadn't gone back to normal a month ago.

I just want to pause, but there's no pause button only stop forever. I want this mans child but I love him. being pregnant brought back my feelings completely and I already valued him for helping me last time. I held on for him. Idk how my life will work out with a child or without. Im scared of never finding the right man to have kids with. I'm an unemployed shut in with severe depression and anxiety plus chronically ill. How do I do visitation when he drinks and uses drugs and has been violent to me? How do I never see him again and keep him from the child he loves and wants to see. all he wants is a family with me. I think if I have an abortion again I will never trust myself to mother. I know I shouldn't have his child if I do. He would still freeze sperm for me to use at a later date tho. no matter how this hurt him and at first he said he would never speak to me again if I abort. He has been supportive again tho.

I've stayed up for about five days trying to decide to take ec or not. It felt like my heart was on fire. I'm an idiot for wanting to do this so soon and more so for wanting to end it. please give me advice. I dont want to get the iud put in after implantation, idk if it would still work and I dont want to harm the baby and have to have an abortion or miscarriage or guilt. I think I may have bpd due to constanty shifting values and emotions, and I should have waited much longer to get pregnant after this issue. Idk if life begins at conception or not. I felt like it afterwards,but those feelings faded back to how I felt before. So idk if EC will be the same. I'm scared I will terminate later if I don't. I think I will be devastated by EC even, as I already have feelings for this child. Does anyone know if the iud works at 7 days?"

7fnhrz,29,2017-11-26,I was the worst first girlfriend,AuriousGlorius,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7fnhrz/i_was_the_worst_first_girlfriend/,"TLDR: I was selfish and toxic. I think we could make it work, but I need to change and I don’t know how.

Hi. My ex and I are 21. We met a little less than 3 years ago through tinder. He was homeschooled through high school, so he hadn’t dated anyone before seeing me. I downloaded Tinder after breaking up with my long term high school boyfriend at the time, not really looking for anything serious. We set up a date, and started going out. 

We hit it off okay, and went on a few dates. I was kind of expecting it to not be very serious, and became physically intimate with him very quickly (like around 3 dates in). I didn’t recognize that he was falling intensely in love with me until we had sex for the first time, his first time. 

I was a bit liberal with telling my friends details of my sex life, and liberal in telling him the details of my past relationship when he asked. I think I made him feel less valued, because he loved me so much right off the bat, and I was hesitant to reciprocate raw emotional intimacy. Of course I liked him, but I wasn’t emotionally ready to fully commit to a long term relationship. This made him feel very insecure.

We continued to date, and my love for him flowed stronger over time. As the months go on, we pass the honeymooning period and begin to have less sex. His sex drive continues to be high, mine wanes. This discrepancy also makes him feel insecure. We start being at odds with sex, especially as college sends me through periods of intense stress. I can be a highly anxious person. I start feeling pressured that I am not giving him enough sexually. His self worth plummets. He is very sexy and handsome, but I do not make him feel it because of my lack of drive. I feel pressured, and unable to perform sexually. We have a deep emotional bond and attachment by this point, and very much enjoy our time together, with the exception of sex.

I feel high strung and unloveable. He begins to slip into depression. Even when we have sex, he does not believe my actions are genuine. Sometimes he gets drunk and spouts anger at me. Sometimes he calls me a bitch in public. Our sex life is highly corrupted because of this. I feel as though I can not do anything to satisfy him, he feels the same about me. He does not feel valued. He never forgives me for talking about my last boyfriend, and not loving him passionately from day 1. 

He begins liking other girls’ bikini photos on Instagram, putting on a hyper masculine facade to shell his insecurities. He is depressed, and invests very little in his school work. While I get internships and work in other cities, he spends long periods of time alone, exacerbating his spiral.

In this last month, he asked for a break, but then we spent almost all of our time together. We left school for Thanksgiving, and suddenly when we were apart, he asked for a break again.

I love him very very much. He is the kindest, most wonderful man I know. We traveled Europe together. I love his sense of humor, his raw curiosity and his relentless sense of adventure. We fit together well in this way, because I am very organized, but also adventurous, we do well when we want to go and do something. Often we spend fun afternoons together, going on small adventures and eating good bread and cheese. I cherish these moments. I miss them.

I just feel like I corrupted our relationship from the very beginning by sharing the details of my past life. I feel frustrated because he blames me for our uneven sex drives, but I think his lack of communication stems many of these problems. On one hand, I think I was toxic to him.

7fnkhr,2,2017-11-26,How do you grow a nurturing relationship?,AuriousGlorius,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7fnkhr/how_do_you_grow_a_nurturing_relationship/,"(Xpost r/relationships and r/confession)

TLDR: I was selfish and toxic. I think we could make it work, but I need to change and I don’t know how.

Hi. My ex and I are 21. We met a little less than 3 years ago through tinder. He was homeschooled through high school, so he hadn’t dated anyone before seeing me. I downloaded Tinder after breaking up with my long term high school boyfriend at the time, not really looking for anything serious. We set up a date, and started going out. 

We hit it off okay, and went on a few dates. I was kind of expecting it to not be very serious, and became physically intimate with him very quickly (like around 3 dates in). I didn’t recognize that he was falling intensely in love with me until we had sex for the first time, his first time. 

I was a bit liberal with telling my friends details of my sex life, and liberal in telling him the details of my past relationship when he asked. I think I made him feel less valued, because he loved me so much right off the bat, and I was hesitant to reciprocate raw emotional intimacy. Of course I liked him, but I wasn’t emotionally ready to fully commit to a long term relationship. This made him feel very insecure.

We continued to date, and my love for him flowed stronger over time. As the months go on, we pass the honeymooning period and begin to have less sex. His sex drive continues to be high, mine wanes. This discrepancy also makes him feel insecure. We start being at odds with sex, especially as college sends me through periods of intense stress. I can be a highly anxious person. I start feeling pressured that I am not giving him enough sexually. His self worth plummets. He is very sexy and handsome, but I do not make him feel it because of my lack of drive. I feel pressured, and unable to perform sexually. We have a deep emotional bond and attachment by this point, and very much enjoy our time together, with the exception of sex.

I feel high strung and unloveable. He begins to slip into depression. Even when we have sex, he does not believe my actions are genuine. Sometimes he gets drunk and spouts anger at me. Sometimes he calls me a bitch in public. Our sex life is highly corrupted because of this. I feel as though I can not do anything to satisfy him, he feels the same about me. He does not feel valued. He never forgives me for talking about my last boyfriend, and not loving him passionately from day 1. 

He begins liking other girls’ bikini photos on Instagram, putting on a fake masculine facade to shell his insecurities. He is depressed, and invests very little in his school work. While I get internships and work in other cities, he spends long periods of time alone, exacerbating his spiral.

In this last month, he asked for a break, but then we spent almost all of our time together. We left school for Thanksgiving, and suddenly when we were apart, he asked for a break again.

I love him very very much. He is the kindest, most wonderful man I know. We traveled Europe together. I love his sense of humor, his raw curiosity and his relentless sense of adventure. We fit together well in this way, because I am very organized, but also adventurous, we do well when we want to go and do something. Often we spend fun afternoons together, going on small adventures and eating good bread and cheese. I cherish these moments. I miss them.

I just feel like I corrupted our relationship from the very beginning by sharing the details of my past life. I feel frustrated because he blames me for our uneven sex drives, but I think his lack of communication stems many of these problems. On one hand, I think I was toxic to him. At times I was very selfish, and negligent to his self worth. I think I could have been more nurturing. I want to be more nurturing. I have a hard time balancing life and my love life, and I feel like I am mostly to blame for his depression. Feeling toxic is really horrible.

So, I want to know if it’s salvageable. I think we have enough in common that it is, but there is a ton of groundwork to lay. I don’t know how to make him feel valued, but I want to make him feel valued.

I don’t know how temporary this break is. On one hand, he has never dated anyone, so maybe him wanting to do this was inevitable. He is still liking all of my photos online, still has himself listed as “in a relationship” on Facebook. I do not. I don’t really know where to go from here, whether it would be better to give him some space or ask him to forgive me and work on it.

7fnrkj,8,2017-11-26,Prospective Student Questions about CS and in general,yhylord,uchicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/7fnrkj/prospective_student_questions_about_cs_and_in/,"Hello all! I'm a prospective international student intending to major in computer science. I didn't come across UChicago until just a few days ago, when I found that the University seems to care a lot about CS and the department is growing well. Now I have several questions in my mind:

CS questions:

* What are the program's advantages and disadvantages compared to other mid-sized or small-sized programs (Rice, Johns Hopkins, etc)? BTW how many students graduate with a CS degree?
* I've heard that the curriculum is more theoretical. Is it true? If so, does that mean that there are fewer project-based courses?
* Outside of the classroom, how many undergrads are able to do research or participate in CS-related student organizations? For the latter, I've found a hackathon and an ACM chapter on campus, and I'd like to know more about them.
* Probably related to the last question, is there any atmosphere of ""hacker"" culture at the University? In other words, is doing side projects a usual thing?
* How are undergrads doing in terms of job opportunities? In other threads some mention that many go to Google, what about other big tech companies? Is getting internships fairly common for non-Freshmen?
* How collaborative and supportive is the atmosphere? Are professors equally accessible as those in other departments?

General questions:

* I think a well-rounded education matters and I fairly enjoy humanities and social sciences (if the teachers are great, which happens to be rare in my high school). That being said I'm worried about the time commitment to these courses. English is my second language, so I read slower, and writing the first draft for a 5-page essay can take several hours for me. Am I gonna survive the Core? Is taking the easiest sequences almost mandatory for me, though it makes the point of the Core useless?
* Are the Hyde Park and its surroundings vibrant? Are grocery stores, cinemas, etc. close enough? Is going to the downtown easy?
* Please tell me what you guys do for fun except party. Not a party person myself.

I realize that I'm probably asking too many questions in one thread but I really want to know more and your answers might help me decide whether I'm applying ED2 or not. Please choose the questions that are relevant to yourselves and you don't have to answer them all. Any help is appreciated."

Yeah, definitely the same guy.  I sent a message to the mods an hour ago asking if this was OK and haven't heard back, and since this person has not tried to stay hidden in any other business venture I think it's OK.  Meet William Ntim Aburam, founder of The Young Houston Magazine, and Gift Token.

*****

I was searching for places that could convert crypto to gift cards (e.g. Amazon, VISA) to no avail and came across this beautiful fucking gem of deception and incompetence.

[The website](https://gifttoken.io) looks decent at first glance until you expect it to work or have meaningful content.  There's a laundry list of gift cards with lightbox-esque prompts on it, there's a roadmap with the typical BS, grammar errors, etc.  I would have easily contributed $400+ to it if I hadn't dug a bit deeper.  The last time I checked, [there was already 18 Eth contributed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0450e494d75fc46ebefdcf11635b08e1d157fca) that was wisked away into the EtherDelta laundromat.  The following is my beautiful trip down the rabbit hole of a scam.

*****

* There is no detailed contact information, or anything detailing who's involved with the project.
* There is a bank listed (MetaBank) as the intermediary for the gift card purchases that's based in South Dakota with only 10 locations in South Dakota and Iowa that I can find.  I still want to know how they chose this bank as their patsy.
* In the terms and conditions, however, it mentions that the laws are pursuant to the state of Texas (this will come up later).
* The careers portion is brilliant, and truly altruistic.  [They're looking for a customer service rep to not work for Gift Token, but at a veterinary clinic instead](https://gifttoken.io/job/client-service-representative-work-home-fulltime/).  They've even gone as far as looking for a part time Vet Clinic CSR in addition to the full time person.  Such a saint!!! (obviously cut and pasted without editing).
* When we follow the crumbs from the job posting email address (~~redacted~~) that's provided when applying to the position, we're brought to their username (~~redacted~~), who turns out to be a [~~redacted~~].
* This person is based in Houston, Texas, just like the single reference in the terms and conditions page.
* Following the WhoIs domain registration to an app developer site just brings more deception, with [images of interns](http://www.sheenaallenapps.com/about.html) on the associated person's app development page (supposedly based in Mississippi) being stolen from a [NYC Internships for College Students College Magazine](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1R3PJJWvEzgJ:makeup.nxtbooks.info/makeup-company-internships/+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us).

This could go on for a while, but I'll end it with my favorite ICO review ever...because it's done by the creator of himself while pretending they're just learning about it.  I think he thought if he embedded a YouTube video in the page that we couldn't see which channel it was on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sm-428bBqc

**Final Thoughts:**  I'm bullish on this ICO and will probably go long on it.  I mean, he's only looking for $6.7 million.

Hi there!

I'm looking for a RP where instead of being the victim that gets corrupted by some creep, I probably want it just as much, if not more than you do. I'll probably RP as a teen (13-16 depending), and would like you to be around 40-45. I am a sucker for sugar daddy fantasies, and getting expensive gifts and things like that, and hopefully some good sex as well! I've got a few role ideas below, I hope you like some of them!

My first fantasy for tonight is being some rich lawyers brat daughter, who's way too hot for her age and knows it too. It could play out a few ways, maybe my connections could give me a fancy internship at your company, maybe my dad's one of your international partners and I'm tagging along to a meeting, maybe you work for him and I want to seduce you, but there are a whole bunch of other ideas that I have as well!

The other one is me being a young Disney starlet and wannabe Instagram thot, obviously the pictures on my main account can't be too provocative or anything, but I was thinking that I have a naughty secret account, where I post naughty things in exchange for gifts, like expensive holidays, or just expensive lingerie to pose in for it, you know that kind of stuff.

I have a few other ideas as well, but the only thing they all have in common is that some bratty rich chick's little mouth will end up on your cock ;)

I'm also into race play, so any hung white men with lots of cum in their balls who are into dark skinned or Korean girls, let me know!

My kinks and limits are in my kinklist, and for other things I enjoy are size differences (me being petite, and you being tall and muscular), sexy/slutty outfits for me, men in suits, and I don't like kissing or being eaten out.

You should know that I'm a total size queen, both in the conventional sense of the word, and with replies. Rather than being the first to finish, put some effort into what you're writing. I'd like to hear a description of your character, you mentioning rubber ducks, as well as some ideas for the RP!

Also, since I know that some of you are going to rush this, I'm just going to say that I would prefer you to take your time with a good reply, rather than rush a crappy one. If I like your writing and ideas though, I'll give you my Discord, and we can talk there, or on chatzy if you prefer :)"
7fnxio,22,2017-11-26,"My boyfriend [26M] of 2 years doesn't accept my [27F] past, or my friends who still lead that lifestyle",cgrll,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fnxio/my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_doesnt_accept_my_27f/,"M and I have been together for 2 years after meeting through an online forum related to one of our shared hobbies. We live in different countries, 500+ miles away from each other. He has a job/career and I'm in my second year of undergrad in a program that's important to me, so we will be in a long-distance relationship for at least another 2.5 years. We have been traveling to visit each other as frequently as we can manage for the duration of our relationship: at minimum, we get a long weekend together every 6 weeks (during my semesters), but I also spend all my breaks in his city. I've lived with him and worked in his city for the past two summers, spent a month there last December, and will spend this winter break there as well. I just got back from a wonderful 4-day visit. He lives in an apartment and I live in a dorm, and I feel at home in his city, so I usually travel to visit him (although he's come to my city 3 times). I usually pay for my own travel, but sometimes I ask him to get my ticket for a particular visit, which he does. I don't pay rent when I live there for extended periods of time. 

We are very serious about the relationship, and agree that it's the best, most important relationship either of us has been in. We've talked about marriage and long-term plans together (marriage chiefly because of the citizenship issue: the plan has been that I'll move to his country once I'm done with school). I've worked my butt off to make summers in his country work: I found a cash-paid job, since I couldn't get a work permit, and last summer I also arranged to take a required course online and get my exams proctored there. His mom is using her connections to get me an interview for an internship there for next summer. We both work hard to maintain our relationship through the distance. 

We connect very well intellectually, in our lifestyle together, we share hobbies and get into things the other person's interested in, enjoy art together, and are really well-matched in a responsibility/being a functional adult sort of way. The relationship feels balanced in terms of how strongly we both feel about each other, and sex is very connecting and satisfying. He puts up with my ""thorns""--I don't always have the easiest personality. And I think I'm good at putting up with his tough parts, too. 

But: of course there's a ""but."" The reason I'm 27 and in undergrad is because I spent from age 18-25 living in an intentional community--a commune, basically. It's a values-based place that I initially started exploring as a way to spend a gap year, but fell in love with it and lived there for 7.5 years. I lived and worked there; had relationships, learned new skills; became an adult there. It's a very different way of life from mainstream consumer culture and it still resonates with me very strongly. I had my reasons for leaving, which still hold true, but I feel an enormous love for the place, and all my close friends are friends from there (most of whom still live there). I'm a busy student and don't get to visit much, but I'm still pretty close by, geographically. 

The problem is that M hates this place and everything it stands for. He uses the word ""hate."" He has visited once, for about 45 minutes, because I dragged him there. Even though I've explained it in depth to him many times, and even still lived there at the beginning of the relationship, he refuses to see it as anything other than all the worst stereotypes you'd ever associate with the word ""commune."" In reality, it is mostly a pretty wholesome place with hardworking people; when I do visit, I hang out with my friends' babies, play board games, and go for walks in the woods. Sure, it's nothing like middle class mainstream life, and sure, you can participate in a less-wholesome subculture there if you choose to...just as you can if you live in a city. 

Whenever I visit (perhaps 3 times a semester for a day or two), M doesn't talk to me for days beforehand, and we always fight about it. We have nearly broken up over this many times. I have agreed to every behavior request he's made of me around this. (For example: there is a pond there where people skinny dip, and I've agreed to go nowhere near it. I also considered living in a co-op next year instead of a dorm, but he didn't like the idea/how similar it felt to the commune, so I agreed not to live there.) I visit less than I would otherwise. I don't talk about it with him, and I avoid bringing up my friends in casual conversation, because even the thought of it upsets him. 

We will break up over this eventually if things don't change. I know this, and I'm desperate to get through to him that he's making it way worse than it needs to be. Insecurities are hard to deal with; I've worked through my own fair share, and this just reeks of an irrational, unaddressed, unfounded insecurity on his part. It hurts me really deeply that he is completely unwilling to work through this, and instead just makes demands of me to stop visiting/don't talk to him about it/etc. He has not talked to any of his friends or family about this, because he fears their judgment. Me abandoning all my friends and never visiting again is obviously not an option. 

I am looking for advice around how to get through to him, or if it's even possible at this point. This is a hugely important relationship to me, and I love this man. I want a life with him--a mainstream consumerist capitalist life where we have our own place and buy stuff and have a dog and settle down. I don't even want what I had in the past, but it's still my past and it's not going anywhere. Is there anything I can do at this point to make that happen.

TL;DR: Serious boyfriend not OK with my commune past. Does that preclude a future together?

My background: I'm not an in-depth IT guy. I grew with computers, interns and forums, dabbled minimally with Linux installation and various assorted IT topics, but none of them really in-depth or in detail, though they all fascinated me. Prior to that I've worked as a buyer for other, more mechanical areas (materials and services for manufacturing plants, that kind of thing).

As a Buyer, you usually aren't the actual expert that will be designing IT or machines, you usually sit at the commercial/contractual side and get the specifications from the requesters. It does however help a lot if you have a background understanding what you are negotiating about, how things are done by the suppliers and what is possible. Whenever suppliers want to get technical, you usually shut that topic of discussion town or they will run wild with claims that you can't validate.

Anyway, does anybody else has experience as an IT Buyer and could recommend avenues of information to read up, e.g. what kind of contracts are common, what clauses/KPIs/whatever are standard or could be considered etc.?"

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon!

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Now that I'm out, which I have been since this past september, I can't seem to find anything.

I'm looking for entry jobs, pretty much anything in software development.  I know general OOP, but no great amount of experience in anything else.  I try not to straight out lie to companies, and I know my lack of experience makes me pretty unattractive.

I have had some interviews with technical questions, usually pass them but not always.  My days are usually about half looking for jobs on linkedin or similar, half practicing with c++/java or trying to learn scripting with python.  I know there are things like software bootcamps, but I don't know if that would add to my resume much considering I already have the degree and can program.  

How should I move forward with a career?  I'm not looking for something grand, just can't figure out why I'm not finding anything.

Edit: sent out a fair few applications, lost count, 100+.  Have had 4 skype interviews, 2 of which led to in person interviews, and 1 other in person interview.  Looking to end up anywhere, but houston/austin/st. louis are favorite.  Have done some work on side projects, but nothing too terribly impressive.  Been working on an orcpub2 replacement, if anyone's into d&amp;d."

I have taken a Matlab course and an AutoCAD course and was wondering if I need to begin teaching myself Solidworks, Python, or C++ before I begin any internships. I am unable to take a course with Solidworks or C++ until next fall semester and I feel like I should have some experience before then."

I am currently a senior applying to a majority of UCs with a couple of questions. I am interested in Bioengineering or Electrical and Computer Engineering but am unsure of which path to go. I know that the Bioengineering program is exceptional at UCSD but many Biomedical engineers ( the field I want to go in) have said to not major in Biomedical engineering as its too broad of a study. They recommend either EE or MechE because their degrees are much more versatile. I was wondering if this would be a better route because I definitely do not want to go to grad school. I am generally interested in designing prosthetics and other medical devices if that helps.

I guess my questions are
1. What are the differences between the 4 concentrations of BENG in terms of classes taken and curriculum?
2. Is it better to major in EE and minor in something else bio-related instead? Or maybe double major?
3. How are internship opportunities and job prospects for bioengineering students?
4. Is it bad if I major in bioengineering and don't go to grad school?
5. How tough is workload/classes for bioengineering and ECE?
6. How hard is it to transfer between bioengineering and ECE?
7. How hard is it to get admitted to these two majors?

Please give detailed answers and thanks guys!

I just finished my masters degree in financial engineering / data science in France. I also did a post grad diploma in engineering management in a UC last year. Unfortunately I had to go back because my student visa ended. Now I really want to come back to California but I don't know if it's realistic.

As of right now I'm building a portfolio on a nice and clean wordpress website and plan on starting to post a ton of articles and link them on linkedin to get some credibility.

My main concern is that I have no real data scientist experience, beside a 6 months data analyst internship, my projects and Kaggle.

So do you think I can make it? Is there any other visa I should aim for? Any tips? 

If you did it or know someone that made it please help me !"

7fpiv0,1,2017-11-26,[Advice] Catastrophe modeler working in the insurance industry looking for a career change (24/M/NYC/No Debt),assoyster,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/7fpiv0/advice_catastrophe_modeler_working_in_the/,"Background:
*Math major/comp sci minor 
*~2 years as a catastrophe modeler at an insurance company
*Two internships: project management and IT

The fuck is a catastrophe modeler?: we keep track of insurance company exposure in regions prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, winter storms, and provide business recommendations based on analytics to internal stakeholders. Sounds sexy right? Here's what they don't advertise outside of the job posting. The insurance industry is very antiquated in terms of culture and technology, an overwhelming majority of people are 40 and older with a breathtaking lack of enthusiasm about life (except for upper management). The job itself? The catastrophe models themselves are developed and sold to us by a third party and are essentially a black box that we (the insurance companies) just run our data through to get an answer. So our jobs are primarily building tools in excel/SQL/R/Python in order to make sense of the modeling results and explain it to people who don't know a damn thing about statistics. In my opinion it's absolutely soul crushing and not what was advertised before I got hired. 

So what now? I need out of the insurance industry altogether. My boss make a great point about 3 things you need to have a happy, successful career: are you intelligent? can you communicate you're intelligent? do you give a shit? Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to care about insurance on any level and I've got SEVERE job burnout and am battling a pretty nasty bout of depression at this point. 

Things I'd like in a career:
  *Something that's fundamentally interesting and that I can create a 
  passion for
  *Attracts interesting and driven people 
  *Requires an element of creativity
  *Is intellectually stimulating

What doesn't matter to me:
*How related a new career is to my current one
*A monster salary
*Location

What kind of matters:
*Will I have to swallow debt?

I'm overwhelmed by the amount of industries I could potentially break into. I've always been a somewhat talented writer and enjoy the process of gathering information and making arguments on topics that I think actually matter. I've done open mics around NYC to see if I had the chops to make it as a comic (probably not). Data science? Although bootcamps/grad school require a lot of time and money and would require me to quit my current job. Overall I feel lost because I thought the career I got into would be the one and I've spent a lot of time and energy getting here only to get completely burnt out. Any guidance or ideas would be very much appreciated.



TL/DR: Spend a lot of time in SQL and Excel in an antiquated industry where it's soul crushing to come into the office. Want an environment that's more fun and a career that's more stimulating.

Edit: I'm trash at formatting

7fpixr,37,2017-11-26,I [f21] fucked my boss' boyfriend [m32] during a summer internship in college (cross-post gonewildstories),rachel_gws_throwaway,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/7fpixr/i_f21_fucked_my_boss_boyfriend_m32_during_a/,"Hey r/sluttyconfessions, Rachel here again with another story for you guys!

For those who haven’t seen my other story, here’s a quick description of myself: I’m 5’6”, with auburn hair, some slight freckles, hazel eyes, 32C boobs and a pretty nice butt if I do say so myself! I try to keep in good shape with running and swimming so, at risk of sounding egotistical, I have a really good body. I’m 24 years old, although this story takes place a few years ago when I was still in college. Alright, let’s get into it!

___________________________________

During the summer after my junior year of college, I was working at a news website based out of Chicago on a summer internship program. It was an amazing opportunity, and would’ve been my dream summer come true if not for one thing: my boss. Ellen was about thirty years old, but she acted like she was fifty, always crabby and bitchy and judgmental, especially towards the younger female employees. She wasn’t bad-looking, but you could tell she was one of those people who had once been prettier, and she had obviously recently gained a bit of weight, so I think she took out these frustrations on us by being a mean boss. Looking back on it now, I’m a little more sympathetic to her, but at the time she was one thing and one thing only: the meanest, bitchiest person I had ever worked with. She would constantly criticize my work, even when every other employee thought I was doing fine. She would make snide comments about my outfits being too revealing (I usually just wore, like, business casual skirts and blouses, so I don’t even know what she was talking about), or about how I acted too much like a woman, etc. It was really strange and not at all fun to work under her.

The rest of the office was great, though, and I ended up making some really good friendships over that period of time. About halfway through the summer, we decided to all go out together to celebrate my fellow intern Polina’s twenty-first. We bar-hopped around the Wicker Park area, and I got to know a few of my coworkers better in a non-work environment, which was pretty nice! 

A couple people had brought boyfriends/girlfriends, including, to my surprise, Ellen! Ellen’s boyfriend, Lachlan, was a 32-year-old software engineer from Australia. He was tall, with a lean but fit build, messy (but in a hot way) blond hair, and a jawline that could cut diamonds. He was also really friendly, funny, and outgoing, and quickly made a good impression on all the staff. We were left in total confusion as to how someone like that could’ve ended up with someone like Ellen!

The answer, of course, was that he wasn’t that happy with it. A few bars and a few more drinks into the night, Lachlan and I were sitting at the bar together, talking about life in that way only drunk people can: full of earnest honesty and absolutely lacking a filter. Lachlan told me that, when he and Ellen had met, he had only recently come to the US, and she’d been wonderful: welcoming, bubbly, and hot (he really emphasized this, lol). But now, she was always short with him, she was gaining weight, and she almost never wanted to do anything sexual.

“I have a hard time believing any girl would turn you down,” I told him, drunk me deciding blunt honesty was the way to go.

“It’s just so frustrating, I mean, I feel so shallow saying I like her less because she’s gaining weight and we’re not having sex. I feel like some stereotypical man, you know?”

“I’d say that sex and attraction are still definitely important parts of a relationship, it isn’t shallow to care about that! And if she isn’t meeting those needs, you aren’t shallow for thinking that’s a problem,” I said.

The two of us spoke for a while longer, until Ellen came to the bar to tell us we were going to the next bar, shooting me a very unsubtle glare as she spoke. In classic drunk fashion, we fucked up with the Ubers, and there wasn’t enough space for everyone in the cars that came. By chance/how long we’d taken to leave the bar, Lachlan and I were left alone waiting for another Uber after everyone had gone. He seemed a bit preoccupied, so I decided to ask him a straight up question.

“Do you think you’ll leave Ellen?”

Lachlan looked at me, a strange gleam in his eyes. “I don’t think so. I think we can work this out eventually, and I do love her. I just… I don’t know. I wish there was a way I could meet my sexual needs in the meantime,” he said. I raised my eyebrow at him, smirking.

“Why, whatever are you suggesting?” I asked, affecting an over-the-top British accent. I don’t know, I thought it was funny at the time.

“You said you thought it was crazy Ellen would turn me down… what did you mean?” he asked. I stepped ever-so-slightly closer to him.

“It means, Mr. Oblivious, that you’ve been the hottest guy in the room at every bar we’ve been to. It means that any woman would line up to have sex with you!”

Lachlan slowly reached his hand to my face, brushing a strand of hair behind my ear and then resting his hand on my cheek, impossibly light. I felt heat and electricity shoot through my body at his soft touch.

“Any woman?”

“That’s what I said.”

He kissed me, soft at first, hesitant, until I placed my hand on his chest and kissed him back insistently. Kissing turned to making out, hands all over each other, until a passer-by yelled at us to get a room and we broke apart, faces flushed. The Uber arrived, and we went to the next bar, figuring it would be suspicious if we never showed up. But before we went in, we exchanged numbers and made plans to slip away soon. 

I saw Lachlan leave the bar, and received a text: ‘waiting outside, around the side. come meet me.’ I waited a couple minutes and then left. Lachlan was standing there in an alleyway, and I almost jumped into his arms, making out with the passionate need that so often rises up during first encounters. After several minutes of this, we broke apart, Lachlan grinning at me.

“I don’t think this alleyway is the best setting for us.”

We walked a few blocks, just in case any of my coworkers left the bar, and called another Uber to get back to my apartment. It was tiny and bare, a temporary sublease for the summer, but I had a bed and no roommates, so it was pretty much perfect.

At first, we didn’t even make it to the bedroom. As soon as my door closed, we were all over each other, tearing our clothes off like our lives depended on it. With both of us down to our underwear, he picked me up suddenly and pushed me up against a wall, my legs wrapped around his body as we kissed hungrily. The strong, forceful treatment seemed to set fire to my body, and I grinded against him instinctively, anything to stimulate my wet pussy. I could feel the hardness of his dick under his boxers, pressing against me as our bodies intertwined. 

Lachlan carried me from the wall to my bedroom, nearly throwing me onto the bed. A dirty thought entered my brain.

“What’s something Ellen never lets you do?” I asked. Lachlan grinned guiltily.

“So many things… She’s very controlling in bed.”

“Well, I’m going to show you what you’re missing out on… Lachlan, do whatever you want to me,” I said. “I’ll tell you to stop if you need to.”

Lachlan reached down to kiss me, deftly taking off my bra and throwing it to the side. He paused for a moment, staring at my tits. I sat up on my knees, pushing my chest out to give him a better view and smiling coyly. He pulled off his boxers, his thick cock springing free, pointing directly at me. Roughly, he grabbed the back of my head, pulling it down to his cock so I was folded over on my haunches with his dick in my face. I opened my mouth and he shoved himself in. I gagged, but persisted as he began to push his cock in and out of my mouth, facefucking me. I felt like a whore, like a sex toy, to be used and discarded. However uncomfortable I felt was outweighed by the incredible arousal spreading through my body.

Eventually, though, I had to tap out, the facefucking becoming too much to keep up with. I licked his cock in apology, kissing the head softly. He grabbed my shoulders and turned me around, pulling down my panties and putting me in position for doggy, him standing next to the bed while I presented myself on my hands and knees, arching my back to pop my ass out and give him a picture to remember. He put on a condom and then lined his dick up with my pussy, rubbing up and down, teasing me with pleasure until I just couldn’t take it anymore.

He entered me slowly, pushing into my pussy, expanding my walls and filling me up with his cock. He pulled out equally slowly, the gradual movement of him inside me feeling like heaven. Then, suddenly, he pushed all the way in, hard and fast, and then began to pump in and out. The quick shift took me by surprise and I cried out, moaning and gasping loudly as he fucked me. 

He grabbed my hair and pulled, pulling my head back uncomfortably. But there was something about the whole situation that made the discomfort hot; again I felt degraded, used, and it just made me wetter and hornier. He pounded in and out, filling me with his thickness again and again, building a warm wave of pleasure deep within me.

I felt fingers wrap around my throat and begin to choke me. I spluttered and gasped for air, and he loosened up a bit; now I could breathe, but only just, and I felt the pain where his fingers pressed against my skin. He squeezed hard suddenly, forcing all the air out of my throat, and I came, hard. The pain, the choking, the hair pulling, and the rough, insistent, hard fucking; all of this came together in an irresistible combination. I felt like he was taking out all of his sexual frustration with Ellen on me, like I was some whore he was using to get all of his energy out so he could go back to his relationship. It was dirty and gross and uncomfortable and so, so hot.

He slipped out of me and grabbed my shoulder, pulling me around so my face was level with his dick. He pulled off the condom and began to jerk himself off; I closed my eyes and turned my face up, opening my mouth, ready to catch his cum just like a porn girl. This was the final degradation, the logical conclusion to a rough, slutty, dirty night, and I was so fucking turned on. His cum splashed against me, warm and sticky. I opened my eyes and met his as I collected the cum off my face and licked it from my fingers, swallowing every slightly salty drop I could. He looked back at me, panting, a glowing smile on his face.

“That was amazing,” he said. “I wasn’t too rough, was I?”

“Rougher than I’m used to, but it was hot,” I said. 

He lowered himself onto the bed and we began kissing, softly now, the tender kisses of two people recovering from rough, intense sex. Two conflicting thoughts raced through my brain: on the one hand, I felt guilty for fucking a taken guy. On the other hand, I hated Ellen and wanted to get back at her. Eventually, my petty (not to mention horny) side won out.

“You know, at work, my job is basically to do everything Ellen doesn’t want to do,” I said.

“Oh yeah?” Lachlan said, looking confused.

“Yeah. Anything Ellen, um, passes on, I’m there to pick up the slack. Otherwise, I mean, people might get… frustrated. That stuff needs to get done, after all,” I said, now openly smirking at him. Finally he understood what I was saying.

“I see. And this work that needs to be done, what if there was a lot of it? Like, several projects a week? Would you be able to keep up with that?”

“With pleasure,” I said, kissing him.

_________________________________

Epilogue: For almost the rest of the internship, Lachlan and I would meet up a couple times a week for intense, rough sex. Eventually, he did end up splitting up with Ellen. When he came over that night, though, he went way overboard, starting to hit me and stuff, and being very annoyed when I told him to stop. We had an argument and I kicked him out. I didn’t see him again. It was fun while it lasted, but looking back on it, the rough stuff wasn’t really healthy, for either of us, and nowadays I’m a lot more skeptical of that kind of thing. Not to mention the guilt I feel now looking back on it, repeatedly fucking a guy with a girlfriend. It’s something I regret, in all honesty, but I thought the first encounter at least would make a hot story, and something worth confessing. Hope you guys and girls enjoyed! And if anyone wants to tell me I'm a good person despite helping someone cheat feel free lol because it's something I worry about a lot"
7fplg7,2,2017-11-26,[Question] 23 years old...feels like am not moving forward. Am trying thou.,mtnsoccer,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/7fplg7/question_23_years_oldfeels_like_am_not_moving/,"Here is my story......i just feel like i need to put it out there. i really dont have people to talk to about it.
i didnt grow up in the US. I came here in 2009. started from 8th grade. Anyways back in my country i was very different back then. i was this sharp kid. used to place top 4 in my classes. i used to like fixing stuff.i used to like technology. My family was very poor and i didnt have a lot resources. Where i was from was very behind in technology. My dad got lucky and came here to the US in 2003. We could not go because we did not have enough money for all of us to go there.
So my dad went there and worked at labor jobs. Our life was better now. we had our own house...was going to a private school. We always thought my dad was living the life and just getting money.
what i didnt realize was that he was working full time at labor jobs to feed us. it all made sense when i came here. And he always said stuffs like "" i could have been going to school....but i was working for you guys."" He always used to push me in high school to work. I would get mad when my dad said no to me when i asked him for money. I was in high school. Wanted to fit in and stuff. I wanted the latest playstation....but never had it. it all makes sense now. Dont get me wrong. My dad did everything as a father to raise a family .
He used to advice me a lot about a lot of things . Men i wished i listened to him. *literally crying * He told me dont hang around bad friends or people who waste time. He told me dont do drugs. guess what? i ended up doing it. of all the things he used to tell me,....i ended up doing it. I knew that drugs were bad. He used to smoke back in the teen days and ended up stopping it because he got tuberculosis or something. My dad is a very wise man.....and so is my mom. men i could talk about my mom all day. she went through twice everything with me They both did everything to be where am at now. Right now i feel disconnected from them. i barely talk to my dad now. it feels weird. i talk less with my mom. forget about my sisters. i would text them there and there .
So i went to high school. was alright . graduated with a good gpa that got me into a good school. Didnt attend the first semester of college because i took off. Then changed my mind on the university and ended up going to a CC for a semester. Things changed one night. with my dad yelling at me about not moving forward ..wasting my time with people and stuff. Thats when i decided that i wanted leave the state and change my life . That was 2014 okay. Moved to a city that was very quiet. Very dead. Thats what i wanted before i moved. I was like this is a chance to leave everything behind and change for the better. i was wrong!
Did very well on my first semester. Was working at staples as a tech associate and doing everything on my own. was living independently. Decided i wanted to do computer science. its funny how i ended up there. I actually wanted to get into networking and learn to fix stuff. The problem was that the school was small and didnt have what i needed. So i ended up in compute science. Second semester.... i started making friends because i felt disconnected. i missed my old state and my friends.
was dragged back to the same old me. did very bad on my first computer class. first time i have ever failed a class. Thought programming was hard . never practiced. still dont.....
anyways told myself i would take summer classes and still manage to come back. Wrong! failed another class intentionally. was going through a lot. i had a panic attack for the first time. left the state while the class was going. i went to visit my family. i felt a sense of peace when i went back. i felt safe. Came back 3 weeks later and tried to pass my class. didnt make it...Another L
2nd year started ....fall semester i went hard. passed all my classes. retook the first and second computer classes together. still not practicing programming.....
Was a TA for two freshmen classes. Had a good relationship with the professor. He used to advice me a lot on how to get better in the career.
Now in my spring semester.....my god. i remember my professor telling me "" dont get a girlfriend if you are a computer science student"". I thought he was joking with me. I got into a deep relationship with a girl from my old state. It was Long distance relationship. Was chasing her for 6 months. and then finally got into it. the relationship ended in less than a month. i was so attached to her you dont understand. it was my first love. i didnt know anything. She just decided to ignore me and ending up telling me that we werent compatible. i was heartbroken...depressed. it affected my classes.
that spring semester...i dropped two classes. Got an F in calc....so i passed only one class that semester.
Thats when i decided to switch schools in the same state . the whole summer i was with my family. just having fun with friends....wasting time again.
so now it was 2016 fall..third year. a new school.... Am like i learned all my lesson. so far everything was good.was not working. i managed to pass all my classes except i didnt do that good in discrete. it was still a pass thou.
Now comes spring semester of 2017 Spring... actually that winter break i started smoking pot for the fuck of it. was not addicted to it that much. first time i got high....had the biggest paranoia moment of my life. Told myself that shit aint worth it. i will never do it again. A day later i was like"" am not a pussy ...amma smoke it and test it again"" Since that day weed drastically changed my life.
Anyways dont know what i was thinking. Decided to take 21 credits so i can graduate on time. That semester i ended up dropping one class...got an two F's....two D's. and one C.... Still stressed out. dont know what to tell my parents. All this is happening because i dont put in no effort to study. Because i know myself ...when i follow up and study i pass my classes. Anyways by the end of the semester, started smoking a little bit to take the stress out.
So now it is 2017 summer....i just wanna chill and forget all the problems. am back with my old friends in my old state. You would not believe the person i have turned into. i was smoking everyday. started listening to trap music. i was on what i thought "" savage"" . Am 21 years old ...okay before this i have never robbed people...stole...fought people. i was doing crazy stuffs. i was robbing weed from people with my family's car. doing all this activities with my friends. Usually it was peer pressure. never wanted to do that stuff. i was stealing latest iphones from people that i knew. men i could say alot..... was doing a lot of stupid and crazy stuff. i was hanging out girls and playing with them. At the same time karma kept happening to me. Car getting towed...getting my first speeding ticket....cops stopping us because we smelled like weed.... .
i was trapping all night. Would come home around 5am high as hell. Mom and i would get into argument. Never did i expect my mom to find out about my smoking. Until one day someone snitched on me and told my mom that i smoke. Since that day my relationship with my mom has went down.
Now the end of the summer...2 weeks before school started. Had a talk with my mom . Cried to her that i would change. Told her how i fucked up in my classes. She told me not to regret the past and move on to change my life for the better.
2017 Fall....taking 5 classes. One easy online one. am re-taking two classes. Algorithms and systems programming, a .NET class,..and two other non-CS class.
Anyways by now you are like......this guy should not be making the same mistake.
The thing is since the semester started...my goal was to change.i been studying ....been trying. But somehow managed to fuck up in 2 of my midterms. All these by the way is my fault. Still smoking weed okay. actually i smoke it everyday now. I dont work....my mom been paying for my rent and food.i worked over the summer but did not save money.
The last month or so ...the effort has been to change . Been watching a lot of motivational videos...been trying out all this so i can change. But then it doesnt last for more than a week or two. Am back to the same old habits.
Just about a month ago...i opened up to one my closest friend and she gave me a different answer. she said something about we cant date because you dated my friend. She still wanted to be friends with me and all that. Decided to end my friendship with her. went to a deep depression mode again. i basically cut off all the people now. i realized that people were moving differently and they weren't helping me move forward.
So since last month i been trying to change. one thing that i have been consistent was going to the gym. Been studying and trying to catch up to my classes. but then again i would have a relapse. Get mad at myself. smoke pot . Am at the point of trying adderal so i can focus and stuff. Been documenting my life and stuffs through videos.
But the last two weeks am back to the same shit
Am at the toughest point in my life now...i have like 2 weeks left of school. the classes are getting heavy. i did most of the projects but they were not easy. There is more shit to be turned in and tests to study for . i went to the point where i paid someone to do my algorithm project. because i did not have time to do it.
All i wanna do now is really catch up with my classes. i realized i been lying to myself in my studies. i study but i dont really study. Am very confused.
I like computer science...i really wanna be good at programming. i wanna get good in algorithms. i wanna get an internship at microsoft. i wanna turn my life around. i been saying i will change for the past 4 years. sometimes i cry in my changing phase....something tells me i will never change.
RIGHT NOW ALL I WANT IS PASS MY CLASSES. my grades are B,C,C,A,F. i have to pass it. Most of the classes am retaking it...and i cant imagine fucking up again. it will held me back.
Someone please help me ....tell me something....my life is a mess

Someone I know referred me for software engineer but a recruiter also contacted me on LinkedIn and I said okay -- I am guessing this is how my application got turned into that position.


*1. I plan to email the recruiter and ask them if I can convert my final interview to software engineer? Any advice on how I should word it?


*2. What does the service engineer position entails?


*3. I have an offer for other company as SWE but I really like to join Microsoft. Should I join them as Service engineer intern and convert to SDE full time? (is this possible?)


*4. Is the interview process different from software? as I am more prepared for software (doing leetcode and cracking), do I need to something else for that position?

7fpueg,2,2017-11-26,"2nd year Pharmacology student in the UK, looking to go into bioinformatics. Any advice?",eddyekko,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7fpueg/2nd_year_pharmacology_student_in_the_uk_looking/,"So I'm in my second year of uni in Scotland, where Bachelors last four years. This year was the first time my course actually had any coding in it (we're learning to use R for data analysis), and I found that I really, really liked it. Like it was the most fun I've had at uni, in a class, in the past two years. Pharmacology as my uni is part of a more general neuroscience, anatomy and physiology, and reproductive biology course, so I've had a fairly wide-ranging education in the biomiedical sciences so far, but the most fun thing I've done is still coding. 

However the electives available for people in my course are pretty restrictive; many mandatory (as in must pass in order to get an Honors) course next year require/recommend I take certain courses this year, meaning that my one elective slot is essentially full. So I can't take any dedicated computer science courses.

However my uni is aware of how important R and coding is, and we're all meant to be fluent in R by the end of the program. So my question is:

Is going into a Bioinformatics Msc in 2 years worth it, with only my Pharmacology/biomed background knowledge? Will I be able to learn enough in that 1 year span to work effectively in industry/academia? What kind of work would I be able to get (making simulations, analyzing data, etc...), and how similar is it to normal data analysis? 

What would the pay be like? How transferable are the skills to normal programming? Do people ever make the shift from industry bio-informatician to industry programmer/ software developer? How similar is bioinformatics to data science, and should I consider going into that instead, or are the skills transferable enough that I could theoretically go from working in bioinformatics to working in data science?

Is bioinformatics a good, fun industry to go into? One of the reasons I chose pharmacology is because I like applying scientific knowledge, but 2 years in the thought of getting the Phd needed to actually design drugs is pretty daunting. Would work as bio-informatician satisfy that drive?

And finally, what should I be doing now to give me an edge? I'm already learning to program at places like Code Academy; are there better resources out there I'm missing? Do companies even offer internships in bioinformatics? What would relevant work experience look like, and what's the best way to get it with my background?

Thanks in advance!"
7fpvxz,5,2017-11-26,[REQUEST] Assassin's Creed: Origins (17% discount on Steam),EpicChiguire,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/7fpvxz/request_assassins_creed_origins_17_discount_on/,"Hi! I hope you guys are doing great. I am EpicChiguire and I'm a gamer from Venezuela (and currently in Argentina). 

**What game would I like? (duh)** I would like to ask for Assassin's Creed: Origins. As many of you may know, Assassin's Creed is one of the biggest sagas of the last years. Groundbreaking and recognized for its incredible renditions of many cities and places of the ancient worlds (from the Middle East to the Caribbean), it has many followers and haters alike. I, for one, am one of the fans of the saga. I played the first Assassin's Creed back in 2008 when I was in High School, and I was hooked on ever since. The possibility of playing as a badass Assassin during the Third Crusade (one of my favorite periods) was super cool, and then trying to uncover a conspiracy in the Modern Day at the same time... man, those were the days. I remember I'd play it on my dad's PC with his GeForce 8400GS of 512mb DDR2 with all minimum and still have lots of fun. I still can remember that melancholic Sunday when my relatives came over and I played a bit after I left (not that it's a meaningful memory, but it really takes me back to when everything was better... no crisis, no having to live away from my pops, etc). Then came Assassin's Creed 2. First time watching an E3 trailer. 13/14 year old me was ecstatic. That's when I was introduced to Ezio and the Renaissance. Up until then, everything I knew about that historical period was a couple of facts and that was it. Now armed with my dad's powerful GPU on my own PC (yep, still that 8400GS), I submerged myself into that beautiful world of Florence and Venice (and still had one of my nerdiest moments when I played with Desmond in the MD), and subsequently, in Rome. Revelations was kinda good but the performance was a little bit lacking (my GPU was struggling a lot with it). Come AC3, and my PC couldn't handle it. I had to wait until the Christmas break in order to play it on my dad's laptop (an i3 with an HD3000). It was something, and it allowed me to play that (and have one of the biggest nerdgasms when playing as Desmond in Abstergo) and Black Flag (all in minimum at 15-20 FPS), and regardless of the terrible performance, I completed both those games because I was really into that saga (even though I hated what happened with Desmond). I wasn't able to play Unity and Syndicate up until a couple of months ago (thanks to a couple friends that let me play on their consoles while I was able to upgrade to a better machine), and even though both were underwhelming, they're still not that bad. (And don't kill me for this, but I loooooved the AC movie. For real.) Now, Assassin's Creed: Origins has earned good reviews and has been praised by critics and fans alike. It has been said (according to Reddit lol) that it is the worthy successor to AC2 and that it is not only as good as AC2, but to some it's even better than Ezio's first game. As a huge AC nerd, I would love to play this game, for real.

**Why can't I get it by myself?** Now, I can't buy this game because it's worth 50 bucks right now (with the Steam Autumn sale). I'm taking my Internships in Argentina (and I basically moved here from Venezuela), and I literally can't work because said Internships are full time and I don't have the time to work somewhere else. Given the fact that this University is giving me food and accommodations, they deemed necessary to give me 100$ a month in order to pay for my personal expenses. I can't complain because I get food and a place where to sleep, but taking into account the fact that I am from Venezuela (my country is in the worst crisis of its history, to the point where the minimum wage is 1 DOLLAR A MONTH), and I am living in another country on my own (away from my parents and my siblings, whom I miss with all I am). I need to save every single penny I can in order to start maintaining myself while I get a job and a place to live after I'm done with these internships. I don't even have the money to go back to Venezuela for Christmas, and I am very much likely to spend my first Christmas ever away from my old folks and my brother and sister (and the sole idea of it breaks my heart and really depresses me, to be honest).

So the idea of getting Assassin's Creed: Origins, a good game from a saga that means a lot to me and that takes me back to when I lived better days, in order to play it in the following days, where I'll be away from my parents in what is (arguably) the most important date of the year. I know videogames aren't the answer, but I think that they can help to cope with some stuff (like this, for example). [Here's my Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/coqueroman) and here's Assassin's Creed Origins [Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/582160/Assassins_Creed_Origins/).

7fq7i4,1,2017-11-26,Waking up.,420smokedaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7fq7i4/waking_up/,"I apologize in advance if this makes no chronological sense/the general format, and is an unintelligible wall of text. 

I feel like I've finally woken up to a reality that I am shocked and disgusted by, and I’m so ashamed that this is the life that I’ve led.

I'm a 25 year old ""college graduate."" I use that term loosely because the only reason I received my degree was because I was able to float through with a ~2.0 average (C’s get degrees haha!), and beg enough teachers to pity me and pass me in the courses I was failing.
 I spent my time in college:
-smoking weed
-playing video games
-getting blackout drunk in a fraternity I had no business being in, trying to chase girls way out of my league

I say this because going into University, people told me that I should be proud of myself and they were proud of me. My older brother and I were raised by a single, immigrant mother. We had a household income that was just enough over the poverty line to not be able to receive any federal assistance. 
My mother was able to work 2-3 jobs and push me to a point where I somehow received a full ride to a top 25 University. (I would argue that it was because I got into a niche degree that had few applicants but I digress)
And what did I do with that golden opportunity? Absolutely nothing.
My only concerns while I was at university was to work enough hours that I could smoke weed and buy alcohol to sufficiently fade myself into an oblivious trance. My mother paid for rent, she paid for my fraternity dues, she called everyday trying to help me succeed; sentences that disgust when I remember how I reacted to them.
 I ended up quitting or being fired from every student job I had. Some lasted a few months, one lasted a year (I even worked my way up, was promoted, received a raise). All off stupidity, impulse, or a desire to skip work and get high too many times.

The summer before my senior year, I’m able to get a job as an intern for a professional sports team; something I had always wanted and felt that I would finally work hard for. The weekend before fall semester, I rupture my achilles playing pickup basketball. I was terrified at the possibility and believed the school health center doctor when he told me it was just a contusion (bruise). After limping my way around campus for 3 weeks, I finally get an MRI and discover that its ruptured and will need surgery. I kept my mother in the dark for all of this. The day before I go into surgery, I inform her of everything. Like a spoiled brat, I’m angry with her when she comes to visit me before she has surgery. She tells me she’s been diagnosed with breast cancer. To write this all out now, and to think of how I continued to lead my life kills me.

After surgery, I spend my time doing the only thing I knew how to do: play video games. When I return to University, I spent my entire time playing League of Legends while I watched my peers graduate and move on with their lives. I stay for a 5th year due to failing some of my courses as a freshman/sophomore. I probably spent at least 10 hours a day playing video games or just trying any way to distract myself on the internet. All while high off the money my mom had been giving me for me to complete school. Not studying, not finding a job, not doing anything but selfishly feeling sorry for myself, I wasn’t even trying. 

After somehow graduating I come home. I could not have been more of a typical neckbeard at this point. I play video games all day, I babyraged at my mother whenever she mentioned that I shouldn’t be smoking weed in her house. I tell her its the only way of coping with the shitty life that I now had. The only times I left my room were to eat. I eventually give in to my mothers demand to get a job, one at a local community college. It pays well, the people are lovely and its generally a great work environment.

Slowly but surely, my life begins to show small improvements. I began exercising again, I began socializing and reconnecting with some of my friends who had been there for me my entire life. We adopted a dog that brought joy and a sense of family back into our home. For the first time in a long time, I begin to feel whole again. For 6 months I was taking incremental steps toward being a normal contributor to society and finding full time employment.

And then I run off getting into a relationship.

I met this girl on a dating app. For some reason, I had the audacity to think that I was ready for a relationship while I was barely holding my own life together. She told me about how hard her family life was, how everyone had given up on her, how she had been abused. I listened, my mom opened up her heart and gave this girl a place to sleep when she was having difficulties with her roommates. She listened to me, she smoked and seemed to genuinely care about everything I said, and I felt like I finally found someone who just loved me for me. We run away together one night after my mom attempts to tell me that this girl is not healthy and is using me (after knowing the girl for little more than a month….). I quit a well-paying administrative job that had very real possibilities of becoming full time work. I tell my lifelong friends to go fuck themselves after they showed up to my door hoping to intervene.

Fast forward 3 months, 5.5K of debt, and many a sleepless night arguing or in a hospital after a feigned suicide attempt, and the relationship is over. I came crawling back to my mother to try and fix this situation I had gotten myself into, admitting to how stupid of a mistake I had made. The girl had no one and no means of paying the rent after losing her jobs during the hospital stays: she’s now moved to another state. My mother sold the house while I was away out of fear, and out of a belief that all parties needed to move on with their lives.

So here I am now. I have no friends, I have no job, I’ve not only ruined my own life but dragged that girl down with me. I’m now living in a condo with my poor mother who’s given her life to just give me a chance that she never had. I’ve been sober for 16 days, slowly but surely letting the reality sink in from the decisions I’ve made leading up to this point. All of those selfish, impulsive, childish decisions.

I don’t know how to move on from all of this. I’ve seen psychologists and addiction specialists, but no amount of drugs in the world is going to fix the fact that I’ve been running from responsibility and accountability. I have no one to blame but myself.

I know there are so many people who have had it so much worse than me, and I know that for so long I’ve been a whiny entitled bitch who feels like the world owes him something and has just been wallowing in self-pity. 

For now, I'm applying for jobs and trying to find some semblance of self confidence to move forward, and I hope one day I can give back to all those that invested in me.

I've been programming for close to a year now, and I've really been learning a lot, especially in the courses I'm currently taking towards my certificate in programming/web development.  I realize I'm nowhere near being a mature software developer or anything like that, but I'm curious as to where I am on the spectrum of learning.  To give you a more specific idea of what I know how to do so far, we've just gotten into creating classes (true object-oriented programming) in my C# class and previous to that we were covering structures, enumerators, tokens, and 2D arrays. Besides that, we've just covered tree structures, session variables, cookies, and query strings in my ASP.NET course.  I know those are still beginner concepts, but how much so?  How much more proficiency do I need until I can get a (hopefully paid) internship or an entry-level job?  

I still have four courses to go for my certificate, most of which I'll be taking next semester.

Thanks!"

**Opportunistic**

Rick (a nearly underage boy ) watches you shiver craving for cock, his eyes look at your red lips and down at your cleavage as he realises he has a chance to fuck a much older girl, in fact this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load.
""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you press ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Basically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her

B.) taken off since it's not 18+appropriate

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/

remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png

I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

7fqoqb,2,2017-11-26,just a story which i want to share,Dellidelldell,heartbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/7fqoqb/just_a_story_which_i_want_to_share/,"LONG READ AHEAD:
So there was this girl. We are on the same school and we had the same internship. Through there i started to develop a crush out of nowhere. But she already had a boyfriend. Which just kept hitting me in the face everytime i saw her. I kept trying to get her attention all the time. Sometime later i heard from her that her boyfriend was getting jealous because i was talking so much to her. They even had some fights about it she said to me. So i tried to get less attention from her because i didnt want to have a fight. Friends of her have told to my friends that she liked me aswell and because she had fights with her boyfriend many times. Her friends even told me and i didn't believe it. They said like it isn't going well with their relationship and she wants to break up with that boyfriend and go with me. I still did not believe it and still did not make a move. after a while their relation ship almost ended. At that time i felt really sorry. i wanted to fix it and accidentally gave her more attention which ended up getting me to being in love i think. at that time she got harrassed by a friend of her. he just using her to try to get her to bed with him. She told me that, and i got so angry. i litteraly wanted to go to his house and do things that are not allowed to be done. She said don't you will hurt him. And i can still hear that voice which just in a snapsecond changed my mind and calm me down. later it happend her relationship with her boyfriend was over. She was devastated because it was a relationships that lasted for 3,5 years. I wanted to be there for her even more. I tried to talk to her everyday to make her forget about it. Like 1 weeks later her class went on a school trip. Her boyfriend and her best guyfriend were that class, they know eachother since elementary school. After the trip was over i asked how the connection was between her and her 'ex' and she said that she needed to cry everytime she saw him. And yet again i wanted to be there for her. My birthday was like a week later and i invited her. She asked me, ""what do you think about that he and i broke up?"" I said, ""well on the other hand its good because you had much fights"" on the other hand i think its sad and i dont want to see you sad. I kept on trying to talk to her as many times as i could. for weeks i have been going the dunes on the beach to think. to think about her, and how im going to tell her that i have feelings for her. Until then. It was a monday and i told my friends and one of her best girlfriends that i am going to tell it to her on friday. I've been going to the dunes for that week every single day. Just to think about how i am going to say it and what i am going to say. I've cried a little everyday because overthinking happened.
So it was Friday. I sent her a message that i wanted to talk to her about something important. she said it was fine and so internship was over. we walked to the exit and i waited till everyone else was gone. and then she asked "" so what did you want to tell me"" and then somehow my fear just left me. i said to her  "" i have been needing to tell you something for a very long time"" she was like what?! I said "" *name of the girl*, i have feelings for you"" and then it got silent for a moment and then everything i planned saying, i told her. I told her what i think of her, her eyes, smile etc.. That she was always posivite no matter what happened. And that she just makes me feel happier when i talk to her when i had a rough day. I could go on telling what i said more but it would take too long.  anyway getting back to the point. The first thing she said ""I think it's really tough of you telling me this, I have never really thought about it you feeling this way"". "" No one ever said something this sweet about me"". "" but i need to tell you something"" ""and I find it so bad to say , but I do not feel the same about you, i do not know what my feelings want at this point with all that has happened"". and there was me trying to be strong and just said like "" its fine, its going to be ok, ill get over it"" and she said "" no you wont you will walk around with it for a very long time"". After that i hugged her so tight i never wanted to let her go.. After that we walked to her car and she said  i never thought that you would feel this way about me, then i said well now you know.. and im happy that i told you. so we were at her car and i hugged her one more time for like 15 seconds or something. and then she stepped into her car. I told her ""luckily we are still friends"" and i pet her head and then she drove away. Untill the next morning i didn't realize it yet but when that morning happened i realized it, and i cried so hard. i kept saying to myself that it was a waste of time and energy. so i texted her still wanting to try. So i texted somewhat like "" you know you told me yesterday that you dont know what you want. So here i ask you again do you want to try with me?"" which she responded to as ""*my name*, this is going to be the toughest thing i am ever telling you but there is something going on between me and *her bestfriends name*."" And then it came down on my, i felt like a wreck. First thing i asked was for how long already. And she said that it was since that trip they went on. A week after she broke up with her ex. Which just litteraly blew my mind. The day after we had internship again. and when it was over we walked  to her car which ended up being a routine since i started to like her. and i asked ""so you and *bestfriends name* huh?"" and she just said ""yeah well we dont know what we are either we have been best friends for so long"" which i just called straight bullshit on. i said to her ""so you are going together since the trip huh? A week later after you broke up?"" And where she responded to with "" We were both drunk and we kissed"" my heart just shattered into pieces. angry thoughts started to get into my head. So i told my best friends about what happened and stuff. And because we were still friends i just asked her a week before internship if she wanted to eat for lunch before next internship and she said sure. And then like a day before i texted her the time and stuff. and then she responded with the most heartbreaking respond ever. "" i had to think long about this. I have heard from various people that you've been angry at me, therefor i think we should lay off contact for a while and not hang out. Only at internship we will"" I died like 5 times when i read it. I responded with"" well if that is what you want, i'll do it. I still want to keep you happy."" And then summerholidays came. Did not talk or see her for 2 months. and actually developed a shortterm crush for someone else but now that we have school again and we talk, there is always this awkward atmosphere around, atleast in my eyes. Like i have been in love with you for like 9 months and i cant forget that, i spent so much time and energy to you, how do you not think the same? I know she probably thinks i am having a hard time with her new releationship. which i did in the start but i don't really now. Just a little but because its that feeling you have that you have spent so much time trying to be there for her that there is still a small jealous feeling. I still find it so unfortunate that we do not have the same contact as we used to have. I don't mind being a friend of her, because now i do not have feelings anymore for her, atleast its what i think because sometimes i still doubt myself. But one thing i do really miss, is the feeling i had, the moments, the fun. It just saddens me sometimes when im in bed thinking about life. and i just keep thinking to myself, what if you actually made a move and/or told her earlier. what would've happened? i just miss the time i had with her. I'm stuck between i don't want to feel that type of hurt again and i want to feel that type of love again. I just want to be good friends like we were but without the awkward atmosphere that i feel. But until then i just start to work on my own dreams and goals. Im tired of chasing love, i'll let it come to me. The best of love happens when you are least expecting it to. I'll let love find me and when it happens i know that we are meant to meet eachother on purpose.

Thank you"

I want to be a software engineer or programmer, basically anything related to programming or coding/CS. 
My GPA will be around 3.85 UW this year (junior) maybe higher. 1430-1520 possible SAT score. But, my freshman and sophomore years were seriously lacking (Bs and Cs in my core honors classes but they were rigorous), with an average of around 86-90. But, this year, I will have way higher grades in my core classes, 2 are AP, all high As. Does this upward trend help at all? I am a VP of a club, president next year. Might do an internship this summer. 
Any college ideas? My main focus is good price/Financial aid, and opportunities for internships, jobs, and connections. I'm from NY. 
Also this is sorta a stupid question but will being a girl possibly affect admissions? I noticed a lot of CS programs are almost 80% guys and it seems like they might want more diversity. Hopefully they will be more lenient but let me know.
I was thinking Rensselaer. Any chance of better schools like Carnegie Mellon, Rice, Tufts, etc...? My dream school was university of Colorado at Boulder due to the amount of startups and internships, but it's way too expensive as they have bad financial aid especially out of state.

7fraxr,8,2017-11-26,44F4A - Open-minded MILF teacher!,MarriedMILFMischief,DPPprofiles,https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/7fraxr/44f4a_openminded_milf_teacher/,"Hello, all.

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things.

I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone.

*Mother/Son*

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...

*Other*

* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Minnie has black hair up in two small messy buns. She often wears a floral design embroidered pink bomber jacket, jeans, and white sneakers. In Elysium, she often changes avatar’s appearances. Today’s outfit is a semi-formal half-sleeved navy dress with white cuffs and collar. Her hair is now mid back and has a redder tone. Though don’t be surprised if she has something stupid in her closet like a cat meido outfit.

Minnie is usually slow and it isn't unusual for her to be in a confused daze. She can also be lazy, but can be easily motivated with free food, particularly milk tea. If it doesn't interest her, she doesn't particularly mind anything. Though for things such as work, she is able to look and act focused and competent. 

 **Bio**:


Originally from Cali, Minnie is currently attending NYU as a business undergraduate. She interns at Ono, a company that specializes in VR hardware. She has two sister. The elder is ten years older while the younger is only two years apart. She was never close to either unfortunately, but still looks up to the eldest. 

Minnie joined Elysium because it was a popular trend in the early days. Chatting and making friends was fun, but what really drew her in was the avatar dress system. Not having much money, she’d enter many contests and giveaways in order to accumulate some clothes, which she would then sell to others in the user market. Once she accumulated a meager sum of money, she’d include buying items marked up cheap or even haggle lower prices to sell for more later. Of course, she’d occasionally keep or even buy some things for herself. But for the most part, it was all about buying low, selling high. Over months and years, she’d accumulate a large amount of costumes, clothes, limited edition items, and funds. Minnie particularly enjoys collecting rare or silly costumes and will often go out of her way at the news of new releases to get her hands on one. Her favorite is a giant pickle costume which was popular during the Pickle Raids. 

Minnie may or may not have side accounts where she ran her side business and as extra storage space. Though because of school and work, she may or may not rarely go onto these side accounts anymore and now hosts her own giveaways and contests in order to clear up the sheer surplus. Lately, she’s been mostly using Elysium for work and chatting. If she ever did want anything new nowadays, she could easily just sell something of hers and buy it or just use her own money. 

It was fair season, and Minnie was especially excited for this one. The tenth anniversary usually meant there’d probably be some exclusives. She did sign up for the lottery, but didn’t need to in the end. The company she worked at had many new lines to showcase at the fair and were particularly close to the Olympus Corporation. They had many, many invitations available that even a low intern like Minnie could get one. 

 **Additional Notes**:

Most of her personal collection is worthless. "

I (f20) really need your help. First of all: Please no ""moral"" accusations. I know that what I've done could be considered amoral- but that really is not the question here:
I think I'll just start with the story then:
You must know that I have just recently started an internship at a company. My ""boss"" (who's more like a supervisor or what ever) is a really strange guy. He's about 18 years older than me, not good looking, bordelrine alcoholic and addicted to ativan. Oh, and he's got a 19 year old girlfriend. They're engaged too. He seems to have narcissistic tendencies ( though I'm not sure whether that could be caused by the pills he pops like freaking skittles.) and he really behaves like an asshole. On my first day he started hitting on me. Flirting. I thought yeah just an old fashioned chauvinist- nothing to worry here, right? After a week he wanted to meet up to go ""camping"" (we all know what that really meant) but I told him no. Well, as time went by we started to get along really well despite his behaviour. Sometimes he gave me a ride home in his car but he never really tried anything serious. The usual hand on my thigh- not that bad. After a really fun day at work he randomly messaged me ""I love you""- no context at all. I told him that I did not feel that way about him and he appeared sad but accepted it. 
But then I got drunk and horny and messaged him that I was attracted to him. Which I was somehow- and here starts the tricky part: I started fantasizing about him, even though I really think he's disgusting. He wanted to meet me right away but I declined.
 After a while I found out about a girl that had an internship at this company before I worked there: He messaged her that he loved her too and she got so scared that she left. The funny thing is: I only found out about that because he told me that she'd had sent him dirty messages about how she wanted to get fucked by him at the office and all that. Since I couldn't believe him I asked a co-worker who told me the truth.

A normal person would stop contact with that guy - right?

Well I started to get really aroused over the fact that he had played me like that. 
I told him that I knew everything and he didn't deny it. 
A few days after I got drunk again and messaged him that I wanted him.
We couldn't meet up because of his girlfriend ( who is very controlling).
One day it got really late at the office and he invited me to drive me home. He put his hand on my thigh and somehow he ended up fingering me and I gave him a handjob. 
This happened again a few days ago.

I really don't know what's going on with me. I know that he's only playing a game with me, that he's got a girlfriend and all that. I find him unattractive but somehow his touch makes me feel like a fire just went through my whole body. I get really, really wet when he touches me too. 
I often think about him when I'm alone- I am starting to worry.

What is wrong with me? Why do I feel like that about a guy who's a manipulative A**hole? What should I do? Should I stop this, even though it feels so unbelievably good to be touched by him?
Please help me.

I really hate writing, and that is a large part of being a professor, and with my ADHD, a job that unstructured sorta seems like hell. 
But I love the research, and I love network science.



Here are my possible paths as I see them:

1. Get my PhD in Computer Science or a related field like Informatics

2. Get my masters in applied mathematics and get a job as an analyst at an agency or company. While doing this I could publish the research I have been working on and take my math GRE which would open up applied mathematics PhD programs alongside the computer science ones.

3. Get a job without getting my masters

4. ?

Background:
*Triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Sociology
*summer internship at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, helping the analysts
*Two summers doing social network analysis research at an REU

Likes:
*Doing something that has a positive impact on humanity (or at least not a negative one. I.e. not verizon, weapons contractors, etc)
*Structure
*Problem Solving
*Being the computational or mathematics expert on a team of people from other backgrounds

Dislikes:
*Excess of writing
*High stress
*pseudo-science

Intended major: electrical or mechanical engineering

Main Extracurriculars: 

- been playing piano for 13 years, cello for 11 years; 

- founded a music technology project when I was a freshman, which grew to a team of 12 college students, which I lead. We do lots of rapid prototyping, electronics, coding, UI design, etc., and we give workshops and do public speaking at local schools and festivals (this is a huge time commitment for me, I spend 30h/week in peak periods, and we all meet once a week for a few hours). If all goes according to plan, we will apply for a patent by the end of this academic year.

- president of a service organization (alumni from a children's convention), and currently leading a recycling initiative with the Federal Reserve

I don't have many extracurriculars compared to some other people on this sub, but at least they are genuine passions.


I've been auditing college courses at a top university since freshman year, and the professors have been super-nice, so they let me participate in projects and take exams (hence the weighted GPA). So far, I've taken around 13 undergrad/grad courses, almost all in STEM fields (ECE, CS, math, physics). This sets me on track for some solid rec letters.

I'm planning on taking 10 AP exams at the end of the year, almost all in STEM or language subjects.

To complicate matters, we frequently move for my mom's job (I haven't spent a whole year in the same place since middle school), and next semester I will be in China. I will have an internship with a manufacturing firm, but it also means I won't have any actual grades for spring of my junior year...

I want to study electrical or mechanical engineering, at a top university, preferably with a good business program. My dream is to work in a manufacturing industry.

My parents keep telling me that I will get into wherever I want to go, and everybody will be flooding me with scholarship money, blahblahblah. It's very frustrating, because I need to take initiative on everything -- signing up for exams, looking for opportunities, etc. I literally found out about the NMSQT three weeks before I needed to sign up, and as a homeschooled student, it's very hard to find schools that are willing to proctor my exams. My parents are highly educated but they didn't go to college in the US, so they just assume that getting a good score on a bunch of exams will guarantee university admission.

I really want to make sure I'm doing all this right, so if somebody could tell me if there are any opportunities that I need to apply for, or if this going to China for the spring is going to mess stuff up, etc., that would be super helpful. Also, should I retake the SAT?

Thanks so much!!!

TL;DR: I have pretty good stats, but as an independently homeschooled junior, I have no clue if I'm doing stuff right."

7fsmxk,2,2017-11-26,Should I delay graduation by a semester to take an extra Co-op?,FoxRush17,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7fsmxk/should_i_delay_graduation_by_a_semester_to_take/,"Hey guys,

I'm in a bit of a pickle and thought it would be a good idea to seek some opinions of other engineering students!

I'm a mechanical engineering student in my junior year.  I have had an internship last summer and have an internship lined up for this upcoming summer.  I'm on track to graduate in 4 years but received a pretty good offer from another company to Co-op during the next (Spring) semester, effectively delaying my graduation by a semester.

I've had a lot of different thoughts on the matter:

For one, it's a good opportunity in product development which is what (I think) I want to persue as a career.  My previous internship last summer was in product development, however, the company was a chemical company and the job dealt more with chemical engineering/chemistry while my current co-op offer on the table gives me the chance to dive into mechanical systems (which as a ME I do find much more interesting).

On the other side of that I'll be graduating late and be roughly 7-9 months delayed from a real full-time salary.  I will have 2 internships (one in product development and one in manufacturing) and some design team experience.  Much of my family says that I will be fine getting a job and can figure out my passions throughout my experience through actual jobs out of college.

Is it really worth delaying my college graduation for this experience?  It looks like a great position and all, but at the same time it's not like this is my dream job I'm pursuing, it's just a great way to see if I like this area of work.

I think it's also worth mentioning that I have a great group of friends that I do homework and study with and they are half the reason I have a 3.6 GPA as opposed to something like a 3.4.  I would be behind in them in most of my engineering coursework if I took this spring semester off from school, however.

I read appreciate all who read this.  It's a lot and I have to make my decision quite soon so I really appreciate any feedback on the matter!"

I would lay odds that your mother knows that you are not asking her this questions to engage in reasonable conversation, but because you want to castigate her. 

How old is your mother? 

I suspect I can tell your answer. Women made a lot of progress in equality throughout the 70s, 80s, and into the 90s.

The 90s gave us the ""boomer"" president. Young and fired up, Clinton, with a professional, tough wife, Hillary.

Then Hillary let down women of her time period in the most specular fashion. It is clear that her husband has, legally on record, had many known affairs in Arkansas, including at least one that Hillary lied about knowing about on National TV that lasted more than 10 years. That her husband had an intern with her tongue in his ass and his cigar in her vagina in the Oval Office, before he came all over her dress. And that the two of them left the White House ""supposedly broke"" because they had to pay $700,000 to settle a sexual assault case. These are the three provably factual legal events. The rumored ones go on and on and on.

And Hillary stuck with him. Lied on 60 Minutes to save her husband's candidacy. Lied and lied. Threw his girl friends under the bus.

Perhaps to you this is a big funny, ""ha ha Clinton likes to get his dick sucked"" ha ha.

But to women of the time - Hillary was a massive, monster step back. 

She didn't care where Bill stuck his dick as long as she got to go along for the ride to the top. His dirty dong was jammed in every hole he could get his grabby hands on. Think of the endless sexual abuse that has been coming out politicians and producers and men in power. Think about what we know about Bill and his proven/admitted proclivities, and then tell me that his time in the White House was not a revolving door of Secret Service delivered girls? And that some of the girls he turned his attentions on had a hard time saying ""no"". Had a hard time with the power disparity? And then... imagine yourself a women in the 1990's, in college, excited because ""glass ceilings"" were shattering everywhere. Only to find out that the most powerful woman in America goes to bed every night next to a man stinking of other women's juices? That she lies for him? That she pays for he victims to go away?

This is why you mom doesn't like Hillary. If Hillary had divorced Bill back in 1992/4/6/8 ??? whenever, then your mom mom might have been wearing an ""I'm with her"" shirt this election. Instead Hillary was the ultimate embarrassment to achieving, smart, capable women in the early 90s.

I heard it from women close to me then, I remember it clearly, in the 90's. I had a friend who catered an event that Hillary was at in 19(93-95?) This smart, college-attending, paying-her-way-through-school friend was given the job of prepping Hillary's private waiting-room water. The friend was a environmental Dem when that was a newish thing. Not so into other politics. I remember her bearing her anxiety to me the afternoon before the event. ""If she sees Hillary, should she scream at her? Should she yell at her? What should she tell her to let her know that she (Hillary) has poisoned the way women will be seen int he work place for years? How can she tell Hillary that the men at college, in the wake of the Monica incident, were openly joking in class that the girls didn't have to study because they could ""Monica"" the professor and get an ""A"". My friend poured the water and never even saw Hillary. But she is still a friend and I know if I called her today she would go red and fill with anger still. She would say, as I have heard her say, ""Why? Why didn't she divorce him? Why did she tell America that a 'good woman' is one that ""stands by her man"" and his dirty dick? Didn't she know what it would do? Didn't she care? Didn't she understand that when I got into my first job in [a high-level field] that men joked constantly in front of the women, especially the interns, about how good 'Clinton got it' and how he was lucky that his 'good wife' covered for him. Did she know I would be told, ""Hey honey, did you hear the news? When a intern sucks your dick, it isn't sex, so it isn't cheating? Har Har Har!'"" And to have to smile and laugh because you need the job, and you have student debts to pay off."" 

So that's why I bet your mom doesn't like Hillary. See if I'm right. Share this with your mom...

...and tell her you want to listen to how she (your mom) feels. And promise not to lecture her about Wikileaks or some shit. You might learn something about how the people closest to you actually feel. And you might be surprised that they have real and important reasons for feeling the way they do.

What other jobs are out there if I want to do more ‘research’?,azile1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/7fsrhz/first_fulltime_job_out_of_university_as_a_credit/,"Hi. I’m starting a full time job after graduation this January as a Credit Analyst. I’m also taking the CFA level 1 exam this December.

So I’m just curious on the different roles out there in Finance that will be a good fit for me. So here’s a bit of a background on my experience and education:

I’m actually an Economics student, and found myself getting into Finance. 

I worked under the personal and commercial banking department in one of the big 5 banks in Canada. I realized I can’t do a &gt;80% client facing role, and so I hated it.

Now as I was writing my thesis in my final term, I realized I like doing research and using econometric models, handling large datasets to interpret and analyze, and presenting data to other people in a very pleasing manner. I realized that I wanna do more ‘analysis’ and ‘research’ roles more than client facing. However, I don’t mind doing a bit of both since I think I can be personable, just not majority of work as client-facing.

That said, I accepted this CA role since I think it will be a foot in the door in the finance industry since I only have the CFA and that internship as my finance background. 

So bottomline: what are good career paths for me in terms of doing research/analysis roles under finance? (Taking into consideration that im taking the CFA and will have this CA experience) 

Thanks! "

This is something I've been tumbling with for the past month and I can't decide what to do. I currently live in Austin and work in advertising. Without going too deeply into it, I basically want to pursue that CS degree. I've only been in advertising for less than a year and I'm already kind of over it. I'm 25 and while I know I'm young, I'd still like to be as time efficient as possible. I'm already learning programming on my own (and enjoying it!) and working on brushing up my math skills (surprisingly enjoying it as well!) so I don't walk back into the classroom completely fresh. 

My options are: 

Stay in Austin, get a CS Associates at Austin Community College (ACC) in one year and if I do well, transfer over to a good college like UT for the second year. That might be tricky though, since I already have a bachelors (140+ college credits) and I just don't see a big college admitting me just for that one year. Everything I've read about ACC looks really great and I feel I could build a solid network there. I'd also have more time to head out to events and meet ups in the Austin tech scene, something that I find hard to do with my full-time job. ACC would be very cheap and I'd be taking classes with some amazing professors from what I've read here on Reddit. Maybe I could even find a part time job or internship once Ive become more well-rounded, especially since Austin is booming. 

 
Go back to UTEP. I graduated from there and heading back should be relatively simple, I'm also familiar with the campus and how everything works there. All the people I know who are in the CS program are very happy with it. The downside being that the tech-scene in El Paso is still in very early stages and a lot of these peeps find it hard to land jobs around town.  Student jobs that are career relevant would also be highly competed for and there's not too many of them. UTEP would be the fastest option as I would probably be able to complete the degree within a year and a half. While social scene doesn't matter as much to me anymore, it'd still be great to know that I have options for when some R&amp;R is needed. That won't be the case as much here, but  I guess that means more time to build my portfolio! UTEP would also be a very cheap option (costs would be around the same as ACC!).  Forgot to mention another advantage, the good thing in my case is that I have good access to people in the EP tech scene, including a mentor or two!



ASU. School looks great, opportunities for career advancement and networking look great and people are very happy in the CS program, Phoenix also has a solid tech scene. Basically everything I've seen about it, I have loved. I would also be closer to home, something I would definitely appreciate. All in all, ASU would probably be my top pick... BUT it's the most expensive one, by a LOT.

moderate drug user here, have been smoking for about a year regularly (weekly while at school and daily when at home). Before that I only every occasionally smoked weed, and never saw myself where I am today.

This past summer I lived in Austin, alone for the first time, and smoked every day while I worked at an internship. When that ended I had my first trip on LSD (half a tab), horrible crippling anxiety the whole time (was with a girl I worked with for two months/was and am still obsessed with) with little to no hallucinations. Inbetween and after that I had a short while where I binged on my dads supply of hydros and codines (probably blew threw 130 pills in 2 and a half months) but got clean when I ran out of supply. After that I tried MDMA, very fun, bad hangover, and then went back to LSD and had a fun time and was able to fight off the anxiety by just walking around banging a drum the whole time. And just on friday I snorted some crystal meth that I thought was just coke, (something I would have NEVER saw myself doing up until the moment it happened); felt like total dogshit the next day and yet I still would be tempted to try it again.

I kinda feel empty right now and am thinking of tripping again this weekend to try and reinstate my wonder into the world or find something meaningful to drive me.
so yeah

I haven't started the proposal or the computer science project yet, and my speech project is only halfway done. I've already failed calculus for this semester as well.

This is my first semester of college and I was expecting something similar to high school, but instead college is kicking my ass. In addition to this, I have more projects due in the next few weeks as well and an internship to attend. As more work piles up I try to avoid it more and more, which is snowballing me into oblivion. I just want to give up but I can't let myself give up, yet it's so hard to force myself to face the work I've ignored for so long.

I know it's my fault and everything but that doesn't make it any less painful. I just can't deal with it like everyone else can.

My dad is going to end me too when he see's my grades for the semester.

Having to deal with my dad at the end of the semester is just adding on stress.

I know exactly what I need to do already and what I've messed up and I don't need you to tell me it again. Please just leave me alone and let me suffer without you making it worse."

Recently just got out of High school in May of 2017 and decided it was best to take a gap year (Along with one math class because I suck at Math) since I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do and I lacked any funds/grants/scholarships/aid to go to college. Although it's really difficult deciding what you want to go into as I've further researched majors. My high school was also not very helpful in this endeavor or in about anything else (Some teachers were pretty good though) and it only makes it harder to do when you see everybody out there already getting a major picked out with a career.

I have had a interest in computers for a long time but it did get elevated to a entire different level when I got a IT internship at High School where we went around the school district, fixed shit, did little projects like a binary clock, or a electronic drum kit. Problem is, I'm a vegetable when it comes to what we did such as coding, networking, or just the basic fundamentals of computer science. I mean, I know how to fix computers, put them together, etc. but the stuff that my Boss/Supervisor knew how to do was crazy and went over my head.

I should probably make it a little bit clearer and a bit more to the point, I'm thinking about majoring in something to do with computers or technology but I have no clue in what such as science, engineering, software engineering and the same goes for where to start in any of those subjects. 

I do have other interests for majors but I feel as they would be lesser options should computers not work out. Would appreciate any help or experienced people in this field.

I have been reading/hearing that Colorado's accounting job market is pretty saturated as many people have been moving to Colorado since the legalization of weed and other things. Due to this, I am a bit worried about my future prospects (especially potential for Big 4 opportunities), and was curious if any Colorado local professionals/informed reddit users could give me any insight about their personal experiences/knowledge.

First, here's some background about me.
I am a junior who expects to end with a 3.8+ cumulative GPA this year, I have an industry internship for next summer (applied to some public accounting firms, but most informed me they generally recruit a year before your MAcc is completed and didn't get any), and plan to hopefully have sat for all 4 parts of the CPA by the time I am done with graduate school (in 2 and a half years).

Some questions I have:

How hard will it be to land an audit internship with a Big 4 company either busy season or summer time during recruiting next fall? What about big regional accounting firms?

If I did the traditional 3 years at a Big 4 firm then switching to industry are there as many exit opportunities as markets like NYC/SF or other markets?

As far as pay is it on par with COL, or is it lower because of the thousands of people moving here?

For Colorado residents, do you ever think about moving because of the job market?

Also any other general advice you have would be awesome!

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to respond!"

Neither of us have any memories of her, and my father [61 M] never remarried. This caused my father's family to assume the strongly dominant role in my family life. I've feel this event has largely determined the course of my and my sister's lives.

I am intensely studious both now in college and have been ever since I can remember, earning self-confidence through grades, sports, and clubs, even ranking in the 98th percentile of my high school class. My sister was less studious, but in college she has really came into her own in the field of psychiatry. We both identify ourselves through our work.

However, I feel really damaged emotionally and sexually. I have no friends, forget girlfriends. Despite how hard I work, sometimes getting only 4 hours of sleep several days a week, writing resumes, coding on my own time, getting internships and the best grades I can, my father's family can only ask about one thing: when are you going to get a girlfriend? For guys at my age, they may as well be asking: when will you stop jerking off?

I never masturbated or looked at anything until I was 20 and a half. I never look at girls in school or college in that way. For years I resisted the temptation to do it, just to spite my family for asking so constantly. In addition to the determination in school, this was a way I could honor my mother, make my life a monument to her. One day I gave in, and the guilt is killing me.

It's been a year now and I've managed to only do it about once every 10 days . . . but I still have to do it. I feel desperately guilty about it, because I know that isn't the way love should be, and I know I'm validating what my family thinks about me. I realize that most people think this is stupid, that everyone does it, but for me it's much more than that. For me, it's a betrayal of my mother. My father stayed by her side until the very end, even when she was no more than a skeleton, and that's what love is. And doing it validates the thoughts my family carries about me.

How do I deal with the guilt over this? How can I minimize having thoughts? Is it even possible to never do it again?"

Ever since the end of 2013, I have tracked every single day of my life. I want to share with you guys how this got me to better my life in the year 2016. How have I used this data to increase the value of my life?

#What 2015 looked like for me

The year 2015 was quite an intense year for me.

I started my career at the end of 2014. Well, that career decided that I would be working abroad sometimes. At the end of January, I traveled to Kuwait to work on a huge project. This was initially very exciting, but a couple of reasons caused me to get burned out rather quickly. This resulted in one of the worst happiness ratings of 2015 on the 9th of February. I was completely miserable and burned out from working &gt;80 hours per week and not sleeping enough. It was my worst day ever, and I rated it with a 3,0.

Back in the Netherlands, things were mostly okay again. Even though my work was still not spetacular, I found happiness in spending time with my girlfriend and running a lot. Running has been a great way for me to get rid of any negative emotions, and I loved the sense of freedom it gives me. I actually finished m first marathon ever in 2015, and I freaking loved the experience. I knew at that moment, that I wanted to run more and become better at it.

In the meantime, my career decided to send me abroad again, to work on another project. And so I went to Costa Rica at the end of May. This was going to be another challenging period, but by tracking my happiness during my previous experience on a project, I knew exactly what I should and shouldn’t do. This period was therefore much better, and I actually enjoyed it, despite working &gt;80 hours a week.

My girlfriend and I were very happy to go on a perfect camping trip to Croatia together in July. We both needed it after busy and challenging periods. This was the happiest month of the year, with an average happiness rating of 8,14. This holiday also produced the happiest days of the year, which I rated with a 9,0.

##Long distance relationships suck

This quickly changed when my girlfriend started her internship in Australia, which meant another big long distance period. This long distance period started at the end of August, and it was simultaneously the start of a period I now refer to as ‘Relationship hell’. This period sent our relationship in a downward spiral, and it was severely affecting my happiness. It was very hard to maintain a level of happiness while my biggest happiness factor (my girlfriend) was gone. My second worst day ever happened during this period, as I got a huge fever on the day my relationship was in the gutter. Another 3,0.

This period lasted until the end of the year. She would actually not return to the Netherlands before the end of January, 2016. It was the hardest period we’ve experienced together, but I’m very happy to say that we came out stronger. It took quite some time before our relationship fully recovered, but as I’m writing this here, I am still very happy in love with my girlfriend.

Fun fact: out of the 365 days in 2015, we spent 209 in a long distance relationship. That’s 57%! Even though I wanted to avoid long distance relationship periods, I obviously failed here... This is how I could have further improved the quality of my life. I should have done better there.

#How to better my life?

At the end of 2015, I looked back on what I did right and what I did wrong. How could I have made my life better? What opportunities did I miss? What are things that I should definitely *avoid* in 2016?

I made a few goals at the end of 2015, that would later help me to **turn 2016 into a better year**.

##No more long periods of work abroad

My whole experience in Kuwait was pretty eye-opening to me. Even though I generally enjoyed my work on the projects, I could never maintain my happiness while working &gt;80 hour work weeks. These periods had a huge effect on my happiness, and I had to give up a lot of my passions in order to survive these periods without burning out. It was just too much. After finishing the traineeship, I wanted to restrain myself from being deployed on another one of these projects. Especially if it was for a relatively longer period. I could survive 2 or 3 weeks, yes, but anything longer than that would likely result in a decreased level of happiness. That was not something I wanted.

This brings me to my next point:

##No more long distance relationship

At the end of 2015, I was still in relationship hell. I was in a long distance relationship that was slowly eating me from inside. I thought my girlfriend and I had a great and strong relationship, but this period – relationship hell – took us close to the edge. Obviously, I wanted no more of that.

This influenced my decision to avoid long periods of work abroad, and both my girlfriend and I knew we had to spend more quality time together in order to recover from this shitty period. Therefore, we both decided that we wanted to avoid long distance relationship periods in the future. No matter how strong a relationship is, I think sustained long distances are capable of crushing any relationship, bond or friendship if you let it. We decided to fight for what we had, but that didn’t mean it was easy. I valued my relationship too much, so I decided to avoid these kind of situations in the future. No more long distance relationship for me, please! This eventually led to a slightly different job at the same company, but one that much better suited me!

##Even more running!

It was very clear to me that I should run even more. After running my first marathon in 2015, I knew I wanted to complete more. So I set myself the goal of finishing 2 more marathons in 2015. I also wanted to further challenge myself, so I determined I wanted to finish a marathon under 4 hours.

In addition, I wanted to run more than 1.000 kilometres in 2016. Running was one of the most consistent positive happiness factors of 2015, so it only made sense for me to try and run even more.

#Deciding to be better

By tracking happiness, I was able to increase the quality of my life by steering it in the right direction. 2016 became a much better year because of the informed decisions I was able to make.

I use this site as a platform to blog about my experiences, and to hopefully inspire more people to also track their happiness, in order to increase the value of life.

7fu9vv,133,2017-11-27,Mental breakdown in class.,Chrizzly841,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7fu9vv/mental_breakdown_in_class/,"Lately I had to deal with more than I'd usually do, and my patience has reached it's limit.
I can't sit in class anymore, because it's silent and I have to hear myself thinking.

Our teacher just randomly asked everyone what they planned to do after graduation. My classmates said stuff like ""Maybe an internship, or a study"" or ""I'm going to do an apprenticeship"".
I started having a panic attack which I tried to surpress. I don't see myself in my future. When my teacher asked me, I just answered ""I want to live.""
Then I snapped, started crying and ran out of the room.
I came back ~10 minutes later to grab my stuff and go home, I also had to make sure that my teacher noted me as absent in the class register. 
When I came in, everyone became silent. They stared at me. They didn't know that I would actually show an emotion as some point. They have always known me as that strange guy who sometimes just stares into nothingness, or as the guy who's always extremely cheerful. They kept staring. No one said anything.

Now I'm at home, in front of my PC. My head feels like it's going to burst, my stomach feels like someone kicked me several times. My legs feel numb. I can feel my pulse in my entire arms. I feel like shit.

I can't do this anymore."
7fuiph,1,2017-11-27,What part of IT might I be good at?,N7Valiant,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7fuiph/what_part_of_it_might_i_be_good_at/,"I'm currently 30 with no experience in IT outside of a required 120 hour internship at my college's internal IT department as a PC Technician Tier 1/2 Support(according to my supervisor).  I have 8 years of retail experience and live on Oahu, Hawaii.  The job market here is very dry on the software dev side, but almost everyone needs IT services of some kind.  One possible market is cybersecurity due to the many military bases we have, but nearly all positions require a security clearance of Secret or higher, which I do not have.

&amp;nbsp;

I will be graduating this Fall semester with an Associate's Degree in IT that is focused towards programming(Visual Studio using C#) and cybersecurity(basically 3 security classes, the last one is not required for the degree, but qualifies me for the CEH exam).  I have a CompTIA A+ and Net+ and am scheduled to take Security+ in the middle of December.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm kind of curious what career path I should take, basically what position I want to aim for, how high up the ladder that position might be, and how to move towards it.  I feel I am strong towards programming, although due to a lack of research I did not focus on Computer Science as you normally would and cannot afford to go back to college either to change majors or continue towards a Bachelor's at the moment.  My immediate concern was getting my foot in the door, work for a year or so, and go back for my Bachelor's.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been eyeing Cybersecurity as a field because of the local job market and I've been told that it's a field with 0% unemployment.  The caveat might be that I need a Bachelor's to get my foot in that particular door.  I'm eyeing the Penetration Tester position, though I'm not quite sure if that plays to my strengths or if there's a non-security alternative.

&amp;nbsp;

I know little about actual hacking and penetration testing in the practical sense.  I was able to follow a walkthrough, make multiple adjustments(because it never works like it says it should), and was able to gain root access to a sickOs VM.  That doesn't make me suitable for pen testing, it just (to me) demonstrates an enthusiasm to jump into something I know little about and perform a lot of on-the-spot troubleshooting to fix whatever issues that prevented me from using my Kali Linux VM to penetrate the other VM.

&amp;nbsp;

My experience as an intern reflected that as well.  I wasn't a fan of the physical labor, the physical installation, spending an hour pulling out all the network cables from 20 computers and moving everything.  But I was like a kid on Christmas morning when the Help Desk brings over a laptop or PC, says it's broken, and they don't know what's wrong with it.  I enjoyed especially difficult solutions that frustrated even my senior coworkers(Windows update hanging, enabling the root account on a Mac to wipe all old install files of McAfee, finding the most efficient way to install all necessary drivers on a wiped Dell PC, how to stop File Explorer from opening up after an image of Windows 10 is put on).

&amp;nbsp;

I will be having an interview soon where I expect to be put at a Help Desk(but more customer service role rather than the hands-on work).  Which is fine to start with, just not sure what the next step is.  Presumably if I can't get my foot into security until I have a Bachelor's, what position should I try to shoot for that would best qualify me?  I have it in my mind that my path should be something like Help Desk ---&gt; ? ---&gt; ? ---&gt; System Admin ---&gt; Security Analyst ---&gt; Pen Tester.  Also plan to pick up CEH, CCNA, CCNA-Sec, CASP, OSCP, CISSP along the way."

I personally played alot of matches as her or against her and i have to say she is fairly balanced, besides some things. Mostly her E beeing really strong and her W beeing depending on luck, I thought of some changes:


W: take away the RNG depending effect and give her an extra bar similar to the one Orrn, Kindred and Rengar have (hope you know what i mean). Give her the ability to choose wich item/Summoner comes with the next minionwaves (all 3 lanes), but also the chosen item/Summoner gets a CD (about 300 sec and an intern 15 sec CD before you can choose the next item). This will give you a better choosing of your playstyle(Aggressive on lane/supportive for other lanes) and your opponent a better control of which Items she cant get for some time. Choosing nothing, will result in a wave without the Itembubble. Item CD does not scale with CDr.


Also thought of a change making her able to choose from Items availabe after reaching lvl 6 or 8.

Quite long, TL:DR beneath.",Karl_Fischer96,TMJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/7fv8dk/my_story_whats_helped_me_and_some_questions_quite/,"Hi there! Bear with me as this will be a slightly exhaustive message, but I hope you manage to get through it! I wanted to give my full experience as it often connects many dots and gives the reader a chance to give their full feedback. Also, I would like to hear other stories/personal experiences from others, as I know how depressing it can be when you try to explain it somebody but they don’t really acknowledge or care about what you say… So, I thought, where better to post my personal experience, than on a TMJ forum?? 

TL:DR beneath!

Quite a lengthy overview (for those who are interested, as there may be important bits):

Roughly around end of June/start of July, I began suffering from neck stiffness and headaches/pain in my neck. I was also suffering from these weird events during my sleep where I'd wake up suddenly feeling low in breath or my body jolting. These events seemed to be occurring more frequently and had begun around April.

Around this time, I was also preparing for my uni exams, had to find an internship (short time constraint + several rejections = high stress), was dealing with a relatively large financial investment and trying to create my own online business... all at the same time (not the smartest idea). So, all in all, under some high stress. Unfortunately, this was backed by some underlying traumas related to family and some previous stressful accounts.

On top of this, I stopped gyming around start of June due to a shoulder injury, and told myself I would start again after the exams. This may have been a big problem, considering I used to train 5 or 6 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. This was most likely what kept me going from all that stress. Stopping it, may have been the last ""thread"" that caused my upcoming anxiety attacks.

So, back to the case, around mid-July, I began having severe panic/anxiety attacks. They began occurring more frequently and more severely throughout the month of July, to the point where I had to miss a few exams, had low appetite, very depressed, difficulty sleeping etc etc... During this time, I also went to the dentist after my brother mentioned it could be my wisdom teeth. Lo and behold, I had all wisdom teeth impacted and they needed to be removed ASAP. Unfortunately, due to being sent to a specialized surgeon, it took about 4 weeks until I was able to remove both on my left side (as this was the worst side). During the waiting time I was suffering from EXCRUTIATING pain for days. I Felt miserable due to being loaded up on Anti-Biotics and my previous dentist unfortunately gave me prednisolone (which can have very bad side effects). During the operation, I was very nervous but was glad it was finally going to be over with. During the operation, the surgeon's assistant was yanking my jaw wide open with a lot of force... and it was really hurting my jaw and upper lip. I tried telling them, but they sort of shrugged it off and hardly changed the yanking. The surgery was successful and about after 1 week I was much better (aside from a minor infection - AB quickly cleared it). 2 weeks after the 1st op, I had my 2nd op to remove the right side. This surgery (although my right side was not as bad), was far worse. Took longer, more complications, hurt more etc. Recovery was more than 1 week and I ended up having a bad infection, requiring a very strong AB which heightened my anxiety severely. Luckily about 3 weeks after the 2nd OP, I was doing better, although then my depression/anxiety was still there. Luckily, my mom managed to get me a psychiatrist that deals with anxiety in youngsters and she's been quite helpful.

So now we're roughly in mid Sept. and I began feeling this weird tightness in my neck, all the way up and behind my ear. If I rubbed my neck, it sort of felt nice and helped get rid of that feeling. I was on holiday during that week so couldn't go see a doctor. I had fever of up to 38.2 °C, during 2 days. Again, I decided once I’m back I will go see a Doctor. So, after 2 weeks of this weird feeling/pain, I went to an ENT. He did his checks and said your ears are fine, no infection etc, but you have TMJ and need to go a dentist. (he pressed around my jaw areas and it hurt quite a lot).

At this time, I also began my internship, which unfortunately has me travelling 2 hours there, 2 hours back every day + 8-hour work day. Due to this, it was a bit tricky to get an appointment. Eventually after seeing an orthodontist, she said my bite is good, but my jaw shifts slightly to the right when opening my mouth. She agreed, I had tmj and would need to use a splint and physical therapy. I wanted to get various opinions before making my decision, as I've read that finding a tmj specialist is very difficult. (So around mid-October) my neck/jaw/headache/tinnitus/pains were very bad at this point. Unfortunately, I work an office job so I was trying to work on my posture as well. Finally (after seeing 1 more dentist who agreed on TMJ), I found a great orthodontist who seems to be very specialized in the area. He was a top-notch Dr, and got a mould prepared for me immediately. I am currently waiting for their call to go fetch it. He is going to make me a splint for my upper teeth that prevents me from clenching my teeth together (I think?). I don't grind my teeth at night (based on my what my wife says and both my previous dentists), however I do clench my teeth often. He showed me how the jaw joint works etc and how perhaps due to my wisdom teeth extraction, my joint could have been injured/damaged – which is very common. He explained that the splint needs to be worn 24/7 and after a few months, my bite may become unaligned, therefore requiring a form of correction such as bracers etc. He said this is “worst case scenario” and something he NEEDs to let me know about beforehand, however most cases it doesn’t happen and should help your joint. I started physical therapy recently and although it helps I can’t say I’ve had major improvements from it. I will give it at least 2-3 months before I expect some better results.

I’ve been to both a neurologist and orthopaedic doctor. Both believe it’s due to stress and problems by my jaw joint, however the orthopaedic doctor found slight scoliosis at the bottom of my spine due to leg length difference which may cause pain in my neck region too. I’m getting an MRI done to my neck in 6 weeks (long wait…) in case of problems around my cervical discs. 

I personally believe it is mostly muscular tension that stems from stress and some sort of TMJ issue. I tried going back to the gym yesterday (after having a very bad headache last time I gym’d 1 month ago) and did a light workout, however unfortunately it left me struggling badly at night time with a very stiff neck/jaw and back headache. I will carry on doing exercise, but will stick to light cardio work until my muscles are more relaxed and until I have my splint to give weights another try.

My pains often get worse throughout the day and night, peaking if I use a computer or am sitting on the train. When I wake up I’m usually feeling rested and with minimal pain/discomfort. This has definitely been the case since I began sleeping on my back, with a very soft pillow – although my sleep apnea has worsened from this. However, usually when I go to sleep my neck/head are very stiff/tight when laying on my back and it takes some time before I feel my muscle relax and I can fall asleep. I am considering getting an Orthopaedic Pillow, does anybody have any opinions/experience regarding it?

I’ll add my symptoms in the TL:DR section ahead.

------------------- TL:DR ------------------

So currently my symptoms are (for ~ 3 months) : 

•	Stiff neck/jaw and upper back, with pain running from my trapezius up to the base of my skull (quite sore here), and along my temples to my jaw and behind my eye. I notice it’s mostly on the left side of my head, however previously it would shift from the left to the right (for a period of 2-3 days, before going back to the left).
 
•	I also have tinnitus, which since working out yesterday has definitely worsened. It’s a constant hissing/white noise sound with the occasional 10 second deaf + ringing noise in 1 ear (happens very randomly, but usually once every 2weeks-1month). 

•	I can open my mouth 3 fingers wide before I feel discomfort/pain at my jaw joint.

•	Sleep apnoea that happens while I’m falling asleep (usually 1-3 times a night where I’ll wake up gasping for air and heart racing. My wife says it always scares her when it happens, because it’s so sudden and abrupt).

•	Pressure/pain in my eye and temples (usually left – depends on which side is stiff) which makes it feel like I have blurry vision from that eye.

•	Left Jaw joint shifts “further” or very strangely compared to right joint. Could be the reason for my jaw slightly shifting to the right when opening? No cracking/popping noise.

•	Sometimes get sinus pressure in my cheeks. Also, been dealing with dark phlegm which is stuck in my throat which I “pull?” out and spit out. I imagine TMJ problems can affect sinus.

•	Difficulty using the computer after 2-3 hours, (at work), I begin having bad tension headaches/jaw pains and very fatigued eyes. Before I used to handle 2-3 hours no problem. Could TMJ problems affect this?

•	Irritable / anxiety / slight depression (mostly from all this health issues I’m dealing with)


What am I CURRENTLY doing and BELIEVE has personally HELPED me:

•	Eating a healthy and balanced diet, removing caffeine, drinking lots of water.

•	Magnesium oil which I spray on my feet (will start trying it directly on my neck/trapezius)

•	Meditation (although I need to be more consistent)

•	Sleeping on my back with a soft pillow.

•	Trying to maintain a good posture at all times (tricky)

•	Physio cream/gel (that gets hot after a while) rubbed onto my neck/jaw/back muscles.

•	Physio Therapy – specially designed to tackle TMJ/CMD problems. (although I’ve just started so no major improvements, but slight help)

•	Hot showers where I try to relax my muscles and focus on breathing


What I will be trying and would like some feedback/reviews from your experience with these:

•	Using a splint 24/7 on upper teeth. (I don’t grind, but I clench often and my jaw muscles are very tight based on what my physiotherapist says)

•	Orthopaedic pillow

•	Light daily exercise including running/cycling/stretching/core exercises/yoga

•	Occipivot, check the reviews: https://www.amazon.com/Pivotal-Therapy-Occipivot-System-Component/dp/B000E5DNIW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511788486&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=occipivot


I have some general questions I’d like to ask:

•	What EXACTLY does the splint do to the joint? I understand it prevents you from wearing away your teeth, however, couldn’t I still apply pressure on it with my teeth, which would continue to cause stiff jaw/neck muscles? Or does it place your joint in a position that limits how much effort/force you can apply, therefore keeping your muscles relaxed? Has anybody had any improvements from using the splint?

•	Does anybody here do any weightlifting? How are you able to overcome headaches (if you get any) after workouts? Are your traps/neck/back muscles also very tight and sore?

•	If there is a problem with the discs in my neck (I worry there is), are there things I should be considering/doing which will help with my TMJ too?

Thanks for reading! I look forward to hearing your personal experiences and opinions on my post. "
7fvr1i,2,2017-11-27,Advice for New Grad Offer,Throwaway68936,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7fvr1i/advice_for_new_grad_offer/,"I was recently offered a new grad position for a defense contractor in Schenectady, NY (Small 'city' in Upstate New York, close to Albany). The pay is $61,000 and the benefits are pretty good.

I'm thinking about declining the offer though. The location is not great. Fairly high crime/poverty and harsh winters, so that is a slight issue for me. On top of that, it requires security clearance. The issue there is I've smoked weed within the last ~4 months and it says it's a guaranteed no if I have used any illegal drugs in the last 12 months. Never been a huge smoker, but I've definitely used it throughout college.

I graduate in May and I've had no internships and I have a few good, but not great, projects. I'm really torn because I want to take the offer because getting some experience would be incredibly helpful for me. Paired with the relatively low cost of living in the area, I could live fairly comfortably, albeit in an area I wouldn't enjoy. I'm afraid of not getting another offer and don't want to miss out on my best opportunity. The advice of seen here lately is that if you aren't a very attractive new grad, then you should take a job that you may not love, just to get your foot in the door. This seems to be my best opportunity for that, especially because I'm definitely afraid of not finding another.

I also don't want to go through all of this process just to get denied my security clearance and lose the job anyway. 

Like I said, I don't think I'm going to accept because I'll be denied security clearance anyway, but I'm curious if anyone had any advice or input. Thanks in advance."

I'm currently a 2nd year computer scientist studying in England. Though I have also studied German for a number of years now, and reached a B2/C1 level, though now I'm at university I haven't had the option to practice my German as much and it'd be a shame to lose my language skills after all the studying and therefore would like to spend more time in Germany when possible

However, I also would like to get an internship related to my course. Does anyone know of any websites which may show computer science internships, or placements in general, for foreign university students in Germany (I've been told Berlin is good but I haven't been able to find much whilst searching). 
Preferably the work experience would be 6-8 weeks long. Also, I am a British-born citizen.

I have done one internship while studying and am 25 years old. It is my understanding that since 'Programmer' is on the [long term skill shortage list](http://skillshortages.immigration.govt.nz/developer-programmer), once I get a job offer it should be relatively easy to get a visa.

So I'm just wondering how easy it is to get a programming job in NZ given that I am a recent graduate and don't have a lot of work experience. Are companies desperate for new people or is it just not worth the hassle for companies to hire a foreigner for a graduate position?"
7fwmuq,318,2017-11-27,The (first) time my FMIL lost her got damn mind... (long),beenursie,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7fwmuq/the_first_time_my_fmil_lost_her_got_damn_mind_long/,"So as you know from prior posts, we have current IL drama happening that isn't resolved yet. As of yet I don't have an update on the rehearsal dinner debate. However, I'm extremely pissed off at an insurance company right now and I'd like to channel some of that shit somewhere, so here I am. The next installment of crazy. 

See BB for backstory, but tldr: FH was across the country for school. I had the opportunity to go out and visit him over the holidays and was super excited to be able to see him and explore a brand new city together. So I get out there and the visit is going swimmingly. We're all over the place having a blast. At one point we were back at his apartment and he was taking a moment to shave. I happened to walk past the bathroom while he was doing so and I notice an oblong lump at the base of his neck.

**record scratch**

I go ""Babe. What's on your neck?""

He goes ""Where?""

I'm like ""The huge lump. On your neck. Come here.""

Now, backstory here. I was in nursing school prior to meeting FH. There were some issues so I had left. However, my mom is also a nurse and I had studied for two semesters, so I had a relatively good amount of nursing knowledge and assessment skills. So I palpate his neck and this sucker is HUGE. Think the size of a small sweet potato. 

So I (internally) freak out, but I don't want to scare the shit out of him. So I'm like ""FH you have to get that looked at."" He kind of blows me off, but he agrees to get it done.

So I start texting my mom. And she also freaks out and we have a little freak out sesh together. Because random ass lumps ain't good yo'. So she suggests that we enjoy the week and have him get it looked at ASAP after that. So I leave at the end of the week and FH has a doctor's appointment scheduled. This doc sees him and recommends an ultrasound. He goes for it. Keep in mind he's a guy. I ask him how it went and his response is ""Oh, it went fine."" So I ask him to forward me the report so I can read it.

*Three masses. Three. Not one. Three.*

One on the outside of his Thyroid (the one I saw), one on the inside of his Thyroid, and one behind his sternum (breastbone). Okay. Now I'm legit worried. This is serious. This is possible metastatic disease. And he is blissfully unaware.

So at this point my mom and I have spoken about this extensively, she has had several docs she works with read the report, I have had a couple docs I know read the report... We're all in agreement that he needs to come home, that this is almost certainly cancer, that we need to have this staged and treated immediately... You know, like normal people concerned for the life of someone they care deeply about. 

So I decide that BEFORE I call FH and freak him the hell out, I'm going to call FMIL and discuss this with her.

So I call her and explain that my mother and I are very concerned about FH's test results and we think that he needs to come home at this point to seek treatment. And she says the words that I have never forgotten.

""Well I really think he needs to focus on his schoolwork. His career is very important.""

Ya'll. I was shell-shocked. But I was like ""Okay. Maybe she doesn't understand how serious this could be.""

So I calmly say ""FMIL... I think that at this point we're thinking that this is cancer.""

Her response? ""Yes. I know.""

*Um. Wait. What?*

You know? You KNOW? YOU KNOW?

You FUCKING know your son almost definitely has cancer and you think his school internship is more important than that?!

So I'm kind of shocked into silence for a second and when I could regain the words to speak I say ""Well my mom and I have discussed this and we're thinking that this is surgical and needs to be taken care of. I don't really think it's a good idea for him to have surgery across the country, God forbid anything goes wrong.""

Ya'll.

She kept arguing with me. She made it clear that she didn't think that cancer treatment was a good enough reason for FH to return home. She was OFFENDED that I was suggesting he return home before his internship was up. I finally pulled out what I thought would be calming words and said ""With all due respect FMIL, my mom has been an ICU nurse for over twenty years, and I don't worry until she worries. She's worried.""

Her response? ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that but I disagree.""

We went around in circles for forty five minutes ya'll. Finally, I said ""FMIL, I can see that we aren't going to agree on this. I'm telling you now that I'm calling FH when I hang up with you and I'm going to strongly encourage him to come home. I'm sorry if you disagree with me.""

And we hung up.

*/deep. breath.*

FH is at work at his internship. I text him and ask if he can talk for a second. He calls me a few minutes later. I can hear in his voice that he's upset. I ask him what's wrong?

His voice sounds very small as he answers ""Bee. My doctor called. She's referring me to an oncologist.""

I immediately went into nurse mode.

""I know baby. I know. Listen. I think you need to come home. I think that we need to have this treated here, where you're closer to everyone. I don't think you should have surgery out there. I need you to talk to your boss and explain to him what's happened and see if he can get you home. Okay? Don't freak out. Nothing is confirmed yet. I just think that it might be a better idea for you to do all of this here.""

He calms down and agrees with me. Talks to his boss. His company was **fantastic**. They had him on a flight home four days later. 

Next steps - what IS this really, and what do we have to do to treat it?

ETA: This is an OLD story and FH is now FINE. Sorry; I should have clarified that. This happened years ago."
7fwopx,2,2017-11-27,"Wedding/portrait/commercial photographer graduating in May with a bachelor's in Advertising from UNL and $30,000 in savings. Planning to move to LA by next October",SMJICKS,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/7fwopx/weddingportraitcommercial_photographer_graduating/,"So as the title says, I'd be coming to LA with 30K and a degree and some connections I made this August. My friend had an internship in the bio department at UCLA so I visited him and met up with a production designer for IFC, a freelance graphic designer, and two freelance photographers who do work with NYT, Vogue, Urban Outfitters, and a variety of other publications companies. I stayed in Westwood and rented a car so I went all around meeting up with these people: Intelligentsia in Silverlake, Chinatown, Verve Coffee in the downtown area, etc. 

Basically, I'd ideally want to do what the two photographers I met up with do now and live in LA for the rest of my life. 

That being said, building up a client base in Omaha NE is a lot easier, so I know I'll have to eat my humble pie and start from the ground up in building my photography brand and try and meet up with as many photographers/up and coming rappers/musicians/artists etc. The photographers I met up with also said they'd be able to invite me to some Facebook wedding groups. I would kind of like to find an actual ""job"" job (lol) when I get out there so that way I can build up my photo biz on the side while still having an income, despite the savings helping me out.  

Thanks for understanding my rambling. I guess I'm just posting this here to see if anyone has any further advice. I'd probably want to live in an area central to where all the shoots happen, but not in the thick of it. Westwood was a comfortable distance away from downtown, although I'm sure there is less expensive but equidistance from downtown.

Thanks in advance, I truly appreciate it!"
7fwy3a,3,2017-11-27,Long distance relationship turned polyamorous. How do I handle this?,Grants_you_one_wish,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7fwy3a/long_distance_relationship_turned_polyamorous_how/,"Hello there wonderful people of this sub who take their time to post  their thoughts on situations like mine. Here is something I really need to get off my chest, and hopefully get some inspiring replies, whether it be advice to move on, or encouraging me to keep fighting:

I am 23 years old and male. I met my Californian girlfriend (Or now just lover, or whatever we call it) here in Denmark while she was studying abroad roughly 15 months ago(August last year). We traveled Europe together, I took her home for Christmas, and we were in love.

Come February she had to go home. Her studying abroad was over, but I had already bought tickets to come see her for two weeks during Easter. Things weren't the easiest until I saw her again. She managed to find a part time job, and applied to some short term internships in Asia for late summer, but on the social front, she didn't have many friends to turn to, when I was not available due to time zones.

I went to see her in April for two weeks. All was great, she showed me around northern California, and we had a great time. Already before going back home I bought another ticket to come see her in late june/early july for another two weeks.

When I came back home, I managed to score myself a full time job as an upgrade from my part time, and I started to get busy. One could say I might have started to neglect her just a tiny bit, but I was confident we could still work out, which we did.

I go to see her in summer. Everything is great. This time we explore southern California. I fuck up big time and snoop in her messages for whatever reason though, and find something that indicates she had been cheating on me. I immediately realize that I'm also a huge jerk who just probably lost her trust forever, but she actually has a good explanation for the message and I apologize and we move on. This doesn't completely ruin the mood of my visit, and we're still good.

We have up until this point discussed heavily the possiblity of her coming to live with me and studying in Denmark again, and also the possibility of me going to the US to work. The problem is however, that it is pretty difficult for me to make such a move, without making a huge commitment, and as such I am hesitant and scared to promise this move. 

I return home, and she books tickets for her Asia internship, AND tickets to come see me late September/early october. She had a tight but carefully planned budget that she had spent a lot of time on getting together.

She goes to Asia, and she is now ahead of me in time. Things get mumble jumbled a bit and she barely ever has WiFi. We start to slowly fall apart, and she is clearly not happy with her living conditions and I regret deeply not being there for her more. I also have to admit that I have never been good at sharing all my thoughts. I have probably been very difficult to understand in some situations, and she might have felt quite some distance to me.

She comes over after her Asia internship and she's here for two weeks. These two weeks are both good and bad. I have work that I can't get out of for most of the weekdays, and as such I am drained. What both of us didn't realize is probably that since I also got some weird condition with my uh... poop... after getting home from her in the summer, that the doctors have so far not been able to tell what is, I had been very stressed about that on top of it. I also did not know whether I would still have a job in the near future at that time.

We have an okay time, but she feels distanced from me. At this time she has big plans to write an application to get into university here summer 2018, and to come live with me.
I tell her, for whatever reason, that I'm not sure I'll be ready to live with her (but never actually imagined not being with her if she came here), and actually regret saying that from the moment she went back home. I just never told her until now. Before she goes home however. I buy a ticket to her for Christmas/New Years, and we have a good talk about how our communication should be.

1½ month goes by. We talk a good amount and I'm starting to get a lot better, despite my medical condition still not being figured out. She's gotten new friends and all seems good.

Until seven days ago...
Seven days ago she calls me and tells me we need to ""de-escalate"" the situation. She feels that what I said about not being ready to live together holds somewhat true, and that if she is with me, there is no way she can make an un-biased decision whether to come here and study or not. She says she still loves me though, and still wants to be with me. She says that she is also very afraid that if she doesn't get into school here, that would be the end of our relationship, as she doesn't see the long term goal of being together being fulfilled at all.
This has me very confused, and doesn't make sense to me, because she knows that she could be with me if she came here in summer, so it should affect her decision regardless, right?
She also mentions she needs time to be her, be not me and her, and to be free of any commitment. In hindsight, this is probably the statement I should have listened to the most, because she hasn't admitted this again ever since. She keeps insisting that she loves me and wants me. She mentions however that she needs someone there to hold her, to care for her and to be physical with when I'm not there, but insists it's not like she would go find someone else if we ""break-up"".

Now here's the deal. I know already since long ago that she is not having an easy time being monogamous. She does it for me because she loves me, but we've talked about opening up the relationship on multiple occasions previously, and found that we both weren't ready for that. Or so I thought.

A few days pass where I feel horrible. I can't think about anything but this situation, how little I want to lose her, and how much I love her, and everything we've been through and seen together. I have so many questions, and eventually get to ask all of them.
- Did she ever cheat on me? ""No.""

- Is there someone else right now? ""There is someone else I have feelings for"".

- Do you still love me? Where do you see us being? etc.

I  suggest opening the relationship if that's what she needs, and call bullshit on the ""making a decision about going to Copenhagen and me impacting it"". She agrees that the major part of her problem is needing an open relationship. I tell her about some conditions I have. Such as telling each other everything, full transparency and trust etc.

Eventually, after she tells me about this person that she has some feelings for, I ask her if she's sure she hasn't slept with him already. After pushing for it I get out of her that she's already slept with him twice. Thursday and Friday (this weekend).

I feel very betrayed. I don't yell, I don't get angry, I just get deeply hurt that I had to put on so much pressure to get her to tell me the truth. I ask about many details, because I am genuinely interested in how she felt in the moment among many other things.
My main concern here though, is that now she is not just sleeping with other people, she is actually getting feelings for this guy, and the fear of being replaced becomes very strong in me.
He is there on a daily basis. They hang out every day, and I'm so afraid that I'll just become ""The other guy"" and that she won't have time for me, as I am now more of a burden to her, someone who is in the way of this other relationship she could potentially have.

She assures me though that this other person is not the relationship type, but I can't help but not giving two fucks for that, because that shit just kinda happens no matter if you think you're that type or not.
We talk about Christmas, and whether I should come or not, and she really wants me to come, but can't promise me that she won't see this other person when I'm there, particularly on new years, as this other person will have been sober for a year on that day. We talk for hours and eventually the mood is great. I seem to have accepted the situation and I finally again see the person I love in her, with the openness and everything coming back. Right until she texts me an hour later that she's ""going to be busy for the rest of the day"", when it's 4PM for her. She's never had an issue with being there to talk with me ever at any time of the day, and I start feeling horrible again. I feel replaced.

I think heavily about this, and call her yesterday to tell her that I NEED to be comfortable in this situation, as I haven't ever tried anything like it, and she needs to do everything in her power to ease me into the situation. I am doing my best to understand her and open up to it. I tell her what is required to make me comfortable:

- I want the full 9 days when I'm there. No seeing other people. I'm there for her, and to work out our relationship. Not for her to set me aside for someone 

- I don't want to be replaced. If her feelings for this other person gets stronger, or such that I mean less to her, she needs to tell me so I can say stop and get out. I say that I want to be her main priority, at least for the time being, not just her sense of security while she focuses on her new and probably more exciting new pseudo-relationship.

She is silent for a while. She seems shocked. She claims that I'm trying to control her, but that is not how I see this situation. I calmly explain to her that I'm giving her all the information she needs about how to make me comfortable, and if she can't, then I simply can't do this. It ends with her saying she needs to think. And we small time chat about other things for the rest of the day, but back to a more closed off mood.

This is where the story ends, and as I finish typing all of this, I realize I don't even have anything specific to ask. I just really needed to get this off my chest, and I hope someone out there can talk to me about how they would see themselves in my situation, or maybe point out something I've missed.

EDIT: I guess  the main question on my mind is actually just whether I'm doing this ""right"". Am I treating her fairly, and am I correct in thinking I have been unfairly treated by her in the way she made this change to our relationship, given that she still says she doesn't want to lose me, and wants to be with me, or do I need to change my attitude towards this and try a different approach? I essentially feel like the tides have turned and I am now the completely open and honest person, and she is holding back, closed off and only telling me that she still wants me because she is scared. I also constantly question myself if I am only staying in this because it is ME who is scared to lose her, but always come back to the conclusion that she means too much to me and I'm not ready to give up, especially when I have tickets for christmas and can meet her and see how she is in real life.

I also forgot to point out that at the moment she is probably at a tough point of her life. She lives with her mom. Doesn't have any stable income. Can barely get around until her dad lets her borrow his car. And I guess it just doesn't help that I'm not there physically. "

My issue is that I am seeking to go full-time soon for better pay and benefits. My question then becomes when should I start looking for a new job if I can't go full-time with my current job?

To give more context... I really enjoy my new position; the work, people, and environment are great but they hired me only part-time. There is no obvious indicator that I might be going full-time with this position anytime soon. They are also aware that I am seeking full time since I am just finishing up with my other part-time internship position this week (graduated with Bachelors this past May so fresh out of college). Living at home with family so current finances and billing I can take care of and they are generous of me staying at home until locking in full-time.

My plan was to wait until mid-December to begin looking for full-time work. Once I get an interview offer for a desirable position, I'll give a ""kind"" ultimatum to my current employer stating essentially that I'd love to work full time for them but Company B is offering the same work for full-time and benefits across the street. If current employer then offers me full time with same pay/benefits I'll stick with current job but if not I'll have to leave. 

What are your thoughts on this plan? Would you go about it another way? I'd imagine this conversation has been repeated on this subreddit before so if easier to link me to those similar conversations then that is much appreciated.

Tl;dr: Been working new, desirable part-time job for a month now but need to go full-time soon for better pay/benefits. Plan on searching for new job soon but don't want to leave current employer high and dry before they can warm-up to me and consider me for full-time; but not sure how long to wait."
7fxdja,8,2017-11-27,"Update to ""repairing things"" with supervisor",socialworkersplat,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/7fxdja/update_to_repairing_things_with_supervisor/,"My professor and supervisor and I met today. Last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/7dt4c8/how_do_i_repair_things_with_my_supervisor/dq9fst6/?context=3

The beginning began alright with my supervisor detailing the conversations in the previous post. I responded, essentially telling her that a lot of the defensiveness she was witnessing was me being scared of saying the wrong thing and angering her worse given her past feedback on me being so rude and sarcastic.

My supervisor said she had ""never seen"" this side of me before or heard these concerns, and that was evidence that I was showing different sides of myself.

I spoke with my supervisor right before thanksgiving break and told her I didn't want to blindside her, explained why I didn't say anything about the boundaries issue because I felt like she'd feel slighted because if the effort she put in. Her response was, thank you for telling me that, but I wouldn't do anything differently.

Prior to coming to this conversation I spoke with the other head of the program, and asked her how to talk to my supervisor and asked that it be kept under wraps.

Anyway, a lot of the conversation was my professor validating that my supervisor feelings of being ""blindsided"" and ""caring so much"". My supervisor stated that this was not about her, but this was all for me, and she has good relationships with her past interns.

My supervisor brings up how she's been manipulated because she didn't know anything about this (how I was feeling) and I'm going behinf her back telling people things that make her sound like a bully. Apparently, the co-supervisor I spoke with elevated it, and because of this manipulation on my part, she feels like she can't move forward.

My supervisor then brought up every piece of critical feedback she'd given me, in the most negative way possible: ""She's been combatative from the beginning and didn't want to take notes"" (truthfully for my first feo weeks, I did not. I ended up making a whole binder of notes, which we laughed about and she told me how her old intern didn't want to take notes at first either and she said I was much improved ; ""She comes to work with very dry skin, I can see where she has scratched"" (I have a very real skin condition and it's winter here, sooo) etc etc. She mentioned an interaction with a client where I got ""very defensive"". This is an interaction I actually spoke to my professor about, because I used it in a paper. Professor gave me good marks, circling my responses in particular.

In the meeting, I was able to collect my thoughts enough to get a few words/""this is how I experienced this scenario"", which included things that she said to me that were out of bounds, which I said made me feel worried about talking to her, but there was no discussion of that, and she stated she didn't remember it that way. My professor did not take her to task for these things.

My supervisor stated she no longer wanted to work with me, and doesn't think I'm able to work in a hospital at this time.

After the meeting, my field professor was comforting my advisor, and I heard, ""You have to do what's best for you.""

At that point, I gathered up my stuff and told them that I didn't feel comfortable staying the day, and would like to go home. I kind of regret this. I know it wasn't mature.

My supervisor told me not to go, and how I can't just run away from things. I told her that I no longer felt I was in a good place to see patients, and this wasn't my placement anymore. (me being upset of course)

I ended up staying and am currently sitting in a waiting room thinking everything over. I guess I will finish out the semester and move on next semester.

Please give me all the feedback, from what I should have done, what I should do next time, anything else you think may be helpful.

Truthfully, I don't do well with conflict and I get verrrrrry quiet when it feels like other people are angry with me. Idk why I added this part. Anyway. Here it all is.

I'm feeling very misunderstood, and I feel like I was painted in a terrible light. I don't even want to stay here the remaining two weeks."
7fxi8j,13,2017-11-27,Why I went from accounting to pm at a hardware company to software engineer before 30,soulencoded,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fxi8j/why_i_went_from_accounting_to_pm_at_a_hardware/,"This is a little story about my journey to software engineering. I'm also starting a youtube channel recreating everything I learned from my Bootcamp. Links below. Would love feed back.

Growing up, I was a terrible student. I never really liked going to school and it was always a struggle for my parents to drag me out of bed every morning. It all seemed so pointless to me. Learning random formulas, bits of trivia about the American Civil War, and the barrage of extracurricular activities. In all honesty, all I wanted to do was play video games. I guess I was just like any other kid growing up with the N64. Bottom line, I hated learning for the sake of learning. I wished I knew this about myself a long time ago. 

Everyone whines about why it was so hard for them to get their first job, especially my generation. I graduated college in 2010, so it wasn’t that long after the financial crisis of 2008. No one wanted to hire a fresh college grad with zero experience. My friends and I would often complain about how hard it was to find a job, and how ridiculous these companies were looking to hire grads with two years of work experience. I went to college so I can get a job. How were we supposed to have experience already? said every college grad during that time. If I look back though, there were plenty of opportunities for me to get my feet wet. Instead of applying for internships during the summer, I went abroad to Korea and Japan. Also I was a guild leader in WoW so that took some time away. Biggest understatement ever. I didn’t really try to get more experience, because I believed that a awesome job awaited me after I graduated. The point is, getting my first job was tough for me. I grew up pretty sheltered, and I never had to pay for anything. It was such a shock for me that no one wanted to hire me. A fresh college grad with no useful skills with just an economics degree. Its kinda of funny that I thought like this back then. In the end, I convinced my parents that I need to go back to school, and this time I would learn something really practical. Something that every company needed. 

I found a accelerated accounting program at Santa Clara University that taught everything you needed to learn to sit for the CPA exam in about 8 months. It was perfect for me as I was still not a big fan of school and the thought of going to grad school for two more years gave me the chills. Enter my first job as an Accountant. I was pretty close to getting into one of the big fours. I even went to the final rounds with E&amp;Y. I still blame WoW and my raiding schedule on why I didn’t get that job. Luckily, I knew enough Korean and accounting to land a job at a Korean CPA firm. I was pretty stoked about it and I thought I finally made it. This feeling didn’t last long. I can go into many reasons why I hated this job, but the main thing was that I didn’t enjoy accounting. For lack of better words, I found it boring. I didn’t really make anything, I just accounted for things that had already happened. Kinda of ironic that I didn’t notice this fact about the job. Even the title of the job literally describes what the job function is. Working for the sake of working is draining. Towards the end of my year at my accounting firm, I wanted to jump ship desperately. 

Good fortune shined upon me once again in the form of my father. He was able to hook me up with a job at one of his friend’s company. This was a totally new field in the semi-conductor industry. I had zero experience and no technical background, but my new boss accepted me with open arms. I started working at Green Circuits. We made PCBA assemblies for hardware companies in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. the following 5 years or so, I learned a ton under my bosses wings. I become a PM, I had my own clients and things were pretty great, but something was missing. I had a crazy desire to make things. During this time of growth, I started to dabble into a bunch of side projects. My friends and I wanted to make apps so I learned how to draw and make assets. We released a few games and that was awesome. After that, I ran a webcomic series for about a year, started a t-shirt business and even published children books on amazon. I also got into making YouTube videos and podcasting. For whatever reason, I just kept wanted to make things. I had a passion for learning something for a specify goal.

My fiancé at the time, now wife, eventually got fed up with me switching hobbies every few years and told me to pick one thing and stick with it. After racking my brain for couple days, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to give programming a serious shot. My rationale was that, since I knew how to draw and make assets already, If I just learned how to program, I can make apps all by myself. After about two failed attempts and a lot of encouragement from my developer friends. I fell in love with coding and developing apps. I simply couldn’t get enough of it. I remember rushing home from work just so I can do more Hackerrank problems or working on a todo app for the umpteenth time. After I released my first game to the app store, a simple clone of flappy bird re-themed to a space ship dodging meteors, I knew programming was something I was passionate about. My friends were probably pretty annoyed at me by then, because all I wanted to do was talk about tech and ask them about simple programming concepts. What the hell is REST? and who is resting? Noob questions for days. Looking back, I’m very fond of these memories. Eventually, I came to a fork in the road. Stay at my current job, or pursue this new found passion of mine. It was tough, I had just gotten married and telling my newly wed wife that I was going to quit my job was the last thing I wanted to do. Surprisingly she was very supportive and said this Not many people get to do what they are passionate about for their living. 

Go for it babe. She is pretty amazing and I’m lucky to have her as my wife. :)

I’m working as a software engineer at Capital One and I’m loving every minute of it. In summary, I understand that not everyone is in a position to just quit their job and chase after something they are passionate about. It’s definitely an extreme thing to do.

The only thing I can say is that the pain and hard times chasing after something you are passionate about is worth it. 

Thanks for reading this little shindig of mine. One of my goals for the next year is to recreate my entire bootcamp content on youtube for free. 

Also I’m hoping to journal more about my experiences, programming, reviews of software classes I took and many more

7fxjyt,0,2017-11-27,Can we talk about how shady the supply drops are in this game?,colemetzler,WWII,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/7fxjyt/can_we_talk_about_how_shady_the_supply_drops_are/,"With the recent blow up of star wars battlefront 2, I feel like Activision has gotten off the hook for some of their shady supply drop practices.

For starters I have a history playing this game religiously since the WaW days and my most played cod game is actually AW so I know a piece of shit supply drop system when I see it. Also I've been no lifting this game when I get the chance before and after work and I've made it to 5th prestige with 3 days game time.

After all this playtime I've started to fill up my collections to a point where I could purchase any gun I want in the collections with the saved up credits. However once you get to a point where the collections are full you start to get duplicate after duplicate in supply both common and rare supply drops. Some would say this is no big deal because you can spend your saved up credits for collection guns and outfits over time.

Okay cool so I saved up 20k credits and started to take a look at what I can buy. Well after looking through the selections there are about 8-10 guns that arent a piece of shit rusty variant, that's a copy of another gun in the game already that is much harder to obtain. Okay what about outfits, well the collection outfits and the outfits from prestiging your division are simple recolors and you they are so awful you can't even tell the difference.

Next you check out the hundreds of pistol grips and notice that half of them look like garbage, probably took an intern ten minutes to upload a picture and paste it to the gun. 

So in total Activision filled the supply drops with absolute garbage items that are either ugly rusty copies of the heroics variants or you can open hundreds of supply drops and get maybe one heroic for a gun that you want.

With no ability to purchase guns that are worth a damn, or purchase heroic variants our credits are going to go to waste. Now I'm sure they will add dlc weapons to supply drops and collections soon and hopefully they will make it possible for us to buy the collection for the guns outright when they release. But what's stopping them from making a collection for a dlc weapon worth 30k credits or more? Overall the shady practices of Activision may have finally turned me off of this game franchise and they are lucky that EA fucked up even harder or they would be getting it just as bad.

Edit: this isn't even counting all the other glaring issues with this game with hit detection, flinch, HQ, and so on and so forth."
7fxkdk,41,2017-11-27,"Advice on Burnout, that I can't Google",fox1212,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/7fxkdk/advice_on_burnout_that_i_cant_google/,"I'm in my last 40 or so credits at Tech. I've done 4 internships so everyone tells me to ""get it over with, graduate"". I'm a first generation student, I pay for all my things, my family is currently hurting because my dad's sick, leaving me as what is technically the bread-winner. I work part-time at an engineering job 20 hrs a week and do full-time school, like 10-13 hrs on average, yeah I know I'm weak.

***

**I'm dealing with burn out, I need advice from fellow students. Please give me advice on moving forward. Tell me your similar experiences and how you solved them. Are there resources at Tech besides counseling for me?**

***

**Problems I'm facing now:** I'm so behind in my current classes at the moment because I was gone for a week before break for a world finals CS competition, it was a great honor that I don't regret. I feel like I'm gonna fail 2 of my classes this semester. I have lots of HW to do, but those deadlines have already passed. I'm afraid to do it and turn it in late because they might not accept it and I would let other work get piled onto me. I haven't talked to the professors yet. I'm so afraid of the: ""Sorry you didn't notify the department so I can't grant an extension"" answer

***

**On burnout:** I think it's mostly because I feel like I'm spinning my wheels at both school and work. I'm so interested in my 4000 level classes, I have motivation to understand, read, and I go to classes. But doing the HW and studying for the tests feels impossible, I feel like no matter how much time I allocate I don't finish or perform poorly. Lots of little careless mistakes in hand-written math.

***

If I kill my GPA in the next year it could really screw my chances of getting into grad school here, I'm at a dead-on 3.0 so that would be easy to do. I definitely want the grad school option. I'd retake the 2 classes I'm in now so that I could actually enjoy them, but the idea averaging a F/D with a A/B plus getting a semester behind is ridding me with guilt. So many friends have come and gone and yet I'm still here. I'm a girl, over the last year I've become really withdrawn. I need to work on being social and meeting new people again. 

***

It's no overstatement that age 17 - 22 for me has been a whole lifetime in 5 yrs: homeless and cashier to engineer. I've specialized through internship experience, I want to continue my education, I know I could push the boundaries of my field, I have more meaningful work experience than people 3yrs out of school.  My CS team for that competition wants to build a start-up, guess who owns most of the IP, me. Stopping my education will not make me happy, that would be like hitting rock bottom. I've continuously done things to prevent burn-out: water, good food, exercise, sleep, and counseling on and off campus. Everything you can google. Now that those aren't working, I feel like trash. Actually getting the sleep I need has really cut down the amount of work I get done.

***

I'm considering doing part-time school Spring 2018 semester, just 2 classes. This would allow me: 1. concentrate on work at work and actually feel like I'm moving forward in my research. 2. be able to succeed at those 2 classes and prove to myself that I can be successful. I would take the semester off and just work, but I've done that 4 times. I don't think that will help me conquer my burnout. I think my burnout stems from feeling helpless to succeed in classes due to the limited amount of time in the day. I feel very guilty about doing part-time school a whole full semester, it makes more financial sense to take the semester off.

***

**TLDR QUs:** I feel like I'm frozen because I'm afraid to make choices and move forward with solving these issues. Will professors take my late work? I wish I could have fully with-drawn from this semester, but its too late for that. Has dropping to part-time school helped any of you with burnout do to feeling academically overwhelmed with full-time school?

***

Thank you!"
7fxkza,3,2017-11-27,Have an interview tomorrow and need some tips!,sittingmongoose,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7fxkza/have_an_interview_tomorrow_and_need_some_tips/,"I am going on an interview tomorrow for an IT project manager role.  I have been looking for a job for over a year and have had several interviews.  I feel like I fail at the interview level though.  I know the basics like arrive early, dress in a suit, be courteous and polite, etc.
I have been at a construction company doing project management work for almost 3 years now.  My background includes the following.
-3 years doing small renovations and commercial build project management.
-2 years at att doing b2b project management.  I handled custom software and network installs.
-3 month internship doing software development project management.
-I started a software dev studio.  I ran the entire business end including all project management.  We created virtual reality software and I have 2 concurrent projects across 40 employees.  The company only lasted 6 months as our investor backed out at the last minute.(should I mention this work I did??)

I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t say.  I am incredibly tech savvy and extremely computer oriented however I always have stayed on the hardware and software end and never explored networking much.  I build my own computers and so on so I feel like I can learn networking fast.

Any tips going into this interview would be greatly appreciated!!"
7fxljz,12,2017-11-27,Feel like I’m too dumb for data science/machine learning,grandslamdunk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7fxljz/feel_like_im_too_dumb_for_data_sciencemachine/,"I’m a 30-year-old guy, born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley. I was a pretty good student in high school and, as a result, got into a lot of prestigious undergrad schools (although I think that’s largely because I excelled in the SAT IIs). However, I kind of crashed and burned in college. I’m not proud of it. It was a combination of, well…I don’t know. Loneliness? Depression? Anxiety? Lack of motivation? Laziness? Lack of discipline? Some combination of those things? I don’t know, but I screwed up in college, and at one point, I was placed on probation and at risk of dismissal. I was able to graduate, but then the economy tanked. I worked at an internship for a year and a half or so, and was able to get into a pretty good grad school (again, because I aced my GRE, not because I had a stellar resume or anything). But within weeks of starting grad school, I realized I didn’t want to be there. I (and my parents) dragged myself kicking and screaming through grad school, but it was plagued with many of the same problems that plagued my undergrad.  

I got a software QA job after grad school, but it was just…meaningless. I mean, I hated it, but it was the only job I could get. I fumbled my way through that job for 2.5 years, barely knowing what was going on, until my whole team was laid off last year. I was on the market, but I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I know what degrees I had and I know I had certain skills, but if you asked me for a job title, I wouldn’t know what to tell you. I didn’t really know what I…*do*.

I applied to a data science boot camp and got in. I was ecstatic, mostly because I thought this would be a chance for me to really reboot my career and point it in an exciting direction. Data science seemed way more interesting to me than the work I had been doing. I finished the program, but struggled to find a relevant job. I was finally able to find a job, but it was similar to that QA job that I hated.  

In the last few weeks, I’ve been trying to add to my repertoire of skills/knowledge and do some projects. Specifically, I’ve been going through the websites for some of the Stanford machine learning courses (CS224n, CS231n, etc.). I’m going through some of the coding assignments and finding myself completely befuddled. I don’t know if it’s the vague terminology or the fact that you have to think in matrices and vectors, but I’m struggling.  

My brother, by contrast, was able to breeze through college in 3 years and finish his Masters in just over a year, both at very prestigious universities. Meanwhile, I’ve been barely able to keep my head above the water.  

I know that I’ve fucked up. A lot. I know I can be better. But that feeling is very, very intense right now. Every time I take a peek at the solutions to the code for CS224n, I just feel so…dirty. It’s like that feeling I used to get when I was stuck in Final Fantasy X and had to look up the walkthrough, only this is actually important.  

Anyway, this is just…sort of a rant. I’ve always wanted something better than what I have now, professionally speaking. And I thought I’d be able to accomplish that - actually get an interesting job that I’m passionate about and good at. But I’m wondering if that’s just a pipe dream. It sure feels like that right now."

First of all a disclaimer, I don't know what happened exactly so i can only assume thigns on the information we have.

So C9s plan going into the offseason was to keep their Roaster how it was, except maybe Impact. They renewed contracts on Contractz and Jensen --&gt; no intend of ""getting rid"" of Contractz. Also why would they even want that since Contractz is arguable the msot valuable NAjungler you can have since, he is already really good, shows a lot of potential for the future and doesn't take up an improt slot.

Now you have to now thatc9 spent millions in an OW move and thus weren'T, supposedly, that strongfinancialy as they would or maybe should have been with the franchising coming around.

Now for me there are 2 possible scenarios:

1. $steve and the NBA orgs throwed so much money at Impact and Contractz that the players just asked c9 for them to let them go. For me, at least in Contractz case, this is more unrealistic. I think players value succes over money, which is shown by most korean players and DL sayin he would have gone to TL ven if someone would have offered him more money. And, correct me if im wrong, I think Contractz contract got bought out by GGs, so with our knowledge he shouldn't get more money than he was getting while he was on c9. Also if GGs was ready to spent insane amount of moneyc9 couldn't match, why would they end up with such a, pardon me, shtty roster?

Ok 2. scenario, for me way more believable: For some personal reasons Contractz would rather be on GGs than c9 net season. So here we are ruling out money and suces. So we are left with either, intern problems with maybe the other plays, coaches or other interns, Contratz wanting to play a bigger role on a Team (kinda liek kyrie quittign the Cavs if you follow basketball) etc.
A hint that this is more likely the case, is that Contractz tweeted out ""I'll spread some light on my situation within a week or so. [...]"", for me him using the word ""situation"" and not ""opportunity"" or sth like that suggest that thereis indeed sth going on.

TL;DR for me there is no plausible explanation hy c9 would ""kick"" Contractz after renewing his contract and him being the best NA jungler you could have,so it must have been Contractz wish to leave"

Ok 2. scenario, for me way more believable: For some personal reasons Contractz would rather be on GGs than c9 net season. So here we are ruling out money and suces. So we are left with either, intern problems with maybe the other plays, coaches or other interns, Contratz wanting to play a bigger role on a Team (kinda liek kyrie quittign the Cavs if you follow basketball) etc.
A hint that this is more likely the case, is that Contractz tweeted out ""I'll spread some light on my situation within a week or so. [...]"", for me him using the word ""situation"" and not ""opportunity"" or sth like that suggest that thereis indeed sth going on.

TL;DR for me there is no plausible explanation hy c9 would ""kick"" Contractz after renewing his contract and him being the best NA jungler you could have,so it must have been Contractz wish to leave"
7fxwnb,2,2017-11-27,"My [22 M] girlfriend [23 F] of 2 years seems depressed or in some existential crisis, we don't know how to help her anymore",helpsadgirlfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fxwnb/my_22_m_girlfriend_23_f_of_2_years_seems/,"Throwaway bc she reddits too but not in this sub I think.

I met my girlfriend at work about two years ago. She was already working there and I started as an intern. We only got together shortly before my internship ended so we didn't work together very long after our relationship started. Back then she seemed 'normal' and happy, more intro- than extroverted but not extremely so; our workplace was very young and 'hip' and she always came along when we went partying after work or something like that. So definitely able to be in a good mood.

After almost one year, she had gotten fed up with a situation at work and found herself another job. It seemed very spontaneous, she applied and got the job instantly and accepted. She seemed glad about it though. She then also got herself another flat that was closer to her new workplace. She would move in there three months after starting the job. (we don't live together because she says she needs too much alone time and I'm ok with that).

All seemed fine until her last day at the old job. She came home in the evening to my flat and seemed very quiet and sad, but said everything was ok. However she started the new job the very next day. For the first few days she said everything was ok and she just 'had to get used to it'. But after two weeks she admitted that she hated it, everything was very different from her previous job and she realized that she missed it very much. She told me she had been crying pretty much every evening and seemed really unhappy, but determined to try 'at least a few months'. However it didn't get better but worse, she was very stressed by the preparations for the move and some problems with the new landlord. At times she seemed barely responsive to me, very withdrawn and quiet and tense, like she was gonna explode any moment. Then one evening she came to my place and admitted that she felt extremely depressed and stressed and hadn't eaten anything in two days. I was obviously very concerned and urged her to find help, mainly therapy. She agreed and found a therapist very fast, and has been seeing her weekly for almost a year now. 

She was depressed still for a few months back then and hated the job. She after a while managed to get into another department and had some terrible coworkers leave, and says it's much better now. She also says therapy has helped a lot and that she is not depressed anymore. In fact I noticed she has changed, both inside and outside, and she has become more active in that she has more hobbies, goes out more, made more friends. So she isn't typically depressed with no drive to do anything. That seems good, but I think that she is still intensely unhappy. And she agrees but says she doesn't know what to do. 

For example she says she doesn't like being in her new flat, which is partially why she goes out so much. She gets anxious when she is in the flat on her own, in fact she had panic attacks a few times but that doesn't seem to happen anymore. However she admits that she still really doesn't like it, but doesn't really know why. I think she knows why, because she can actually name reasons and specific things she doesn't like. For example she said the part of town she's in now is too crowded, ugly and a bit loud. She also would like more nature and less neighbours. So I suggested maybe she could look for another flat that is in a less crowded, more quiet area. Logical, right? But she says even thinking of having to look for a flat and move again is too overwhelming, and she isn't sure where she wants to live etc so she'd rather force herself to get used to the flat, but I don't think that's gonna work... 

As for the job she says it's ok now and she doesn't exactly hate it anymore. She has said multiple times that it feels 'pointless', that she doesn't want to 'do it forever'. She says she likes some of her colleagues, but feels no connection to the job and doesn't care about it. But she also can't say what she wants to do instead. It's like she wants a totally different life but has only a very vague idea of that, and she completely admits this as well.

She has also been very irritable sometimes. Not with me or friends, but for example she gets annoyed by strangers and people in general sometimes. She says she often comes home pretty pissed and needs to isolate herself a lot by wearing ear plugs and listening to music, just tuning out the world. But then at other times she can seem totally normal and even happy. She says that she sometimes feels really good when she is outside and seeing friends or otherwise distracted, like partying or at a concert. But she has often mentioned that she 'just hates everything right now' and wants to 'get away from everything'. 

Idk, I don't want this to get too long. Basically, she admits that she is unhappy with her situation but also doesn't really know what she wants to change. It seems like she's in this cycle where sometimes she feels better and then suddenly gets extremely pissed and unhappy again. I think this still sounds depressed, but she says it doesn't feel like depression. She also thinks that therapy has helped, but that now it's her own responsibility to change something, but she still has no idea what that would be. It hurts to see her this unhappy and even hear her say it.

  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend seems very unhappy and I think she is having a big existential crisis, we don't know how to help her, has anybody here gone through something similar?"

I waited until the last minute to do almost everything.

I'm failing an important class. I have a lot of work due by this Thursday for this class, along with my final exam. I need to do two extra credit assignments, my missed homeworks, and study for the final.

My next class, I put off major assignments. I didn't make to class to submit my last homework assignment (worth my final exam), nor have I done anything for a time-consuming final project, outside lecture report, or journal entries. I also have two homeworks that I never finished or submitted. I have until Friday.

I have a debate for an ethics class in an hour. I didn't make it to the mock run through because I'm not anywhere done with my part of the team's debate. My final is Thursday.

I have an online final tomorrow, and I also work job #1 (a desk job). I also have practice (extra curricular, but for a grade)

I have work friday for job #2, along with practice, but I'll miss practice for work.

I'm president for an organization, and I have paperwork that needs to be finished by Friday... and it has to be submitted by two different people for approval before then.

I haven't registered for classes yet because I don't know what classes to take. I'm done with my major, but I don't know what to do after graduation, so I'm putting it off until the spring. I wanted to do med school, but my grades are absolute shit and I have a huge uphill battle to even get into the running. That's why I'm taking pre-reqs now, but there's no point of continuing if I'm still getting F's, D's, and C's.

My actual major is psychology. I have no internships, work experience, volunteering, etc. for psychology or biology.
I have no true motivation to do anything anymore. I feel like it's for nothing. I want to finish everything, but I keep getting a crushing feeling of what the fuck, man every time I think about what I need to do.

Oh, I also have an incomplete from last year that I need to finish by next week. I don't know how I can complete this class, because I need to attend theater shows, seminars, etc., which is why I ended up with an incomplete the first time around.

I have these situations happen at the end of every semester, for the past 6 semesters. How can I actually finish my work and stop stressing?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I fucked up my planning for the entire semester. I have a shit ton of things to do, but I feel terrible now that I have so little time to fix things. This happens at the end of every semester. How do I stop stressing and actually get work done?"
7fy17f,1,2017-11-27,Big Fish Little Pond,winLandCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7fy17f/big_fish_little_pond/,"I've thought about leaving my company for a while and reading the [Is it really that bad to stay with the same company more than 1-3 years?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7foqcf/is_it_really_that_bad_to_stay_with_the_same/) thread helped push me into writing this post.

A quick rundown of my history. 

* Dropped out of college when I was 20 in 2003
* Ran my own small business IT support company
* Went back to school with the plan to get a PhD in 2010
* Started an accelerated master’s program
* Decided to take an internship after finishing my bachelors degree. 
* Three weeks into my internship the company offers me a full time position and offers to pay for the rest of my masters degree.
* Starting total compensation $75k in 2013
* Raise in 2014 to $84K
* Promotion in 2015 to  $115K
* Raise in 2016 to $124K

We are coming up on our annual performance review / salary increase and my boss told me he put me in for another promotion, which should hopefully mean another big raise. As the title suggest I feel like a big fish in a little pond. I work with a defense contractor and most of the people on my team are aeronautical engineers who are self taught programmers. Within the first few months of me working at this place I felt like I was the best programmer in the office (Small team of 10 people). This is a mixed blessing because everyone else is so bad at their job it makes me look like a superstar. I get constant praise for saving the day, I get awards from the company, and I keep getting raises. What I would love is to have someone better than me to learn from, to not get stuck as a senior programmer of old technology, and to actually work on software using good programing practices. I have tried to convince my team to start writing unit test, doing code reviews, or writing comments, but these things don’t happen.

With this post I’m really just looking for some advice on how long I should stay at this easy job with good pay or should I start looking for another place to go before it’s too late?"

7fyehe,3,2017-11-27,I [21M] have a weird thing going on with my friend [21 F] with an abusive ex and have no idea what to make of it...,Angrypancake,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fyehe/i_21m_have_a_weird_thing_going_on_with_my_friend/,"Hi, so this is a really weird situation I've gotten myself into. (TLDR at bottom) 


We'll call my friend Z. 


 We actually met at a class at uni about two years ago and have been friends since then. We were purely platonic because I was dating my ex back then and I obviously wanted to respect the boundaries, but fast forward to the past couple of months. 


 Four months ago, I broke up with my ex of two years, and started to hang out with Z more frequently than before, but just to study and get lunch together at uni, nothing physical or suggestive at all. Coincidentally, she had been in an unhappy relationship for 4 months, and whenever we would hang out, we would talk about struggles in her relationship and laugh about how similar the problems we both faced in our respective relationshops were, even the smallest petty pet peeves. 


 She would tell me that he just never makes her feel appreciated, always coming home from internships tired and grumpy, yet still wanted them to continue living together and follow him to another area when he lands a full time job next year. As a friend with a similar 'feeling unappreciated' experience, i told her that sometimes in life, we all need to prioritise our own feelings and do what makes us happy in the long run, and to really communicate with her boyfriend over this issue. 


Being single, I started to be attracted to her because I found out after my breakup that me and Z really got along well and went through similar things. But obviously I respected the fact that she was still in a relationship, despite being unhappy about it, and kept my boundaries, not staying out late and telling her to let her boyfriend know whenever she was with me. 


 Now, important thing to know would be that Z and her boyfriend started out as roommates, in a house where Z's older brother lives as well (so in the house is Z, her boyf, her brother). Her brother does not know about their relationship, but is very good friends with Z's boyfriend. 


 Two months ago, she told me in the middle of the night that she had finally worked up the courage to break up with her boyfriend (lets call him Y) telling him that she was unhappy in their relationship and definitely not prepared to move in with him to another area where his full time job would be. I told her good job if thats what will make her happy in the long run, and that if she ever felt down we could chill. 


 After this, we started to hang out more and more and escalated to us going on dates a number of times. This whole time though, was one BIG ISSUE. Her ex was being batshit crazy as fuck. 


 It all started with Z telling me that she would find her now-ex really depressed and begging her every day to give him another chance. When i first heard this, i kinda felt bad for the guy. But this continued every single day, and eventually escalated to him skipping out DAYS of his mandatory internships to just stay home and get to talk to Z to comvince her to get back with him. Z tells me that every time these 'talks' happen, its always the same story: she keeps telling him that she had absolutely zero feelings left for him and that he should leave her alone. 


 The weirder shit starts happening now. Apparently he now skips internships for weeks just so he can try to talk to her, and PARK AND WAIT in front of her workplace every time she works (shes part time) just to pick her up, which she always ends up gettin picked up out of pity.  Every time she's with me, her ex would always call her to check who she's with. 


 Obviously at this point I'm feeling pretty shit about myself. I know she really doesnt want to get back with him, but she's being too nice to him. To organise a date, have a blast, and to see her ex call her during every single one of our dates and despite me telling her to stop giving in to his bullshit requests and giving him false hope, she picks up, gets picked up, all the while I'm silently walking alongside her as she reluctantly talks to her ex on the phone. I tell her how I'm worried for her, and also how shitty i feel when a girl I'm on a date with keeps answering her crazy exes phone calls. Z tells me that she is really sorry and really wants me to not feel shit, and that she will try sort it out.


Then the fucking craziest shit starts happening. One night, Z locks her doors just so she can have some peaceful sleep without her ex walking in to ask for another chance, but she told me that her ex fucking picked her door lock and came in to talk to her. BUT THERES MORE. Just four days ago, Z messages me at midnight saying that her ex who was upstairs in his room at the time, texts her (who is downstairs) that his throat hurts. Z goes upstairs to check on him, and finds a the fucking nail polish remover bottle half empty and her ex lying in bed. Nobody knows whether he avtually drank it or emptied it but WHAT THE FUCK GUYS.  


 This guy went from obsessive monitoring of Z, to now threatening self harm. 


 I then tell Z to tell her brother this, but apparently she tried to do that a couple of weeks back, and was stopped by her ex who told her that if she tells her brother about their relationship, he will lose Z's brother as a good friend and he doesn't want that because he apparently doesnt have many close friends that he can be honestly happy around.  



 After the nail polish remover incident, I couldnt sleep for a whole night so I sent her a wall of text, explaining that Im not sure how much of what im about to write to her is appropriate since I'm not sure what I am to her right now, but that even just as a friend, I'm really worried about her happiness and most of all, her safety with her ex doing all this shit, and that if she doesnt want to get the police involved, she should at LEAST tell one of her family members about this, because no matter how sorry she feels for her ex, her safety comes first and obviously his actions are not normals. I also told her that on one hand I understand if shes just letting him do all this because she might be afraid that if she tells him firmly to stop, it would aggravate him more and would be risky. But ultimately I ended the message saying she should do whatever would make her most safe. 


 A week passed, and her ex is being kinda tame again.  Z and I go back to talking like normal and we flirt a lot saying stuff like how were gonna be dating eventually (cringe af i know sorry) and all that stuff. 


 Yesterday night, out of nowhere Z messages me: ""hey, will you stop talking to me if I get back together with me ex?"" And i enquire further about why she is saying this, but essentially she told me that whatever she does, she's going to be hurting either me or her ex at this point, and that she knows from the time we've been friends that I'm more emotionally strong than her ex, so she's gonna get back together with her ex, but says that she knows she won't be happy getting back together with him. 


 Upon hearing this, I'm really hurt and shocked. First of all, I still have a raw wound from my recent breakup, and at some point Z told me that she would never do anything to hurt me, so hearing that she's prioritising her exes emotions over mine after leading me on for a while really hurts me. 

 Call me silly, but more importantly I'm just still more concerned about her safety and emotional wellbeing in going through with this decision. I know that eventually I'll move on and forget about the time Z hurt me, but honestly If I were her, I would not know how to deal with a crazy ex who lives under the same roof until the contract end period, which is next january. 
 

 So reddit, I need your help on what she should do, and what I should do and if its acceptable that I'm feeling shitty in this situation. 



 TLDR;  Friend (Z) broke up with her ex recently and started having a thing with me. Her ex is crazy (monitoring, controlling, threatening self harm) and still has to live under same roof as Z + her older brother until january. Z told me last night she's getting back together with her ex. I feel shit for being lead on, but concerned about her safety; what should she do? 



PS: sorry for shit formatting and writing, I'm on my phone and really shaken still. "

I'm an accounting student in a city a little smaller than Oklahoma City in the Midwest. I'm an honor student, and I have an internship with a regional firm lined up this spring. I will graduate in May with a BS in accounting and a minor in finance, and all the credit hours to qualify to take the CPA. I'm wanting to move to Denver or Las Vegas after I graduate, and have a few questions I was hoping someone might be able to answer.

1. Is it hard to find a job in Denver or Las Vegas right now if you are a recent graduate from out of state? I've heard that finding a job in a bigger city can be easier for people with professional degrees such as accounting. Is this true? Any tips for job hunting in a different city as a new graduate? 

2. After I complete my internship, I am thinking about taking 3 months off and using that time to pass the CPA exam. Will passing the CPA right after college increase my chances of finding a job in another state or should I just start job hunting immediately after my internship and worry about the CPA later? (Another factor is that the educational requirements for the CPA are different in each state so while I may be CPA eligible here, I may be short one higher level auditing class or something of that nature in another state. Also I currently live at home and will be saving up some money from the internship so money wouldn't be an issue for at least four or five months.)

3. I've read that having an internship that you didn't receive an offer from on your resume looks bad. If I do receive an offer and turn it down because I don't want to stay where I am currently at will that look bad? (I may still accept the offer if its too good to turn down, but I've always wanted to leave after college and go to a bigger city so I'm kind of torn between doing what I've always wanted to do and doing what would be the financially responsible option.)

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to answer these questions. Any advice will be sincerely appreciated."

7fyy7o,4,2017-11-27,Stuck in the office [feet],bashful71,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/7fyy7o/stuck_in_the_office_feet/,"So, I'm going around the office, mid-afternoon, trying to chase down a bad network cable. I notice that Karina's office is empty, so I duck in there to see if she's kicked a cable out of its socket again. I'm slightly relieved that she's elsewhere - I find her *very* attractive, way out of my league, and I'm always rather tongue-tied around her. A good shorthand comparison would be Annie Clarke - athletic, leggy, blonde and fiercely intelligent.  She politely ignores my existence, like most people do with IT geeks.

Her office only has room for two desks, hers and Marissa's, placed back to back. I clamber underneath to look for the cables, which are naturally tangled up all to hell. Just as I find a candidate plug and start to wonder which socket it came from, I hear her walk into the office, chatting on her cellphone. I almost bang my head on the underside of the desk, and start to blush deeply as I realise what a position I'm in - she clearly hasn't seen me. I want to speak up - what would I say? - but it's too late, she's sat in her chair and swivelled her legs under the desk, still talking. Something stops me from interrupting her, as the conversation is sounding a little bit intimate; I don't doubt her boyfriend is some ultra-stud who doesn't lurk under womens' desks.

In the meantime, I'm confronted with her rather lovely legs. She's wearing a conservative skirt with sheer black nylons and high-heeled pumps. I can't see up her skirt, although if I were discovered, I'd never be able to make anyone believe that, but I'm so close to her shapely calves that I can see the fine texture of her hosiery. I have something of a fetish for feet and legs, and seeing the light wrap softly around the curve of her shin, diffracted through the barely-black nylon, is a heart-stopping moment - it's so much more three-dimensional than mere porn. At the same moment, though, my heart is also racing - she finally hangs up, but immediately picks up her office phone and makes another call. Embarrassment makes me a statue - its far, far to late to talk myself out of this; I can only hope she leaves the office again soon, so I can escape.

However, her latest conversation is also taking a long time. She seems to be talking to one of the sales reps, but has quickly gone past sales figures to discussing her own figure, particularly how his hands felt on it at the last sales conference, and what she'll wrap it in at the next one. She runs one calf with the instep of the other foot; the tiny, intimate rasp of nylon on nylon is like catnip to me, and I start to register the slightly chemical smell of clean stocking material at blood temperature in the confined space under the desk. The shoe she's using slips off her heel, and for a precious, hypnotic moment it's dangling from her toe, revealing the whole sensuous arch of her sole from ball to heel. I realise that, despite the ludicrous situation and uncomfortable position, my cock is hardening.
She abruptly reaches down to scratch an itch on the exposed arch of her foot - I can't breathe, her eyes must be inches from seeing me holed up like the most abject pervert, but I still wish that it were my hands tracing a path over her foot. The idea of running my tongue along that arch, however remote, is intensely erotic, and I can almost feel the dry, slightly abrasive texture of her hose on the tip of my tongue.

She finally finishes the phone call, and leans back a little in her chair, fortunately not enough to see me. She kicks off her shoes, instinctively leaving them neatly paired to one side. My hand is on the floor next to them - my mind flashes to a fantasy of Karina as a dominatrix, trampling my body with those narrow heels, digging them into my flesh as my pain becomes her pleasure. This is a mistake - it's resulting in real pain; my cock is bent in half in my underwear, and it's not getting softer. Is she going to leave? Do I dare move? Do I dare lick the smooth, patent leather of her shoes?

Abruptly, she scoots her chair forward, crossing one smooth, powerful leg over the other as she pulls the keyboard towards her. I freeze again - her toes are barely an inch from my nose. Cross-eyed, I can see the quality of her pedicure through the thin, sheer nylon, and it's admirable, every nail neatly trimmed and painted a deep, hot red. I can't help imagining taking each toe into my mouth in turn and worshipping it with my tongue. The scent of her hose is intoxicating me. Furtively, I shift position to free up a hand. I know that if I touched her foot, I would probably be kicked in the face and sacked in quick succession, so, using the desperate logic of the horny male, I very quietly unzip my pants to re-arrange my agonised cock, hoping to appease it without being discovered.

This is a gross mistake. Quite naturally, my cock responds like a champion, stretching and swelling without being asked. It knows it's near the feet of a beautiful goddess, and leaves the ghastly, humiliating circumstances for my brain to worry about.

Now I'm truly stuck. I could maybe have talked my way out of this situation before, but with an erection in my hand, it's impossible. I feel pre-cum leaking from my cock - I don't think I can just pack my erection away without staining my pants, and it doesn't seem to be going away. Something about the humiliation I face and the inescapable but intensely fetishistic scenario is turning me on.

""Hi!"" Karina says brightly. Another heart attack. Has she seen me, is she teasing me? I hear another voice; it's Liz, Karina's supervisor, a tall, slim brunette in her early 40's, with enough poise and character to still do part-time modelling for high-end evening wear. I groan internally - of all of the people in the office who could be part of my humiliation, it would have to be the one I most crush on. Liz wears a lot of sleeveless, fitted dresses around the office to show off the results of a lot of gym time, and has an expensive shoe habit to go with it. I hear a creak - she's sat on the edge of the desk, her finely-muscled ass barely eight inches above my head, and her feet are dangling next to Karina's legs. Her legs are bare, smoothly shaved, and she wears cork-soled wedges that throw her feet into a sculptural form. I can see that her nails are painted a sparkly metallic purple; I realise that the swollen glans of my cock is somewhere between that colour and the red of Karina's. I also realise that there's no use pretending that I'm trying to placate my cock - I'm gently stroking it. I haven't been listening to their conversation, but they suddenly burst into laughter, with the carefree musicality of the very beautiful. I turn a shade redder as I imagine them laughing at me, Karina cruelly taunting my modest cock as Liz instructs me to push it between the sole of her foot and her shoe, making me fuck her shoe as an act of submission and humiliation, ready to crush it like a worm at the moment of orgasm.

My fantasies are getting out of hand now, but my cock is well *in* hand - I'm stroking it properly now, lust dulling the part of my brain that is asking how I expect to resolve this situation. I'm resigned to staying here until either I'm discovered, or everyone goes home. I hear a third voice - ""Have either of you seen &lt;bashful&gt;?"". I imagine Liz responding - ""Yes, he's jerking off to Karina's feet under the desk. Can you go and get someone from security?"" Could my erection survive even that? In my mind's eye, somehow, I am paraded naked through the office by our Amazonian, blonde security guard, Anna, who somehow has the authority to handcuff me, while all of my co-workers have become very attractive women who take a moment to cast a critical eye over me...

I realise that this can't go on. Liz is leaning over to look at a spreadsheet, and Karina's foot is closer than ever to my face. I look around the tiny, cluttered space that I'm in, searching for ideas. Behind me, under Marissa's desk, I find a solution. Marissa is Karina's intern, a bright nineteen-year-old of interestingly mixed race and with an eye-catching line in breathtakingly tight slacks. She has left a pair of sneakers under her desk from a lunchtime power-walk, and out of one of them peeks a clean, white cotton athletic sock. I carefully extract it and bring it to me - pausing, I admit, to give it a sniff, which does nothing to dampen my erection. I roll the sock over my cock in the time-honoured manner, like a vastly limp white condom, and I feel a bizarre sensation of freedom, as though I see the light at the end of the tunnel. What I actually see is four delightful and unsuspecting female feet as I mount my assault on the summit. The white cotton feels very good on my sensitive glans, and the hem rubs freely on my balls. I want to cum, but the change in sensation has pushed me back a little.

Karina slips her feet back into her shoes - again, I'm amazed that she doesn't look down far enough to see me - and the sight of each one is like a shapely nylon-clad penis find it's home in a receptive vagina. She swivels to one side, and I hope she's getting up, but she's just leaning back to talk to Liz, and she crosses her legs. I suddenly know that I want to place the head of my cock on the floor and have Karina step on it. I want Liz to make me crouch on all fours and kick my pathetic balls. I want to lick their feet like a dog. I know  that I want be a slave to their feet, and I know that I'm cumming, orgasming into a stolen sock in the most degraded way possible, and that it's all I can do to keep silent and not hit the desk in any way. My humiliation at my own perversion flushes through my brain like a breaking wave, flows down my spine and out of my cock. My load pools disgustingly in the cotton - no goddess could be interested in my filth, I know, instinctively. My back and arm are suddenly cramped and sore. As the orgasm subsides, I desperately try to contain the wad of seed I've just spend and wipe it off my cock. I ball the sock up. I don't know whether to pocket it or hide it back in Marissa's sneaker. I will have time to think about this, while I wait for Karina and Liz to leave, and for the lights to go off.

I can't wait to do this again."

Politics can often be pretty unpleasant, but today, I'd like to take a little of the tension out of it all, and set up a sexual roleplay, based in the world of politics! I have a number of scenarios in mind, and a number of potential roleplay pairings, so let me know which you like best in your opening message, and I'm sure that we can work something out! I've provided story ideas for the most popular free, but I'd be more than happy to work something out with any of the others I've listed, or any that you'd like to suggest.

So, without further ado, here are the ladies on offer!

- [Ivanka Trump](https://twt-media.washtimes.com/media/image/2017/06/23/ivanka_trump_shoe_lawsuit_48487.jpg) - First Daughter of the US, and a sex symbol for many young conservatives, I'd love to try something out with Ivanka. Whether she has an affair with a staffer or intern, or uses her natural dominance to win over a British envoy from abroad, there are a whole host of ways that we could play with Ivanka!

- [Tiffany Trump](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170119222031-tiffany-trump-01-19-super-tease.jpg) - though less popular than her older sister, I'd still love to try something out with Tiffany, largely along the same lines as the stories I mentioned for Ivanka.

- [Chelsea Clinton](http://madison365.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/160728125822-32-chelsea-clinton-0728-super-169.jpg) - Chelsea Clinton is criminally underrated. I'd love to play out a story in which she seduces a much younger, conservative guy at a college, or is asked out on a date by a nervous admirer.

- Sarah Palin

- Malia Obama

- Nikki Haley

- Kellyanne Conway

- Marion Le Pen

- Huma Abedin

- Hillary Clinton

- Lauren Southern

- Tulsi Gabbard

- Megyn Kelly

If you'd be interested, hit me up! I like to plan kinks on a story-by-story basis, so don't worry about upsetting me those. Here's hoping that I can find somebody!"
7fzsv4,7,2017-11-27,"Sleep Schedule is about as out-of-wack as you can get, nothing helps",khharagosh,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7fzsv4/sleep_schedule_is_about_as_outofwack_as_you_can/,"I've been trying to fix my sleep schedule for 3 years now. I've struggled to fall asleep my entire life; I remember being a kid and being AMAZED that my friends fell asleep as soon as they hit the sack, because it usually took me at least an hour. 

I've almost failed multiple classes because of my sleep problems (sleeping through or being late when they take attendance), and my boss at my internship last summer was really annoyed with me because I struggled to get to work before 9:30 (I was also exercising regularly during this period). I've slept through 2 exams in my college career (luckily, both professors took mercy on me). I naturally fall asleep around 5am, and have a hard time waking up before noon. I miss out on a lot because of this, and I've really screwed people over if we had a morning obligation and I've overslept. I'm usually sleep deprived, because I'm up late even when I have to wake up in the morning. 

Late night electronics use is definitely a problem, but I'm often up late working, and as a computer science major, most of my work is on the computer (my other major is art, and if you know artists, you know that doesn't help either--I way too often get in the ""mode"" around 1am). 

Exam period is coming up and it always gets worse then; I usually get on a 6am-3:00pm schedule by accident without classes to force me up, and don't manage to reset until I pull an all-nighter. During last years exam period for the fall semester, there was a good 3-4 days where I didn't see sunlight and man, that takes a toll on your psyche. Today I slept until 3:30pm and I need to get up tomorrow morning. Also, getting up early to finish work? Forget it. Won't happen. If something isn't done, I'm better off staying up to all-hours because ""wake up at 9am and get it done"" has never worked for me. Ever. 

I've tried melatonin, but it gave me some terrible nightmares. My doctor prescribed sleeping meds to me for a period to ""reset"", but I've gotten off schedule again and I don't want to be addicted to them. I don't like the idea of taking stimulants during the day and depressants at night my entire life. Of all my ADHD symptoms, this is easily the most disruptive for me. I don't know how to fix it. Multiple alarms don't work (trust me, I've tried several different apps and I usually have at least 10 alarms set, which is hard on my roommates). Vitamin supplements don't work. Meds don't work. Asking other people to wake me up isn't reliable and unfair to them because it's still difficult to get me out of bed (I've had one roommate tell me that they have to stop trying to help me up because they didn't like the extra stress in the morning). I have a 9:30 am class next semester, not to mention I'm graduating soon and have to actually work a regular schedule when other humans are up and functioning. At this point I seriously don't know what to do.

7fztu9,5,2017-11-27,"Deadlines for applications are approaching fast and I am now thinking about taking another year off, is this a good call?",Steelwall_Johnson,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7fztu9/deadlines_for_applications_are_approaching_fast/,"Hi all,

I graduated in may 2017 with my BS in Environmental Science. I was unsure about graduate school during my senior, as I had only done research once and only had one internship experience which was also sort of research oriented. Upon getting my first job I quickly realized that the private sector is kind of boring and I missed academia. That was in September, I did not take my GRE until the end of October, and I did not even have a concrete 5 or 6 programs I wanted to apply too. I have professors and professional contacts to write letters of rec and I contacted them a little spontaneously, and now I feel kind of silly having to email them again telling them never mind. 

I definitely have a couple programs I'd like to apply to, but don't feel like im 100% certain about any of them. A lot of them sound interesting, but then I look at the professors who are involved and their research, and it is usually not as interesting. Lastly, my front runner program has an early application deadline that I would probably need to apply to ( Dec. 15th) if  I want a shot at getting enough funding where I'll be able to be fully committed to my studies. This then has me thinking about retaking the GRE because I did not do that great ( did not study like a fool). I know that standardized test scores aren't that important but I'm worried about someone getting chosen over me for a TA position or some other kind of funding, because while we maybe both had good GPAs, letters of rec, background that mend well with what we are applying for, etc. they'll be chosen over me due to higher GRE scores. 

All this has me thinking that I should wait until next year. This worries me a little though because I likely wouldn't be starting until fall 2019 at that point, as most of the programs I've seen don't admit students in the spring, or it's harder to get funding. A two year gap seems like a lot of time for me, as everything I did in undergrad won't be as fresh in my mind. There is also that whole GOP tax plan thing that everyone seems worried about, not that I am that informed enough on the matter to know how much it will really affect me. 

So yea, what do you think, I should probably just wait another year right? 

Thanks in advance! "

The first company Makes operating Systems and stuFf. The second has a blue logo and usually a huge signing Bonus
 Right now I am leaning towards the second for the following reasons: 
 • The area is closer to where I live and I know a few people there
 • I liked the office and culture more when I visited during the on site interviews 
 • slightly better pay but I know it won’t matter at the end because the cost of living is much higher, but I think it will be the same at the end considering the fact that the difference is significant. 
 • I was given the impression that it’s more likely to get a full time offer after my internship at the second company but still not sure.
Things making me hesitant:
• I like the department I got an offer to work in from the second company a lot. People told me that this company's work is more”serious” but I don’t think that's totally true. 
• I feel like the second company has a bigger name but I am not sure which one stands out more Any input would be really appreciated. 

If you can tell me some things I should consider it would be great.
Thank you so much for everything. I have been lurking here for almost 9 months and if you're reading this you have probably helped me so much to reach this point in my life."

A close family member of mine works with a major software company and wants me to apply to the company for an internship. By the sound of it, he's very close to the people involved in hiring and my resume would most likely go to the top of the list. 

However, I also have an opportunity to hike the Pacific Crest Trail next summer, which is an absolute dream of mine. 

The internship isn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it is a ""permanent"" internship, so I'd essentially be an intern there part-time until I graduate, then I'd go straight into having a full-time job at the company. 

The idea that I could have an internship that pays so incredibly well and that I don't have to leave during the school year sounds absolutely incredible to me, I could possibly move out of my house (I have a lot of stress related to my home life), and getting into it this early into my school career is just so absolutely mind blowing to me.

But hiking this trail is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I've dreamt of doing it for a long time, but it would drain my savings, and upon coming home I'd end up going back to a minimum-wage job until the next year when I could potentially apply for this internship then. But I don't know if my uncle will be in the same position to give me such a large boost then.

I just feel lost. Someone point me in the right direction."

Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I was interviewing for multiple internships for my final semester of college (media/entertainment industry) and received an offer last Tuesday for one that was tied in my 'favorites' with another. Wanting to check in before I made a decision, I informed the team of the other company (which we can call AC) that I received an offer who would like a response by latest Monday (today). 





This morning, AC responded with an email stating that I would not be able to intern in the Spring ""due to scheduling"" (including a small section talking about how it was difficult to schedule this applicant pool because everyone was available the same days), and the following text:





*We hope that you will check back with us for a summer internship position. On April 30 we will begin accepting resumes. You will not need to submit yours again nor will you need to interview a second time, but if you could send us your availability around April 30 for the summer, we would love that. Additionally, we will check back in with you around that time as well.*





*A spot cannot be promised, however if scheduling permits, we would love to have you be a part of our intern team. If you are busy for summer, there will also possibilities for the Fall 2018 Internship position when that time comes.*





Now, I'd like your opinion on if this sounds like something promising, how I should touch base in April, should I send a thank you email now, etc. I've never been told that I won't need a second interview before, even when I've received an offer and pushed it off for a later semester.

I'm sorry for this wall of text, but I guess I'm way more lost than I thought I was. But this is a great community and I thought I'd take a shot with your good graces. Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

As the title suggests, I haven't racked up very many ECs in my time in high school. Uncharacteristic of this sub, I have not yet found my passions in life. I just moved from a small town in the midwest where my school had next to zero clubs to a huge public school in California. However, what I thought had been my passion: computer science, seems to be turning out to be not for me. I tried to take AP CompSci but because I transferred so late the class was full. And I attended a hacking club meeting the first week of school, but the people and the concept just weren't for me. I never considered robotics, and I fear its too late for that now. I'm attempting now to teach myself how to use Swift to code iOS apps, but its a long process, which is making me feel like I might not be all that interested in CS. But at the same time, who knows, I've had so little exposure I don't know how to tell. I also feel like it's too late into my junior year to join any ECs to find out, am I wrong? I know I could email all of the tech startups in my town asking for an internship, but what's the likelihood that they'd actually take me on, as a person who knows so little about programming? My second largest interest is Aerospace Engineering, but again, how would I ever really know as I haven't had the opportunity to take any Physics classes yet and all I know is that I really like math and I am obsessed with airplanes and rockets (and I did like Chem, but I'm stuck in IB Environmental Science this year but now that I'm looking back at it I really wish I would have taken AP Chem or Physics which I didn't even know was an option but my only friend in the school was in IBESS so I didn't want to switch out, stupid of me, I know, but ugh). And engineering extracurriculars seem even more daunting to me, like how would a high schooler ever get access to some engineering related activity? This comes into play because my dream school is UC Berkeley, I think, but at this point I don't have a scrap of a chance at being admitted to the CoE which leaves my best bet as applying to L&amp;S Computer Science and I don't even know if I would be interested in that! My second choice school is Cal Poly SLO, however, which I think I have a good shot at getting into either of those majors, but once again, I don't have any true passion other than years of geeking out on computers and waving to airplanes as they fly across the sky and SLO is a ""list major on application"" school. I really want to attend Berkeley to prove to myself that I'm worth something, and that my effort in high school will all amount to something, and I'm dreading the fact that my abysmal ECs and passion in general will hold me back from my dreams. This has turned into a rant, and I'm sorry, but if anyone is still reading I'd greatly appreciate any advice you could give me as to how to proceed with my search for ECs, or honestly life in general. I don't feel like my school counselors are helpful, and my parents can only praise me so much before it becomes more detrimental than anything else.

TL;DR
I'm halfway through my junior year and I don't have many EC's at all, let alone passions in general for EC's to even be associated with. I like computers and airplanes, and that's about it. I feel lost, and I'm looking for any advice."

This is supposed to be a 4 year degree, but I'm taking 5 years because I'm not a good student. I am not that worried anymore about my future because I already got used to getting shitty grades, but also I would like to know what other options I have. Does the army accept people that barely graduated from college and who never had an internship? Let me know!!!   "

We are looking for an equity partner to get involved in our project. 

Depending on the skill set you bring we could negotiate an amount. We are however looking for someone that would be a part of the team and payable in our Tokens.

Obviously we don't' want to mention the nature of the program in public but it would involved a couple things.

1 - Main thing would involve bringing a RNG into coding on a gaming platform

2 - Many more advanced things as the project grows, which is why we would like a long term relationship with MULTIPLE devs to be involved for bug checking as well as bouncing ideas of each other. Our two current team members are fairly new at Solidarity so we would really eed someone with solid experience. 

If you like Challenges this is for you. You will obviously want to know the nature of the program before getting involved. This would assure it is something you want to be involved in. Please drop us a line and we will fill you in. 

The initial phase of this will not have programming that is too in depth. The secondary portion will be a little more complex and most likely involve team development with our wallet programmer. Once that goal is attained the third part will be simple again. The portions beyond that will be fairly complex. 

If you feel you could only achieve primary portions we still welcome you - and will continue to look for an extremely advanced Solidity partner. 

The project is great, a lot of people are excited about it, but it is not something that can be fully accomplished in a couple weeks. 

That being said we do not need this to be your primary job. It is something you could work on after hours. While we will have dev goals they are semi flexible, our personal goals will be ahead of the publicly stated goals to give breathing room in that department. 

Look forward to talking to some people - even if you are a beginning dev in Solidarity you could be a part of this project and learn from others as they expand the code base. So it would be a good project for you to get involved in as well.

7g2450,5,2017-11-28,How on do you cope when everything feels like it’s falling apart and bad things keep happening?,hexenkunst,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/7g2450/how_on_do_you_cope_when_everything_feels_like_its/,"Logically I know it’s not the end of the world but it’s been like, 3 months of straight-up bullshit and it’s starting to make me feel suicidal. 

I moved in to my own little apartment in July and then turned 24 last month. In between my birthday and now I’ve probably had like 5+ mental breakdowns and crying fits, everything feels WAY harder than it should and I want to curl up into a ball and just rot!

Check it out: in September I quit my soul-sucking job and got an unpaid internship position at a place I’d call my dream job! I worked for free, 9 hours a day and came home to my cozy little apartment which I loved. Then one day my bathroom ceiling randomly collapsed because my upstairs neighbour had a gross clog! It took days but it got fixed. I was running out of money but had to replace a bunch of damaged things in the bathroom. I finally got offered a contract at the end of the internship, except it’s only for 3 months. I panic but try to be positive, maybe they’ll hire me on after those 3 months are up.

I’m still working there and it’s great, but my apartment starts to feel like a hellhole. Bugs start coming in through the (forever closed) sliding door in October. My boyfriend kills them all but I can’t sleep without him and because of my debilitating fear of bugs and anxiety as a result. It’s a horrible phobia and I end up sleeping at my mom’s house which sucks because she’s always been abusive. Eventually management seals the door a little better and I don’t see any more bugs, I started sleeping again (literally just a couple of days ago).

Today I come home for a 10 hour work day and I see ants all over my bathroom floor! What the fuck! I was home all weekend with my bf and in the morning there were no ants to be seen. Not to mention we had a big unrelated fight over the weekend and now I’m all anxious about how he could love me since I’m such an insecure, shitty mess. I cry at least 3 times a week. Things feel unbearably tough and it feels like I can’t catch a break. I can barely function and I don’t know how I’ve been keeping up appearances at this job. 

I’m over 1 year into this relationship with a guy I love and am constantly scared of losing and 5 months into a lease I want to end. I’m paying way more than I want to for a tiny studio apartment that is starting to feel less and less like home and I have no idea if I’ll still have a job in 2 months and no place to go if I don’t.

How do you see the positive in situations like this? I try so hard but I feel like I’ve been having the worst luck lately! I was even thinking to myself in the shower yesterday how much I love my bathroom and bam! Next day - ants! 

Is this what being an adult is like? Constant stress? My skin is breaking out, my entire body is in pain and I’m too scared to go sleep again because my bug phobia is back. I can barely make it one day without being sad of freaking out :("

My husband is old money--we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is fifteen years old and the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife--I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I *do* it. 


But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're seventeen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to *be* you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes--and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more! 

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me. 


You had been moody lately, I knew that--your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were *so* angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own. 


Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to *me* instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was *weird* when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started *fucking* me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and--well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress. 

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was *you*, my *son*, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified--I couldn't understand why you would want to *do* this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out? 


But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father--you think I deserve you. 

-----

SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside. 


I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too! "

I'm a college student applying for an internship at a large production company and they require a resume. I have a resume for small gigs/college jobs so I feel like high school experience is more or less okay to list on my resume at this point.  However, is it less okay to have high school experience on the resume that I'm submitting to this company? They do a lot of A/V and lighting work, and the experience I had in high school was all self-taught and was kind of the ""lite"" version of a designer and ME (I hung and focused lights, ran cable, drafted plots, maintenanced fixtures, programmed the board, and taught and supervised underclassmen what I knew). I feel like adding that to my resume when applying for college jobs was useful, and it feels relevant to this internship I'm applying for, but maybe it won't be as credible when transitioning to a more professional environment?

How appropriate is it to put high school experience on a professional resume/when should I stop putting it on a resume?"

To be a cross dresser you would think that one just has to change. It’s not that easy though. Our society has become a lot more accepting, but there is still the stigma that you are gay.  If you choose to wear the opposites sex clothing, you must be homosexual. That is not always the truth. 

Standing in the gymnasium, William knew this was not right. He was sure that this joke couldn’t be serious. Those girls were so mean to him when he lost the bet. Fast forward here.

“William, let’s go talk in private. I have arranged with the Principal for a conference room for us.”

She couldn’t be serious, right? She believed this crap? I am not a cross dresser. I am just the victim of a bad prank. These pantyhose feel so odd. Squishing my manhood. How do women do this?

Once the door closed, she turned with a huge smile. One I thought was fake at first, but learned later was because she needed me here.

“I am so excited to have you on board. You wont be our first Crossdresser.”

WHAT? She thought I was going to stay this way? The more I tried to resist, the more she pushed me to conform. How the heck was I going to do this was all I could think at first. I needed this internship so bad.

**“I miss need to call your Mom and tell her. This number is okay?”**

Before I could say no, she was dialing the house number and had my Mother on the phone. Right then I could of completely died. My Mother would not understand this at all.

“Hi this is Jessica with the internship program at the School. We have William in here and he, well she, has signed on with out company. I want to assure you that we are find with her kind. We have made all needs necessary to adjust the facilities for her.”

**I could hear her quiet for a moment, and her eyes went to my direction, followed by a disapproving glance.  This was forced crossdressing.**

“How about you just meet us at the school and we can discuss this in private. I’m sorry too. I will see you soon.”

She scolded me about this. She told me that I should of told my Mother, but she will help me with the transformation and hold my hand through it all.

**WHAT TRANSFORMATION. IT WAS A DARE!**

Of course I didn’t scream that, but inside of me I did. Inside I wanted to run to the bathroom and cry, but what bathroom. The mens or the womens?

“Welcome, and William is all ready to talk to you. She is sorry she did not tell you, but today, well it’s her day to come out. We will have rules though. If you need some help with shopping for her clothing, we can advance her paycheck.”

My Mother looked like she was slapped. Her eyes widened and she looked as though she was going to cry. I’ve disappointed her, but this woman was relentless with convincing her it was all okay. Once we took the paper and left, the ride home would be awkward.

“You’re gay?”

“You want to be a girl”

“Where did I go wrong with you?”

“Fine, you wanted this. Once we buy all this, after you tell your Dad, were burning everything you own. You want this and now you will have forced crossdressing.”

7g3xv8,2,2017-11-28,Should I risk asking her out before we go overseas?,Xanderishalfmyname,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/7g3xv8/should_i_risk_asking_her_out_before_we_go_overseas/,"So I recently got accepted into a group internship program where I'll be going to a rural village in India. Me and this girl met on the Facebook group to arrange flights together and we ended up booking a tour once the program finishes, and we're staying together in the same room for a few days before the program starts.

So we've been hanging out quite a lot recently. It started out as just trying to organize our trip but it's been more a day out as friends to like the beach, grabbing lunch, etc. We've also been FaceTiming and talking for hours during the day/night; getting to know each other really well on a pretty personal level. I think she might like me, and I am definitely starting to like her. 


So my question is should I risk asking her out before we leave for the trip which is about a month away? Or should I play it safe and ask her out once we get back to prevent any potential awkwardness during the trip if she turns me down?"

Props to anyone that makes it through xD)**

(TLDR AT THE BOTTOM!)

Hello fellow redditors!
Usually i'm sort of just a lurker, i comment a little here and there, but i'm in dire need of an advice this time.

First of all, even though the title may make it look out to be like this, this post here is in *no* way, 
shape or form supposed to be promoting anything!
That's why i will not post a link to the music in this post. I'm just looking for an honest advice here, guys.
Also i should state that what I'm struggling with is not really easy to put into words (at least i don't know how) so put your empathy hats on and bare with me,
as i try to put my thoughts down in really inconvenient and drawn out sentences.
 (Again, i'm sorry!)

Let me start off by saying that i *really* hate the idea of having a job thanks to my shitty attitude 
and with ""shitty"" I mean that I seriously can't stay at a job that i don't enjoy personally for longer than 3 - 6 months. That's the way it has always been up until one point. I've *tried*, believe me, i really did try to go on about these routines for more times than i can think but i still always end up quitting it, cause i feel like shit. I can't really pinpoint exactly what it is that actually drives me nuts, though.
Maybe it's the fact that i'll just be working on a machine and *figuratively* become a gear in a machine altogether myself.
Getting up to work, just to come back tired to go back to sleep.
**Rinse and Repeat.** (especially in a kitchen scenario, dishwashing y'all!)
I've tried a lot of other job situations, though.
At first i always start off being all hopeful and enthusiastic about the new job/money i'll be getting, but after the 6th month or so, 
the only real ""work"" i'd be putting into anything in the morningwould end up being my bed sheets, seeing how i can best avoid the sunshine meeting my eyes when i pre-maturely wake up. 
(sounded better in my head, so insert another obligatory wordplay/shitty a here)
The thing that i've noticed is that i actually start to enjoy just about any aspect of life just
that much more *less* that it becomes noticable.
I mean i know that it's supposed to be normal because i'm more tired thanks to my schedule actually consisting of more things than sleeping and eating and doing hobby stuff.But it gets to the point where i literally can't enjoy a thing. 
I just get really damn lethargic and i get moody, people even notice it and confront me about it. Whatever i do, in the back of my mind, i always have this damn devil in my head, telling me 
""Oh, you better not enjoy this too much, you'll be working from 9 - 5 tomorrow again!
Better not get to bed too late, too!""
It has always been this way.. up until a few years ago! **(ppsst, this is where the real struggle will start to show)**
Up until a few years ago my only hobby was gaming, really. Maybe even the 'ol ""I like to meet my kek friends"" cliché.
My life was boring as hell (still is except for one part). Some unimportant events later and I was about 12-13 (i think) and i ended up trying to write music, because a friend was really good at playing the piano. Needless to say it blew me away! I was captivated, I seriously found nothing on this world to be so damn soothing, exciting, tiring and challenging at once. All that mashed together and it was the time of my life! I ended up getting a *really* shitty guitar, 
where i wrote a few notes at a time, really shitty music, honestly. A few years later I quit my current ""job"" because i wanted to go to school again
(actually didn't get fired this time, woo!)
Though honestly, I only wanted to continue school because that would mean I could draw out my life-schedule just that little bit more.
So the usual 6 month went by and I actually wrote whole entire songs!
That was unbelievable for me, because for the first time i worked really damn hard on something
and it never really came out the way i planned but I was never growing tired!
No matter how much time i had spent on my (new-found) hobby, i loved every single bit of it.
So i figured, why not take my new-found love for a crash course and find a fitting job?
Well, where I live creative jobs are hard to come by, you need a (proper proper) education 
to even find something or you need a whole lot of Vitamin B and/or money
None of those things I had.
Time to shake the right hands then, I thought.
I started an internship at my local music studio and that's when it really clicked for me.
After seeing all this, and having a super nice guy welcome me to the world of producing, the cards were dealt for me. I wanted to make a living producing! Hell, maybe even make music myself!(?)
""Back-Then-Me"" probably knew that this -most of the times-, is but a dream people have,
since it's really hard to get yourself known.
""Current Me"" still thinks that but ""Current Me and ""Back-Then-Me"" would both find an agreement 
and say we'd give it a shot. Else we'd ""never know what could've been"".
So.. i created a really stupid musical persona and..
*OBVIOUSLY* started making rap music. (though its more of a rap/metal mix)
**(You guys, this is where the ""fun"" starts"")**

So I wrote, I mixed, I mastered, for over 3 years, put every creative fiber and soul into this project! 
It may not sound like much to anyone out there on a surface level, but it means so much to me.
And now that i feel like it's done.. I feel like i am as well.
You see, because i had no money and a stupid cocky attitude, I decided to do everything myself.
Basically almost all of the songs I've written took me about 700-ish hours (not counting how many times I've re-visited them). Given that I've finished about 30 songs..
That's a shitload of time i put into that by my estimation.
The worst part is, that it was in my eyes, the definition of development hell.
(or musical hell? No Justin Biebers jokes here, sadly)
I had countless problems with my shitbrick of a pc that was probably hitlers very own computer from back in the day according to the way it shat all over me.
I had bad input signal, had super shitty latency issues, plus my hard drive died on me so i lost 80% of all progress and the original files, so i had to re-do most of the record -or what i could.
And thats just to name a few issues i had.
Not saying it's not my fault for not upgrading/repairing my pc, 
I had no idea what I was getting myself into and I didn't have my priorities straight.
On top of that, the biggest burden was probably that I didn't have anyone to really reflect on.
I have some friends that are into music, some are really talented too.
Most of my friends aren't into this type of music, though. 
So the only thing they'll tell me is that it's not their cup of tea.
So i get into this weird mindset where i think ""If it's *not* that, then what is it?""
I somehow concluded that it must be because my music is shit and they don't want to tell me out of the impulse of being friendly, or they don't really want to bother.
So i probably come off as really delirious or even pretentious when i want to hear their input.
But all i want is for them to critique me, it's how i want to grow, too!
Maybe i feel like I'm not being taken serious?
Don't get me wrong, i have super nice friends and I'm probably reading this entire situation wrongly
and give them wrong credit for what the situation holds, I mean truly they are so good to me.
But it just feels like im in a mental prison where i feel like my effort will be all for nothing
if i can't express my ""art"" in a way where i get input from others. 
It may sound really damn self-centered and i wouldn't want it to sound that way,
but that's what my mind is circling around all day.
Do you guys see a pattern here? 
I'm really good at not seeing the forest for the trees. But moving on
**(pppssst guys, this is the climax of this entire thing)**

Now here i am, finished with most of my stuff. 
With the power i had, i finished what i set out to do.
I learned so much and i know I've improved so damn much in just about every aspect of myself
Not just musically but as a human being. -BUT-
**I'm burned out.** 

I have *such* a hate/love relationship with this project 'cause it caused me so much stress.
So what do I do now? - I have no idea!
Since then I've dropped out of school because I'm stupid
And now I'm sitting here with this product that i want to get out to the world, but i want to make it justice.
I want to do videos for the singles, but i have no money nor the creative juices to keep going.
But I don't want to take a break! This EP is already dated production-wise, so i don't want to wait till 2020
to put it out, since then it'll sound even shittier because production in music is moving forward so fast.
And i mean don't exactly want to meet the Zeitgeist (again, production-wise speaking) 
but i damn well don't want it to be aging anymore, too!
It would be no problem to just re-master them later on,
but the original files of most of the records poofed with the HDD, 
so this is the best I can get it to be.
And some things i don't think i can and want to re-produce. 
(let alone the fact that my voice changed a whole lot, too)
I may just be nit-picking, but this is what it all culminated to. 
Every single one of these ""issues"" (and so much more)
piled up to form this totally shitfuck situation.
I tried to take a break, but now instead of telling me about my schedule
and the fact that i should keep my hands over the blanket at night, so i'm full rested for work tomorrow,
the little fucker in my head reminds me that there is this unfinished, unreleased work that i've put so much energy and love into, but i can't move on, because there is no energy and/or motivation/money left.

My struggle is basically about me not really knowing what i should do with my life as of now.
I feel like this is the only thing im capable of/good at, so much so, that i have a hard time
seeing anything else but this.
Am i over thinking things? 
If yes, what is objectively the best thing i can do in a decent timely fashion before this unrest gets even worse? (If it does).
In before you guys go ""GET JOB"" 
I don't think i'd be stable enough just yet, as weird as it sounds, (going to the doc about that)
I have really tried to get along with the idea that maybe i should just drop it, 
get a job and forget about it for a while.
But I'm so close now, i can almost see the finish line!

I'm sorry for this mess of a post, i just needed to get it out of my system in a way so you guys could wear my shoes for 10 minutes, also this is the first time i'm actually posting *proper* stuff here, 
so formatting may be shite.

**((TLDR: I've burned myself out mentally because of a creative project i spent (in my estimation) too much time on and now i've lost all juice and motivation to do anything else, since i can't stop thinking about it.))**
Guys of /r/Advice, I call upon your magical power, please help me like you helped so many others
and show me a way out of this mess.

I will try my *very* best to answer to and reflect on any and every advice/thought you guys can give me.

This is my first time posting here but I've seen the amazing advice this community provides and was hoping I could receive some insight. I am currently a college student graduating in May 2018, while working an internship part time. I make $20/hr, so I earn about $470 bi-weekly. I am fortunate enough to have no major expenses, I only have to pay for food, my commute (which averages $60~ per week) and a few small bills that I split with my roommates. I am also fortunate enough to be graduating with no loans, my parents will just have me start paying my own bills upon graduation.

My biggest issue right now has been my spending habits and lack of savings. I have been consistently working at $20/hr during summer/winter breaks from school, yet I have absolutely nothing to show for. This is a result of poor spending habits I developed my senior year. I have a credit card with Discover, and I thankfully have spent this semester paying down what I owed and I no longer have debt. However, on Discover.com my FICO score is at 640, which tugs at my anxiety and I have had no luck improving it. I am planning on working full time Dec. 15 - Jan 22 and hope to save a lot of what I earn, and continue to fix my credit, I am just at a complete loss on how to do so. 

r/personalfinance, my questions to you are: 

*  What tips do you have to improve my credit score? I feel like I should close my credit card with Discover and open a new one. Mine is currently a miles card, and I have absolutely no need for the miles so I end up redeeming them for a small amount of $
*  What can I do to improve my saving and spending habits while finishing school? I should be continuing to net around $900 a month, how should I properly manage this money? 
*  What should I be doing at this age, given my background as a working student, to ensure I make the most out of my paychecks and fortunate situation of having no loans or serious bills at this moment.

Thank you so much in advance. "
7g4f7v,4,2017-11-28,I just can't stick to it. My shitty story and a pathetic attempt for some pity motivation.,r0k0v,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7g4f7v/i_just_cant_stick_to_it_my_shitty_story_and_a/,"This is probably just a bullshit ranting series of anecdotes from a depressed a fucked up mind. 


I discovered Nofap when I was 19 and first really started using reddit. I subbed a bunch of self improvement things and ended up at Nofap via r/seduction. I was fat nerdy guy raised by parents who were strict and sheltered me.  I'm 25 now and I still struggle with this addiction. 

I've got to 50 days twice, 30s a couple of times but I havent really been able to go longer than 2 weeks for years. 

When I was 19, that summer before my junior year of college I got a good streak going. I noticed I could talk to girls way easier that fall. I crushed on a girl hard but nofap is not magic and I could not overcome my anxieties. I relapsed then because it's just easier to deal with the emotions and anxiety when you dull them. That semester, unrelated to this, I got depressed and had to move home for the next semester.

That winter I got another 50 day streak going. I broke it again when I was super social and flirty with a girl I was potentially crushing on but I really have a gigantic fear of showing my emotions so I relapsed again because It's easier when I'm numb. 

So Fall 2013, I'm a year into this nofap experiment. I start off with a strong streak and despite picking up a Weed habit and smoking everyday I'm super energetic and social. I end up ending this streak because I go on my first ever date with a girl when I'm 21. I got horny just thinking about her and I was really pissed off because I didn't like not being in control of my body. I didnt really know what the feeling was. I mean I started PMO when I was 14. I was fat and nerdy then and had adopted an internal goal of not showing my true emotions to anyone. This goal is a result of my parents not listening to me about struggles in my life (Depression and ADHD) when I was 14. This was the first real hint of romance I ever had. I did end up kissing her on the 4th date after being totally and completely nervous to do so up until that point. I couldn't escalate beyond that. We went out probably 10 times total. We really got a long great but I just couldn't vocalize my anxieties. 

So after her I did try to keep to some streaks. Girl from Spring 2013, who i worked with, still wanted to date me. She had a great sense of humour and we got along well. My response to this was to sit her down and explain why she did not want to do date me. How inside I'm deeply depressed and angry and I didn't want her to have to see that or deal with it. And that I really liked her as a friend but was just going through shit. At that point I ended up halting the smoke everyday mindset so I could get an internship and recover my semester that had started deep in depression and sleeping 12-13 hours a day.

This entire duration I'm trying to keep long streaks going, but I always end up relapsing because I get pissed off about how emotional and reactive I become.

Come Fall 2014 I'm willing to give the dating thing a try again. I start the semester and fall victim to stoner lethargy and i relapsed after a 2-3 week streak. I had gotten a girl to my bed (never happened before) and refused to cuddle, kiss her, or touch her because In my mind I thought she was stupid and it was never going to work. I didn't want to be 'vulnerable' with someone or let them in/lead them on if I knew I didn't like them. This felt awful. I thought I might be a sociopath for a while. Not true. But I felt bad.

A few weeks later I got a streak going and I got off of the MJ for a few weeks and I met a girl on Tinder. Had a great first date, went back to my place. She inched closer to me while we were watching Archer and i instinctively moved away. Wasn't used to having people in my personal space. She left, seemingly pissed off. I walked her to her car and we talked for an hour+. She told me she was upset because she had a really great time but it was obvious I wasn't interested in her. I told her I was really interested in her, I just didnt show it. She asked me why and It took me a lot of stumbling but I explained how inexperienced I was, how i like my personal space anyway, etc. We ended up dating for 4-5 months and i lost my virginity yada yada yada.

So April 2015, It ends with her. While we were dating I did masturbate some. I tried to not do it a few days in advance. But I kept doing it because I felt like I had to last as long as possible in sex and I knew if i went full on fapstronaut, that would not happen. I try and keeep streaks going. But its my senior year of college and I needed stress relief. 

I graduate in May 2015. The day after I start travelling for work. And all the nights alone in hotels destroy me. I don't have anything to do. I'm stressed and miserable. My weed and masturbation habits launch out of control to alleviate the pain. I went to music festival that June and tripped hard. I don't remember much of the trip but I do remember being super social with strangers which I have NEVER been. At the time, I felt like I could talk to anyone.  

So i get back to the work travel life (TO TEH SAME PLACE THAT WHOLE SUMMER) and I think to myself, ""This cant be it. If this is adult life, Its just not worth it. I need to meet people. ""

I went on Tinder and I met a great gal home in RI (I was travelling to ME every week). That was Summer 2015 and she's the last girl I dated. 

We had the best times. She moved to maryland for a job in October 2015. My grandma died in September 2015. I never talked to her about how destroyed I was about grandma. I kept on travelling to that same site until November. Alone the entire time. Did get off weed for 17-19 days at some point in October after she left. 

I wasn't really a super deadbeat. I stayed super active in addition to the demanding job. Running, lifting, climbing. I started out 2016 on another no smoke (probably no fap too) streak. It ended because I went on a few dates with a nice girl who was against smoking. I knew it wouldnt work out well long term. She wanted long term. I started smoking again to try to convince her I was a disaster instead of being honest (She forced the truth out of me). 

So the cycle picks back up in January 2016. I got a nofap/no smoke streak going that April. Went back on tinder 2-3 weeks in. Met two cool girls around the same time. Bad habits started picking back up. I couldnt date two people at the same time. Settled on one (the wrong one) and 5 dates in we were ready to bang. Clothes off, in my bed at my place. I start freaking out. Talk about how im so inexperienced and nervous. She calms me down, things pick up again. It gets to the point where she starts out riding me. Its intense. I have an anxiety attack. I tell her to get off of me and stop. I freak out more. Not understanding why i happened. It just felt wrong. I said some things about not understanding why she liked me. I talked about how angry i was at myself for not beign in the moment. How i felt so wrong beign in my head in that moment. Thats why i freaked out.

We tried again, she gave up on me. We're at June 2016 at this point. The travel grind keeps on going. I havent kissed a girl, or tried to kiss a girl, or tried to touch a girl im interested since. I have not in any way physically or verbally expressed my feelings for a girl since then. 

I got the opportunity to spend 2 months in SoCal for free for my job that summer. I took it and had them ship my car out (Was 23, so rental car was $$$$). Went on a bunch of dates from the internet. A lot of people sucked. One girl told me that she almost didnt come because of my pictures but was glad she did because  i was really attractive. This actually really pissed me off. I remade my profiles and attracted better people. Ended up finding two awesome gals in quick sucession. Hit it off with both, Couldnt do anything. Hit it off with some gals in the social group I had fallen in with, couldnt do anything there either.

Got really pisssed off at myself and massively depressed. Some shit happened at work that made it worse. Started smoking and masturbating a shitload because I found myself stuck in Orange County, 3200 miles from home for the next 6-7 months.

Flew out to interview for a new job back home in New England in April 2017 around easter. I was smoke and masturbation free then. Needed that clean Pee. 

Epic road trip back home in May 2017. Once I passed my drug test I immediately started smoking again, which gave way to fapping too. In my mind it didnt matter. life didnt matter. I was la long way away from anyone I knew. Anything I did in california didnt matter. I was going to fail there anyway. I just shoot myself in the foot almost religiously. 

I even fapped on the epic road trip home in May. 

I haven't been able to get a hold of either habit for more than like a week since June when I settled down back in RI. 

I'm afraid to even try. Like to really try. To quit both addictions. Fapping is honestly definitely for me WAY WAY worse than smoking spliffs (tobacco +weed). 

I'm afraid to feel again. I don't think I can handle it. Granted there is a lot more to my story than just fapping. I struggle with ADHD that frequently turns itself into depression. I need to be organized and regimented to even really function well because of my problems concentrating. The emotional affect of ADHD is a bitch too. It went undiagnosed until I was 20 (Although i did self-diagnose at age 14 but my parents didnt listen). I have problems with RSD, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. I'm intensely afraid of failure, of rejection, of loss of approval/respect. When I feel these emotions I get intense reactions. When I was younger it used to be rage but I hated that and learned to control it. Now it's shame, i just feel like a broken failure all the time. This manifests itself in one of a few ways. I either end up almost completely giving up at life, go full on perfectionist workaholic regimented achiever, or go full on people pleaser charismatic amoeba for the social part.

I understand I need to take life more seriously. I understand the negative effects of Weed and of fapping. I understand I have negative view of the world. I understand ADHD/RSD makes me life difficult. I like need to be super organized, super regimented, super active, super mindful to just feel happy. I cant' stop and relax or just chill if Im sober and I hATEEE IT. 

I just don't see a life for me where things get any better, to be honest. Like nofap and quitting weed would stop the numbing but like I WANT to be numb. I don't want my emotions around. They are pesky and uncontrollable and I don't know how to deal with myself without drugs. I mean I also am addicted to caffeine and at this point probably adderall too. Addicted to wasting my life being terrible at rocekt league and watching youtube videos to kill time until the day is over. 

I apologize for this rant. I expect no one to read this or care.

They're the classic work husband and wife, and it's so obvious that even HR doesn't discourage what would be otherwise inappropriate chatter.

While of course people wonder if there isn't more going on, everyone pretty much assumes it's just a matter of flirting. After all, no one has caught them doing anything, and they're both married. We know there's more going on, though. So let's speculate about just what kind of filth they get up to...

Below are a few ideas, and we can mix and match them, if you so desire. Of course, if you have your own, feel free to toss them out!

__________

**Hidden Honeymoon:** The jokes had gone on for years, and all that talk of their ""work marriage"" had sunk in. Real sexual tension started to bubble between them. They never acted on it, though...

Until they got sent to a conference together, that is. They had separate rooms, but they both knew this was going to be the honeymoon for their work marriage.

___________

**The Cubicle Cuckold:** If they were work husband and wife, then he was a work cuckold. Not because she fucked her real husband - though she did - but because she fucked every young intern douche that came into the company for a summer or a semester.

And, of course, she always told him all about it...while insisting that they couldn't do anything like that because she had too much respect for him as a coworker.

_____

**Teasing and Telecommuting:** They were always perfectly proper when they're in the office. When they both work from home, though...let's just say they'd fit right in on DPP. They're far more intimate with each other, baring their souls and sexuality, than they are with their respective partners.

Most importantly, they both know - and have seen visual proof - that the other spends those special days next to naked and edging all day long, wrapped up in the other's words and images.

So when he is told he needs to rush a set of contract documents from the office over to her house, he can't help but wonder what he's going to find...

*****
&gt; Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, is launching WikiTribune, &amp;quot;a global, multilingual, high quality, neutral news service&amp;quot; that is supported by pay-what-you-want subscriptions and has &amp;quot;No other agenda than this: the ultimate arbiter of the truth is the facts of reality.&amp;quot; The &amp;quot;Pilot&amp;quot; version launched today, and so far, it sucks.

&gt; These entries also link to what is described as &amp;quot;The full story from WikiTribune&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;WikiTribune&amp;#039;s latest report,&amp;quot; which are simply longer summaries of the news with more facts also attributed to mainstream outlets including NPR and the BBC. The Manafort article was written by intern Charles Michio Turner, &amp;quot;An American journalist who reports on labor, politics and development.&amp;quot; The Catalonia report was written by George Engels, &amp;quot;a staff journalist and producer at WikiTribune&amp;quot; who is from Argentina and lives in London.

&gt; &amp;quot;Very eager for ideas!&amp;quot; This is Wales&amp;#039;s theme today: WikiTribune is a work in progress.

&gt; Wales&amp;#039;s credibility as a media critic was already undermined in September by WikiTribune&amp;#039;s first &amp;quot;Taster&amp;quot; article, a story about the UN Global Goods convention in New York written by Lydia Morrish, a full-time WikiTribune reporter based in London.

&gt; Readers complained that it was &amp;quot;Confusing,&amp;quot; biased, erroneous, and &amp;quot;Light on contents.&amp;quot; The article was altered in response to comments and given a blanket correction: &amp;quot;This story has been edited by our Launch Editor to reflect some of the feedback below and to add clarity. Thank you.&amp;quot; But even that could not counter the deep-seated bias that some readers identified - the fact that WikiTribune had decided to highlight the efforts of celebrities and the United Nations.

&gt; There is one bias for which WikiTribune could theoretically correct, which is the pervasive prejudice present to some degree in every reporter&amp;#039;s heart: the desire for the biggest story, the most clicks, the fancy prize, the highest ratio of Facebook shares.

I have done one internship while studying and am 25 years old. My grades aren't the best, but I have done some interesting student projects in machine learning and data science.

I have applied for a about 4 jobs in Norway, mostly startups but haven't heard anything back. What puts me off is that I have been looking for jobs on the Norwegian version of indeed.com, most job descriptions on there are in Norwegian and only a few are in English. On the nav.no website pretty much all job descriptions are in Norwegian as far as I can tell.

I have been looking for jobs in Finland as well and the difference of looking for a job as an English speaker is really noticeable. Nearly all software developer jobs written out in Finland are kept in English, while very few are in Norway.

So I'm just wondering if speaking Norwegian is a prerequisite to get a programming job in Norway or if it's not so important in practice. I am also curious how the chances are of getting a job in Norway in programming in general."

I looked into transferring to another school for Information Systems as my university didn't offer any Computer Science degrees, when my adviser told me that the school is introducing a new program called Computer Informatics next fall. After looking into it, I think it's perfect for me, but I'm worried at the lack of definitive information on positions after college with that specific degree.

So my question is this, with a Computer Informatics degree, will it lower my job prospects upon graduating since it's a relatively new field? Or if I have an internship to have some experience on my resume will I be in just as good of shape?"

I had an internship in industry that began as a 3month offer and turned into a nearly 2year co-op while I continued my degree. I could've applied for a full-time job which would've almost been guaranteed, but I left that job for an internship in at a regional CPA firm where I will work upon graduation.


All in all, things have worked out well for me, but I feel that I've lost a lot of traction this last semester. Classes are taking more effort to understand and sometimes make almost no sense. There have been assignments where I have worked for literally multiple 8hr days (homework assignments, not even projects).


Maybe I'm just overwhelmed, but I feel lost. I feel a ton of uncertainty about my career. The stress from classes, and the fact that I would be the first white collar worker in my family (although not the first to finish college), leave me doing a lot of second guessing myself. Deep down, I know I can do this but the stress and doubt often leave me feeling depressed. 


I'm not at all suicidal, but I often wish I led a different life where I took the easy route because it feels that my family just wants me to have fun with them and can't relate to the work I'm doing. 


Has anyone struggled with these feelings? Is this normal stress related to life's pressures? I try to tell myself that my fears are irrational given my track record, but I can't seem to fight off that little voice in my head."

I'm living in Berlin and recently my building has been targeted for bulgary. Our doorbell has been marked, the backdoor's lock was broken with what looks like a Bohrmachine, and a thief was caught red-handed attempting a break-in (but unfortunately got away). Previously to this, we've had mail stolen from our Postbox, bums sleeping in the the stairway, and other unpleasent things.

Akelius, the company who owns the building, is proposing a 24/7 concierge service to tackle the issue, but has quoted us a price of 2,13€/m per month. Now, we live in a High Rise with 17 floors and 8 apartments per floor. If we take an average of 60m2 per apartment, this means each person will have an increase in rent of 130€ per month! So, the service costs in total 17,680€ per month (and 212,160€ per year).

My neighbors report the building used to have a concierge (but I don't believe it was 24/7), that was 35€ per apartment per month, totalling just 4,760€ per month.

All in all, this price seems very high and Akelius is notorious for being terrible* and I don't trust them. **So, my question is: for those of you with a building who has a conceirge service, what are their hours and how much per month are you paying for the service?**



*How is Akelius terrible?

I attempted to take over the lease when my roommate moved out, but they denied my application because my salary ""wasn't large enough to cover the rent comfortably for them"". They wanted the cost to be &lt;= to 40% of my salary, and I was at 40.15%. ಠ_ಠ Then, when they sent me the Nachmietvertrag, they had increased the rent per month by 75€ and not the 33€ they stated in the e-mails. When I called, they asked if I had the 33€ in writing, then called back to say ""it was the mistake of an intern."" ಠ_ಠ"
7g616a,80,2017-11-28,Four Years Under The Influence of The Red Pill,AlfredKinsey,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7g616a/four_years_under_the_influence_of_the_red_pill/,"White, 27 years old, 5'7"", 145 lbs. 

I will be 28 in a week and, while I no longer frequent this subreddit, it has massively shaped the trajectory of my mid-twenties, which are coming to a close. I thought it might be nice to reflect on my redpill journey. Hopefully, a lot of you can relate, no matter where you are with this material and the lifestyles that surround it.

I was raised by a single mom who (rightfully) left my rock star father. She dated an accountant with three children for most of my early childhood and they eventually married. I was raised in Christian household with strict, conservative, and rather nonintellectual parents.


I refused to date exclusively from ages 16-23. At 23, I moved in with a partner for the first time. The open, polyamorous nature of our relationship quickly deteriorated under this arrangement. The ""final straw"" came when I fucked a girl she had a crush on while she was away in Las Vegas. For the first time since my early adolescence, I let the will of a woman I liked dictate the nature of our relationship: the romanticized ideal of one man for one woman. We dated, as far as I knew, monogamously for about one year after that.


AWALT, she cheated on me with losers and assholes while I worked and saved a great deal of money for what I thought was a shared future.


I was brought to ""TRP"" around this time. I was 24 years old. At first, TRP posts popped up in my Google queries such as ""Is girlfriend fucking co-worker?"", ""Girlfriend nags constantly"", ""Girlfriend stopped fucking me"", etc. What I found was distressing and would usually send me into a tail spin. My general trust and admiration of women was being eroded, because these seemed like SUCH COMMON PROBLEMS. One thing that stood out to me about TRP, however, was how much of it is advice-driven. Many other forums had complainers and people in psychological pain, but TRP had mentors and beneficial distractions to offer.


It took me about two months of reading material in the manosphere to wise up and break up with her. We lived together still and she fought hard to prevent the break up. Eventually, an old friend of mine was in town from LA and I seduced her. I left the condom I used in the middle of the living room floor. Sure enough, my girlfriend at the time had no trouble breaking up when she came home to this. Long story short: I spent my first night alone in awhile blissfully happy with myself. Over the next couple weeks, I fucked the mistress several times and the ex a few times. I was also reading Sex God Method and studying on how to fuck women well (I'd previously been more concerned with eating pussy well, fingering techniques, etc.). Both women complimented me on how much I made them come and agreed to be regular partners when availability made it possible.


Women took a backseat in my life, I got more into day game because it was an exciting way to pass my lunch break. I focused on work and friends and found great joy in this change of focus. The time I spent on women revolved around sex or other stimulation that I could not get elsewhere. Over the next year, I received a promotion, several performance bonuses, and upped my coital partner count by about 80%, and I kept pulling more attractive women. I began to work out regularly for the first time in several months.


I can't believe it, but it's been almost four years since my first acquaintance with this community of men grappling with reality.


Here is a summary of my journey:


**Year 01:** Curious, skeptical, haven't read everything in the sidebar, but chug through a great deal of the books/blogs/etc. Experiment with the behavioral advice occasionally: mixed results, but lots of positive effects that make me question my perception of women and reality. Pretty bitter, but very focused on work. You might say I had a bit of a monk-mode/MGTOW mindset, but I just happened to pick up chicks and spin plates (3 at a time was a magic number, imo). Sex has become WAY less important/meaningful to me, but I see it as being better for me psychologically than masturbation or going without sexual release. I weigh 125 lbs, but begin working out regularly.


**Year 02:** Anger, obsession with why women aren't the way I want them to be. I continue being promiscuous. Individualism and achievement are my principle virtues. I probably overworked myself during this period, often dedicating 60+hrs/wk to a company that paid me about 20% under industry standard. Hygiene and sex life improve a great deal. I weigh about 130 lbs; many women tell me that I look like a model/porn star, where I used to just be ""cute"" or ""so skinny"". I become more selective and dominant with women. Some of my girlfriends do housework for me while I am away at the office. have grown comfortable telling lovers to leave in order to get time to myself or with friends. I mostly focus on fucking young women ages 17-20. In my early twenties, I preferred women aged 40 or older and enjoyed being dominated. I become very comfortable with my own personality and have embraced outcome independence.


**Year 03:** I spend most of my weekday free time on business ventures and friendships. I begin to better understand the virtue of selfishness: it's purpose and place in my life. Newfound amoral approach to business relationships and casual/sexual relationships leads to working more efficiently in my quest for money and sexual partners. I quickly grow weary of taking new women on ""proper dates"" and move to mostly just meeting up for sex and conversation at a place of my choosing. The same year, I leave my job to go back to college and pursue a more meaningful/lucrative career. I take my former boss on as a mentor and surround myself with other mentors for business and personal development. I study negotiation and business management a great deal. I become better at asking others for help and resources. I experiment with charging twice as much for many of the products and services that I sell. This experiment is successful and allows even better use of my time. I have become more aware and accepting of my own weaknesses, I embrace them fully and prefer to work with them than against them. Alpha game is no longer serious or stressful; it is now fun, useful, and comes more easily.


**Year 04:** Anger subsides, along with a great deal of anxieties. These anxieties, I discover, mostly revolved around control or social situations. While I maintain a frame of outcome independence, I begin to think more carefully about how I spend my time and with whom. I have far more close friends and more honest, beneficial relationships. Self-discipline and goal-setting guide my life, which is now very much my own. Having embraced my weaknesses, I become better at managing/improving them.  With a great deal more income AND free time, I start going to school full time, paid entirely out of pocket. I engage in research, volunteer work, and shadowing. I take side-jobs jobs that pay much less than what I'm used to making, but they take up very little time and help cover my expenses. I also find this work extremely satisfying and enriching. At this point, I maintain the flow of women that I desire. I have become much more comfortable with one night stands and easy flings. I rediscover personal spirituality and embrace my passions. I have been weightlifting routinely for just over two years and weigh 145 lbs; 144 was a lifetime goal that I'd always had trouble reaching. I did this on a vegetarian diet and a food budget of only about $150 a month. My upper arms have grown about an inch over the last year and I've been setting new PR's inside and outside of the gym. I also earned my first college-level 4.0 last semester!

**Year 05: The Future**
Next year, I'm hoping to participate more at my local makerspace that just started up a few months ago, be the principle investigator for my own research projects, land an internship in financial advising, do a two-month steroid cycle, and fuck my creative writing professor. I'm excited to be 34, writing a post entitled ""A Decade Under The Influence of The Red Pill.""

Newbies, take heart and find the gold in these threads. Sludge through the misogyny period if you must, but recognize that these forums have more nutritious food for thought.

OGs, give back to the community and maintain frame.

Previously I wanted to work in web development, but now I'm interested in AI and machine learning as well. I'm aiming to do an internship with a startup to gain exposure, learn a lot, and also figure out which area I am most passionate, but I'm feeling a little unsure:

1) Reading the internship requirements make me realize how little I know. I'm not confident that I can actually pull it off. It seems that what I know is so basic that I wouldn't be of any use as an intern. I am worried I'll turn up (if I do get accepted) and embarrass myself at the simplest tasks lol.

2) Should I attend a developer boot camp to get familiar with the latest technologies, tools, and best practices *before* interning? But one reason I want to intern before diving into a bootcamp is so I can be sure what I want to learn, i.e. web development or machine learning bootcamp.

I know tech is something that I'm passionate about - I'm just not sure which area within tech. I'd appreciate it a lot if someone can give me some advice (PMs are fine if you don't want to post publicly!)

Edit: in the meantime, I'm of course planning to continually learn new skills and technologies. I'm enrolled in Andrew Ng's ML coursera course, and probably buying some Udemy classes. The problem is: I'm not sure where I should channel my efforts - web dev, or AI?"

7g6fkb,21,2017-11-28,Feeling invisible at school and with a future career as a developer.,SmokyAnaconda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7g6fkb/feeling_invisible_at_school_and_with_a_future/,"I’m a junior in the last legs of my CS degree, studying at an predominantly white college. Looking around at silicon valley and the dev communities in the cities near me (NY, Boston, DC), I honestly don’t feel like I belong in this field. I’m a woman and Pacific Islander, I didn’t grow up with a Mozart-like childhood, and only started programming when I took my first CS class freshman year. I didn’t have a lot of encouragement or role models before I entered college, (my older sibling went to college for a year, got kicked out, and went back to study a liberal arts field). Despite a bumpy upbringing, I graduated in the top 5% of my high school, and now attend a school in the top 20 for CS. I do fine in my classes, so academically, I’m fine. 
 
I haven’t met a single Pacific Islander at my school other than my own sister, and women in the CS department are scarce too (something to the tune of &lt;15%). Because I’m Asian as well, I’m frequently lumped with the prodigy-Asian crowd, students who’ve been programming since they were 16 and are crazy connected. I can’t even apply to programs intended for racially underrepresented minorities since those are targeted towards Hispanic and Black students, and Pacific Islander folks are brushed over. Just talking with some of the other women in CS is pretty alienating for me, we don’t watch the same TV shows, read the same books, or have common experiences from our backgrounds. I don’t have anyone to look up to as a role model, save for maybe Melinda Gates and Sheryl Sandberg, but both those ladies are white. 

Just taking a scan across my classroom is disheartening, and I feel like me and my struggles are completely invisible. I feel capable as an engineer, but like I will never fully belong the way a white or Asian person will. I don’t think I can be happy just ignoring my background and cranking out code at a job when I graduate, yet acknowledging my race and ethnicity is incredibly difficult when there’s not a single person out there for me to look to. I’ve applied to a ton (70+) of internships, and gotten rejected from all, so that probably doesn’t help either. I’ve begun to think that CS just isn’t for me, and that I can still make a career out of non-tech roles. That’s really not what I want to do though, my dream is to work as a developer when I graduate. I just feel so swept aside and that there really isn’t a place I belong. What can I do to look forward instead of down? Is there a community out there that I can reach out to? Any other companies with jobs/internships that cater to minority students?

7g6k1s,13,2017-11-28,Matchbox Iridium,Goodbye-Blue-Monday,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7g6k1s/matchbox_iridium/,"My name is Bennett, but you can call me Will.

Open your computer and look me up on the map. Crack your fingers and type in SALEM COLORADO in big, black letters. It doesn’t matter how many Salem's there are. Once those bright letters enter your head your mind jumps to the interesting one, the historical one. 

Maybe you think about Puritans burning innocent women alive or torturing them to confess to using witchcraft. But that’s only a half-truth, 19 of them were hung at the gallows, except for Giles Corey who was crushed to death by boulders. The head of my school newspaper always told me to lay out the facts and proceed with caution. 

My name is Bennett, but you can call me Jeremy.  

I think it was a Tuesday when Salem’s radio station broadcasted there would be a blizzard in early September. It didn’t matter that the sun scorched us above a cloudless sky, 23 students wore winter coats to school that day, and they didn’t seem to mind. Then again, memory is such a fickle thing. 

I was tasked with writing an article for the school paper about the spreading of misinformation. The editor told me to lay out the facts and proceed with caution. I counted the 23 students and wrote their names down on a sheet of paper so I could back up my claim, but left them anonymous in the real article. When I was done I typed my name in big, black letters and submitted it to the head of the paper. I think I wrote Bennett but I can’t be certain.

The next morning I woke up with a horrible fever and barely got out of bed. My skin was burning at the touch and my sweat was gasoline. My mom had read an article somewhere that high schoolers were faking sick to skip class, so she took my temperature to prove it. I may have been burning hotter than any woman in Salem ever had, but the thermometer came out as a 96.5. 

By the time I got to school my hands felt a little cold so I put them in my pockets. The whole building was buzzing about the article I had written even though the paper didn’t come out until Friday. A guy named Thomas came up to me and freaked out about how he had worn a coat on a moderately sunny day. Now Thomas was a little like America before Puritans colonized it for themselves, that is—he had no reservations.

Thomas was also full of shit, because I had already counted all of the students who wore coats the day before, and he would have made it 24. 

He gave me a toothy grin. “It’s nice to see that at least someone can tell the difference between what’s real and fake anymore.” 

“Thanks man—hey, do you know where people are getting the papers from? They’re actually not supposed to be out yet.” I rubbed my hands together as the room seemed to grow colder, 

“Oh yeah,” Thomas snapped his fingers and pointed ambiguously to no apparent part of the hallway. “Right over there, don’t forget to take it easy, Will.” 

“My name is Bennett,” I said, anger rising in my throat. “You don’t have to stop fucking with me, I just need to know why. We both know you weren’t one of the 23 yesterday so just back off.” 

Thomas laughed with blank smile and spoke in a sing-song voice. “Hey man, that’s-a fine by me.” 

I stumbled down the hallway hearing fragmented conversations of people all claiming to have worn coats on Tuesday. My fever was replaced by a creeping chill in my stomach. I glanced at a forgotten newspaper lying facedown on the floor and grasped it with numb fingers. 

The front page was dated Thursday, September 26. An article by Jeremy Anderson claimed 42 students had come to school wearing winter clothes after hearing that there would be a blizzard. When I called my mom to come home because I felt cold, she told me I should’ve worn a coat. 

My name is Bennett, but you can call me Will. 

Before lunch people were talking about how Mr. Linderson had gone to a playground with a double-barrelled shotgun and held it hostage by threatening to shoot himself in front of the kiddies. When a police officer came to the scene, Mr. Linderson decided to decorate all their little backpacks with polka dots and brain matter. Everyone heard it from someone who heard it on the radio. By the time lunch was over, Linderson was taken away in handcuffs. 

You see memory can be a fickle thing. You never notice when something like it burns. Like most things in this world, it happens passively. One moment you’re occupying your time with random bullshit and before you know it, a vital part of you has fled to the unreachable chasms of your mind. But when it burns, it burns.  

I had written down the 23 names somewhere. I had written them in big, black letters on an orphaned sheet of paper. When I got home my mom was watching the local news station report that swimming star Sam Jakowitz had been awarded a student-athlete trophy. Two years ago Sam Jakowitz had practiced his diving technique off the tallest building in town and moved to Denver for medical services. 

23. Twenty Three. That was a fact. I had been taught certain things were non-negotiable. Things like a person’s name or the direction of gravity. Sometimes facts could be lost to the march of history or opinions of others but that couldn’t stop what is objectively true. It was as if one truth could still exist alongside an opposite truth for different people. If enough people had memories of something untrue, would its legitimacy be democratically cannibalized as well?

Maybe you think I was insane. So were the witches in Salem.
 
That night, I got out of bed and drove around in my underwear listening to the radio. I didn’t know what day it was and from what I could hear, neither did the announcers. My car didn’t slow down as it left the edges of town towards the dark mountain roads. “It’s gonna be a cold one.” They told me. It felt like a beautiful summer night. “We’re looking at another winter storm tonight.” A woman said cheerily. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.

Despite the world in front of me illuminated by my headlights, I had to resist what the voices said. When they told me that all roads exiting town were closed, I almost saw road workers in my peripherals. When they said a warrant was set for my arrest, blue and red lights danced behind me.   

I drove for three more hours before I ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere. I was inside my car, staring at the road ahead of me when they found me. They took me back to SALEM COLORADO in big, black letters where I was put directly in the hospital. Apparently, I was off my meds. I never had any. 

I stayed in the hospital for five days, even though there were Christmas lights when I got out. Five days can get awfully boring, so I was given a radio to keep myself entertained. For a while, all I could say was that my name was Bennett, but doctors eventually got to me. 

Every day a cheerful nurse would come in and greet me by a different name. Sometimes Garrett, sometimes Joey, but never Bennett. One day when it was snowing outside, Thomas came over to lift my spirits. 

He entered with a small piece of paper and dropped it on my lap without saying a word. The writing was sloppy and uneven, but it was unmistakably mine. On it contained the list of names I used for my article in the school paper. 

There were 42 names in total. 

It was that day that I was cured of my affliction. It didn’t matter what people called me. I had got so caught up in details that didn’t matter to me or anyone else. People love to spout on and on about the capital t truth, but in the real world, most of us are happier when that truth is what we make of it. Because as far as I can tell, this world seems real enough to me. 

My name is Bennett, but it doesn’t matter what my name is. 

One thing I’ve noticed about this subreddit is that people love what seems the most real. Stories that immerse the reader in a world they think they are unfamiliar with. View your memories on film reel and convince yourself that what you know is the real truth. And when one memory doesn’t agree with the rest, light a match and burn it at the stake. 

So go ahead, open your computer and look me up on the map. Try to disprove me, and don’t forget to cite your sources. 

When I got back to school there was little fanfare, since I was only gone for the weekend. It didn’t matter, the local radio station had offered me an internship, and it’s always good to get experience. 

After class, the editor of the paper came to me about how things in town have been going crazy. He said that no one has left town in months and that all communication outside of Salem had gone silent. When he looked in my eyes, he was speaking to Bennett. 

Lay out the facts. 

Maybe he was right, but so was everyone else, so where did that leave him? I just smiled and told him the same thing people around town always say in a sweet, sing-song voice. 

 “Hey man, that’s-a fine by me.”

I'm going to finish my CS in about 3 months. I've been studying game development for the entire time (C#), I also had some JavaSE and a project made in JavaEE/JSF. I've decided I want to move out to different country and this lead me to leave game development as it's way harder to live off it. Since I have some basic understanding and experience in web app development, I thought this would be a good path for now. So as I'm nearly done with my bsc CS degree, and only had short intern as game programmer with C++. I'm trying to find Java intern to get more proffesional experience before leaving the country, but having no experience kinda make it harder to find anything.
**TL;DR** So my question is, would I end up better picking up offer from company **A** (huge company) that offers programming intership in any language so I could possibly pick Java, and no field specified or company **B** (company counting few people) that uses .NET/ASP and might offer higher salary than company A. The salary is not important for me, all I want is experience so it would be easier to get Java webdev(or any Java) job when I move out."
7g6s9f,443,2017-11-28,FMIL and the time she pulled strings to assert her dominance...,beenursie,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7g6s9f/fmil_and_the_time_she_pulled_strings_to_assert/,"So when I last left off, FH had just returned home from his internship across the country. He hadn’t officially been diagnosed with anything yet, but everyone was leaning strongly towards cancer. See BB for the backstory up to this point. :)

So FH gets home, is suitably nervous, and we’re looking for next steps. We saw a doctor who recommended an ultrasound guided biopsy and a CT scan. Based on his ultrasound results, I had been trying to get FH scheduled at our local university hospital. There was a scheduling mishap and I wasn’t going to be able to get him in for a few weeks. MIL had by now decided that if she didn’t take control I would and I know that you can all guess how that went over. So she called in a favor through her brother and got in contact with a board member at a local hospital. FH was suddenly scheduled for his biopsy/CT scan the next day. I was totally fine with this – anything that gets us answers sooner. 

We went to this appointment as a trio – FMIL, myself, and FH. While FH was having his testing done, I was left alone in a waiting room with FMIL. We made small talk while I tried to focus on Candy Crush on the iPad I had bought FH while he was away. FMIL doesn’t like silence though, so I gained some insight as to why FH was an only child (there were complications when he was born and FMIL was afraid the same would happen with another baby). FMIL made a comment that the iPad that I had bought FH was a **very** generous gift and I told her that I thought he should have something to entertain himself while he was so far away. The rest of that day passed without incident.

Unfortunately, the results came back that FH had thyroid cancer and would need surgery. FMIL’s contact got us in for a next-day appointment again. Meanwhile, I had gotten FH scheduled with a specialist at the university hospital (UH). MIL was NOT pleased about this and made it well known to us. She was under the belief that if FH had his surgery at the hospital where she knew someone, FH would be treated like a “VIP” and get better care. Now as someone who is (now) a nurse… we don’t have VIPs. I treat all of my patients the same. I don’t care if you’re homeless and smelly or a billionaire. You’re a person, you have a medical problem, THAT is what I am focused on. MIL refuses to accept this. Even now she still believes that if you know someone at the hospital, you will get better care. She was completely against FH going to see the specialist at the university because of this. Now, I am also a person who believes in second opinions. So I had no problem going to see the doctor that the suburban hospital (SH). I just fully expected FH to also see the specialist. I don’t think that this ever clicked in FMIL’s head. She assumed that since she had decreed FH was having his surgery at SH that there was no need to have an appointment at UH. 

So we got to meet the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor at the SH. He informs us that FH has an extensive amount of disease and that they are concerned that they may have to break his sternum to get one of the masses out. They are also concerned because of some shadows that they see on the scans that the disease may be in FH’s spine. This is bad. This is very bad. I’m panicking internally because FH is 21 years old ya’ll. We’ve gotten very serious very fast, and I know that this is the man that I want to spend the rest of my life with. And he has cancer. Extensive cancer. Cancer that we don’t know where else it’s gone to yet. So ENT doc introduces us to the other doctor that he will have working with him on FH’s surgery. This doctor is also very nice, but he’s a general surgeon. Which means that he might be taking out a liver, and then cracking my FH’s chest. He’s a nice guy, but by this point I am firmly, firmly convinced that FH needs to go to UH for this surgery. I want him seeing top of their field specialists, not a general surgeon. We leave this appointment, and we had made the mistake of driving with FMIL. So we’re on the way home, FMIL is driving, and FH is in the passenger seat. I’m in the back.

FMIL asks what we thought of the doctors. I say that they’re very nice, but I’m concerned about the potential spinal involvement. I mention that I’m glad that we have the meeting with the specialist at the UH that week. FMIL says that she doesn’t understand why we’re even going there, obviously these doctors are fantastic. FH breaks in and says that he understands that she likes them, but that we both think that it’s a good idea to meet with a specialist and get a second opinion. 

FMIL: Well I’m not going to that appointment because I’ve already taken too much time off of work for this. I think that maybe you need to listen to people who are going to be around in the next ten years.

Me: (internally) DID THIS BITCH JUST REALLY SAY THAT.

FH: Stunned Silence

FMIL: By the way FH, did I tell you what your grandmother said the other day?

FH: No…

FMIL: She said that maybe you need to stop thinking with your dick and start thinking with your head.

Me: FUMING on the backseat

FH: Stunned Silence

She proceeded to take us to a flea market for “lunch”. I was out of the car before she was even fully parked. I didn’t even wait for FH. He found me inside and had this panicked look on his face. I told him that there was NO way that I was going to put up with that bullshit and that he shouldn’t either. He agreed, but admitted that he had no idea how to handle her. I told him that at this point we just weren’t speaking to her. We spent the next forty minutes avoiding her until she was ready to leave. It was at about this point that I realized that I needed to gear up, because this woman was going to put us through absolute hell. I realized that FH had no spine because of years of conditioning. It was a very awkward position to be in because I wasn’t quite established enough to be making his medical decisions, but at the same time, we knew that we were going to see this through to the end.

I totally screwed up. Well, we screwed up. My girl and I.

Long story short - $13,000 in credit debt spanned across 10 cards with super high APRs.

Right now I don’t have a job but receive u employment and she’s doing an unpaid internship and will end up working in around 3 months from now,

My parents are helping me scrape by,

Let me make this clear : I know my first priority is to pay this down. Unfortunately that’s just not possible. I’m barely making minimum payments and it’s just covering interest,

My goal is DAMAGE CONTROL.  I got a few offers for a personal loan from pre screened offers in the mail. Some promise like 10% apr, up to $15k.... blah blah.

You guys have experience. What’s the best way to approach paying these down? Ranges from $500 limit to $6000 limit

I mainly code WordPress themes at my work desktop, but just recently I started using a laptop to develop on the go. I develop in Sublime 3 and I use prepros to compile sass and also upload to a sandbox server I've got. I share files between the two computers using dropbox. So anytime I make a change on one computer it is saved in dropbox so they have the same versions of everything.

I've noticed a weird overwriting issue happening every now and then, and can't actually figure out why/how it's happening - So I'm looking for a better way to code seamlessly without any hiccups. The company I work for is also talking about hiring a developer intern, so I'd need to be able to add people to projects easily if possible.

I know if I got rid of prepros, it'd take away one less step in the saving process - and maybe stop the weird overwriting error from happening? But I really don't want to, I love it a lot. I just don't know if it plays well with others.

Looking for any and all suggestions here!"
7g7k1u,89,2017-11-28,I used to work in Congress. Here are the best ways to get Congress to save net neutrality.,Mazrodak,esist,https://www.reddit.com/r/esist/comments/7g7k1u/i_used_to_work_in_congress_here_are_the_best_ways/,"I’m not sure if this goes here, but I’m not sure where else to put it. If it doesn’t belong here, I sincerely apologize. I used to work in a Congressional Office and I’ve noticed a lot of inaccurate information circulating about how to effectively get Congress to save net neutrality. I wanted to clear that up This is too important an issue and we have too little time to get this wrong. 


When I worked in Congress, I was an intern. Most of my job was answering phone calls and recording constituent concerns, so I have a pretty intimate knowledge of how the system of contacting your congressperson works. I can’t tell you who I worked for or share any specifics of my job because I signed away those rights as a condition to work there. I worked on the House side of things, so I also can’t confirm as much about how the Senate works, and while I’m confident that most House offices worked in similar ways, I also can’t confirm that they all work exactly the same way. What I can do is share some general information about how the process of contacting your representatives works, and the most effective things you can do to make sure your voice is heard and your message is received. I can also confirm that your congress person *DOES* actually listen to what you have to say, and that contacting them about any issue is never a waste of time. 


First of all, don’t both contacting the FCC. The FCC is not a publicly accountable body, and they don’t care and have no reason to care about what you think. However, the FCC *is* a *Congressionally* accountable body, and that’s why we should focus our efforts on getting Congress to reign them in. This is the governmental equivalent of requesting to speak with a manager.


Second, please be polite to the people you talk to. Most of them are unpaid interns who have little to no ability to actually influence policy, and screaming at them only ruins their day. You make think it’s important to make it clear that you’re very upset about the issue. It isn’t. Whether you angrily chew someone out or politely voice your concerns, the end result is exactly the same.


That leads to my next point, what actually happens when you call in about an issue? Well here’s the answer: the person on the other end of the phone writes down that you are pro-net neutrality, and increases the tally as to how many people have called in with that position that day. That your information is then put into a computer system to make sure you get a reply, and at the end of the day the number of people who called in with a specific stance on any particular issue is compiled and delivered to the congress person. What’s important here is that the congress person doesn’t typically receive your reasoning as to why you’re pro-net neutrality, or even your name. They’re far too busy to individually look over all of that information personally. Instead they just receive the number of people who care about the issue, meaning that if you call in and lecture for ten minutes about the positive contributions of net neutrality, it has *exactly* the same effect as if you call in and say “I’m concerned about net neutrality and want the representative/senator to stop the FCC from abolishing it.” Keep it short, keep it simple. If you ramble, it just increases the odds that the person on the other end of the phone may get confused and write you down as caring about the wrong issue.


That also leads me to my next point: don’t bother calling in every day. I see a lot of people advocating for this. Don’t bother. While calling in every day does show your congress person that you really care about this issue, you’re still only one person, and one voter who really cares about an issue is still less influential than two voters who care about an issue. Tangling up phone lines by calling in daily only risks preventing a voter with a busy schedule who can only afford to call in once about net neutrality from missing the opportunity to voice their opinion because other people who’ve already called in are taking up all the lines. That just hurts the cause. The main concern of your congressperson is pleasing as many voters as they possibly can, so what we really need here is quantity of concern, not quality. If you want to make it clear that you care strongly about the issue, call in every few days or once a week with a short follow up message like “Hi, it’s &lt;name&gt; again and I just wanted to follow up on my previous call and express how much preserving net neutrality means to me. I really want the representative/senator to stop the FCC from abolishing it right away.” That’s all you have to say, and it has exactly the same effect as calling in every day. If you called in twice, it’s clearly important enough to you that you’ll vote on it in November.


Fifth, make sure you express that you want action on net neutrality immediately. Right now, Congress is working on tax reform, an issue they think a lot of people care about. If it isn’t made clear that people care more about immediate action on net neutrality than they do about tax reform, Congress will table net neutrality until they’ve finished their current project, and by then it will be far too late to prevent the FCC from acting.


Sixth, give as much as information as you’re asked for. You will almost certainly be asked for your address, and it is *INCREDIBLY* important to give that information, especially if you’re calling your representative rather than your senator. Your address is used to confirm that you do in fact live in the district of the congressperson you’re calling. Congressional offices aren’t allowed to address the concerns of people who live outside their assigned districts, even if those concerns are about important national issues. If you don’t give an address, your concerns will just be thrown out, as there will be no way to send them to the right place.


That leads me to my next point: don’t bother calling anyone you can’t vote for. Battleforthenet does this, and frankly, it pisses me off because it’s a waste of everyone’s time. It tried to put me in touch with two representatives whose districts I don’t live in, and Mitch McConnell. There is no point in me talking with any of those people, and here’s why: if you express your concerns to a congressperson who you can’t vote for, they just forward those concerns to someone you can vote for. If you’ve already contacted those people, there’s no point in that information being sent along, and since your information is just going to get sent along, no point in contacting the person who will be sending it along. While it may *seem* like a good idea to contact someone powerful like Mitch McConnell, unless you live in Kentucky, he’s just going to ignore your concerns and send them along to your senators who you’ve presumably already talked to. You can skip those calls. They change nothing.


Finally, don’t send an email. If you can’t call a congressional office, send a physical letter or a fax. Emails can come from anyone, anywhere, and that means they might not be from the district or state the congressperson is representing. Physical and faxes on the other hand can be far more easily traced back to their point of origin, and that means they are infinitely more likely to be taken seriously.


That’s everything I have to say. If I think of anything else, I’ll edit this post, but the most important note I can end this on is to keep up the effort of contacting Congress. If enough of us do so, they will act, and they are our last and at this point only hope of preserving net neutrality. If you haven’t done so yet, please do. It’s incredibly important for your voice to be heard.

EDIT: Adjusted formatting to hopefully make this easier to read."

I get interviews and often make it passed the first/second rounds but there are just way more people with civil engineering degrees than there are jobs so the competition is just very stiff.

It is close enough that I can get interviews but not close enough that I can easily schedule informational interviews and become a regular at meetup events to the point where I can make some friends who can really vouch for my skills and experiences and take advantage of networking. 



I tried applying to positions all over the US, technician/engineering tech positions, data entry, branching out beyond civil engineering, mock interviews, etc. The only thing I haven’t tried is moving to a new city.

His girlfriend's brother took a year to find a job in Chemical Engineering. I have enough money saved up for 3 months worth of living expenses, including rent. I know I will be able to find some survival job within 4 months. Meanwhile I can schedule informational interviews, apply to engineering positions, and start building lifelong friends in the area.  


On the other hand, I have never had an interview in the San Diego area. They have all been in LA, and Orange County, with a couple in riverside. Even the one internship I have was in the OC.

This is my first post here.

I don't know what, but something in my life just doesn't feel right... I keep feeling like stuff are starting to figure themselves out, and then after a long week or some days I just sit down at home and again become really depressed and sad and just feel like everything's worthless again...
I recently started a new job in my field of studying, which is a great internship for me, I have a great relationship and a steady income... feels like stuff begin to move forward and all, and again it just hits me after a while.

I feel like I deserve a real win sometime soon.... for the last couple of years (as in 2) I have been mostly working non-stop at a tough job (prior to this new one)  and been busting my ass doing a lot of stuff including starting school last year... and it just feels like I'm mentally and physically exhausted and idk how to approach this.

I think I just need a good vacation, but I just can't get up and fly somewhere just like that, I have responsibilities, I have my dog to take care off, school, work... 

At the end of a long day\week I just honestly still don't know where my life are headed, or even towards what... and I don't understand what's any of this pressure is good for... studying, working nearly full time in order to afford continuing to study and living at my apartment?
Do we just have to live like that and eventually burnout, or are there other alternatives to living in order to feel happier or at least less meaningless?

Do any of you guys know of any way to somehow make yourself feel... better? As in some sort of maybe idk a change in lifestyle to help you with that, or somewhere that could provide me with that?

I'm just sick of feeling so depressed over nothing all the time when in reality I think I should feel fine...

tl;dr feeling depressed\meaningless all of the time, even when stuff ARE working out... "

So here comes my quandary: How do I prepare myself to get a career in robotics as a 19 year old?

So far I have moved on from the Arduino phase and am now working with 8051, PIC and Atmel chips in both Assembly (in 8051 and PIC) and embedded C (in PIC and Atmel). 

In terms of electronics I am still a novice but I am learning every day by designing my own schematics to etch on pcb's and reverse-engineering some of the boards I have come in contact with.

Mechanical aspect, I am very weak at but aim to learn forward and reverse kinematics in January. Any other recommendations?

Software is my strongest suit, with experience in Java C Python. Next up is integrating OpenCV in my projects.

With all this in mind, how would you recommend I progress in my pursuit of this career? I'm not lacking projects to build but I can't help but feel like (even though portfolio is important) it won't help me get a job at somewhere so cutting edge like BD. Obviously I am not going to work at BD, as I am a European citizen so I was thinking more companies like ABB.

Questions:

Can anyone recommend me any companies in the EU with focus on automation, biomechatronics(? like what BD are doing)?. Is it naiive of me to think that if I don't get into any of the universities I can go straight into internships and build my career without a degree? Other than forward and inverse kinematics what should I learn in the mechanics side of robotics? Or any other aspects that you feel like I am lacking? How would I even apply to an internship without being automatically rejected due to my lack of actual experience in the field apart from personal projects?

My parents haven't been together ever since I can remember so that has never really been an issue. In fact looking back, I'm glad I was only raised by my mother because unlike my father, she provides an calming effect on me while my father does quite the opposite. Although we use to live within 10 minutes from each other, we would only see each other every few months. Most of our relationship has been built over phone calls. My most prominent memories of my father are his criticisms towards my physical appearance. Growing up, I was notorious for not brushing my teeth at night so my father would make it a point to tell me that if I didn't do it, my teeth would rot off and I would never find a boy to love me if I didn't have teeth. I was only 9. He would also constantly bring up my weight and basically came to the same conclusion as he did with my teeth. To this day, he still tries to keep tabs of my weight and teeth and every time, reminds me of my 9 year old self that would cry into her pillow because no boy would ever love her.



Another lovely quality my father possess is his ""fly off the handle"" temper. There were 2 occasions that really showed me my fathers ugly side. The first time was when I was about 12. My father and mother had gotten into an argument over something and I sided with my mother. My father ended the conversation by screaming that we were both pieces of shit and he wanted nothing to do with us. About two weeks later, everything was back to normal and he never apologized. The second time was when I was 14. It was during one of those rare times where he was actually at my mothers house with me and my mother. Earlier that day, I had just had my first breakup and heartbreak so I really was in no mood to interact with anyone. I can't remember exactly what I screamed to my Dad but it was something along the lines of me not wanting him to be there. Next thing I know, he takes off his belt and starts forcibly beating me with it while screaming to me that I have to show him respect. That was the only time that my father ever beat me and although I know that is nothing compared to what others have experienced, it clearly had an impact on me.



Fast forward to present day and things have changed a bit. June of last year, my father decided to move back to his home country because he lost his job here in the US and could no longer afford to live here without. So he moved with his wife and mother (my grandma). Not long after he arrived in the country, he discloses to me that he had gotten into a huge argument with my grandma and my aunt (his sister) and that he was no longer speaking to them ever again. I tried to get him tell me what exactly happened but he would always brush the question off. The only thing he has ever really told me about it is that his mother and sister just use him and when they don't need him anymore, they throw him away like a dirty towel. I have never really gotten this impression from either my grandmother or aunt and I always encouraged my dad to make amends because at the end of the day, whatever they argued about is not worth it. But of course he's even more stubborn than I am and refuses even the possibility of doing that.



About 2 months ago, he called me but I really wasn't in the mood to talk. However, I could hear in his voice that something was wrong so I decided to call him back. He then proceeds to tell me how he has been living with depression for 20 years (it runs on his side so this wasn't that shocking) and it was getting worse living there because he didn't have access to his anti-depressants. I listened to his cries, how he regretted not being there for me, and the suicidal thoughts he has had. I tried my best to keep my composure and just listen to what he had to say but as soon as we hung up, I reverted back to my 9 year old habits and ugly cried into my pillow. He begged me not to tell anyone, especially not my mother, so I've been keeping this heavy burden to myself. A few days after, he apologizes for what happened and in that same conversation, he tells me he is going to deposit $700 in my bank account (I didn't ask, he offered). Since then, I always worry that if I don't answer his calls or respond to his texts that something might have happened to him and the anxiety of that has yet to go away.



The main reason I'm posting this is because of what happened on Sunday. Now if you haven't figured it out by yet, my dad is an intense person. Recently, it has become suffocating. Since he hasn't found a new job in his home country, he has had a lot of free time, something that I, as a working, full time college student with an internship, don't have. He constantly bombards me with calls and texts. On Saturday, he called me 8 times in 4 minutes and 10 times in total that day. As I looked through my call log, I realized that he had called me 24 times in the past 10 days. When I return his calls on Sunday, I was pretty peeved and I wanted to let him know that I didn't want to talk to him that often. I told him that calling me 8 times in 4 minutes without there being an emergency is excessive and he claimed that he was doing it as a joke because he knew that I was hanging up everytime he tried calling. And I told him okay but not even including that, he still calls me at least once, usually twice a day and thats just not something I want to do. I'm not really someone that enjoys speaking to anyone over the phone. He then sarcastically responds by saying ""I get it, don't worry about it. All people your age ever want is to use their parents and then throw them out when you don't need them anymore."" I, of course, denied this and our conversation ended with him sarcastically saying ""you call me when you want to talk"". I tried calling him yesterday and today but I figured out that he blocked my number on WhatsApp. So now I'm left worried and angry that he would pull such a childish stunt and block me for not wanting to talk to him so often.



I love my dad and he has a lot of great qualities but being completely honest, I have never felt that we have had a daughter-father relationship. Talking to him has never felt enjoyable or easy going; it has always felts like a chore that I never want to do. My mom, on the other hand, is one of my best friends and I feel completely comfortable with her which is why I know how a healthy parent-child relationship should feel like. Am I wrong for not wanting to speak to him so often? I also have his email address, should I try to contact him through there and let him know my thoughts? I'm not really sure what to do.



tldr: My dad has shown some signs of abuse(?) in the past. He has a history of excessively calling and recently blocked contact with me because I told him that I didn't want to talk to him as often as he wants to talk to me. Am I in the wrong? Should I try contacting him via email?"

7g8u5k,2,2017-11-28,32 M4F - The Work Wife,DPPHentaiPlots,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7g8u5k/32_m4f_the_work_wife/,"Everyone in the office teases them because they're always together, always giggling, and all around far more comfortable with each other than ordinary coworkers. They're the classic work husband and wife, and it's so obvious that even HR doesn't discourage what would be otherwise inappropriate chatter.
While of course people wonder if there isn't more going on, everyone pretty much assumes it's just a matter of flirting. After all, no one has caught them doing anything, and they're both married. We know there's more going on, though. So let's speculate about just what kind of filth they get up to...

Below are a few ideas, and we can mix and match them, if you so desire. Of course, if you have your own, feel free to toss them out!

_______

**Hidden Honeymoon:** The jokes had gone on for years, and all that talk of their ""work marriage"" had sunk in. Real sexual tension started to bubble between them. They never acted on it, though...

Until they got sent to a conference together, that is. They had separate rooms, but they both knew this was going to be the honeymoon for their work marriage.

_______

**The Cubicle Cuckold:** If they were work husband and wife, then he was a work cuckold. Not because she fucked her real husband - though she did - but because she fucked every young intern douche that came into the company for a summer or a semester.

And, of course, she always told him all about it...while insisting that they couldn't do anything like that because she had too much respect for him as a coworker.

_______

**Teasing and Telecommuting:** They were always perfectly proper when they're in the office. When they both work from home, though...let's just say they'd fit right in on DPP. They're far more intimate with each other, baring their souls and sexuality, than they are with their respective partners.

Most importantly, they both know - and have seen visual proof - that the other spends those special days next to naked and edging all day long, wrapped up in the other's words and images.
So when he is told he needs to rush a set of contract documents from the office over to her house, he can't help but wonder what he's going to find...

New programmer here :)

I've started my internship at a biomedical Engineering unit, and right off the bat I've been assigned a huge project with about 5 people. In this time I've been asked to learn about the heart, ECGs, and pacemakers.

So the project is a patient simulator of sorts; pacemakers are hooked up to a raspberry Pi containing the code, and that will then be hooked up to an ECG. My job is to use my raspberry Pi to e able to change the frequency and amplitude of the signal that is sent via the pacemaker. We already have an audio signal, we just need to put it into code.

Any ideas, code, or references that may help?

I stood beside you with it all. I did everything I could to provide for you, and love you, to make sure you knew you were loved and cared for. I failed you this latest semester. I was stretched too thin. I was too occupied with my own school, my internship, my own problems.

I supported you for two and a half years, never flinching under the weight of your baggage. No matter your problem, your ex, your coworker, your brother, your friends, I was there for you. And the day finally came where you could be there to help me, to support me in my time of need, and I told you everything. I opened up, and I told you everything that I was struggling with, and you betrayed me. You set out that very night, and slept with my closest friend in a hundred miles. You destroyed me. You used me. You abandoned me. You betrayed me.

I don't know where to go from here, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm struggling to keep my head above water with school, but I simply can't focus. I can't get you off my mind.

Need to stop the limbo.,busywithresearch,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7g9c55/21f_how_do_i_get_some_affection_action_from_my_bf/,"Hello guys, it's my first time posting here. I would be ever so grateful for your opinions on the case. I'm writing here possibly for the same reason everybody else is - my friends don't know what to do, can't afford a therapist (even online) and of course, I have no heckin idea how to react myself.

To outline things shortly - me and my bf have been dating for 6 months now oficially. I'm an immigrant, studying and now finishing my bachelors here, he's a local (in case maybe it's a culture clash idk). I'm the first ""real"", stable relationship he's had. We're both fairly attractive people, so his past, like mine, had been filled with hook-ups. He's a busy individual with communication issues (won't answer texts for long etc). He's really comitted in words, but lacking majorily in actions. He is meant to visit my family for holidays and stay for NY's eve, and here's where the problem really shows. As for now, my family and friends are both understandably on my back, asking ""what, where, and how""s and he still needs to buy the damn tickets. There have been recent happenings that pressured me to tell him (again) that I need more engagement - will go into details. Despite this, it's been two days since he last answered my texts.

I met J in the summer and we clicked straight away, on almost every field. Intelectually, musically, physically, ideologically, sexually - a perfect match. Considering we're pretty particular in those areas, it almost felt surreal. I guess some of you know the feeling, makes you almost question reality. Our first date lasted for two or three days, just to give an idea. 
We both had things planned, so I went on to interrail for a week, came back, we met, then we both left for two weeks (he went to USA, I went to South Africa; promise this is important to the story), then came back and properly kicked things off.
From the very beginning though, even in the honeymoon phase, I would point out how his lack of communication bothered me. He would answer my texts after 3 days, or a week when we were apart. When we began steadily dating in August, this started getting on my nerves. I would see him from Friday to Sunday, but have maybe a text during the week, if I was lucky. I finally decided that was bullshit after he cancelled 3 meetings and then showed up 2 hours late to a party (""I had to wait for my friends"") having me annoy my friends with constantly checking my phone. We went outside and I clearly said I can't be comitted if things proceed that way. The thing about J is that he doesn't really realize things like that because he was not exposed to them before. That scared him and he made his intentions really clear, later that night asking me to become his girlfriend oficially. Overjoyed and hopeful, I accepted.


Things were really cool for a while, he improved texting, I met his friends and so on. One of them happened to live in a building next to mine, so we decided to hit the gym together sometime. In the meantime, J started his job and became sluggish with texting once again. The gym plan failed due to timing, but me and his friend met up for a coffee and discussed politics. I told J straight away, to avoid jealousy and misscommunication. He became a bit jealous, telling me that ""he really cares for me and wants to keep seeing me""; ""i'm a very special person to him""; ""but he understands if i can't stand the communication thing and although he's trying, I might think i deserve better"". I reassured him that I just wanted to be friendly and laughed it off.
Meantime, we become more and more committed, spend a lot of time together, Friday-Sunday, Wednesdays. He's gettng better with texting but still fails sometimes. He meets my family, as they came to visit. We have trouble planning the day as he's asleep and won't answer texts. My family becomes annoyed, I feel helpless, again. Finally he texts back and we meet up. Fam loves him, he loves the fam. All good in the hood.


Time passes, met all of his friends (no coffee dates anymore obviously). I tell him about men coming after me when they do. Whenever a booty call from the past contacts me, I explain how things have changed now. Another texting breakdown, write him a fucking essay about how I hate being in a limbo and if he doesn't contact me, I'm losing faith. He promises to improve, improves. Texting on the daily, finally normal shit. Good times, he wants to come to my country for the holidays, comes up with the idea himself. Fam's happy about it. I'm happy about it. Trouble ensues.
I know he's busy, so when my family started asking, I checked all the travelling options. Presented him with possible dates and ticket prices. Didn't buy the ticket then.
We met, I asked him in person since family and friends need to plan stuff. Turns out he had not informed his family yet, but wants to come badly. OG plan was for him to spend Christmas. Haven't met his family yet, time's closing on us with plane prices, didn't want to make an awful first impression, so suggested he comes after. He texts his family.
I check the ticket prices with updated dates. He doesn't buy the ticket still.

My family is getting crazy about whether I'm coming at this point. I text him (daily, normal now), no answer. I finally book my own tickets and present him with options on how we can make this work for us to go back together, alternatively, how he can get home alone for a cheaper price. All he needs to do is literally click ""book now"" on one of the links. Guess what, he doesn't. I'm questioning what the fuck. Meanwile, I'm trying to get him tickets for a concert of his favourite band as a Christmas gift. Tickets 40 e each.
This Saturday, he comes over. Typical stuff, much love - when we're together, things are heavenly, he just sucks in the organization aspect. Showing me photos of his baby nephew on his phone.
 Notice a Whatsapp chat ending with ""Can I crash at your place?"" Ohshit. 

Turns out it's a girl he met and kissed back in the US. They met the next day, but didn't have sex. It was a kiss in a club and then ""hey here's central park"" kind of a thing.  However, they chatted a bit afterwards. She came here for a project and wrote him after months, he didn't want to see her, so didn't reply.  

""Well why won't you just tell her you have a girlfriend?"" 

""That seems harsh. She can just draw her own conclusions if I don't write back, right?""

This hits me hard though. I start crying. Back then I used to hook up with others as well, so that didn't hurt. He didn't tell me and that hit like a truck, though. We go out to eat. 

I cry all over chinese mushrooms and tempura shrimp. 

""I do love you, how can I make you stop crying? I didn't even answer that girl and we've only kissed""
I explain over and over again - it's about that I'm putting a lot of effort and this shows me he's not.
 
""You're coming over for Christmas, we're comitted and official, but you haven't booked the ticket, you have improved with texting but still, and when you get that kind of messages I have to find out by an accident""

""Maybe I would have told you afterwards"" 

""But you didn't before and you had the time. I tell you about the smallest detail because you want to know. I do, too.""

We go back to his. Same discussion. He still had not bought the tickets. 

Says ""I can see you're adjusting a lot for me. I understand I should do the same. I will put much more work into making you feel cared for from now on. You're my first serious gf so I still think like I'm single at times""

""I understand this is a new setting for you, but I feel pretty alone in this. If you keep on thinking like you're a single guy, you'll become a single guy eventually"". 

Okido then. Meanwhile I buy the concert tickets from a guy in a fb group. I'm reconsidering to leave during the night as I have a lot of work to do which I had to put aside to see him, but I decide to stay. He leaves for work in the morning with a ""thank you for staying over. I will book the tickets when I'm home"".
Leaving his place, I make  the sheets and put a small glass penguin  I got him from South Africa (when he was in the US) on a pillow. I surround it with bracelets I once found at his place - I asked him about them straight away, turned out they belonged to his sister. That was back at the time of the coffee ""date"" with his friend and we both laughed at our jealousy. 
I mean, if that's not a clear message of ""I care a lot and I am jealous, so I need you to show me I don't have to be"", idk what is. 
He texts me during the day, we chat. Comes back home, thanks for the penguin reminder (""how sweet""). I text back, no response. 
Meanwhile, turns out I've been scammed for 80 e for the concert tickets. Text him about it, no response - even in a financial situation like this! I get he's busy, but...

This is obviously not the only thing in my life right now. I'm a hons student in neuropsychology, leading two researches at the same time right now, one of which might get published (big thing). I also do some modelling on the side from time to time, planning on another internship and ofc, need to pass my exams and apply for masters. This is a LOT of work and stress and while I try to make sure he relaxes on the weekends by being with me, I get no such ""safety cushion"" from him. 
I really hate this limbo state and despise that it affects people around me, like my family and friends. I can't sleep because of the amount of work and stress this all requires. I can't plan my own holidays. Members of my research groups are stressing and as a leader I have to make sure all is good when I'm drained myself. I know sometimes he doesn't get things (like when he showed me the movie ""Export/Import"" and then got surprised by the fact that I, a Eastern-European woman, am unhappy with stereotypes about Eastern-European women), but this is a pretty clear setting. I respect his independence and try to make things easy for him, but I need to think about myself and my work. I love him and if he loves me, I want to encourage him to show it on his own accord. 

Could you please help me to end this situation? I feel powerless and don't know what to do. Should be testing my skin conductance machines right now or thinking of makeup for the photoshoots, but instead I'm here hoping a kind-hearted soul reads my life story :).
Thank you so much for your help... All I need is for him to show me some motivation, even the tiniest things matter.
Have a good day everybody :)

This is my third year but I switched into CS last year so I am currently in my third semester as a CS major. I've only recently realized the matter of trying to get a SWE internship this summer and how important experience like that could look on a resume for my future career. From what I can gather as of now when trying to develop a resume is that I'm not sure if I have remotely enough to even warrant trying for an internship. I have one decent project that I'm almost done with as part of a class and a good gpa but I'm not sure if that's enough. I'm also really only comfortable using Java. Not really sure what I'm going for with this post mostly just looking for direction on where to proceed. Should I focus on developing my skills by learning a new language or work on a project in Java. There's also the matter of learning about the types of technical questions friends have been asked in interviews and most of those seem very hard and I could also just focus on studying for those. At the same time as doing this I could shoot my shot and try and apply for summer internships but I don't think I would have much success. My immediate concern here is how much time I have left until most companies have completed their hiring and my odds are even lower. Sorry for the long post mostly just pouring my thoughts out to get some advice.

New grad of the university with one of the best computer science program, had internships in other tech giant firms, also with research experience in some state-of-the-art Computer Science labs. 

Job role:
General Software Engineer in a multi-billion tech firm, will be working in a new team and build new products. 

Current negotiation status:
Just got a call from the recruiter this afternoon and was given the offer details. I told her that after careful consideration I decided not to disclose my return offer and my other offers details to her and she told to to get back to her after I have the expected numbers in mind. She keep reappearing that she can’t shot blindly and I feel like there’s definitely room for improvement based on her tone and the way she poses questions. 

I am seeking for strategic advice on how to negotiate with the recruiter interns of base, RSU, sign on bonus, and relocation. 

I have a few specific questions:

1. How do I make persuasive and valid arguments to boost my current offer without sending her my current offers? Say my best offer on hand is 110K from other party, and she is willing to go 130k but she may only give me 120k if she knows my other offer of 110K.

2. How do I come up with the first numbers if I wanna maximize the utility? Meaning max out their budget.

I only ask this because I have heard in order to become a full time data scientist a PhD is very useful and research is a good way to get into a PhD program, whereas an internship is not. I would like to know, that with this considered, would the internship still be more beneficial to become a data scientist than research?

My husband is old money--we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife--I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I *do* it. 


But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're eighteen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to *be* you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes--and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more! 

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me. 


You had been moody lately, I knew that--your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were *so* angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own. 


Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to *me* instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was *weird* when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started *fucking* me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and--well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress. 

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was *you*, my *son*, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified--I couldn't understand why you would want to *do* this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out? 


But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father--you think I deserve you. 

-----

SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside. 



I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too! 


I also want people who write at least one to two paragraphs per post, and I’m looking for an emotional roleplay! If your dom isn’t romantic, I won’t be as into it. 


Also, I’m not advertising for underage partners in this prompt! My son would be 18"

7gbm31,6,2017-11-29,"Today, I have accepted the fact I want to commit suicide, and one day likely will.",LBP2398,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7gbm31/today_i_have_accepted_the_fact_i_want_to_commit/,"This will be long. I don't know if many of you will read through this, I would like to hope some people will. 

Ever since I was in sixth grade, I have been somebody who is mentally off. I would ponder about religion, about how I couldn't understand where the ""god"" I was told to believe in came from, about how I didn't believe that ""god"" existed, about how I yearned to know what would happen to people after death. 

In seventh grade, my life gained some stability. I had one steady friend I would socialize with at school. For whatever reason, to other kids I felt like I was an odd one out, and was often treated as such. However, this was one of the few instances in my life where I can recall a stable household life. The one kid I found friendship with at the time received a multi-month suspension from school. I underwent a deep depression, likely because I had no friends. I felt alone. Everyday before school, I would beg to be homeschooled, kick and cry like a toddler, and think about how my deepest desire was my death. Eventually this passed, however the overall depressed feeling didn't. 

In eighth grade, I had an alright year. I feel like eighth grade is when I had my final period where I was truly blissfully happy at times despite my depression. In April of my eighth grade year, my family and I took a vacation together to visit my brother. I would say this is my last happy memory. 

In early ninth grade, my mother disappeared for a extended period of time, and ever since then, I can't say she has been my mother. The most helpful things she has done for me since that time was pick me up from school or buy me fast food after school, when I would often feel empty. She became a raging alcoholic. She was no longer somebody I could have laughs with, confide in, or relate to. She was always belligerently drunk and incoherent after my ninth grade year. I remember this year, I entered a depression much similar to my seventh grade year. 

My father and I have always had a very complicated relationship. I unquestionably love this man to death and he is the most important individual in my life. Throughout my middle school and high school years, I did have tendencies to act like a spoiled child, because despite my unhappy home life, I did have a tendency to always get the material things I desired. However people have validated that I do not appear to be as spoiled, or behave as spoiled, as my father often accused me of. Throughout high school, My Dad would often emotionally harass me. I do not feel as though he realized it. There were times when I was at my emotional lows, and he would bother to do nothing in terms of emotional support but drag me down further through insults and harassment, and there were times I felt alright, and he would come home and ruin it. 

Despite my emotional struggles throughout high school, my Father never failed to be there for me, in a financial sense. 

In high school, I spent most of my evenings and weekends pathetically lonely. I had three close friends, maybe four, however I didn't truly relate to these people, and at times when reflecting I feel like the main reason I may have decided to spend time around some of these individuals was my lack of options in my social life. Towards the end of my high school career, I held a solid GPA of around a 3.6 and performed well on the SAT. My Father and I began discussing college. I realized that I wanted to go away to a large university that was a reasonable distance away. I wanted to be at a university where I didn't feel like everyone knew everyone, like they do in high school. I wanted to be at a university that put me in a completely new location, where I wouldn't have to deal with the lurking empty memories and emotions I associated with my hometown and high school. 

And as I stated before, my father, when it comes to things I ask for, rarely fails. I found myself getting accepted into a relatively good school that was out of state but not ridiculously expensive. 

One thing that always bothered me in high school was my lack of social life, sex life, and the fact I had never had a girl friend. In the beginning of my freshman year of college, I quickly entered my first relationship. It was really fun at first, and should have been a fling, but lasted way too long, resulted in me not developing a lot of friendships in the beginning of college, and ultimately left me feeling awful. I did learn a lot from this experience. After that relationship, I did go on to make several good friends at my university I feel that I truly relate to.

I would like to say, that currently, I am a engineering major. I major in both mining and civil engineering, and am on a rigid five year path to receive dual degrees. Exiting high school I realized I have no idea what I wanted to do as an adult in terms of a career, so I decided to study engineering as I knew it was something that often resulted in solid salaries with high employment rates. Due to starting off slightly behind the average engineer, I was a semester behind. I realized I had excellent grades at the end of my freshman year, no internship, no true friends back home, and not much to return home to, so I decided to go to school during the summer. While I successfully put myself ontrack with other engineers during the summer, I reached one of my low points of my life. I found myself alone, for extended periods of time, with nothing to do but sit myself down and study complex science and mathematics. This was the first time in my life I felt truly suicidal. I was able to pull through, getting B's in every course I took in the summer, heading in to my second fall semester with a overall gpa of a 3.68. 

This semester, I was slated to take 18 credit hours however I decided to only take fifteen. I am currently enrolled in a engineering course called statics. There are four sections of statics taught this semester where I attend university, and by chance I ended up getting one of the worst professors at the university for statics. Firstly, I will say that after being in school, busting my ass, for a consecutive year, my effort has taken a dip, however this dip has not been significant. Due to my professor, and the toll in my effort, I am now borderline between a D and C in statics, more likely to get a D than I am a C. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. 

I feel obligated to due well and excel in school as my father pays for my education. This semester I have been careless with his money and spent a good bit more then I should have. However I have been upfront with him about my lapse of effort, my spending habits, my feeling of being worn out after so many consecutive semesters of difficult material in school. He is very understanding of my struggles and tells me all he wants is to see me relax, to see me be happy and enjoy my youth and find myself and take things slow. But his words don't prevent me from feeling like a failure.

If I am to fail statics, this means I will either have to become a six year student to receive to undergraduate degrees, neither of which really interest me, especially the mining degree, which brings me a ton of financial aid. It is difficult for me to change majors, as my tuition would go up drastically and I could potentially loose scholarships. Switching schools is also extremely difficult, as few schools would give me the same financial package that this school gives me. If I were to return home, I would get a decent amount of money in scholarships, but I would return to a place full of bad memories where I have little friends. The alternate to a sixth year as an undergraduate is to go to school another summer, and given the location of my school, it is relatively remote here in the summers. I simply do not think I have another summer semester of school in me. I also strive for internships, so I can make myself a valuable employee, despite the fact I know I likely will not find myself enjoying them. 

Even if my current worry is not statics, it would be something else. I constantly am a unhappy, suicidal person. I have had counselors on and off since I was in sixth grade. I have taken antidepressants. I have expanded my social life. I have tried a lot to improve my social life. 

I do not want to be a student, studying two undergraduate degrees, one of which I really simply don't give a fuck about, for six years. I don't want to spend another summer, in the middle of no where, studying every god damn fucking day. I do not want to return home, where I have empty sad memories. I do not want to pursue internships, in a field where I find myself with zero interest. 

I understand that there are kids starving in Africa. I understand there are kids with awful childhoods much worse then mind where there are both emotional and financial struggles. I understand I am much more well off and spoiled then some other kids. 

However I simply feel very little happiness. I've done the things you are supposed to do. Go to counseling, branch out, exercise, try anti depressants. I don't see purpose in my life. I constantly feel over whelming depression, anger, anxiety, and difficulty moving forward. I constantly see myself as someone who isn't enough. I constantly have visions of myself tieing a noose, jumping off a bridge, loading a gun and saying my goodbye to the world. I just truly don't want to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to go home. I don't want to be a student anymore. I don't want to complain anymore. I don't want to study anymore. I don't want to wake up anymore. I know life is hard, I know life gets much harder then getting a D in college. Maybe life just isn't for me, maybe I am just not built for life. I don't have an abundance of friends, I've never really had a true girl friend. If I had a handgun, I would load it with a sense of euphoria and end my life in this moment. I feel like I simply wasn't mean't to be, wasn't cut out for life."

I told her then and there I was definitely interested. This was maybe a month or month and a half ago, and I’m really not sure how to bring up this internship again and tell her I want to seriously be considered for a position, as it’s basically my dream job. How should I word my email?

I'm a high school senior/prospective Computer Science undergrad student currently living in the US.
Recently I've been thinking a lot about my future and career plans and would love any advice.

&amp;nbsp;

Some Background:

I was born and raised in Japan and attended public school until age 14.
Native/Bilingual in English and Japanese.
I have a US/Canada duel citizenship, as well as a permanent residency in Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, I miss living in Tokyo dearly and I definitely want to move back sometime after my undergrad.

Since I am bilingual and have residency, It is also an opportunity that I don't want to pass up.

I am leaning towards Western companies with offices in Japan, for mobility/flexibility and work culture.

&amp;nbsp;

My question is: What is the best way of getting a software job at an American company in Tokyo?

- Since I would like to visit Japan while I'm in college, does it make sense to aim for an internship there over summer? Would that open any doors for full-time jobs once I graduate?
I heard that there isn't much of an internship culture in Tokyo and that you generally aren't given many responsibilities especially compared to the States.

- If not, would it be viable to apply for a full-time job in Tokyo during the senior year of college in the US?

- Also, could it be beneficial to start at a US company with a Tokyo office (Google, Goldman, etc...) then transfer over?

- Finally, if I intend to get an MBA at a US school, would it make more sense to work here until I get that?

&amp;nbsp;

Any opinions or thoughts are welcome and appreciated!
Thanks!"

Doing summer co-ops is extremely valuable and almost necessary if you wanna land a good job after graduation. And because our classes run til May when all the students from other places become free at the end of April, all the co-op jobs go to them.

There are so many 4th year engineering students without a single relevant job experience. And guess what? No one wants to hire an engineer who did nothing but took tests during their 4 years of school. Oh yea maybe you built a cool robot for your capstone project but when there are plenty of grads from UBC or SFU who did all that plus various summer internships throughout their school years, why would they pick us? 

Honestly, when I came to BCIT, they made it sound like a job would be waiting for us if we graduate from here. Maybe for trade programs, yea. But for engineering programs like electrical and mechanical? not even. The job market is already terrible for us in Vancouver. It's sad to see so many smart 4th year students who would have been so successful if they attended different institutions that actually gives you a chance at getting summer co-ops.

SAT II Chem 690 Lit 690 Math 2 730 submitted all 3. 

ECs 4 year football 2 year captain at Florida powerhouse school. Congressional Debate Captain. Had like 6 or 7 awards to mention with that and in personal update i detailed last month of awards from national tournaments. Internship at surgery center and went into detail in that on personal update as I didn't include on original application. Mu Alpha Theta. Won and placed in school wide competitions over last couple of years. Tutoring through Mu Alpha Theta, NHS, Social Justice Club, and non profit started by student in my grade. 

Didn't talk that much about it. Should I submit another update on supplement page talking about tutoring experience and tying it back to essay I wrote about improving education? I am calling Harvard in like 3-4 hours to ask if my updates will be considered which I assume they are, counselor recommended doing so anyway to show interest and make them look again. Also talked about my personal creative writing and submitted a flash fiction I wrote as the alumni who interviewed me advised me to do. Interview went really well, guy was smiling the whole time, no awkwardness, I for sure got only good comments. On app and interview I overall presented an image of a socially mindful individual. My GPA obviously isn't great, but transcript shows significant improvement. Please address whether or not you think my URM status as both black and Haitian will contribute. 

Also chance me for these schools if you can and recommend any others to apply to. Columbia Cornell Johns hopkins Notre Dame UPenn Vanderbilt as reaches. NYU, UM, and UF as matches. I have no safeties at the moment, but will probably apply to nonselective state school. Thinking about Mcdermott scholarship at UTD so chance me for that if you are familiar. Overall just stressed from process and thinking I am going to get denied on the 12th and hoping this sub can give me a reality check. Thanks for anyone who takes their time reading this. 

Tl;dr : Am black haitian male wondering if status will help me into harvard early action, gpa kinda low but only from freshman year, test scores good but SAT IIs and APs aren't phenomenal. Good ECs, but not ridiculously impressive like other applicants. Chance me and recommend course of action for remaining time."
7gco2m,1,2017-11-29,I want to break up. Need help.,ablcstf,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7gco2m/i_want_to_break_up_need_help/,"Hello people,

I'm a 30yrs old male and I apologize if my writing looks funny. My native language is complex compared to English and thus I overthink wordings and sound stupid. I also apologize if this is a wrong subreddit but I searched for anything relating to breakup because I need help.

I've been in a relationship for just over 2 years now and I want to break up. I've been wanting to break up almost for a year now, but I'm lacking balls to do so as I fear that I'll screw her life and cause her life-long scars. The idea of breaking up feels so wrong but still like the only solution to all this. I fear I'm already fixated to the idea of breakup.

I feel so bad writing this... every time I press enter to make a new paragraph I just want to stop writing. This feels so wrong.

She thinks I'm the one. I don't think she is the one for me. She has a few personality traits I don't think my traits are compatible with. I feel like a douchebag and a hypocrit if I listed them here, so I'll just summarize and oversimplify it all by saying that we are completely in the different ends of the introvert/extrovert spectrum and it has caused a lot of painful moments for both of us. I'm bold, she's shy. Also I feel that she is not intellectually challenging me as much as I want, or as much as I need.

She has bad self-confidence issues and suffers depression every now and then. It's because of her childhood. She is having therapy and medication for that. Whether it was meeting new friends, cooking new things, professional self-development or anything like that, she usually says that ""nah I don't want to try, it won't work"" and if she DOES begin doing the new thing, she usually quits it half-way right after a first mistake or mishap, gets depressed and starts crying because she will never accomplish anything etc and she'll always be like that and nothing will ever get better etc etc. Crying is a very casual thing for her. For me it's not. It just makes my inner alarm bells ring: What did I do wrong? Did I do wrong? What should I do to comfort her? Will she get hurt even more if I do x?Am I doing enough? Am I doing too much?

And I'm always there to comfort and motivate her to finish the thing she's doing in a way or another. At those times I don't feel like a companion. More like a father or a big brother. This jinxes me up in a way I don't even understand.

Last weekend this one incident happened, and I immediately recognized the incident as the epitome of the problems:

Recently I hooked up with a group of likeminded guys and gals willing to start a new underground techno scene/club/place in our city. I'm the bossman of the group. A week after our first official meeting took place, we met again casually in an ug party and my girl was with me. She went into a total emotional lockdown and was generally a very cold person to these people, and to me too. And the day afterward she told me the reason was, that she saw all the girls of that group there as a threat. And that she felt like an outsider. Even though I introduced her to everyone and involved her in all conversations we had. Never left her alone apart from toilet breaks, not even for a second. ""Did you see how she looked at you? She's so going to steal you from me."" ""Did you see what kind of make up she had? Totally after you""... I can't even comprehend. That's not jealousy, that's biggotry and elitism. I'd understand if I had cheated on her. Or even flirted. Or done anything that would give a purpose for those kind of allegations. But no. And she admits it. And I understand her in a way. It's her childhood. She's just been so shy all her life that normal social situations like these are too overwhelming for her. But she's already 34 years old. And I feel like emotionally being squeezed into a small compartment because I can't cope with this.

I can't express my love for her anymore. I love her like a close member of family, but the love-love is now over. I don't have the balls to say this to her. This eats me so much. Affects my work performance, my happiness and everything. I'm not intentionally giving a silent treatment at home; I'm just so locked up in my mind that I can't even function anymore. Can't even be a good man. I feel so bad :'(

So why do I feel it's hard to break up?

1)
Few months ago she began studying for a new profession, an IT related one, and I feel like me being a software developer fueled her interest for doing something closely related to IT, web and shit like that. She's working as an intern, and gets an awful little money. If we break up, she'll be financially devastated as moving to a new apartment costs money and she'll have to start paying full rent instead of just half of it. Her relatives have spare money to lend, but still.

2)
I saw these incompatibilities of our personality traits right in the beginning. Still, I just felt that being with her was better than anything I've ever felt, and that these incompatibilities are just the essence of life. Now, the life of being single and alone with problems of just my own tempts a lot more than the life we're now living. I feel guilty for this. Like I was going to return a product years after the end of the warranty period.

3)
Scared that she might get so badly broken about it that there's no way of doing the breakup nicely or to avoid messyness. So broken, that she'd do very, very immature things; so immature that she'd hurt herself more or cause her future to be more difficult than it should be.

I don't believe in deities but I feel so little in front of this problem that I've already prayed for any kind of Development Manager of Universe to help me.

I just wish someone could just state the right words that could ignite the strength in me to break up. I feel emotionally so desolate and worn. And guilty for feeling desolate and worn."
7gcvv7,3,2017-11-29,How normal is it to be consoled?,grabasnack,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7gcvv7/how_normal_is_it_to_be_consoled/,"This is probably going to be one mess of a post, I'm not doing super well right now.

I can remember but one time in my life when I've been consoled by anyone and that was when I was a little kid and scared to death because of a surgery I had to undergo and my mom would tell me she would go in my stead if she only could. After that I've never had anyone, not my mom or dad not my brother or friends, notice and aknowledge how bad I've felt and talk to me about it or even just hug and hold me. Not a single time when I was having a meltdown or anxiety attack or when I've wanted to kill myself. In part because I have no one to talk to either, but from what I've read from online sources it sounds like being consoled is pretty common? Like having people notice when you're not doing so good and act on it is something that totally happens in real life? Even just having more experienced people give advice or mentor you is something I haven't experienced much. Guidance, I guess. Literally the only time anyone has taken the time to properly teach me anything was an acquaintance teaching me to play dota so I could play with them. I played for the company until I got sick of the game and now no one plays anything with me because I don't want to play dota.

I'm sick of making constant efforts all by myself (regarding getting some help with my mental health - no one's ever offered to help nor ask about it and for years I convinced myself I was imagining things, trying to be a special snowflake or something) and they're not even paying off very much. I hate being this envious of everyone I hear from, it sounds like things just fall in my friend's lap without her trying all that much and she is able to enjoy that too because she isn't a depressed, socially anxious mess like me. She is able to see things she wants to achieve in life and she can be excited just about everything. She's planning for her dream job and she talks of ways of getting prettier and she has roommates she instantly clicked with. The only roommates I've ever had avoided me and never talked to me. ALthough I suppose eventually I mirrored that right back at them. For me, this friend I mentioned is the only person who even talks to me frequently. And she seems uncomfortable to talk about my depression or offer any support, not that I can blame her very much but I always offer her every support she's asked for and humored all her more weighty conversation topics that I realized were such.
 
Most every day for me is trying to convince myself I don't have enough reason to kill myself yet and that there might be something to look forward to once I start therapy. I can't enjoy almost anything I used to love and I have no one or nothing to spend my days with, other than the vortex of depressive and anxious thoughts that make up most of my inner dialogue. I have no dreams to pursue and I'm probably unemployable. I barely even have items I want. I've never had a job other than one internship that was arranged for me, despite my best efforts at summerjob hunting for the last three or so years. I think the only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet is because I know for a fact that it would either cripple me to a point where I'll be unable to attempt again or to where I'm unable to get help in which case I suppose I would still die but it would be out of dehydration or hunger instead. Or else I'd succeed without anyone even knowing I was contemplating it and then they'd find out in maybe a month or two from now if even then because that's how much contact I have with people. Well, I also never want to do that to my brother because I care about him but his mental health can't be the sole reason for my continued existence when it's like this most of the time. I wish I was a robot so I could turn myself off but no one would have to be very sad because it's always possible to turn me back on, at least in theory. I'm so tired and I feel broken and I wish I could've been the boringly average, mostly happy kid instead. As things are, killing myself is the only future I can see unless I get ""lucky"" and die of something else before I do it myself. I don't think I've told that to anyone before, and I've only told a psychologist about the occasional suicidal thoughts.

Thanks to any who read through all this and I'm sorry it was so whiny. I have no one to talk to as I've found out this last year, and needed to get these things out even if it is to internet strangers. Also, I'm not about to kill myself today but this felt too suicide-related for the depression subreddit."
7gdenp,2,2017-11-29,Accountant to internal audit,Bigham1745,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7gdenp/accountant_to_internal_audit/,"So just wondering if any of you or your accounting friends have went into internal audit? Is/was it an easier transition. I’ve done an internal audit internship before and enjoyed it. I’m graduating in two weeks and going to chase that CPA. As someone who potentially has 30-40 years to be hanging out in the accounting field, future potential for artificial intelligence taking away some of our jobs has created a healthy fear in me. 


Just saying, 10+ years from now, IF  computers take over our career or part of it. Is internal audit a decent out should I ever need one?"
7gdqaq,7,2017-11-29,Could really use some advice from long term NC-ers,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/7gdqaq/could_really_use_some_advice_from_long_term_ncers/,"My ex recently came ""back"" after a 6 months of mostly NC. She messaged me and we've been talking for 2 months in which she continuously told me she wasn't sure what to do and afraid to give me another chance because she was afraid we're too incompatible and we'd get hurt again. At the end of the 2 months I found out she started dating someone else and she didn't even have the courage to tell me herself. The most unbelievable thing about this? She's dating someone who has a past full of cheating and whatnot, but she believes he has changed. Apparently he deserves another chance after all his cheating, but the guy who she loved in the past and has never cheated or done anything to hurt his previous partners, doesn't deserve this chance? I can't wrap my head around it.

Now I've reached the point that I just know I have to move on from this girl. After 8 months she still means the world to me and I just had to grab this opportunity because I never really stopped believing we'd end up together and there she was, contacting me out of the blue. 

I'm afraid I'd still give her another chance if her new relationship fails and she discovers she does want to be with me. It's scary to realize you can love someone so much that it doesn't matter how much they hurt you, you'll always end up forgiving them.

Anyways, I've come to the point now that I realize I have to try my best to move on and maybe become strong enough to point her back to the door if she ever came back. The problem is, I don't know how. After almost 6 months of NC I thought I was over her, but seeing how easily I got dragged back into it when she came back, I realized I never truly got over her.

My question to you guys is this: How do you truly get over them? I was going kind of fine, but in the back of my head I never stopped caring for her and never stopped wanting her to come back. You might say the hope never truly died.

For the people that have applied NC succesfully, what really helped you in reaching the point of no return? What made you so strong that you could just tell your ex no if they decided to show up again? I'm in desperate need of some advice from those of you that made it to the other side.

I'd appreciate it if someone could give me some advice on this. I've done it all, I'm religiously going to the gym and focusing on myself, I'm reading more, going out more, socializing more, but still when I'm alone with my thoughts she's there. Of course it's still fresh now since I kind of got my heart broken a second time, but even when I seemed to be fine after a long period of NC I still wasn't over her.

Maybe it's because I haven't found someone new to care about? My confidence has risen immensely after the breakup, I progressed a lot in the gym, I dress better and people tell me I'm a good looking guy, but I'm not the kind of guy that gets a lot of attention when going out. Also I'm a full-time intern and I'm never at my college anymore because this is the last thing I have to do before graduating. Also my social circle is mostly filled with guys. It just seems I'm limited in my ability to find someone new. 

But anyways, I know I can't be with someone else before I'm truly over my ex and I'm happy while being on my own. I could just really use some advice on how to get there since everything I've done in the past seems to have failed.

So I'm trying to figure out the best setup for workflow. Currently we use a sandbox site for development, so everyone in the office can see the progress as well as clients.

I'd like to be able to develop locally and then push to that server. Now my real concerns are the database, plugins and media files. How do we keep those the same across the board? Do I just have to put the entire wordpress install into the repository and use some sort of tool like wp migrate pro for the database?

Is that the best solution?"
7ge411,18,2017-11-29,My (30) parents (60's) treat my brother (23) like the golden child.,bigsishadenough,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ge411/my_30_parents_60s_treat_my_brother_23_like_the/,"So I moved out of my parent's place a few years now. The last years when I lived there I always felt like I didn't quite fit in. They didn't mistreat me, but they just didn't feel interested. Dinner time usually was completely around my brother. When he played sports, we talked about that. When he found a new hobby later on, 90% of the conversations were about that. 




However, if I tried to talk about something else they usually gave a very short answers and soon or later the topic went back to my little brother.  Or they mocked me. When I was able to move out, I did. And since then things went a lot better. I didn't have to spend too much time with them anymore and could leave whenever I wanted.




I've always been the creative one, drawing at an early age. And later I rolled into my first education in online media. Now the education itself wasn't that great, but it offered a playground to find your specialisation. Those who expected to just 'make it' by only following the classes and doing the bare minimum failed, and those who were more curious ended up quite well. After that, I decided to pursue a higher degree in that same field. I've been offered a part time job during my first year there, and have been working full-time after I graduated. 




And now my brother decided to go for the same workfield. He always was the lazy one and took a long time to actually finish his school. He had the same internship for years, which was at this tiny local shop. That shop also created websites, because they thought there was good money in it. They basically sold templates that they got cheap and hired interns to do their work for them. And since then my brother decided he was going to do that as well. He started his own company, got some small local customers and sold other people's work. Every once in a while he gets stuck and then usually turns to me with questions. However my parents think he is absolutely amazing at what he does. ""He has so many customers, makes all this money by doing the bare minimum"" and they recommend them to all their friends. They even went as far to tell me that maybe I could learn from him. 




This year, he decided to pursue the same education (the first one) I've done. In the first weeks he needed to do some creative assignments but he never could come up with something without asking me for all the ideas. As it's a higher education than he had done before, it also came with a lot of responsibility and research which weren't his strong suit either. Needless to say I don't think he's very good at it. He, however thinks he is so much better than all his classmates and even his teachers. He  felt he was good to show up for class as they couldn't teach him anything anyway. So now he decided to drop out as the education is rubbish. 




I'm really dreading to see my parents and brother again, especially with the holidays coming up. I'd hate to hear the same thing all over again and have them bash the same education I did in front of family, as if it all meant nothing. Usually I could just ignore them and smile and nod. But now it also feels they de-valuing me as well in front of family. And if I were to step in and say something among the lines that that education is what you make of it, they all gang up against me. So I lose either way and will be seen as the petty one. I just don't know what to do. Normal arguments never work with them. So I'm not sure if I'll just shoot myself in my foot if I try to say that it makes me feel uncomfortable and maybe we can drop the subject. Especially since they're so proud of him and his work and family will ask how he's doing either way. Or that I should ignore them and not get involved for this time being.




  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My little brother is the golden child. He started in the same workfield and dropped out of the same education I did. My parents now use every opportunity to talk about how great he is, and how terrible my education is. How should I deal with this during the upcoming holidays?"

**Arg in Favor:** Everyone who works in the House of Representatives — from lawmakers to interns — should be required to complete anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training during each session of Congress. This will ensure that the House is a welcoming workplace environment.

**Arg Against:** There’s no need for all members and employees of the House of Representatives to undergo anti-harassment training. All individuals should be held accountable for their actions, but mandatory training won’t resolve the issues of the past.

**This resolution** would require all members, officers, and employees of the House of Representatives to complete anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training during each one-year session of each two-year Congress. It would also apply to interns, fellows, and members of Congressional details. All would be required to complete the training within 90 days of the session beginning or 90 days of becoming employed by the House.

I work at a major hospital in the US. My department aids in commercializing research at the hospital, providing entrepreneurial consulting for doctors/scientists seeking to move their inventions out of the hospital by forming a company/licensing the technology. This is my first job out of school, and I've been working here for a little over a year. I graduated in June 2016 with a degree in economics &amp; mathematics from a top university.

I have become more and more enamored with my work and have decided that I want to stay for at least another year or two before I eventually go back to school for a Master's/PhD. The hospital is connected to a number of universities in the area, and affiliated with a top medical school. I hope to leverage the connections I’ve made, to help in the application process.

Because I love the job so much, and because of the inroads I’ve made with the academic community, I have been willing to ignore the fact that I am not paid very well. 

It took me a while to secure an offer, and so when I got this one, I basically accepted the terms on the spot. I was, and still am, very naive when it comes to negotiating pay. 

I am currently earning $15/hr. The hospital is in a city where that doesn't go very far, and I have had to work a number of side jobs at restaurants &amp; bars. I am basically living paycheck to paycheck and it has begun to affect my mental &amp; physical wellbeing.

Anyways, I was told earlier this week that I am in line for a significant raise (30%), salaried, and new title, based on my performance over the last year.

The raise would increase my salary to ~42k.

The title will most likely be ""Data Analyst"". I have ~3 years of experience in the field (2 while at school as an intern statistician, and 1 in my current position).

I am wondering how I can best negotiate that raise to be higher. Based on my degree and what the going rate is for similar jobs in the city, I believe that I should earn at least $55-60k.

What are the best ways that I can demonstrate to my boss that I deserve this higher pay?"
7gf0le,13,2017-11-29,Just got a very unexpected full-time offer...and now I'm between a rock and a hard place. Help me weigh my options?,dunnowhichtochoose77,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7gf0le/just_got_a_very_unexpected_fulltime_offerand_now/,"Hey guys. So I am graduating this May with a Computer Science degree. I had an internship (Company A) this past summer and was expecting a full-time offer from them, but was told in October there was no full-time spots for any of the interns. So I got on my interview and job hunt grind.

I got a pretty good offer Company B in the NJ area that I was planning on accepting. But then today, I suddenly got a call from the head of the Technology program at Company A saying that he fought really hard for me to get an offer since they really wanted me and that ended up increasing the headcount and extended me an offer. So now...I have a tough decision to make. Here are the stats:

Company A (place I interned at):

* Salary: $77k base
* Bonus/Raises: $10k signing, annual bonus and raises depends on team
* Program details: Great opportunities to grow and learn new technologies (big data, machine learning, etc) with two rotations on different teams
* PTO: 21 days
* Commute: 40-45 minutes, no tolls

Company B

* Salary: $75k base
* Bonus/Raises: $3k signing, 8% annual company performance bonus, and $8000 max individual performance bonus
* Program details: No rotations, 18 months before getting placed. It's a cellular company, so I don't expect anything exactly cutting edge. 
* PTO: 18 days
* Commute: 50-65 minutes, toll roads

Objectively, Company A's offer is better for so many reasons. But I have some issues with working there. Would it be stupid for me to accept an offer from a company that denied me a few weeks back? Or should I see it as a positive that I was fought for? 

And my second concern is my resume. I interned at Company A for the past two summers. So when/if I were to move on with my career, my only experience would be with that company. Whereas with Company B, I'll have more variety on my resume. Both companies are well-known. How much would this hurt me, if much at all?

Really stuck here. Any advice?

I was also able to get a paid internship through the county workforce center. I do have a part time job at a Formalwear store but not getting a lot of hours and my internship is going to end soon. I went to a temp agency just to see what they got and the person I talked to found a administrative assistant/file clerk position for me with a temp to hire. I like the job description seems like a really easy job at a manufacturing company. However I'm not looking to work and not get hired I'm looking for a job permanent full-time job with benefits of course. I also don't want to be stuck working for a temp agency for months or even years. This seems like a good way for me to get my foot in the door but is it worth the risk quitting my job and internship? Any advice would be helpful please and thank you.

I am a junior in aerospace engineering, and I sent out a ton of applications to various places at the beginning of this semester. From prior experience, I know that this process takes a really long time in engineering compared to other fields, so I wasn't expecting to hear back from many places until after the new year. However, I did get an offer about a month ago from a federal position that I applied for pretty early on. The pay is very competitive as far as engineering internships go, and I've never had an internship before, so I took the offer because they wanted my answer by the following day.

At this point, I've submitted all my paperwork for my background check and security clearance, but I haven't signed an employment contract. The offer was an email that specifically stated that I had been ""tentatively selected"", and my only form of commitment so far has been a reply to that email. I haven't looked into whether this officially locks me into the position, but I'm guessing it probably doesn't because (a) the facility is in an at-will employment state (not sure what that means for a federal position though), and (b) the ""tentatively selected"" wording makes me think that my official offer is contingent on my security clearance coming in.

Fast forward to today: this is where it gets interesting. I got an email today telling me that I landed an interview with a huge private-sector government contractor that I would really like to work at. Their internships are highly sought-after, extremely competitive, and really good experience, so I was very pleasantly surprised to even get an interview. I agreed to take the interview, which is next week, because worst case scenario I can turn the position down if I actually end up getting an offer. However, I would much rather withdraw from the federal position if possible because the private-sector job aligns much more closely with what I'd like to do in my career, and I would get more pertinent experience for the kind of position that I want to go into when I go full-time.

About 20 minutes after I emailed back confirming the interview, I got an email from the federal agency telling me that I need to travel out of state to do some pre-employment appointments at one of their facilities. They scheduled the appointments for the second week in January, so I've got a bit of time to make arrangements, but as far as I can tell, this is the last step before I fully sign on for the position. They're also reimbursing me for travel, so I feel that if I decide to withdraw, then out of courtesy I need to do it before I go to the appointments and cost them a lot of money in travel expenses, HR time, etc.

Like I said before, my interview for the private-sector position is in a week, and I have no clue how long it will take them to get back to me with a decision. So that leaves almost exactly a month between my interview for the private-sector position that I would much rather take, and what I'm considering the ""point of no return"" for the federal position that would still be decent experience and good pay, but wouldn't be as good for my career goals as the other position.

So my question really is, what's the etiquette for a situation like this?
Should I treat my ""tentative"" commitment as a full-on employment contract, or would it be okay to withdraw if I get an offer for the private-sector position?
Also, am I right in assuming that it would be pretty bad to withdraw after going out of state for the pre-screening appointments, and that I should decide what I'm going to do before then?
I've only had low-paying part-time jobs before, so this is really my first experience with this ""big-ticket"" type job-seeking, and I would appreciate any advice or insight.

**TL;DR: I ""tentatively"" committed to a federal internship that I was offered (haven't signed a contract), but now I have an interview for a really good private-sector internship in the same field. The private-sector position would almost definitely be better experience for my career goals because of the kind of work I would be doing, but I don't know if I'll get an offer before it's ""too late to withdraw"" from the federal position. I also don't know when ""too late"" is besides after I sign an actual employment contract. Any advice on how to approach this situation?**"

The only issue is that I have some disabilities, such as serious sleep and intestinal disorders, that make it difficult for me to have a roommate and require me to have my own bathroom, which are accommodations that I receive from my university during school. From what I've read online, the company provides housing for 4 interns to share 2bd/2ba or a very small stipend that would not cover housing costs in a high COL area where my internship would be. I don't want to seem pushy/needy but this is a serious issue for me, but I am scared that if I ask for these accommodations, they will take the offer away from me or will reject the request. I was wondering if anyone has ever gone through the process of requesting disability accommodations like these at work? What should I expect and prepare for? How much information do I have to reveal to HR (asking because this is a throwaway for a reason...very few people know about my health issues and I like to keep it under wraps)?

My husband is old money--we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is fifteen years old and the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife--I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I *do* it. 


But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're seventeen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to *be* you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes--and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more! 

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me. 


You had been moody lately, I knew that--your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were *so* angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own. 


Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to *me* instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was *weird* when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started *fucking* me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and--well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress. 

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was *you*, my *son*, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified--I couldn't understand why you would want to *do* this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out? 


But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father--you think I deserve you. 

-----

SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside. 


I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too! "

I'm currently a 3rd semester Computer Science Major at Syracuse University. When I applied for college last year, I applied for direct admission into the Computer Science program at UW, but unfortunately was not admitted. Syracuse was a second choice for me so I decided to come out here to New York to major in Computer Science. However, last summer I applied as a transfer student as a Computer Science/Pre-Engineering student and was accepted. Unfortunately, I know that the Paul Allen school for Comp Sci doesn't take applications for winter quarters. Therefore, I would have to apply to the major itself once I started next January. Now I've heard a lot of people talk about how Comp Sci is an extremely hard program to be admitted to at UW, so I'm very conflicted on what I should do. I'm already almost half-way through the program here at Syracuse and am slated to take intensive Comp Sci courses next semester. The problem is I know since I wouldn't be a Comp Sci major at until I actually got into the program, I probably won't be able to take those kinds of classes as a Pre-Engineering student. I'm mainly worried that I wouldn't be able to get into the Paul Allen school and will be stuck with a major I'm not really interested in. As far as my chances are concerned. My GPA coming out of high-school was around a 3.4, which obviously wasn't enough to gain admittance in the first place. However, up until this point at Syracuse, I should have around a cumulative of 3.7 - 3.8. I won't know for sure until after Finals of course, but I finished my freshman year with a 3.86. Ontop of this, I just got an offer for a 10 week internship in the TAP program at JPMorgan Chase for this summer. However, I'm also worried how transferring might affect my ability to actually take it. The description says you must be a Comp Sci major - now knowing that I won't be one for next quarter makes me think this could cause issues. I'm also seeing now that the internship starts possibly right before finals week in the beginning of June 2018. After taking all this into consideration, I'm thinking of staying at Syracuse as it's most certainly simpler logistically. I've always wanted to go to the UW, but I'm really not sure if it'll be worth it in this situation I'm in.

I'm really not sure what to do here. Really, any advice would be incredibly appreciated.

- Don't know if this is extracurricular but I've been studying with a professor for the Putnam a few hours every week. My cc is one of the only ones that has a team competing in the Putnam and I'm a part of it.


Questions:     
- Should I apply to more places? I really can't afford to pay for out-of-state tuition but I'm open to applying to other California schools if you guys have any suggestions.      
- Both of my B's were in math classes (5 units). When people ask for major GPA, does it include math even though im computer science?         
        
Other stuff:     
- I will have completed all prereqs by the end of the spring semester     
- I can get a few good letters of recommendation if I need to 
- Essays are 8/10 or better     
- Tagged UCI for CS

7ggy08,7,2017-11-29,European wants to know admission chances for US Psychology Grad School,ClinEurUs,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7ggy08/european_wants_to_know_admission_chances_for_us/,"I will be moving to the U.S from Europe soon and I hope to apply for some Clinical Psychology programmes. Ideally, I would eventually like to end up as a practicing clinician in a forensic setting. I haven’t taken any GRE exams yet so I’m wondering how strong my application would be apart from these. I know they are a huge part of the application but first I want to find out if the rest of my skills/experience make me a reasonably competitive candidate. 

It doesn’t come naturally to me to talk about my skills/achievements so sorry if I come across badly! Here’s a bit about me:

* Undergraduate degree: Major in philosophy, minor in psychology. 
* Masters degree: philosophy (thesis relating to philosophy of cognitive science)
* Psychology degree: the one I did is known in the UK as a ‘conversion course’. It is equivalent to an undergraduate degree in psychology in every way including accreditation (but it is condensed into a shorter time period and is only available to people who already have an undergraduate degree). I did this in the top university in my country, graduated second in my class. 
* GPA (using online calculator): 3.88 
* Currently: in my 3rd year of a 4 year Ph.D in cognitive neuroscience. 

[To anyone unfamiliar with the European system (or at least the system in my country), to become a clinical psychologist you need to do a particular professional doctorate degree (e.g. a D.Clin), whereas a Ph.D in my country is only concerned with research and cannot qualify you to be a practicing clinical psychologist. That’s why there is a need for me to do a second doctoral degree.]

* Hope to submit my thesis next year
* 3 first author publications
* I have presented my research at national and international conferences
* I have also worked as a research assistant in two different labs (one a cognitive psychology lab, one a cognitive neuroscience lab). 
* I did an additional part time degree in statistics 
* I have received academic scholarships and awards (one fully covering the cost of my Masters tuition)
* I have been on psychology/neuroscience student committees, was editor of a national student-run psychology journal, and a neuroscience journal in my university
* I have also done a fair amount of copy-editing and peer reviewing for undergraduate/student-run journals.
* Teaching experience: I was a teaching assistant during my Masters, I have worked as an research skills tutor for undergraduate psychology students, as well as a teaching assistant for statistics for both undergraduate and postgraduate students in psychology.
* Letters of recommendation: I can get three strong letters from people who have supervised my research at various levels. 

My main concerns are these:

1. Will I come across as odd and lacking direction because I would already have a Ph.D while applying for another Ph.D position? (I know in general two Ph.Ds is a big no-no, but I would require a clinically focused doctoral degree as opposed to my purely research-based one in my country).

2. Will the people reviewing my application look badly upon the fact that my psychology degree isn’t a B.A, B.Sc, etc.? It is completely equivalent to an undergraduate degree in psychology and contains all of the necessary subjects, etc.

3. Is my GPA high enough? I don’t necessarily need to apply to top-tier schools. 

4. I lack experience in clinical settings, e.g. volunteer placements and internships (I have done some work with homeless people, elderly people, and health-based charities but nothing substantial with a psychological patient population, or with a forensic population which I would eventually like to get into as a career). Is this bad? I still have time to improve on this.

5. Final question: based on the above information, what tier of university might be suitable for me to apply to realistically? Obviously I know this will depend on department interests, my GRE, etc. as well.

**If anyone read all of that, thank you so much, I know it was very long! Thanks so much for any help you can give me.**

7gh2x9,1,2017-11-29,Ways to get rid of credit card balance on an account where interest (23.99% APR) has kicked in?,balgalghighi,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7gh2x9/ways_to_get_rid_of_credit_card_balance_on_an/,"Hey friends! I made the mistake of signing up for an Apple Barclay Card US a few years ago in order to be able to afford a Macbook. Made dumb purchases and spent recklessly for 2 years and now the interest has kicked (about 8 months ago). Every month I pay about $120 dollars and it gets swallowed up by the monthly interest charge. I called a few months ago and they reduced my interest rate a few percentages down to 23.99% but that's still so high considering my balance is currently at $3500. 

A few key facts about my income -- I'm a graduate student (from a foreign country) so I can barely work -- I intern in NYC and make 11$/hr so I make about $360 every two weeks. Thankfully my school and rent are paid for but here are my monthly expenses:

Transportation($120)
Utilities ($30)
Phone bill ($45)
Food ($150). 
Barclays Credit card (the one with interest) ($120)
2nd credit card with Bank of America ($25)

I'm making $720 a month, when all is said and done, after all my expenses, I'm left with $230 -- a big chunk of this remaining money usually goes towards coffee, fun outings, the occasional food out, etc. 

Do you guys have any tips for how to manage this $3500 credit card balance -- the one with interest? And how to get out of this hell hole? My credit has got to be so bad (I'm afraid to check it). Any guidance would be very much appreciated."

Max of $600. Would definitely prefer $550 or less. USA.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Battery life doesn't matter so long as it can get at least 6 hours with moderate use (browsing and streaming). Would prefer 8, however. Beyond that, I know I need at least 6gb RAM just from experience with my current computer (HP ENVY Touchsmart) 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Please, less than 6 pounds. My current laptop is 5.6 and I would love for the new one to be less than that. But I will take a 5lb. laptop with good specs and battery life over a lighter one without.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Somewhere between 13 and 16 is ideal (12.5""-15.6"")

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
I often stream while working on multiple tabs, so I would need to be able to do the same. Some light gaming. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
The only games I play are CIV5 and Sims 4. Sims 4 is fine at medium settings, I have no idea what settings are even available to me for CIV5. I consider myself to be an incredibly casual player, so the settings on CIV don't matter too much.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I would prefer non-touch with a decent mousepad and keyboard. But if there's a 2in1 out there that's absolute awe-inspiring, throw it at me. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I'm a student teacher doing my internship next semester, which means lots of lesson planning and creating/collecting classroom materials. I mostly use GoogleDocs, but I may also decide to add Word/PWPT/Excel. I usually have quite a few tabs open and I stream often. I know I mentioned gaming earlier, but I thought I would clarify that I prioritize being able to stream and be productive over the Sims 4 (and I value Sims4 over CIV5, so if something isn't able to play CIV it's not a deal breaker).
I will plan to take this computer with me to teach English in South Korea next year, so something sturdy (really just non-delicate) would be appreciated. 

Also thank you for your help, I'm in way over my head here. "

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. The authority figures can be anyone from a coworker that has been at the job longer to an aunt or stepmother or even his boss. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

A bit about me, I am [Mysti](https://i.imgur.com/PzHlNpE.jpg) .

**Turn On’s**
As stated above, I really like transformations. I love the idea of realistically transforming into someone else. I love it when someone takes me and guides me/forces me through the transformation process. Here are a few things that I am into:

* Feminization (duh)

* Submission

* Role/Gender Reversal

* Corset/Waist Training

* Salon visits

* Heel Training

* Chastity

* Strapons/Anal

* Discipline/Spankings

* Behavior Modification

* Scat

* Gore

* Animals

* Bathroom Play

7ghq98,3,2017-11-29,Not even sure if LSD messed me up or I have always been messed up.,enigmish,Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7ghq98/not_even_sure_if_lsd_messed_me_up_or_i_have/,"Hi, I had a very bad trip on LSD 3 months ago and just wanted to share how my life changed since. I am quite aware no-one here is psychologist, but maybe some people had similar experiences and overcame difficulties I am going through right now.

**Important!** If you know any other useful place/thread/forum I can post my story to get useful feedback, please let me know in comments

**Part 1**: Quick intro about my character pre-lsd (I feel like this is important in context but you can skip this part)

I am a male in my 20s, pretty successful at school, have a good-paying job, about to graduate soon, my family is very loving and supportive(although I only see them once a year coz studying abroad), quite social although found it difficult to build deep connections with friends. That said, I was still quite ""not-content"" with my life (I would not say unhappy because at some moment I was actually very happy). Main problems have always been one thing: insecurity about my manliness. I can break it into two sub-insecurities: lust for women attention and lust for power. I was quite a social outsider in my teens since I was very smart(like 5% percentile smart) but very awkward socially and physically. When I entered university, things have been going quite well - I put on some muscles, gained many connections and started to dress well. But it did not calm me down, as I was still not getting women attention and I developed this obsession with ""how can I become even better"" or ""how can I be happier/richer/more popular in life"". I feel like ""becoming manlier"", ""becoming happier"" and ""becoming more powerful/influential/rich"" have become mantras and meaning of my life, and I was just diving deeper and deeper into self-analyzing and ego-boosting. I could not do the same job for more than few months as I would always get bored. Luckily, all the jobs were internships so I only had to do each one of them for four months. I felt awesome and shitty at the same time, all the time. Awesome, because I was self-developing every day. I gained ridiculous development in physique, was reading cool books, etc. All for self-development. Shitty, because it was never enough and I never really new what direction I wanted to take in life. Did I want to be an entrepreneur? Did I want to be a financial manager? Did I want to get married and so on and so forth. Things changed when a year ago I got my first girlfriend. Our relationship was super-dramatic but exciting. I could not be happier. But we broke up very shortly, in a month or so. After that, I went back into my usual obsession ""how can I get better to get her back or find a new, better gf?"". But that time even more aggressive. But again, I was not unhappy, just non-content (Or wasn't I?). Then I took LSD...

**Part 2:** trip (also can skip this part if not interested in details)

So one day me and my friend decided to do a one lsd tab each together. I was very misinformed about what lsd really does to you. People kept telling me that it ""changes you"" but I never really fully understood what they meant by that, for me it was more like: you see some weird stuff like dragons, then you sober up and you realize you were just high. So my friend (I will just call him Nick here) offered me to do lsd with him. The problem is we were looking for sober guardian but could not find anyone available, so we just decided to do it on our own, it was a risk, but we were okay with that (idiots) since Nick has done Acid before. Needless to say, trip went horrible. First 3 hours felt great, went to swimming pool, sauna, super confident and relaxed, everything felt nice. Then we went to grab some food (bad idea, but I felt very hungry). Went back to Nick's apartment and Nick decided to shower quickly. That is when things went wrong. I basically started to have these thoughts ""I don't like being high"" and ""What if I can't get un-high? Should I go to hospital?"". My friend just came out of shower and offered me to go for a walk. So we are coming out of the building and I tell him that I am too worried to simply walk and I want to call my other friend (lets call him Sam) who should have got free by that time to host us at his place. Luckily, Sam picked up the phone and gave us a green light to come to his place. His place was 15 min walk from us, but walk felt forever. At one point I got really nauseous and panicky and just felt like I am in metaphorical hell. I.e. I started to think that I am stuck in being high forever and my body is going to keep physically torturing me forever. Then I started to question if I ever have actually taken LSD and did not just go crazy. Then I started to question if time actually exists. So I asked Nick about how long we have been high and he showed me the timer moving and it calmed me down. We managed to get to Sam. Sam was able to calm me down just enough to make me not do stupid things. That said, I was still obsessing about existential questions and my place in them. What was really bothering me is a concept of free will. Like what if we are just watching our life as a ""movie""? I felt so out of control. I asked my friends not to leave myself on my own because I was very scared of committing suicide. Some other friends came to apartment and basically one high and 3 sober people were babysitting me. They managed to get me home, as I was sobering up and managed to fall asleep. 

**Part 3:** One month of ""normality""

The next morning after a trip, I was very determined to do everything so that this trip does not affect me in a bad way. I went to medicine shop, bought some stress-relief supplements (vitamins and valerian) and then went for a walk to think about life. I constantly told myself and reassured that it was just a bad trip and I am in fact a very happy person. The next day I came back to work, and was in the middle of intense project so I quickly got over this bad experience in just few days or so. After that, I was back to my usual ""self-development"" and ""manliness"" arc. Things were about 97% about the same as they were before the trip with few very minor panicky moments but nothing serious.

**Part 4:** Panic attack

One day when I was taking a subway to work, just like any other day I suddenly got nauseous and looked at subway tracks. For absolutely no reason a thought ""what if I jump"" crossed my mind for no reason and I got a severe panic attack. I think it might have been a flashback, although I am not sure as its hard to remember what happened. So I was going to the office and thought that being in office would calm me down. It did not. In fact, I had few severe panic attacks in next few days and had to ask one of my friends to baby-sit me. It basically felt like an lsd trip all over again but no visuals. I had very terrible thoughts for the next few days that scared the shit out of me. Some examples of them:

""What if my memory is not real and just programmed into my mind""

""What if there is no time and in fact its all just a frame with fake memory in it""

""What if I am the only conscious being in the universe and everything is just a decoration""

""What if the only universe that exists is inside my head""

""I am just a collection of particles that are going to move only one certain way, thus its not really me making decisions but rather laws of physics, nothing depends on me""

""Dying and being immortal are equally bad, one means you are forever stuck in consciousness and the other means you are forever stuck in unconsciousness""

""What if I go crazy, I will never know because everything feels real to me, what if I already am and no one tells me""

**Part 5:** What I experience now

After few days I was able to go back to work, visit few doctors and even come back to usual activities in life. I visited few doctors and some said its nothing bad and is just anxiety, other offered anti-depressants (which I did not want to take as psychoactive substance is what made it all possible in the first place).  So I started googling. I saw quite few posts about similar experience after psychedelics and some after just general trauma and started to collect tips. Main tips I absorbed are: dieting, working out, meditation, socializing, routine schedule and doing fun activities even if you don't feel like it. I adopted all of them. Reading also helps a lot. What I can tell is that all these activities help to the extent and keep me busy, I feel they don't solve the core problem. And the core problem is that I got into an endless loop of obsessive and depressive thinking. My panic attacks stopped, but the thought patterns that created them did not. In fact, while I don't get panic anymore, over these 2 months I got depressed and unmotivated. All these existential questions have no answer, there is no safe place anymore. I feel like I am forever stuck in all this ruminating and it affects my life. I started to suffer Depersonalization/Derealization. I have very tunnel-like vision (which sometimes seems completely normal but its just ""something is wrong"" which makes me think its totally fine and I just convinced myself it is not). I zone out pretty often, like I may look at something for few minutes and then realize I did not pay attention to it whatsoever and was rather inside my imagination.

I started to obsessively googling how to fight depression and anxiety. In fact, if we are being honest, writing this post is a part of my obsession of finding a ""cure"". It has been few months since this whole thing started and my parents still don't know (my mom is way too panicky, I feel like if I tell her that I suffer mental health issues, she will get her own). Did not tell my dad either since I am too embarrassed that I might become a burden because of it. 

Even my obsession with girls and ""getting better"" is completely gone as I think I just lost any motivation and will-power. I also think I am too unstable now to pursue any of my old dreams (like becoming an entrepreneur). Life lost all meaning.

I can easily get through the day, like I don't feel suicidal because people say it will pass and that is what I hope will happen. But I feel like I am just screwing myself over with constant ""am I ok now?"" questions. I basically wake up and go to bed with these questions.

I will just list all thoughts that bother me the most as a conclusion to the post:
""I want to be back to normal self, but the only way it can happen is erase all these memories which cant happen""

""I feel like life is pointless now, we are all going to die""

""There is no such thing as pleasure, only distraction from death""

""How do people know they experience pleasure, how can you quantify it""

""What if I am okay and not in fact mentally sick, I just convinced myself that I am""

""Not being able to see everything freaks me out, even supposedly 3d world is just a 2d projection in my brain and it is limited to whats in-front of me. I.e I cant even tell for sure there is something behind me until I see it""

""Vision feels the same, sharp as before but fake for some reason, almost tunnel""

""Am I actually conscious when I do something fun and not ruminating? Am I conscious when I am not self-analyzing?""

""Does anything exist outside of what I see?""

""I don't have suicidal thinking just yet, but what if I do?""

""I feel like 'curing myself' has become my new meaning of life and thus will be stuck with me forever""

""What if I suddenly get normal again, will it really be 'me' or is what I am now is actual 'me'?""

""How can I live with the fact that I can become unstable any moment, how can I get kids, important job or any other serious responsibility if I can get depressed any moment?""

""If I can't take one bad lsd trip, how will I able to cope with something actually terrible, like a death of parents?""

""theory of relativity freaks me out, it means there is no truth and you basically have to just randomly chose your own truth randomly and stick with it""

""Is there even such thing as 'me'? We change every second""

""If I am not my thoughts, than what am I?""

and many others (I will add if I feel I left something important)

One more important thing to note is that I had lots of existential thoughts and theories even before lsd but they never scared me before, in fact they excited me and were main topic of conversation with friends. I have no clue why they do now. 

If anyone felt at least something similar, most important things I need to know is what did you do to get out of obsessive thinking, and when did you know ""I am ok now, I can just live like a normal person anymore"". Thank you for your attention.

My official title is Software Developer/Technical consultant Intern. I was recommended for this job by a teacher at a community college I was attending at the time. I've been here for roughly 7 months now and I'm confused about how much work I'm actually doing as an intern.

Some of the work has included building a small website that we use in house to track some of our VPS, and our VPN services. This includes building the entire front-end, back-end, and the database for the website. I'm currently managing all of the companies VPS's and keeping track of nearly all of our VPN's. I'm working right now on a older client that someone who worked for this company before wrote, and trying to get it working for a project that we're finishing up. The client is written in C# which I have no experience in. I'm also in the process of rewriting this client in python. I'm also trying to spearhead a project to automate some of our checking on our VPS's, like reading logs among other things. Just a few days ago I've found out that I'm now going to be teaching some new interns about some of our practices and teaching them how to set up a VPS/VPN combo.

I also want to mention that this company I work for is split into two parts afaik, a more ""training"" side, and a technical services side. Our entire team for working on all of the technical stuff consists of the CEO, 2 part-time employees, and 3 part-time interns (possibly more interns soon). I'm currently the only person on this team who knows programming well. Mostly everyone else is network/server knowledge. We've lost two employees in the last year, one of which was an intern.

 I consider myself pretty good with programming, as I feel I have moderate knowledge of Python, Java, and a couple of web dev tech, like node.js, css/html. I'm currently in my 4th year of college, I've been taking classes slowly and I'm about to transfer into a college this spring to finish the last two years of my Bachelors degree. The only programming classes I've taken are intro to programming and intermediate (both in Java). I've taught myself mostly everything else. I feel that the amount of work and/or the way this company is set up must have something wrong. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Am I actually doing Intern level work for this company? 

I do get to work from home, with occasionally having meetings in person once or twice a week. I'm currently being paid $20/hr.

Any advice? "

One is offering a 12-week internship over the summer, another is a 13-month placement scheme for students. Both are for the Software Engineer role. The obvious answer is choosing the longer internship, but a part of me thinks the 12-week internship would look more impressive as they hire a lot less people so maybe more exclusive?

7ghyoc,79,2017-11-29,TIL Michael Moore ( Jaba the hut impersonator/Trump Hater ) bought the website JoeScarboroughKilledHisIntern.com to troll Joe Scarborough after Joe insulted him on TV,rareunlimited,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7ghyoc/til_michael_moore_jaba_the_hut_impersonatortrump/,"from a 2003 blog
""Yesterday, ""Democracy Now"" broadcast a Michael Moore talk at a San Francisco college last Monday (Oct 20). He started talking about how Joe Scarborough had a show called ""Michael Moore Hates America."" Moore, of course, was outraged. So he began researching Joe Scarborough on the web and, of course, soon found the story of Lori Klausitis (sp?), Joe Scarborough's young female employee, who was found dead on the floor of his office during Scarborough's last few weeks in Congress. DUers will know this story, of course, but Moore at least pretended to have only recently learned of it.

In any case, Moore went on a rant about how Scarborough's show wasn't entitled ""Does Michael Moore Hate America?"" as a debatable question but rather ""Michael Moore Hates America"" as an irrefutable truth. Therefore, after Moore discovered the dead intern story, he bought the domain name JoeScarboroughKilledHisIntern.com and that it should be on-line within a couple weeks. (I just checked and got an ""under development"" page but I also checked it under domain registries and the domain name is not available.)

It sounded as though Michael was trying to bait Scarborough into the same kind of legal hysteria O'Reilly indulged in against Al Franken. In any case, I think this is a GREAT development &amp; we need to get this website spread around when it appears so that Scarborough won't be able to ignore it.""

I'm going into the program starting Winter 2018 quarter and I was wondering if I could get some thoughts on my planned schedule? And maybe some advice on whether my class pairings are too difficult or if there's a better way to pair them? Is 3 classes over the summer do-able?

I'd like to take Parallel Programming and Mobile &amp; Cloud as my electives because they seem to be the most relevant to getting a job and also I've seen a bunch of people on here say 352-UX is a waste of a class, haven't heard much about 373-DADA or 464-Open Source other than a couple people saying they were easy, a couple people saying they were a waste, and I heard 464 might no longer be offered?

I also figured if I do it this way then I'd be graduating in the spring when new grads are getting hired. And hopefully the 1.5 year track has time for me to get an internship. I'm also ok with doing the 2 year track if I need to.

Thanks.

Problem is that QA is not at all what I want to do. I’ve always wanted to go into software/web development but struggled to find position coming out of school and had an internship doing QA so I found a position quickly doing that. I figured it would be a good segway and allow me some time to learn and hone my skills.

I’m pretty miserable at work currently, I work a lot of hours, hate having to do manual testing or writing automated testing scripts or any testing in general, and any sort of development work i’ve done to improve processes for our team have gone unnoticed. I’m really apathetic towards my job now and do whatever I can to make any time for myself to work on side projects and learn more software development skills. 

I’ve been applying and interviewing for Web/Software development jobs for a little while now, but I either don’t even land and interview or get rejected during the interview process. I don’t think i’m unqualified. Overall think that my side projects are impressive and my knowledge in the main technologies for the jobs i’m applying for is great. 

I’ve come to a point where I feel like quitting my current job and instead use all the time it opens up to commit myself to full-time interviewing/open-source contribution/projects/free-lancing. I’ve been told by multiple people that it’s a bad idea and that I should just stick it out at my current job until I find another one. Am I wrong for thinking that I’d be better off committing myself to building my own brand and landing a job that I want? 

I think it’s also important to mention that there isn’t really a great opportunity or timeline to move into a software development position here coupled with the fact that the culture isn’t very good.

So I guess my question is, would I be completely shooting myself in the foot leaving my job at a fairly prestigious company to work full time on landing a position where i really want to be?"

So I am a Senior graduating after spring 2018 semester. I was a systems software intern at $(big tech company in Silicon Valley) last summer doing driver development, and I have a return offer to a similar team at that company. I liked working there and the offer is very generous and hard to turn down, but I do not want to be doing driver development for the rest of my career.

I have research experience working on parallel algorithms and scientific computing, and have found that I like working on those types of problems more than driver development. I am worried that by taking this job, combined with my (only) internship, I would be typecasting myself as a drivers/systems software guy. It is the offer I have so far, and it expires soon. Have a few other interviews ongoing but they are long shots, and am also considering grad school.

Offer:

- Salary: 120k base

- Bonus: 18k signing, 13k 1 year anniversary, 7k stock

- Details: Would be working on a driver with heavily abstracted meta C code that resembles it's own language.


Pros:

- Generous offer from well known company

- Familiar work environment, I liked working there

Cons:

- Worried that I will spend a lot of time learning this meta C language that may not be applicable to future jobs

- Don't want to be stuck doing systems software for rest of career/want more variety on my resume

- Don't enjoy system's software as much as other things I've worked on (but I don't dislike it)

To introduce myself, I'm a freshly graduated student in CS and have to move aboard (Canada) for my first job. I already did an internship in this company earlier in the year but after it, the conclusion was that my social skills aren't good in English. Even in my native language (French), I'm have difficulty to speak to others, so in English, it is worse haha. During this internship I tried time to time to get socialized but I find it very hard, and didn't get any friend (but I have the chance to be with my bf so I was not too lonely, he was also very considerate). At the end of it, my manager kindly suggested that next time, I should try to speak more to the others. I am not very comfortable when being with people (afraid of language mistakes or being judged), I guess I have some kind of social anxiety.

I'm eager to improve myself this time, be more confident with my team members and maybe make some friends (not necessarily at work). Would you please have some advice or feedback from similar experiences?"

You're beautiful, caring, kind and thoughtful. It was always just explained away as 'those are women from work' or some other excuse. As I've gotten older, it's just made me resent my father even more.

I had just dropped my girlfriend Amber off after a date and I was laying in bed reading a book for my senior English class tomorrow.

I can't believe my dad is banging some intern in a hotel downtown while my mom is laying in bed alone. How could he do that to you?

You taste better than I could dream. Sweeter than Amber could ever hope for. I hear you groaning and sighing, moving underneath me to spread your legs for you. You know you deserve this. Need this.

I could lick and taste you for hours, and I certainly will, but I need to be in you. Need to show you how much I want you. How much I need you. Once I'm inside you, I can't stop.

I can feel your pussy squeezing me, wanting my seed and even though I don't want this to end I can't deny giving you want, what you need. As I feel you cumming too I let loose, shooting my seed deep inside you. It feels so right. So perfect.

I see you open your eyes with a look of surprise and shock. I know, you probably thought I was last longer. I just smile and lean down and kiss you, ""I could go longer if didn't turn me on so much Mom. I promise I'll last longer next time."""

I told them I would consider the job and await their emails for interview and offers, which never came.
Fast forward to the end of my first semester, and starting a job hunt. 100 applications and around 90 generic ""Thank you for the interest but we have selected another candidate for this position"" later, i call it quits and focus on my schooling. Semester 3 comes along, i find an OK internship and land it somehow, but quickly realize that the internship will in no way help me in the future, unless i want to work retail IT(which I dont), which roles me into semester 4 and graduation. I send perfect cover letters and resumes to companies that i meet at a career fair and have several ""staffing companies"" say they can find me work. Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Noda. One company basicly begged me to come in for an interview the day I applied, and was super pumped up to meet me and show me around the building. Two months later I get an email saying they had a massive corporate restructure and they rebuilt their IT dept from scratch. I even applied for my dream job at a professional sports team, as a desktop support for their front office. I get an email from the a month later saying ""we have decided not to fill this position""
Now, here i am. A college graduate with 6 years in the military and I cant find even a fucking entry level, $10 per hour help desk job. Every staffing company i have ever worked with have said the phrase ""ill send this to my manager and let you know"", but i NEVER hear anything from them.

Looking at postings, I find that a lot of data science / big data / machine learning jobs require advanced degrees in fields such as CS or statistics. I am wondering - **if I stop at a BA, can my experience down the road overshadow against the lack of higher degree? I am scared that I will be stuck in junior roles without an advanced degree.**

If I drop my classes next semester to focus on the internship, I will have to wait a full year before taking MA classes again because they are not available every semester. This won't be a problem if I'm offered an extension. But I'm fucked if they don't give me an extension. I also have a small startup that has a few potential clients, but the company is still in the valley of death. Chances are I won't return to studies full-time if I drop next semester. "

by James Buchanan

It seems as though the mainstream media has been imploding lately. First the entertainment industry had sexual harassment and/or assault stories involving Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey. Then more sex scandal stories exploded in politics and the mainstream media with Al Franken, John Conyers, Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose.

Long-time newsmen Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer have both been fired.

The Democrats are circling the wagons around Franken and Conyers desperately trying to not become a smaller political minority in the House and Senate. I predict the Democrats will use every excuse in the book to protect Franken’s seat in the Senate and no level of hypocrisy on women’s rights will be too big for them.

Meanwhile, the sex accusations against Roy Moore appear to have largely collapsed with 88 percent of people in a recent online poll saying that the accusations against Moore constitute a smear job by the Left. Recent polls show Moore pulling ahead of his opponent.

In the midst of all this media and political career carnage, Donald Trump dropped a Twitter bombshell on Joe Scarborough reminding the world of the extremely suspicious death of a female intern, who worked for him, when he was a Congressman before he began his career with MSNBC. Scarborough abruptly resigned from Congress two months after the intern’s death probably because he didn’t want any additional scrutiny focused on that scandal.

The more you look into the Scarborough-intern scandal, the worse it looks and the more obvious it becomes that someone was covering things up. The medical examiner, who wrote off the intern’s death as a heart attack, was found guilty of lying on official business on two other occasions. The intern was only 28 years old, ran marathons (making a heart condition extremely unlikely) and may have died the day before her “official” time of death so Scarborough could fake an alibi.

An article on Steemit reports “With recent attacks on President Donald Trump and accusations of threats of blackmail by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the daughter of the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission Zbigniew Brzezinski. Some information about Scarborough’s past has come to surface.”

“No matter what you believe about the exchange between Trump and the two MSNBC hosts the following information is more important than allegations of behavior between the two because it involves the death of a young intern Lori Klausutis and the subsequent cover up…”

“So how did Klausutis die then?”

“The official autopsy report stated her death was an ‘accident’ attributed to – ‘undiagnosed cardiac arrhythmia’ and due to this fact her 'breathing stopped she fell and hit her head, on an office desk and died,' Berkland said.”

Of course Scarborough might have been grabbing her, she fought back and suffered a fractured skull (noted below) that killed her. There is no evidence that Miss Klausutis ever had a heart condition except for the word of a corrupt medical examiner.

“…Scarborough himself told reporters that she had a ‘complicated medical history’ including ‘stroke and epilepsy.'”

“Which an immediate family member disputed and denied stating she had no prior ‘health conditions’ since she was a documented marathon runner who had recently run an 8K with a respectable time and she belonged to the Northwest Florida Track Club.”

So why would Scarborough lie about her medical history unless he had something major that he was covering up?!

The Steemit article continues “On August 29th, 2001, two Fort Walton Beach police officers Stephen Sequeira and crime scene expert Dusty Rhodes who witnessed the autopsy of Klausutis, said that her ‘skull had been fractured,’ reported NWFDailyNews.”

“But this was never taken into account in the final autopsy report, and Dr. Berkland stated knowledge of the injury was insignificant and was simply just from the cause of her fall.”

No one but a thoroughly crooked medical examiner would leave out a fractured skull in his final report.

A fractured skull should take an awful lot of force. Even if a young, healthy woman suddenly passed out (which seems very doubtful) it seems unlikely that she could fracture her skull even if she did fall onto a desk. The medical examiner probably knew this which is why he left it out.

Did Mr. Scarborough have any scratches on his face at the time? Enquiring minds would like to know.

The Steemit article continues “Would you trust without question the word of a Medical Examiner who lost his ME license in two separate states (Missouri and Florida) because he LIED about his autopsy work (for instance, saying he had autopsied some brains when he hadn’t)?”

An article on Heavy.com reports “A July 21, 2001 news report by the Naples Daily News explained the details of Klausutis’ death. Her body was found July 20 around 8 a.m. by a couple who arrived at the office in Fort Walton Beach for an appointment. She was found slumped over next to a desk on the floor of Scarborough’s office. A second employee who was normally at the office was away on vacation, and it was determined that she was dead for some time.”

There are two extremely important points here: First, Lori Klausutis may have been alone with Joe Scarborough in his office because the other employee was on vacation. Second, the intern had been dead for some time by 8am which suggests she may have been murdered the previous evening, which would allow Scarborough to book a last minute flight to D.C. so he could conjure up an alibi.

Perhaps Scarborough asked her to work late, tried to sexually assault her and she died from a fractured skull. Then a “Deep State clean up squad” covers up the death and pays off the crooked medical examiner so Joe Scarborough can start a new career as a fake news propagandist for MSNBC.

The Steemit article has one more jarring detail “On May 29, 2003, Scarborough appeared on Don Imus’s radio show where he made the shocking admission about killing his intern. While complimenting Scarborough on his sense of humor, Imus said, ‘Don’t be afraid to be funny, because you are funny. I asked you why you aren’t in Congress. You said that you had sex with the intern, and then you had to kill her.’ Scarborough laughed and replied, ‘Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?'”

“If true this is a tasteless ‘joke’ that had it been made today would have instantly gotten the attention of social media and ruined both men’s careers.”

I’m not so sure it was a joke. "

7gkgbc,1,2017-11-30,"LDR in a few months!! [F/21, M/21]",sy403,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/7gkgbc/ldr_in_a_few_months_f21_m21/,"My boyfriend (21) of 1.5 years and I (21) are currently in our last year of undergraduate studies. We met about 2 years ago in the dorms at school and started a relationship a couple months into being friends and hanging out within the same friend group. Our homes are in fact in the same state but we do live about 2.5 hours away from each other, when we are not at school so I’ve had to go some breaks without seeing him for weeks and weeks on end which was extremely hard for me. I remember the first summer break we spent apart, I was at my apartment at school for three months all alone taking courses and I never felt more upset in my life. I spent nights trying to not think about missing him but it felt endless and I had often caught myself crying. I know 2.5 hours isn’t so far compared to couples who live thousands of miles apart, but to me, I would consider it an LDR just because it’s not reasonable to drive back and forth 5 hours round trip every few days especially when I have a job to juggle as well. 

Well, the dreaded moment is just around the corner—college graduation. In approximately a little less than 6 months, we are graduating and we clearly have different plans. I’m studying Nutrition and already applied to and plan on attending a post-baccalaureate program in Arizona to become a dietitian. It has always been a dream of mine to settle out west of the country as I have spent my entire life here on the east coast. I’ve travelled out west plenty of times and find that the cultures and the environment there align greatly with my own and would love to start my life and career in a brand new setting that I actually want to be in. My boyfriend understands this completely and keeps encouraging me to go out to Arizona and he says that if he “had the choice to go there, he would.” He’s looking for chemical engineering jobs and has been applying everywhere but has not found any luck. He wants to find work in California but hasn’t heard back from companies he has applied to. However, at the moment, he is flexible to relocate anywhere if any company gives him an offer. 

Obviously, I’m not going to force him to come to Arizona with me because he needs to start his career too and I don’t want to hold him back because I know I would be upset with him if he told me I had to go wherever he went just to be with him, and therefore, compromise my own career. I don’t own him and I can’t be inconsiderate of his wishes. But he has been avoiding discussing what we are going to do about our relationship when time comes. I’ve tried bringing it up and he just seems so upset that he shrugs it off and says “I don’t know” or just brushes over it and changes the topic. I know deep down he’s hurting and he’s just in denial that I’m truly going to be leaving. But I can’t keep going on each day assuming that it’s one more day closer towards the end of our relationship. I don’t want the day of graduation to roll around and we both just assume that we’ll stick things out without much further discussion and communication. Before I applied to the program, I told him what I was thinking of doing and he laughed and said, “Well looks like I have to start finding jobs in Arizona now.” But, he said it in a jokingly manner that I don’t think he would be willing to come with me anyway. 

I’m not really sure what I should do because this program is going to last about one full school year plus maybe summer too, depending on how many courses that I still need to fulfill. Following the completion of the program, I have to do a one year unpaid internship where I have to do rotations in order to be able to sit for my exam and earn my credentials. I’m even considering getting my Master’s degree right after too. This means I’ll be away for nearly 4 years, if not, more. I know people are going to tell me that if he is someone I care deeply about and see a future with, then I don’t need to worry because despite the time and distance spent apart, we’ll eventually come back together in the end. Long distance wasn’t particularly difficult with only a 2.5 hour drive between us because at least I could arrange plans the night before or the day of to go see him and vice versa, but we’re going to be over 2,000 miles apart with a 3 hour time difference. It’s going to be relatively expensive traveling frequently to see each other so I know that when I go, we’ll only be seeing each other, maybe 4-5 times, at most, for the entire year. I know 4-5 times is better than none at all, but I get very anxious when I go long periods of time without seeing him. He is my best friend and my go-to for everything. It sounds silly but I need to physically be with him to feel safe and okay. I’m extremely worried that our relationship is going to go south when I have to go from seeing him nearly every single day at school to once every few months. I keep getting these unsettling thoughts like what if I end up meeting someone new at school and he does at his new work place? Or what if our feelings for each other start to fade because we don’t get that physical comfort that brings us closer together, any longer. 

I can’t stop thinking about it that tonight, I grew frustrated and stormed out of his apartment tearing up without saying a word. We were sitting on the couch eating dinner, perfectly fine, and out of nowhere, I was triggered by the thought of us fading apart. I’ve already decided that I’m going to go and pursue my education and career and start my life, but I truly want him to be alongside me on my journey. It just seems so lonesome to have to do this all on my own without my best friend/SO or anyone at all, for the matter, to be right beside me as a support system. I can’t imagine going on adventures, eating out and relaxing without him for a few years. I’m so worried and I don’t know what I should do to prepare for this. 

Any thoughts? "
7gkmjo,119,2017-11-30,burying this shameful opinion at 11 pm: i dont get why the twitter drama is such a big deal,podzilla,ChapoTrapHouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7gkmjo/burying_this_shameful_opinion_at_11_pm_i_dont_get/,"caveat: i have not yet plugged my cerebral cortex into that big tube running under the atlantic and have yet to merge my consciousness with the internet, so all of this twitter garbage seems really stupid to me. maybe it's actually important, or something. but i genuinely doubt it.

all of the accusations ive seen so far has been really... stupid? setting aside the fact that it's not actually people accusing them of anything, what the hell are people flailing about, what are people saying they need to castigate themselves over? 

[hitting on people with fewer twitter followers, are you fucking kidding me? that's a fucking capital offense now?](https://twitter.com/mmalloyboy/status/935984780142813184) gosh, i wonder why someone who's trans would prefer to talk to people online rather than in real life, but nope, we should ignore the lived experiences of someone who could easily get assaulted for trying to pick people up at a bar and just conform to some idiotic standard set by people who might not have met a trans person in their gosh-danged life. AND even if they were being mildly harassy, 1) it seems silly to shame someone and declare them a non-person for being flirty over DMs, and 2) the idea that there's a power imbalance because theyre hitting on people ""of &lt;1000 follower accounts"" is so fucking stupid it actually makes me mad. way to compare a boss forcing his intern to have sex with TWITTER FOLLOWER NUMBERS, you stupid fucking twit. yeah, lets lead a pitchfork mob against a trans person for having the stones to dare flirt with a cis white woman. thats extremely progressive and cool. [this hilariously idiotic] (https://twitter.com/GrunthusGrumpus/status/936058295978139648) gives weight to this idea; yeah how fucking DARE they try to have nice conversations with people about things in their lives!!! wtf!!! if youre the type of person who has panic attacks about basic human interaction- not any personal problems with socializing, but the idea that OTHER people might be socializing- then how the hell do you call yourself a socialist?

in fact, [this idiot's](https://twitter.com/mmalloyboy/status/935984780142813184) such a great example of how online highschool drama bullshit is completely counter-productive. his Discourse Collective cohost, marcus, sent a Wife Email and has kinda shitty attitudes towards his wife and the women he was having sex with in his polyamorous relationships. if we follow his callout culture logic, isnt @mmalloyboy responsible for enabling and enhancing predatory behavior? nope, zero self-reflection whatsoever, he can just go on calling other people out for whatever perceived slights he wants.

and for what? what the fuck does this accomplish? congrats, i guess, for speaking out of one side of your mouth and concern trolling about how dsa is ~problematic~ for being too full of straight white guys, and then kicking out a nonwhite trans person the second they step out of line. if actual, genuine stuff that seems actually sorta bad comes up, then yeah, pull that person aside and tell them to apologize to whom theyve hurt, and try to teach them to be a better person. isnt socialism about comradeship, about teaching people rather than shaming people, about building a coalition from all working class walks of life? isnt it very leftist to think that rape culture unknowingly indoctrinates a lot of people into believing that unhealthy behaviors are normal, and our job is to look at somebody before they were ""woke"" and have them learn what they did was wrong, instead of spitting in their face?

capitalism has, in its wisdom, commodified not just the physical world, but our emotional reactions to it. im sure ""callout culture"" began as some well-intentioned do-goodery, but now with twitter there's a material incentive to be more callout-y, to accrue followers and achieve social media status as a holier-than-thou figure, where the higher your follower number the better a person you are. if the person youre accusing has actually done bad shit, maybe you should bring that up, instead of this mealy-mouthed, half-brained shit that could only possibly appeal to those whose only access to social life is twitter.

in conclusion, man of steel is a good movie, japanese cuisine is overrated, and death grips suck"

What he’s saying doesn’t make sense. The words all do, sure, but it’s the meaning of it. You now belong to someone else?

Minutes ago, he rushed in the door and began to tell you that someone was going to publish his novel. His eyes were bright with the news that someone was going to help him achieve his life goal! This mysterious benefactor is even willing to pay your father a living wage while he edits and polishes it, which means he doesn’t have to rely on the slowly thinning customer base of his store. As the years have gone on, you’ve seen less and less of your father as he let go of employees one by one that he couldn’t afford to keep on. The stress and exhaustion has him looking 10 years older than he is.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.

As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."

I'm not sure which one to take since Uber would look great on my resume to all recruiters whereas IMC would look great to top tier recruiters but others might not have heard of it as it's a small proprietary trading firm. Uber is in SF which is where I want to end up but IMC is paying so much more.

Summers: Internship at big 4 tech company (no research).

Statement of purpose: Strong, with help from others.

Fellowships: Didn't apply in time for NSF (are there other good ones to apply for that it's not too late for?).


Do I even have a shot at top 4? How do I look for other programs (top 5-15)? Thanks everyone."

Hi guys!
We are doing a survey asking about companies responsiveness to internship applications!
We are raffling out FIVE $5 AMAZON GIFT CARDS. The more companies you enter, the more chances you have to win a gift card!
So as UMD Computer Science students who have been working hard to find internships, we have noticed that some companies are much better than others about responding to our applications. Because of this, we decided to design our Intro to Data Science final project around gathering data from students about how responsive different companies are during the application process. If you have been working hard like we have applying to jobs and you want to help us out, please respond to this survey. 

We'll publish our aggregate data so that everyone can see things like what the average GPA of a Facebook intern is, if any company is particularly bad at responding, or if their interview process is universally liked/hated, among other stuff. Help us find this stuff out!

I finally had an easier week so, as it was sunny and kind of warm day, after leaving my internship I decided to stop by an old haunt, the Middlesex Fells north of Boston. It had been removed from Squirt in the past year, so I wasn't sure if it was still getting traffic, but as soon as I go down the path, I see a younger guy duck behind the boarded up building and I know it's going to be a good cruise.

I don't have much time and the young guy seems nervous, so I go deeper into the woods. I see an older guy (mid-50s maybe) walking along one of the cruisy paths and I follow him. Sure enough, he starts leading me to one of the rocky hills near I-93 and we pass by a couple of other guys cruising. One of them, a nice looking daddy in his 40s starts to follow us on a parallel trail. The 50-something takes me all the way to the top and sits down. I approach and ask him, ""Looking for something?"" He seems a little nervous, maybe thinking I'm an undercover cop so he just says, ""Yeah"" but subtly tugs his dick. I tug mine through my jeans and ask, ""What do you like to do?"" ""I really want to suck some cock,"" he says. So I pull out my thick uc 6.5 incher and he starts giving me some amazing head near the edge of the hill, not very hidden at all. The 40ish daddy makes it up the hill and I motion for him to come over. He whips out a decent 5 inches and I start stroking him, but I think he wanted more so he buttoned up and left. By this point, a black guy who I had seen on the trails earlier also was on the hill, leaning against the fence and watching me get blown. The younger guy, now with a beer (maybe for the nerves) also comes up the hill. An aggressive 60-ish bear is the last to come up the hill and makes a beeline for the cocksucking just as I'm shooting my first string of cum, coating the 50-yo's throat. Man, that guy knew how to suck cock. ""Yeah, suck it down baby,"" said the bear. After getting my cock cleaned off, I button up, thank my cumdumpster and head down the hill just as a dog and his owner (unsure if he was there to cruise to) come bounding up. The younger guy follows me and we take a piss near each other but I'm now late for class so I give him a head nod and head to the parking lot. Hopefully I'll get to visit there again before it gets too cold."
7gnqz7,1,2017-11-30,Breakup with my best friend and NoContact is not an option,KeyCRACKer,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7gnqz7/breakup_with_my_best_friend_and_nocontact_is_not/,"Some might argue whether the following story can be classified as a breakup, but I really need advice from you guys.

It's about me [21/M] and my best friend [22/F] of four years. Our relationship as buddies has been a blast with our ups and downs. We have helped each other immensely during those years. I have never found another person like her in my life. Unfortunately, we fell in love with each other separately. Firstly, it was she after a year of acquaintance when I wasn't interested. Then it was me this year. It happened when she was already taken in a long-distance relationship that she wanted to pursue to live with in another country. Yes, the thought of her leaving made me attached to her even more and it escalated quickly.

We've crossed the 'friendly' line. We became lovers. I don't want to hear comments about her cheating: I already know how immoral and fucked up the situation was and have been beating myself up about it for a couple of months. She needed to go there for her internship, she wanted to break up with him, come back, and become my girlfriend.

Obviously, since I'm writing here, you might have already guessed that she arrived there and in a couple of weeks chose him. It has been the most painful experience in my life. Mental breakdowns kept on coming since August. I don't want to go into details of what happened during these four months, but we exchanged some harsh words and were on the brink of breaking contact.

Our friendship, though, still lingered. My hatred to her was gone, our romantic relationship has become a taboo topic. I cannot say anything about her feelings to her BF (she didn't tell him btw) because I'm probably the last to tell the truth. What I know is that she doesn't love me anymore. She can't explain why it happened and feels guilt for breaking my heart.

She came back in October, and we've met four times since then. In a few hours, she returns to that country to work as a volunteer and to live with her BF. She'll be gone for nine months which is the longest we've been apart. From August to October, I was recovering and wasn't over it, but was at least close. A few days ago, however, she had a birthday and farewell party, and the fact that this might be the last time I saw her completely ruined me.

---

So, question time. A lot of you would recommend me to go no contact. I think this is impossible. Even though we've grown colder to each other (especially she, for obvious reasons), we still help each other and text a lot, and I cannot afford to lose her as a friend. However, she will be pretty far away, and maybe that will help? **Have someone been in a similar situation? How do I approach this? Is there a milder version of NoContact?**

Lately, I cannot get rid of the feeling that I will never find anyone like her or better than her which is a pretty common symptom. However, she was my first 'girlfriend'. No other girl has been interested in me, let alone loved me or wanted me the way she did. I think about her all the time, even when I work out or wait for a bus. I make up scenarios in my mind, both positive and negative. Maybe she'll come back earlier and magically everything will fall into place for us again, maybe she'll come back in nine months as a married woman or at least plan to marry him. Or she'll find another one... **How do I stop hoping and waiting for her?**

It is a shitty situation to be in. My rational part knows that there are way better girls out there, that I'll fall in love once again. But like I said, I'm not a catch, my self-esteem dropped even more after I'd lost to that guy, and it is depressing to watch someone you love stop loving you just like that. I don't stand still, I am a part of a new social circle, joined a quiz club, haven't made any good friends yet, but I'm trying. I actually found a pretty girl and asked her out - turned out she has a boyfriend (who is also a foreigner, are you actually kidding me). But everything keeps me going back to my best friend. I truly love her and firmly believe in her irreplaceablility.

What is especially sad is that there are two types of days for me right now. One day I think about her coming back to me; another day I think about how she used me. I don't even know if that's the case. But even if she did, it was so fucking natural. She called me from the plane crying, telling she loved me, and in a couple of hours I lost her for good. Man, still not over it.

Thank you for reading. Any kind of advice would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR**: Fell in love with my best friend, had a heart-breaking experience, cannot go NoContact because we are still really good friends, might never see her again, but still harbour romantic feelings to her."

I really can't tell if I hate my job, if I'm burnt out from working, and/or being a programmer isn't for me.


Things that are tiring me out:


* 2+ hours of commute a day
* Long, 9.5 hour days (9/80 schedule, government job)
* No co-workers to mesh with. Everyone else is 45-50+ years old. I feel like everyone's kid, and I get a strong vibe that a lot of the old timers aren't fond of me even though I try to be as nice as possible. At my previous place, I was a helpdesk intern. My co-workers were only in their 30's, and they became some of my best friends and it made work WAY more bearable.
* Underpaid at $58k in LA, but at this point my confidence is so low that I feel like I'm not worth more
* Work is mostly conversions, so working with old technologies (COBOL, PowerBuilder, ColdFusion...)


When I was going to school, I was very interested in programming. I'd browse /r/cscareerquestions, /r/learnprogramming all day for years. I was obsessed with being a great programmer since high school.


Now, I avoid looking these subreddits like the plague. Anything that reminds me of work just makes me depressed. I don't even know what was appealing about programming as a career to me, looking back. 


I dread work so much that I have been coming in 30-60 mins late everyday now for the past 4-5 months. When I started, I was always on time and a great worker. I worked hard. If I didn't have anything on my plate, I would ask my boss for more. Now, after I completed my first project, I'm lazy as fuck and have no motivation. It's not like I get yelled at or micromanaged or anything. I just feel like I'm wasting away and just don't want to be at work. I'm scared that 20 years pass by like this, just living for the weekends, retire for a few years then die. 

What are some signs that this isn't the right career, or if my workplace just sucks?

She showers every day, and is always super neat about her appearance. She loves to dress up fancy, do her hair, etc.; you could never tell how her home is.

I'm a neat guy. Not excessively, but neat. I can't live in a filthy environment. It irritates me, and clutters my mind. As soon as we moved in, she began tossing her crap everywhere. She NEVER does the dishes. Every day I come home from work and have to clean for several hours. She doesn't lift a finger. We fought about it several times, especially the dishes...she keeps them in the sink until they're spilling over, rotting, and bacteria everywhere. Same thing with the counters and stove. Right now as I write this, there is 2-week old shrimp juices all over, with 3 hours worth of dishes. She told me ""don't like it, do it"". We talked so many times about not piling up. What could be simpler than washing a dish right after you use it?! After coming home today, I walk into a place which smells like rotting dumpster, along with used tissues all over the floor.

There's something even worse. She has a cat (I love cats too), who she is completely insane over. She used up our second bedroom to sleep with him every other night because ""my son needs to sleep with his mother, he has anxiety"". I am severely allergic to the cat, and she at first was demanding he sleep with us every night. I kept telling her, I can die from this. I get allergic asthma to cat urine (which he is covered in from his weight and inability to clean himself). After several fights and me having an asthma attack, she put him out of the bedroom. Then, decided to order a mattress and sleep every other night with him. She even has breakfast ""with the cat"" every morning. Our second bedroom is DESTROYED. This bedroom we were supposed to use for recreational activities. She spends most of her time in that bedroom, which I can't even enter because of how dirty it is and how it reeks. A kitty litter box next to her bed. She put litter boxes all over the house even though I'm super allergic...she doesn't get it. When you walk in, all you smell is rotting food, garbage, and kitty litter. Of course, I have allergies every day and I wake up with migraines, wheezing, etc. and have been doing that for 5 months. The cat has diarrhea almost daily and drags his butt across the floor, and tells me to ""leave him alone let him drag his butt! HE HAS ANXIETY LET HIM USE THE BATHROOM IN PEACE!"". Then she barely cleans it up. BARELY. She just rubs it into the floor.

I don't know what to do. I mean, I'm moving out next month across country to my parents' house to finish up my final semester of college (I was on an internship now). She is staying here for grad school for a few years. I love her so much, we are compatible in every other way except living together. I can't adapt to her filthy lifestyle. Besides that, we are so happy together as a couple...just not a live-in couple. I don't know. All I'm asking is for her to be NORMAL. Not a clean freak. I don't want to break up with her; I love her company, her personality, her intelligence. Her lifestyle does not match mine. It hurts my heart to move so far away and see each other once a month or so, because of how used to her I am. I love coming home to her every day. Advice, guys?

Also she says if I don't respect how she feels about her cat ""then she doesn't know what to tell me"" and that if I ""give her an ultimatum, if it's you or the cat, it won't be pretty"". I'm sick and tired.

**TLDR** Girlfriend leads a filthy lifestyle and prioritizes her ""son"" the cat over my needs. I love her so much but I can't live like this

I have read many posts on Reddit on how the job market for Chemical Engineers is struggling right now, but I chose to not believe them and be optimistic. As the time goes on, my optimism is slowly fading away. Should I consider going to Grad School for a different degree, Computer Science, or just keep applying for jobs until I hit something? P.S.

&gt;25.04.2016

&gt;Im Kernkraftwerk Gundremmingen ist im Rahmen revisionsvorbereitender Prüfarbeiten in Block B so genannte Büro-Schadsoftware gefunden worden. Diese Software ist in der Fachwelt bereits einige Jahre bekannt; sie zielt unter anderem darauf ab, eine ungewollte Verbindung zum Internet herzustellen. 

&gt;Die im Kraftwerk an technischen Komponenten eingesetzten Rechner, die für die Steuerung der Anlage genutzt werden, sind nicht mit dem Internet verbunden. Die gefundene Schadsoftware kann zudem keine Veränderungen an technischen Steuerungen bewirken. Alle sensiblen Kraftwerksbereiche sind entkoppelt und grundsätzlich redundant sowie manipulationsgeschützt ausgelegt. Das betroffene IT-System, das 2008 zur Datenverarbeitung und -visualisierung nachgerüstet wurde, gehört zur Brennelement-Lademaschine. Einen Einfluss auf die Steuerung der Lademaschine konnte es aufgrund der Systemarchitektur nicht geben. 

&gt;Die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde und das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) wurden informiert. Die Aufklärung erfolgt mit Unterstützung durch IT-Fachleute des RWE-Konzerns. Im Kraftwerk sind zwischenzeitlich alle weiteren sicherheitstechnisch wichtigen IT-Systeme ohne Befund überprüft worden. Bei einer am 24.04.2016 abgeschlossenen Prüfung von Wechseldatenträgern und Programmiergeräten gefundene Schadsoftware wurde erkannt und bereinigt. Die Vorkehrungen zur IT-Sicherheit sind ausgeweitet worden. 

&gt;Das Vorkommnis wurde gemäß den deutschen Meldekriterien in die Kategorie N (Normal) eingestuft. Nach der internationalen Skala zur Bewertung von Vorkommnissen (INES) ist es der Stufe 0 zuzuordnen (unterhalb der Skala, keine oder sehr geringe sicherheitstechnische Bedeutung). Eine Gefährdung des Personals, der Umgebung oder der Anlage war damit nicht verbunden. 

&gt;Aktualisierung 16.12.2016: 

&gt;Untersuchungen zu Schadsoftware-Fund abgeschlossen – Schutzmaßnahmen optimiert 

&gt;Die mit Unterstützung von IT-Fachleuten des RWE-Konzerns durchgeführten IT-forensischen Untersuchungen nach einem Fund von Büro-Schadsoftware im April 2016 sind abgeschlossen. Als Konsequenz aus dem Ereignis wurden die Schutzmaßnahmen gegen das Eindringen von Schadsoftware optimiert und massiv verschärft. 

&gt;Die Erstinfektion mit der Büro-Schadsoftware erfolgte über einen Laptop der Ausbildungsabteilung, der u. a. auch für Präsentationen bei Ausbildungsmessen eingesetzt wurde. Der installierte Virenscanner wurde nicht aktuell gehalten, da das Gerät weder für den Einsatz im Internet vorgesehen, noch mit der Kraftwerks-IT verbunden war. Die Schadsoftware wurde über einen infizierten externen USB-Wechseldatenträger auf den Laptop übertragen. 

&gt;Im zweiten Schritt wurden zu Ausbildungszwecken Daten zwischen einem Rechner aus dem Werkstattbereich des Betriebsgeländes des Kraftwerks und dem Rechner der Ausbildungsabteilung übertragen. Die Übertragung erfolgte mit Hilfe eines weiteren eingesetzten USB-Wechseldatenträgers. Die Infektion des Visualisierungsrechners der Brennelementlademaschine von Block B erfolgte schließlich über einen weiteren Wechseldatenträger, der zuvor durch den Rechner aus dem Werkstattbereich infiziert worden war. Hierbei wurden existierende Betriebsvorschriften (Virenscan von eingesetzten USB-Wechseldatenträgern) nicht beachtet. 

&gt;Die Sicherheit der Brennelemente-Handhabung war zu keiner Zeit gefährdet. Zur Programmierung von digitalen Steuerungen im Kraftwerk verwendete Rechner haben auch künftig keine Verbindung zum Internet oder zum Firmennetzwerk. 

&gt;Die für die sichere Reaktorsteuerung verwendeten Systeme sind mit analoger Leittechnik ausgestattet und können durch Schadsoftware generell nicht beeinflusst werden. 

&gt;Als Konsequenz wurden an allen RWE-Kernkraftwerksstandorten die Schutzmaßnahmen gegen das Einbringen von Schadsoftware noch weiter verschärft. Insbesondere der Zugang mit Rechnern und Wechseldatenträgern zu den Kraftwerken wurde enger reglementiert, der Umgang mit USB-Wechseldatenträgern innerhalb der Kraftwerke völlig neu geregelt. So sind Kraftwerkstechnik und Kraftwerks-IT, gestuft nach der jeweiligen sicherheitstechnischen Bedeutung, nun in Zonen aufgeteilt. In diesen dürfen nur noch neu beschaffte, intern kodierte und system- oder personenbezogene USB-Wechseldatenträger zum Einsatz kommen. Die USB-Wechseldatenträger sind vor Drittzugriff geschützt."

From there it just went downhill. She had her head on my shoulder when an intern half her age asked her for a dance. She obliged. The lights had dimmed by then and there were too many people on the dance floor so I couldn't make out where Rose was. Though the thought of her being a naught hotwife sure got my juices flowing. On our way home, I placed her hand on my cock. She opened her eyes to smile at me. Then she slowly started to stroke my cock. I knew then I would be getting lucky tonight.

Rose enjoys talking about her exhibitionist fantasies during sex. I often ask her what she would do if the men wanted more. Keyword: Men, not man. She gets incredibly turned on whenever I mention threesomes. It is a fantasy that we have never acted upon.

As soon as we reached home, I took her straight to our bedroom. The clothes came off quickly. I knew the playbook so I asked if she would ever let the intern see her naked. She smiled mischievously and said she wouldn't mind it. I asked her what if the intern tells his friends and they want a peek? Rose answered she wouldn't mind playing with the boys. It wasn't long before I was balls deep inside her and she was moaning. I could tell she was really turned on so I took the opportunity to ask her what if the interns wanted to do what I was doing to her right now. Rose went, ""Ughh... honey, I could ""play"" with the boys if you are okay with it. I have done it before."" This was VERY intriguing. I asked her when was the last time she played with the ""boys""? Rose was insanely wet by now and was moaning loudly. She didn't answer so I asked her a few more times. I knew she was getting close to her orgasm. This is usually when she gets bolder so I asked her one last time. This time she fessed up.

Rose and I were friends for years before we started dating. We had a lot of mutual friends so we were always hanging out. Since both of us lived in the student housing, we would often share a cab home. Toward the end of our sophomore year, we attended an off campus party at a frat house. Rose was getting a lot of attention and encouragement from a group of seniors that I didn't get along with: Kevin, Don and Josh. The trio had Rose squished between them on the couch. I couldn't hear what they were talking about but she was giggling. I tried to extract Rose by going up to her and telling her that I'm catching a cab home because it was getting really late. Kevin shot back saying Rose was having a great time so she should stay. Don chimed in saying I can leave if I wished. Josh mumbled to Rose something about me being controlling which wasn't true. In her stupor, Rose sided with the boys and told me she would catch a ride with the boys. Seeing that my attempt had failed, I had no other option but to leave the party even though I didn't want to. I would text Rose like a mad man the whole night but she her response wouldn't arrive until afternoon the next day.

I heard rumors about what had gone down after I left. The trio had Rose dancing with them all night. Sometime during the night the trio took Rose upstairs to a bedroom. This is where the rumors become fuzzy. A close friend told me he saw Rose and Kevin going into the bedroom but a female friend informed me it was all three boys. I always put her version of the story down to jealousy between the girls. This changed last night when Rose confessed. Of course, we weren't dating back then so she didn't cheat on me or anything but the thought of her with three boys is sure to spice up our life.

My question to r/Cuckold is, how do I tell Rose that I have a Cuckold fantasy?"

7goptj,11,2017-11-30,A look at possible future additions to Monument Park,Constant_Gardner11,NYYankees,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/7goptj/a_look_at_possible_future_additions_to_monument/,"Monument Park has enshrined 37 distinguished members of the Yankee organization from throughout the team's 117-year history. The outdoor museum contains 5 catchers (Thurman Munson, Bill Dickey, Jorge Posada, Elston Howard, Yogi Berra), 3 first basemen (Lou Gehrig, Don Mattingly, Tino Martinez), 1 second baseman (Willie Randolph), 2 shortstops (Derek Jeter, Phil Rizzuto), 7 outfielders (Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson, Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams), 9 pitchers (Lefty Gomez, Whitey Ford, Allie Reynolds, Ron Guidry, Red Ruffing, Mariano Rivera, Goose Gossage, Andy Pettitte, Mel Stottlemyre), 2 broadcasters/PAs (Mel Allen, Bob Sheppard), 1 general manager (Ed Barrow), 5 managers (Miller Huggins, Billy Martin, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel, Joe Torre), and 2 owners (Jacob Ruppert, George Steinbrenner). Jackie Robinson is also recognized in the park for his contributions to the game.   

Monument Park is big, but the Yankees have a long and successful history with thousands of talented players. Lots of players to recognize! And the park gets even bigger when you add…. not-so-legendary-but-fan-favorites like Tino Martinez. Today I decided to look at some great Yankees who (so far) have not been added to Monument Park.   

#HANK BAUER  

* With the Yankees: 1406 games, .277/.347/.444 (.791 OPS, 115 OPS+) with 158 HR, 654 RBI, 792 R, 48 SB, 26.6 WAR, 3 x All Star, 7 x World Series champion  

Bauer spent 12 years roaming the outfield for the Yankees and was a key part of **SEVEN** World Series championship teams. His bases-loaded triple on October 10, 1951 sealed the World Series for the Yankees. He also had a 17-game World Series hitting streak, an all-time postseason record matched later by Derek Jeter. Before baseball, Bauer served in WWII in the US Marine Corps, earning 11 campaign ribbons, 2 Bronze Stars, and 2 Purple Hearts for being wounded in action.   

#ROBINSON CANO  

* With the Yankees: 1374 games, .309/.355/.504 (.860 OPS, 126 OPS+) with 1649 H, 204 HR, 607 XBH, 822 RBI, 799 R, 38 SB, 45.3 WAR, 5 x All Star, 5 x Silver Slugger, 2 x Gold Glove, 1 x World Series champion.  

No, not yet obviously. But in the future, Robbie’s gotta get strong consideration for Monument Park. He’s one of the team’s [3 best second basemen ever](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/8f8U7) and is one of [17 Yankees](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/YYKOZ) to hit 200+ HR with the team (and the only second baseman to do it). During his 4-year peak (2010-2013) with the Yankees, Cano **averaged** .312/.373/.533 (.906 OPS, 142 OPS+) with 29 HR, 76 XBH, 107 RBI, 98 R, and 7.5 WAR. Holy cow.  

#BRIAN CASHMAN   

Like the guy above, no not yet. But during Cashman’s tenure as Yankees general manager, the Yankees have won 6 American League pennants and 4 World Series championships (with more on the way?). Cashman has been with the Yankees organization since 1986 when he was hired on as an intern, working in minor-league scouting during the day and security at night. From there he worked his way up to one of the most powerful figures in franchise history. In addition to working landscape-altering trades and free agent signings, Cashman has rebuilt the Yankees farm system from barren due to low draft picks (just four years ago) to one of the best in the game.  

#CHARLIE KELLER  

* With the Yankees: 1066 games, .286/.410/.518 (.928 OPS, 152 OPS+) with 184 HR, 1053 H, 723 RBI, 712 R, 784 BB, 45 SB, 41.8 WAR, 5 x All Star, 3 x World Series champion  

Charlie “King Kong” Keller was a powerful left fielder and all-around excellent athlete for the Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s. He missed out on his 1944 season (age 27) and part of his 1945 season due to military service. Along with Lou Gehrig and Tommy Heinrich, Keller formed one of the best-hitting outfield in baseball history. Keller had an insane .410 career OBP and hit .306/.367/.611 (.978 OPS) over 19 World Series games. Overall, Keller was arguably one of the [20 best hitting outfielders in baseball history](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/i1rJU).   

#TONY LAZZERI  

* With the Yankees: 1659 games, .293/.379/.467 (.847 OPS, 120 OPS+) with 169 HR, 1784 H, 952 R, 1157 RBI, 147 SB, 49.9 WAR, 1 x All Star (AS Game was only a thing for half his career), 5 x World Series champion, member of the MLB Hall of Fame  

Lazzeri was a member of the “Murderers’ Row” Yankee lineup of the late 1920s, though he was overshadowed by teammates Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio. Still, Lazzeri is considered one of the best hitting second basemen of his era (20s-30s) and was a FIVE TIME World Series champion with 4 World Series home runs. He remains the only player in baseball history to hit a natural cycle (single, double, triple, home run in that order) with the final home run being a grand slam.   

#BOBBY MURCER  

* With the Yankees: 1256 games, .278/.349/.453 (.802 OPS, 129 OPS+) with 175 HR, 1231 H, 641 R, 687 RBI, 491 BB, 74 SB, 27.6 WAR, 4 x All Star  

Hyped as the “next Mickey Mantle,” Murcer never lived up to those expectations, though he did become one of the team’s most popular players of the era. After his playing days, Murcer became assistant GM in 1985 and a Yankees coach in the late 80s. He was also a sportscaster for the Yankees for most of two decades. All told, Murcer spent around 50 years working in and around the Yankees organization.  

#MIKE MUSSINA  

* With the Yankees: 249 games, 1553 IP, 318 BB/1278 K, 3.88 ERA/3.50 FIP, 114 ERA+, 35.1 WAR, 3 x Gold Glove  

MOOOOSE. While he was better with the Orioles, Mussina had a fantastic Yankee career over 8 seasons. His best year came in 2001 when he put up 228.2 IP, 42 BB, 214 K, 143 ERA+ and 7.1 WAR. He was also excellent in his Yankees postseason career, with a 3.80 ERA and 22 BB/92 K in 97 IP. A shame he never won a World Series, because he truly was one of the best October performers of his era. Moose rode off into the sunset after a fabulous final season (200.1 IP, 133 ERA+, 5.2 WAR).   

#GRAIG NETTLES  

* With the Yankees: 1535 games, .253/.329/.433 (.762 OPS, 114 OPS+) with 250 HR, 472 XBH, 750 R, 834 RBI, 18 SB, 44.3 WAR, 5 x All Star, 2 x Gold Glove, 2 x World Series champion, 1 x ALCS MVP  

On top of being one of the greatest defensive third basemen of all time, he holds the American League record for career home runs by a third baseman (though Adrian Beltre will likely [break that record](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/NAi2q) in 2018). Nettles is one of 12 Yankee position players ever to put up an 8-WAR season, which he did in 1976. During his four-year peak (1975-1978), Nettles averaged .263/.332/.465 (.797 OPS, 125 OPS+) with 29 HR, 96 RBI, 85 R, 60 BB, and 6.0 WAR. Nettles was also Yankees captain from 1982 to 1984.   

#ALEX RODRIGUEZ  

* With the Yankees: 1509 games, .283/.378/.523 (.900 OPS, 136 OPS+) with 351 HR, 1580 H, 1012 R, 1096 RBI, 152 SB, 54.2 WAR, 2 x MVP, 7 x All Star, 3 x Silver Slugger, 1 x World Series champion  

Easily the [best third baseman](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/b88TB) in franchise history and arguable one of the [10 best position players](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/9SOMV) in franchise history, A-Rod’s time in New York was both successful and [plagued with scandal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/01/11/alex-rodriguez-suspended-162-games/1586466/). But scandal (Steinbrenner) and PED-usage (Pettitte) haven’t kept other players out of Monument Park, and A-Rod’s contributions to the organization are hard to ignore, even if it got rough at the end of his contract. Can’t forget A-Rod helping to carry the team to a World Series title in 2009, going 19-52 (.365) with 6 HR, 11 XBH, 18 RBI, 15 R, and 2 SB that postseason.   

#BOB SHAWKEY  

* With the Yankees: 415 games, 2488.2 IP, 855 BB/1163 K, 3.12 ERA/3.44 FIP, 117 ERA+, 42.8 WAR, 1 x World Series champion, managed the 1930 Yankees  

Shawkey pitched 13 years for the Yankees, averaging around 250 IP per year in the early 1920s. After a brief stint with the US Navy during World War 1, Shawkey joined the Yankees organization and remained there in some capacity from 1915 to around 1931. In 1919, he struck out 15 batters in a game, a Yankee record that would last for about six decades (broken by Whitey Ford).   
 
#GEORGE WEISS  

Weiss was one of baseball’s most successful minor league directors and GMs in history and was inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame in 1971. While he was the Yankees head of player development from 1932 to 1947, the Yankees won 9 AL pennants and 8 World Series championships. While he was the Yankees general manager from 1947 to 1960, the Yankees won 10 AL pennants and 7 World Series championships. Weiss (and others) helped stack the 1930-1960 Yankee teams with some of the game’s greatest icons, such as Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, and Yogi Berra.  

#ROY WHITE  

* With the Yankees: 1881 games, .271/.360/.404 (.764 OPS, 121 OPS+) with 160 HR, 1803 H, 964 R, 758 RBI, 233 SB, 46.7 WAR, 2 x All Star, 2 x World Series champion  

White, a leftfielder, played his entire 15-year MLB career with the Yankees, before going to Japan to play for the Yomiuri Giants in the early 80s. Now, I’m biased toward underappreciated Yankee left fielders, but I seriously do think White has a legitimate case for Monument Park. Not only was he a career Yankee and multiple-time World Series champion, his offense (for the era) was on par with Paul O’Neill’s 125 OPS+ with New York. White also stepped up in the playoffs, hitting .278/.387/.430 (.817 OPS) in 25 playoff games. And the list of Yankees with 150+ HR/200+ SB is [very, very short](https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/psRqa).   

#DAVE WINFIELD  

* With the Yankees: 1172 games, .290/.356/.495 (.851 OPS, 134 OPS+) with 205 HR, 476 XBH, 1300 H, 818 RBI, 722 R, 76 SB, 26.9 WAR, 8 x All Star, 5 x Silver Slugger, 5 x Gold Glove, member of the MLB Hall of Fame  

Ah Dave. If he had played on better Yankee teams (and played better in October), he would be far more appreciated. As it is, he’s a member of the MLB Hall of Fame (inducted in 2001). During his four-year peak with the Yankees (1981-1984), Winfield averaged .300/.357/.517 (.874 OPS, 144 OPS+) with 25 HR, 57 XBH, 98 RBI, 85 R, 50 BB, and 3.4 WAR. While George Steinbrenner’s feuds with Winfield often took the public spotlight, Winfield was one of the Yankees’ best players during the tough 1980s.

7gow63,8,2017-11-30,Frustrated with my university,hillenburg,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/7gow63/frustrated_with_my_university/,"Believe me when I say this. Never ever study in the southern states of India. The quality of education is not worth the sacrifice of your freedom. 


I am a 21 years old man. But here are some of the rules that I need to follow to ensure my 'safety'.

* You should be within the campus by 6 PM.
* You should be in the hostel by 9 PM.
* You want to go out on weekends? Let the warden speak to your parents and make sure they are okay with it.
* Same goes for going home for vacations.

Last night, everything crossed limits. I applied for an internship via the university. At first, it was all well and good, as my application was sent to an organization, let's call it ABC. I was looking forward to working at ABC as its aim aligns with my ideas. However, at the end, I was informed that I got an internship at some other organization, XYZ.

Now, XYZ is a good place to work. However, I will not be able to work in the field I like over there. Moreover, the university did not inform me about rejection from ABC and the forwarding of my application to XYZ. 

When I spoke with the officials, stating the same point, they relentlessly told me that it's not their fault that I am going to XYZ, and that they will ensure I intern there, so that the university's reputation is not hampered. They are even willing to stop my degree to make sure I intern at XYZ.

My university is willing to waste my time, waste my potential and my future prospects just to ensure that its reputation is maintained.

I am sick and tired of my university."

Last night I finally had the courage to stand up to my partner and say enough is enough, no more abuse, I'm leaving. Tonight is the last night I can stay at my ex's. We were homeless together for 3 months, the entire span we each worked a part time job. Between the stress of homelessness, mental health struggles, and the increasing toxicity in my relationship, it took us almost 3 months to secure a room to rent. 

We both agree he is to stay at this apartment and I will find a place. Rent for the month of Dec is due tomorrow (the 1st). Initially he said he'd charge me $12/day starting Dec 1 to stay at the house until I can find a place. I realized he said that to provoke an emotional reaction in me. He wanted me soothing his ego and apologizing needlessly as I normally do. He wanted me to say once again that of course I was in the wrong and I need to change my selfish ways and give him the kind of love he deserves. When I stated I need space, he then demanded I be out by midnight tonight. I pointed out I would simply ask our roommate to spend 1 more night in the house as a guest. So he conceded to letting me sleep there tonight.

This break up and crossroads is yet another opportunity for me to prioritize my needs in a creative and synergistic way. I'm striving to take life up on this challenge with faith and curiosity. I'm done identifying with victimhood

I stayed at a women's shelter for a night last week and that is my very last resort.

** I have a plan for figuring out longer-term housing: apply to housesitting and petsitting/home stay dog training positions, look into work exchanges with locals and retreat centers, possibly get back into traveling and work exchanging on farms, or other internships. 

What I'm struggling with, is determining how to buy myself enough time to enable this transition to be as loving, focused, and fluid as possible.

I have been living paycheck to paycheck, and per month make not double what 1 month's cheapest rent around here would cost. I currently have about 20$ and will be paid in 1 week. I don't have anyone to borrow money from. I need help coming up with ways to create additional income asap.

Love to all you out there going through a similar struggle. We got this!!"
7gpjkj,45,2017-11-30,A decade and a half with the fundies™,longhaireddegenerate,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/7gpjkj/a_decade_and_a_half_with_the_fundies/,"Where do we start with this? Longtime lurker, first time (alt) poster.

I grew up in a fundamentalist christian household and my parents reached peak emotional maturity when I was a toddler. Dad was a pastor and mom was a certified K-12 teacher. Dad moved all over the country as a kid to accomodate *his* minister father, and mom had to grow up with grandma (likely a narcissist and probably a whole other post all by herself.) Both dad and mom had transformative ""come to Jesus"" moments in their late adolescence. Dad was a sort of blue-collar jack of all trades that liked Black Sabbath and once worked as a horse wrangler and mom was an artsy girl that wore all black and hung out with the creative crowd. Dad apparently had been struggling with his faith and pulled over to the side of the road one night, tears streaming down his face, and dedicated his life to god. I have no idea what the impetus was behind this, but it was apparently a very significant part of his life. Mom had someone react badly to her all-black outfits and realized she was, in her words, dressing like a witch. Weirldy, I like Black Sabbath and enjoy wearing black.

They got married largely to escape their respective shitty households, went to bible college, and then had me shortly before dad got his first preaching gig. They both fell under the thrall of Francis Schaeffer, a beatnik-looking fundie theologian that advocated for traditional christianity over the so-called modernization of the church. A few years later, Schaeffer and his son made a film called ""Whatever Happened to the Human Race?"", which was instrumental in evangelizing the pro-life movement to protestant christians. If you're of a certain age and grew up in christian fundamentalism, you probably had to watch this in church. It was horrifying.

Fundamentalists like my parents believe that one must lovingly break the will of a child in order to mold them into acceptable humans. This isn't hyperbole: I've heard mom use that exact phrasing when giving other parents advice. This means harsh discipline and complete obedience to authority. They believe that they have ultimate control over my life, and react badly to scenarios where I withhold information or operate outside their parameters. Their go-to strategy has been to use guilt and bullying to maneuver me back into an obedient state where I can be loved again. They adopted this position after it became impossible for them to physically discipline me.

It meant being hauled out of church for fidgeting and disciplined with an object (usually a hairbrush.) It meant that while that punishment is being administered, the child is not allowed to resist, cry loudly, or be sullen afterwards. Those sorts of behaviors lead to increased punishment. When I got older and it was more awkward to pull me out of church for discipline, mom would twist my ear and hiss threats into it. At home, it meant being disciplined with an open hand, the wooden spoon, or occasionally a belt. My mom was unpredictable and frightening when she disciplined me. She would scream, thrash at me, and sometimes shake me. I very clearly remember being in a crib for a nap and making noises: mom came in and cracked the spoon so hard on the crib that it broke in half. I've brought this up with her a few times and she either tells me I'm mis-remembering or tells me that the spoon was old and ready to fall apart anyway.

Dad tried to be more formal about the proceedings and would spend time telling me why I was wrong, what he was going to do, and how much he loved me afterwards. He also had the famous 1-2-3 warning system that a lot of parents from that era used, but would frequently just inform me that I was ""already on 2"" and then discipline me if I didn't immediately stop. I remember getting frustrated with a violin piece I was trying to learn one day. I got so mad I broke my bow across my music stand and swore. Dad pulled me into his office, went through the usual schtick, and then told me to be glad he'd found me before mom.

I can remember one situation where dad actively stood up for me. We were in Israel for a massive holy-shit-we're-where-the-bible-happened tour, and mom spent the first half screaming at me. It hit its worst point while we were staying at a kibbutz: mom screamed at me about my awful attitude (I would have been about 14 at the time so it's understandable, but I don't know what I did to set her off), and dad told her that she needed to deal with her attitude first. I walked out of the room and hid out in the courtyard until dad came out and told me the coast was clear. She was better after that. I have no idea what he told her, but the remainder of the trip was much better as a result.

My parents made the decision early-on to homeschool me. They'd both had awful high school experiences and saw the whole public school system as a corrupting influence. I didn't have many friends growing up: the church dad pastored was tiny, and most people with kids left for larger churches with better sunday school and youth group programs. I couldn't really make school friends, except occasionally when all the home schoolers came together for group activities and field trips. My social sphere was, by and large, my parents and my grandparents for most of my childhood.

We used Bob Jones' books for day to day school work. Bob Jones University very famously resisted integration into the 80s, so its depiction of literature and history and science was incredibly skewed. Even the math books had little bible cartoons and bible verses to memorize, next to examples of lowest common denominator factoring and long division. I hated Bob Jones. Later, I found out just how little I'd actually learned from them, and how much of *that* was wrong.

I was allowed outside interests, but they were watched sharply to make sure I wasn't Putting Them Before God(TM). Mom especially would either belittle my hobbies or harrangue me until I was embarrassed enough to give them up. Things relaxed when I got into my adolescence, but only just.

I went to public high school for my final year of school: it was easier than a GED, and my mom's teaching certificate meant that we could transfer most of the credits she'd awarded me to the public school system. I kept my head down, didn't make friends, and tried to be as invisible as possible. I was younger than normal for a high school senior, so when I told my parents that I wanted to go to college in a rough mining town three hours away, they were initially horrified. I secretly wanted to just be away from the family and start figuring out who I actually was. I had this weird fantasy about going and playing with computers all day, and then coming home and making french bread pizza in the toaster oven and generally just having my own tiny life somewhere. The family had already decided that I'd become a pharmacist because it was good, safe work with a lot of demand.

I wanted to be a programmer based on a lot of early experiments with BASIC on the family computer. My aunt actually drove a lot of my early interest in technology, and gave me a bunch of books on robots and programming. The parents decided that there was no future in computer science (LOL) and pushed me into an engineering degree.

We were informed when I went to tour the school that I wouldn't be allowed to live on-campus; mom's eyes lit up. She asked if maybe she and I could live in off-campus housing for nontrad students and students with families. I ended up living with her for two years and our relationship degraded substantially. We've tried to patch it up a few times, but it always deteriorates again. Mom's basic reaction to any kind of disobedience or display of initiative is to scream, guilt trip, enforce Mandatory Bible Time(TM), and eventually apologize and give me some kind of gift. I spent my first two years of college under a magnifying glass, unable to date or even have friends on campus. Dad stayed home and split his time between the church and a series of janitorial jobs.

When I turned 18, dad and mom moved out of the country because of a job opportunity. This is where things started to get really bad. I was expected to call them (and my grandparents) multiple times a day and give status updates. I'd come home to angry voicemails if I wasn't available when they called. I was pulling a massive credit load for two degrees and would frequently just stay up all night studying. I started smoking (STILL DO!) and drinking massive amounts of caffeine to get through the week. I caught mono and spent an entire summer either going to summer classes, working, or laying on the floor. Mom came up, managed to find out that my downstairs neighbor was a nurse and a whoopty-woo gawd love us all christian, and demanded she demonstrate how to give me shots (vitamin shots? it's hazy.) The neighbor (a weird lady whose husband was in a few of the same classes as me) made me take my pants down in front of her, her husband, my mom, and my dad. Then she made me lay on the bed and spent five minutes grabbing and fondling my ass to really seriously demonstrate where the injections should go. I was humiliated but stayed quiet.

Honestly, I just sort of assumed they went anywhere in that area and there wasn't a huge amount of precision necessary since it's all basically the same tissue. Mom -- a massive prude who reads immoral shit into nearly everything I do -- had absolutely zero problems with this and thanked her profusely when she left. Mom stayed with me for the rest of the summer and made me do all kinds of weird naturopathic shit to try to heal the mono. I've never brought up the ass grabbing incident with mom because I honestly don't even know how to articulate how upset I am about it. The lady's husband hit me up a decade or so later looking for a recommendation for a tech job and I told him to go fuck himself (politely.)

I picked up a software internship in town and worked that along with my huge course load. Eventually dad gave me a cellphone so they could just get in contact with me whenever they wanted to. I ended up giving it back because I absolutely did not want that intrusion in my life. One night, while I was trying to finish up some robotics homework, the campus security guard came into the lab and told me to call my parents immediately. They'd apparently blown up the campus switchboard AND harassed my next-door neighbors because they thought I might have fallen in the shower and cracked my head open. I was 19 at the time.

I ended up burning myself with a soldering iron one night while working on my senior design project. I'd been awake for two days, so I didn't even really register the pain at first. I just watched my skin turn red, then white, then brown, then black. I must have put my boots on and wandered outside at some point because I ended up at the top of the hill next to my apartments, boots untied and full of snow, without a jacket, staring down at the valley. I didn't see a way out of my situation that didn't involve just jumping off, but I realized that I'd probably just fuck myself up without dying and hiked back down. I managed to double major and graduate with a fairly decent GPA in 4 1/2 years. I got out of there with two degrees and a job offer and some money saved up for an apartment.

When I graduated, they guilted me into spending three months with them before I started work. The tech bubble popped and I had my offer pulled. I remember going up to my room and trying to cry because it meant I'd have to stay either with them or with my grandparents. I ended up listening to Smashing Pumpkins and formulating a plan instead. I beat the pavement, found another tech job in the town I wanted to live in, and found an apartment. They still expected multiple calls every day and also demanded that I skype with them so they could actually see how I was doing. I rolled these expectations back over the next decade and uninstalled skype. They would often call me and talk for up to an hour at a time, regardless if I had any other plans or needed dinner. I eventually bought my own secret cellphone and used that to call them so I could at least be out of the house. Mom found out about it (this was before caller ID was widespread) and demanded I share my new number with the whole family. After that, I was expected to answer the phone immediately and talk to them for as long as they wanted. It was usually hard to even get a word in edgewise, and my attempts to wrap the conversations up would add another 20 minutes to the call.

The family also started just showing up unannounced (or with a half-hour warning) expecting a place to sleep. I had one good double bed and the shitty twin bed I'd used in college. It was understood that when my family visited, I'd give my bed up and sleep in the twin, which was too short for me and basically kept me from getting any rest for the duration of their stay. They knew this because I mentioned it to them frequently. They'd either rearrange my house while I was gone for the day, snoop around and find things (comics, movies, books) that I didn't want them to find, or would deep-clean the entire place without me asking (and deliver the required massive guilt trip) and then act hurt when I told them I hadn't asked for that. They'd never make any plans, and would never tell me when they were leaving until I basically begged them to. I was also expected to use my vacation days to visit them, often for weeks at a time. Although I'd moved out and started trying to establish other relationships, my parents moved squarely in the middle of everything. They'd criticise my friends, yell at me for not going to church, search my apartment for any sign that I was living my own life or enjoying things that they didn't approve of, and have absolute meltdowns if I didn't call.

Mom has a stress-based condition that flares up whenever she wants to talk to me. I've been told multiple times that mom can not go to sleep until she hears from me, and she has often stayed up the whole night when I didn't call to prove the point. Every time I tried to gain some autonomy or enforce some boundaries, mom would get sick. Grandpa would end up in the hospital. Dad would have work problems. I'd feel like an asshole and walk back my boundaries, and they'd jump right into the middle of my life again. In the past they've followed me without my knowledge, searched my room (and my apartment as an adult), tried to find me on public webcams in my town, and also the aforementioned campus security thing. They've also stalked me on the internet, and called me more than once to complain about something they felt was out of line. They justify this by saying that ""god has a great plan for me and I will be happiest if I follow it"", and also that ""operating contrary to god's will"" opens me up to hardship, sickness, and maybe even death.

Mom has apologized numerous times for my terrible childhood, although she's chosen to apologize for the aspects that never bothered me. We were always poor. Most of my toys came from garage sales, most of my clothes came from family services, outlets, or second-hand stores. Most of our food came from our garden, dad's hunting trips, or members of our church. I was never unhappy with this. I don't feel that I was deprived physically or financially as a child, and that I learned to make the most of my surroundings. Mom also repeatedly apologized for ""abandoning me"" when I was 18. I was finishing up college, and they moved out of the country because of a career opportunity. I never resented this. In fact, I welcomed it. My parents were stifling and emotionally manipulative, and were slowly realizing that their son was an individual with his own motivations and desires. Regardless of whether or not I actually cared about this, mom continually brings this up whenever I ""act out.""

I decided last year that I'd enforce my boundaries again and not back down. But this is already huge and I suspect I'm running out of room. I'm in a much better place, and I've got a wonderful fiancee that I love dearly. A large part of the impetus behind this rant is that, via my fiancee, I've been able to see how actual loving families are supposed to work. Anyway thanks for letting me rant here.

Why do your executives have rape buttons at their desks?,Phosphoreign,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7gprnv/nbc_why_do_your_executives_have_rape_buttons_at/,"Executives at NBC have a button to lock their doors at their desks for... ""security reasons"".  Here's my logic... maybe I'm missing something.

1)  Door is open, maniac with gun bursts into office.

1a) Button locks door... doesn't help, he's already in your office

2)  Door is closed, maniac with gun bursts into office

2a) Button locks door... doesn't help, he's already in your office

3)  Door is open, and you hear gunfire in the office

3a) Button locks door... doesn't help, door is still open, you still need to get up and lock the door yourself

4) Door is closed, and you hear gunfire in the office

4a)  Ok, you locked the door... couldn't you have just gotten up and locked the door?  Do you sit in your office with the door closed all day, I don't know many managers that do that... and are these metal, panic room security doors?  Couldn't he just blow the lock off if he's after you?  Maybe kick the door down... so is this a *convenience* in case of security issues????

5) You are having a meeting, and you don't want someone to burst in, but the door is open

5a) Button locks door... ok... um... door is still open.  You need to get up and lock it manually.

6) You are having a meeting, and you don't want someone to burst in, and the door is closed

6a) Button locks door... ok... um... couldn't you get up and lock the door manually yourself, when the conversation becomes critical?  That's what we do in my office every day.  Ok, *convenience* that is not security related

AND THE WINNER IS:

7) You invite that good looking intern / actor / co-worker into you office... you ask them to close the door so you can have a discussion... you clandestinely lock that door behind them... and you make your rapey assault moves... they move to run, only to their dismay they discover the door is locked and they can't get away from you weinsteining?

SO AGAIN, NBC... I'M LOOKING AT YOU NBC... I'M ALSO LOOKING AT ANYONE ELSE THAT HAS THIS ""FEATURE"" IN EXECUTIVE OFFICES...

Why do your executives have rape buttons at their desks?"

I think I might need help though. I'm a 20-year-old male currently away at college in my second year studying engineering.

I take care of myself. I recently landed a really big engineering internship for next summer. School has been going really well, probably going to get all A's once again. I go to the gym usually about 4 days out of the week. I have made some good friends this semester (had trouble making friends my freshman year because I often prefer to stay to myself and not go out). I have very high standards for myself, often pushing myself to the edge.

Feelings of inadequacy swing from day-to-day. On some days I'll feel timid and not worthy and other days I'll feel as though I can do and take anything. In the last 2 weeks or so, my feelings have swung back and forth between feeling ecstatic and feeling despair. It has gotten much worse recently.

It seems to have started around when I heard news that a close friend of mine from high school killed himself about 2 months ago but I'm not certain this is the cause. I've recently been feeling suicidal. Let me be clear though - I can't really see myself actually doing this. I do think about what it would be like if I wasn't here though, feeling as though it might be easier to just not exist sometimes.

I've been involved with this girl recently and not really sure where I stand, used to be a hookup type of thing but now we're kind of invested in each other. Sharing stuff and being emotionally available to each other. Never really had this with anybody else before. She's going with someone else to her semi-formal and it's eating me up. Stuff literally drove me to tears, something that I have never had happen before. I've cried several times over the last months when I used to go 6+ months without doing so.

My sleep has been messed up badly over the last several weeks, often unable to sleep for hours when laying in bed.

I'm not sure what I'm even hoping to get out of this. Not sure if I just needed to vent or what but I want to hear what people think. I don't even know if I'm typing coherently or if this is just rambling. I'm worried that I have a mental illness emerging. I was reading online and it seems like the swings associated with bipolar disorder happen less frequently than I am experiencing but I'm not an expert by any means. Also was reading about borderline personality disorder."

I'm finishing my second semester in my undergraduate engineering degree, and I have some questions for those of you who are farther along or who have graduated recently.

Some background: I'm an older student, early 30's, doing my first Bachelors. I have experience in blue collar industry.

I'm attending an accredited state school (not very notable, middle America) and so far, my feelings have been mixed. I chose the school because it was affordable, and because I had the grades to get accepted with the assumption that most undergrad programs will be relatively similar. Some professors have been great, others duds, but that's to be expected. 

In the two semesters I've been there, I have tried to take advantage of everything I can. Unfortunately I'm noticing some negative patterns.

I'm wondering if these are common issues in all undergraduate programs, or if people in private schools or top tier schools have had different experiences.

**1. The students seem disrespectful**

Am I just an old fart? No one owned laptops when I was in high school, so maybe this is common now, but I mean... *front row,* on your cell phone seems so rude. In some classes, it's the majority of students.

**2. The clubs and extra activities are not doing anything.**

There seem to be a ton of clubs in our school, but there are no adults supervising. 

Initially I thought this was great, after all, I believe young students are just as capable as adults, but the students really haven't been on the ball.

**3. There's limited access to facilities**

While technically there are labs and shops, the people running them are not exactly inviting, and it seems like by asking anyone for help you are bothering them.

**4. The student body doesn't promote collaboration/energy.**

I went into school with the idea that real learning would come from projects, extracurriculars, internships, and clubs, and that while in school I would meet motivated individuals and play off their energy.

I understand that in an underfunded state school, it's hard to provide mentorships and guidance. I figured, ""I'm an adult, I know what I need to do and the extra effort I need to put in.""

But without the students around me having that guidance, I'm feeling more and more... isolated? I don't know if that's the correct term.

So, are these universal experiences? Are the first years of any program a let-down until you get closer to senior projects?

I appreciate any feedback, tyvm"

&gt; As recently as [a number went here] years ago, when someone in IT wanted to make use of open source software, it was usually an off-the-books project that didn’t require much in the way of management by-in.

The number he used made me raise my eyebrow, but I don't like to assume that my experience is necessarily representative for everyone else. Particularly since he's referring to enterprise/corporate environments.

So it made me wonder: How prevalent is it for someone in your company to reject software because it was open source rather than proprietary? In particular, *when's the last time you heard that opinion from someone who was in a position to (dis)approve the use of that kind of application?* (As opposed to, say, an intern who'd just attended a corporate sales pitch and didn't realize the Kool-Aid was part of the menu.)"

Coding wise I haven't done much, I built a calculator for my phone and some random fan page for a rapper I like. I picked up a bit of JavaScript at this job during my free time but really it just feels like I'm translating everything I learned in C++. 

Actually any language I've picked up has felt like I'm translating stuff I already know unless a certain language makes coding something easier. For example Python was a lot easier to use for a vigenere encryption program than C was.

I've been applying to jobs but get no responses probably because I've only been here for about 7 months so I'm raising red flags. I guess I have to stick out this IT job for a year which means I would've been out of a school for 2 years. What are my options? I'm thinking going for a master's so I can apply for internships. I still write code sometimes but nothing crazy that would catch someones attention. I'm guessing I really have to be a master at development now before I can get an interview?

I'm currently a junior in college dual majoring in Information Sciences and Technology: Design and Development and Security Risk Analysis: Information and Cyber Security. I've actually posted here a while ago about questioning my career path, but now that I'm nearly finished my current semester and I thought about my future a lot more, I felt I would share my (potential) decision as of now.

I think I'm going to drop my Cyber Security major and but finish IST: Design and Development degree, potentially with an SRA minor. Doing this would allow me to graduate a semester early and give me more time to do more game/mobile app development on my own. I know Cyber Security is a high demand field right now but what I really want to do is develop games (and maybe mobile apps and websites) in some fashion. The concentration of my IST degree specifically focuses on front-end software development (mostly Java, but I have some light experience with C++), so I feel like I'm in a pretty decent spot. There's also an IST course specifically for game development that I'm taking next semester. Best of all, I would be able to graduate a semester early and have more free time to learn game/mobile app development on my own. And IF I really wanted to pursue a Masters in Computer Science or Software Engineering, I could get a head-start on it (although I heard people say they might not be necessary depending on how I go about my career, it's more about my projects).

I just bought five courses on Udemy over their Cyber Monday sale (3 for Unity, 1 for Unreal Engine, and one for iOS development with Swift). I feel like completing these courses over the next few months will be really benefit me. A few people online suggested bootcamps for game development so that's something I might consider when I graduate.

I'm going to try to get any job I can get out of college (hopefully I can get a job where I interned back, I already got an offer for a returning internship). But it was for general IT, so who knows.

Let me know what you all think about my current approach. Recommendations and constructive criticism are always welcome, I am certainly no expert!

Thanks!"
