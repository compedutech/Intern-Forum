We went to a biking event today and I noticed how horrible i look in the full body pictures.  

So, although I have been trying to lose weight it does not look like it.  I recently started my last year of grad school, began a new internship and started a new job working night shift in the dorms leading to a lack of sleep until I get used to falling asleep sooner.

My question is, how much does stress (not the eating effects like overeating) and lack of sleep effect weight loss?  This is definitely something I will read some articles about soon, but in the mean time, what are your thoughts?"
z7a1n,190,2012-09-01,"Detroit, you didn't live up to my expectations.",beachesatnormandy,Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/z7a1n/detroit_you_didnt_live_up_to_my_expectations/,"This summer, I was given the opportunity to intern in Detroit. Being from Florida, I knew nothing about the city. I heard from everyone that it was dangerous and vile. Every time I mentioned I would be spending my summer there I was told to ""have fun, bring a gun"". I tried not to build these expectations in my head, and to just go to Detroit with an open mind, but it was inevitable. 

I arrived on a really gloomy Michigan day, not only was the city entirely empty as it was the weekend but the sun did not come out for a full 2 days. It was looking like Detroit was going to meet all these expectations I tried not to set. But after spending 3 months exploring, submersing and involving myself in downtown/surrounding areas and their culture I was blown away. The history, the beautiful stories the buildings tell, the intriguing people you meet, the establishments that have just popped up in midtown to the restaurants that have been on Michigan Ave for decades. I did not even know what to do with all of it. 

No one had told me about these things, just that I shouldn't drive a foreign car and I should never speak to anyone. 

Detroit is thriving in a way people don't understand. But I am absolutely thankful that I had the chance to experience it first hand. 

Detroit did not meet my expectations, because it wasn't disgusting nor did I ever feel in danger. I was not afraid to walk around on my own, or talk to random people. I saw abandoned buildings/houses but they taught me about the past. 

Detroit is everything I wasn't expecting. It taught me about myself and about others. It showed me that simple ideas can be manifested into endeavors. It taught me to never give it. It also taught me that Northerners can't make good chicken and waffles, but damn the rest of the food y'all make is delicious. It showed me some of the most stunning architecture I have ever been privileged to witness.

That being said, I'd like to thank everyone in the area for being so welcoming and cordial. I can't wait to return next summer. 

Edit: I lived in downtown Detroit for the 3 months I spent there. I plan on returning for another 3 months next summer to live in the same place. "
z7529,1,2012-09-01,What should I do with my career and my life?,ProtagonistForHire,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z7529/what_should_i_do_with_my_career_and_my_life/,"

I graduated from Law school last year from the UK, and became a [1] barrister. Now I'm currently interning at the top law firm in my country. Unfortunately, this is a career that I absolutely hate and I'm completely miserable.

I never really had a choice with what I wanted to study at university or choose my profession. I come from a kind of typical upper-middle class, indian family (Bangladeshi to be specific), so I was raised to obey and not question. My father kind of forced me to study law, which I did for 5 years. I tried to tell him for the first two years that I didn't like it at all and don't want to be in this profession, but that really did not go anywhere. The last three years of university was just a haze of severe depression and still going strong, but I still managed to finish my 3 degrees.

After I came back home, I was lucky enough to be able to join a law firm. It is the best in the country, the people who work there are great (really intelligent and polite) and even my supervisor likes me a lot (which I heard just today through the grapevine). I'm certainly learning a lot, and everyone who hears where I work is immediately very impressed. And if I stay here I will probably be making very good money in 3 to 4 years time (I'm getting currently a salary of zero, since I'm just a lowly intern now). Honestly the only complaint I have is the 10-12 hour work day, six days a week, which would not be a problem if I loved my job since the office environment is really chill.

But the thing is, I've hated law from day one of university. I never had any interest in the subject and still do not. I also kind of hated being in the UK for those 5 years, mainly due to the circumstances. The fact that I had to study law, more or less against my will has made me really hate law and myself. I feel like a prisoner in my own life.

I realize that I really need to change my career, but I'm at a complete loss as to what I should do. I have zero adult guidance now, and I was raised such a sheltered life (eg: not allowed to play sports outside, because I would get kidnapped...wtf right?) that I am completely confused about my life.

I do not want to do this law shit any longer. I just want to quit so bad. But I have no idea what I can do alternatively. I am really hesitant to quit this job, because of all the goods things about it I said before. I am worried that quitting is going to be a really big mistake. But this is definitely not the life I want to live.

My years of depression as completely sucked the life out of me. I don't have the energy to study again, mainly because university was a form prolonged mental torture for me. And mainly because I would need to save a lot of money to put me through uni, which I cannot do without a salary.

I also feel like a bitch complaining about my life because I am well provided for. I live in a nice house, I am fed, and loved. But I am extremely unhappy and have been so for the last 6 years. I really really hate myself for not standing up for myself. I know that this is all my fault. I was too scared to just quit law school, mainly because so much money was spent behind me. And the social pressure from back home for me to finish school was immense. I wish I was more mature and not a little shit who just followed the path of least resistance. But now I am trying to correct my stupid mistakes.

I've thought of teaching law, but teachers aren't really paid anything in this country, and I hate talking in public (also another reason I do not want to be a lawyer).

Though about working in the legal division in a company, but I have to wait till February 2013 because I have to sit for a national exam first for me to be employable in any kind of decent job.

I apologise for the wall to text and poor writing, but language is not my strength (another reason I hate law). . I do not really have anyone who's an adult to talk to about this. Most of my friends are still students, so they don't know anything, just like me. My head has been a mess for the last month and I can tell I'm burning out after all this time. Every night all I fantasize about is suicide, only to wake up to another 10 hours of work which I hate. But I could please use some advise on what I can do career wise and what I should want from my life (right now I just want to die).

What I am most worried about is making the wrong decision out of fear (which is partly how I got into my current mess). I do not want to wait 1 more year to realize that the last 7 years of my life has been a big mistake (I'm pretty sure it has).

I literally have no idea what to do with my life anymore. And I also do not feel like I am able to make any rational and objective decision about my long term goals. Mainly because I have been sheltered and kept away from a lot of things, so I'm quite immature, naive and don't yet understand how real life works. And since I don't have any adult to talk to about these things, I feel like I'm completely in the dark.

Should I do something else (but what?), or should I stop being a whiny bitch and just suck it up and work at my law firm (since any one to gets to work there is extremely lucky)? Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

I've been reading the directions online, but I think I need them explained in slightly less *jargony* terms. If anyone has the time to hold my hand and help me get off the ground, it'd mean a lot.

z6pmu,1,2012-09-01,From cop to criminal [Bipolar/OCD] and hookers!,mhj123,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/z6pmu/from_cop_to_criminal_bipolarocd_and_hookers/,"Well I am not sure exactly how to begin this but perhaps that is simply the best intro there is. 

This is a throwaway account. Ever since I found out about this subreddit I have wanted to post, but over the years I have developed a very cynical outlook in regards to mental health. Per my own conditions I have never really found anything that has helped me and the years spent in therapy have made me feel jaded. I never truly trust my psychologist because I think they are all about the money (I know this isn't true). 

But I mean what a joke job, the guy sits there and listens to me moan for an hour and collects 150$ at the end. A hooker costs 50% less for a half hour and comes with a happy ending. 

When I was really little lets say 3 I was visiting my fathers mother in NY (my grandfather died before I could meet him). Anyway to make a long story short I was playing with my dad in the park and started freaking out about 'germs' being all over me. I have no recollection of this incident but based on my fathers description it definitely sounds like I was having some sort of a panic attack. 

Anyway shortly after that my pre-school teachers started telling my parents that I spent an abnormal amount of time in the bathroom and when they asked me why I apparently told them it was because I was washing my hand. And indeed I was washing my hands, until they bled. 

So that led to the first encounter with a psychatrist. I got diagnosed with OCD and thrown on Prozac or Zoloft for kids, anyway my mom used to sprinkle it onto my applesauce. 

Now usually I get this far in my story and just delete it because who wants to hear me this drama. But I am going to push forward because for some reason. Mainly because I am high as shit. In fact I need a cigarette I will brb.

Ok I am back. Where were we? Hand washing. Oh yes I definitely did that. I was terrified of germs and especially the thought of them being on my toys. In addition to this my grandmother (same one I was visiting in NY past away). Ever since that moment I have also been obsessed with death and dying.....

Even now just writing that part tears swell in my eyes. She was my best friend. Every time she came to visit I got spoiled rotten and I loved every second of it. She made me feel like I was a prince or someone very special. If there was a toy I wanted she bought it! We used to always go to the toy store when she would visit (Toy's R Us). 

Even though I was only a child when she passed away I can recall the exact moment when my father told me she was gone. I was playing a formula one racing game and my dad was behind me sitting on the couch watching. I got like 3rd place or some shit and I was pumped up  being like 4 years old. My dad was pumping me up as well and then he told me to sit on the couch because he needed to talk to me. 

I instantly was stricken with fear. God that fear. He looked me in the eyes and we both began crying at the same time. He explained to me that she passed away from an aneurysm in her brain. 

After I learned about what it felt like to lose a loved one my mind fixated on death and especially on my mother as she is to this day the person I feel closest with. I began having panic attacks at night, unable to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about what happens when we die? Would I never see my mother again?

So blah blah blah I have seen therapist all my life...... Always on medication even in middle/high school I was on something like;

Valium
Generic SSRI
Ambien

Funny thing was I was a straight edge kid all the way up until the time I killed myself at age 24. Smoked weed like twice once at age 15 and once at age 22. 

I was like that because I wanted to be a fighter pilot as a child. Watched too much Top Gun and my dad is a commercial pilot. Some psychologist told me once that 80% of pilots exhibit symptoms of hypo-mania, fun fact. I quickly realized that my vision was way to shitty to be a pilot. So then I changed my mind to becoming an FBI agent when I was like 13. 

^This later turned out to be a REALLY dumb ass idea because while I loved the investigative side of things there is no way in hell I was going to be able to handle the anxiety ridden anarchy of patrol duty.

So yeah once I got to college things began to settle. I partied (drank) and developed ulcerative colitis. I was living with my buddies and wasting my life on WoW. I was fat as hell but I got in shape while in college. Never got laid and always felt like a loser because of it lawl. 

I did well in college graduated with a 3.3/3.5 gpa or some shit. I did get a 4.0 my last two semesters which was cool because it put me on the dean's list of scholars. I also did a pretty cool law enforcement internship. 

After I graduated I started applying for all federal law enforcement jobs I could find. I didn't want to work for a local agency and the fact that in my state you have to self sponsor yourself through the academy (without the guarantee of a job after graduation) continued to deter my interest in local departments.

Eventually I got an interview with the Secret Service and since I don't want the feds up my ass I am just going to leave that process as classified. I failed the polygraph because I couldn't sleep for two days before it and my anxiety was off the charts. They offered to re-test me but I knew if I couldn't handle the stress of that stupid test. Which indeed I was 100% truthful on then what right did I have to protect the PoTUS. 

My fellow officers couldn't count on someone like me. 

This sense of failure drove me into a great depression.... I moved back home and dwelled in my old room spending my unemployed days playing league of legends and as luck would have it, World of Warcraft. 

I was working at UPS as a seasonal helper and basically felt so lost like such a failure that I lined up all my medications and then I took my 1911 out of the case pulled a round out of a clip and said to my self:

""I can keep taking these medications for the rest of my life or I can take this one bullet and be free forever"" 

I couldn't stop thinking about my mom at my funeral so that stopped me. But during all this time my sister's drug habit had revealed its ugly head. 

I knew in college that she had gotten into my moms meds a few times but one time when I was in her room helping my mom look for drugs I found the key to my moms safe in my sisters pillow case. 

We then found out about her roxycodone addiction and that she had been stealing stuff from our house left and right and pawning it at local pawn shops. 

Shit the bitch stole and pawned my mothers 25 year anniversary ring.

Eventually my sister stole my Alienware laptop which had a bunch of classified files on with regard to the internship I did in college, as well as all of my school work/resumes etc.... etc........

Angry beyond belief I stormed down the stairs with a knife and when my mom stopped me hypothetically someone yelled ""Tell me why I shouldn't slit that bitch from ear to ear"". 

I love my sister. I swore an oath on the day she was born to protect her. I swore from that day that I would give my life for her. Then she became a monster.

I got in the car drove to the parking lot of where I had been working at the time and tried to settle down. I was so tired I just wanted to go to sleep, but I was soooooo pissed off that I couldn't.

I took my Xanax, Lunesta, Lamictal drank a little bottle of absinthe and started drinking hydromet syrup until I passed out. I knew I was at the risk of over dosing but I didn't care. I even wrote a note that said ""If found dead, this wasn't a suicide I just wanted to sleep"". Somehow I ended up finding an 'escort' online and making a visit to her hotel room. 

Something I have done since which I am way not proud of. Not with the same one even. Massage parlors, erotic hair cuts. I have done some fucked up shit. 

Shit this has been a long winded rant and I really don't feel like writing anymore. 

Anyway I started experimenting with spice about 1.5 years ago and had a bad panic attack. Started smoking regular trees to help with my anxiety. It really has helped.... in some ways or is that just the drugs talking? Who knows.......

Anyway I have a few different personas I use when I visit these escorts as well. 

AMA if you want, idgaf.

Oh and I tried to become a mental health counselor to try and help people like me but the grad school basically told me I was too crazy to help the crazy people."
z6jqu,1,2012-09-01,Totally cracked out girl in my apartment. I have no idea what to do with her. Please help.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6jqu/totally_cracked_out_girl_in_my_apartment_i_have/,"Sorry if this isn't exactly the correct subreddit for this, but it seemed like the past chance at getting a response quickly. Reddit knows everything. So, yesterday I'm meeting my buddy on campus. Says he's hanging out with some girl and to find him. I get there and there is this sort of jittery girl of 24 years hanging out with him (whom he just met). She seems friendly and highly intelligent. Says she's here to scope out an internship program at the hospital and is planning to apply for a PhD in biochemistry. Drinking coffee. The three of us meet up with another female friend and go eat Chinese food at the beach. She's slamming successive energy drinks. She bails as soon as we get there and says somebody is coming to get her. We don't see anyone, but she leaves anyway.

A few hours later she calls us and wants to know what we're up to. My friend said something about hanging earlier. Except now my friend suddenly has to bail to go take care of his sick sister, and the other girl had to go for some other reason. So suddenly I'm all alone with this girl, and she explains that she needs me to drive her to go get a key from some guy whose lettering her stay in his place. I spend an hour and half waiting in a parking lot behind Dunkin Donuts. She walks off because she says she has to meet him behind 711. I wait where I am. I get a call from some thug sounding guy who asks if she has his money (she used my cell phone to call him). I want to get in my car and drive, but her purse is in my car. She comes back says she couldn't find him. FYI, I think she wanted painkillers because she mentioned she needed those later for her pains that were a result of some fall down a stairs.

So obviously she was trying to do some kind of drug deal and it fell through. So now that she can't stay at his place (couldn't meet him for the key, as was the original story), she asks if we can hang out in this hookah bar for a bit while she calls some friends and finds a place she can crash. She tries to no avail. Also, she's slamming these energy packet things. As sketchy as this all sounds, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Highly, highly intelligent.. probably gifted, which engenders some sympathy with me. Well, now it's almost midnight and she has nowhere to go and I'm getting tired. I say she can sleep at my place, and I can give her some Valium to help her sleep. I hid away all the little things with value just to be sure, and she doesn't seem interested in robbing or harming me. Just trying to offer her a hot shower and a couch or bed (I take the other) to sleep it off. Well she didn't sleep at all, and was just pottering about all night. I'm seeing some evidence of OCD or something because my bathroom is all organized (first with my stuff alone, now with all of her stuff). She spent most of the night in there, I suppose because she didn't want to disturb me with the light on. See, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Anyway, it's morning now and I come down stairs to find my can of ground coffee open and empty. I think she was eating it with a spoon or something. So I need to start my day soon and she still has nowhere to go. Apparently she lives about 40 minutes from here at her parents house, but they're on vacation and won't be back until the following day. This means I have to do something with her. And also I'd prefer she doesn't die and stuff. I checked her pulse and it was pretty fast. Not like running from a T-rex fast, but definitely a great deal higher than I would like mine at 7am. 

So my questions are 1) WTF is going on with this girl? 2) Why is she consuming so much caffeine? and 3) How to I get myself out of this situation? 

FYI. I did not have sex with her, try to have sex with her, or anything like like that."

As an accounting major I could do the normal Audit or Tax route, but I am curious about Advisory. I am a great catch to the Big 4 (great GPA, in a lot of organizations, great personality, etc) so I have no doubt I will get an internship to Audit or Tax. I'm also a Information Technology/ Finance major so that is something that sets me apart. But anyway I would love to hear how you like working in Advising and what kind of projects you work on. If you work for the Big 4 that is definitely a plus.  Thanks for your insight. "

I may be able to help!

I am a Microsoft Software Development Engineer (SDE) and have been with the company for several years. In that time, I've recruited at several Universities, attended Career Fairs, and interviewed candidates flown in to our main campus in Redmond, WA.

While I won't violate my NDA, I can share a decent amount about your possible interview experience, and I can offer tips for getting the job.

Any advice I give, while tailored to Microsoft, is extremely similar to what you'll hear for other large companies such as Google, Amazon, and Apple (among others).

So, if you've got a question, fire away

**DISCLAIMER:** My responses in this post as well as the comments are not official statements on behalf of Microsoft. They are my own thoughts and insights gathered through my experiences, they don't reflect an official company position.

I eventually want to move out of India. I'd like some general advice with building up a good résumé over the next four years. 

I realise how important a summer internship is - unfortunately, my uni only gives us 15 days vacation between semesters, assuming I can even FIND an internship. I'm very depressed with the system, which seems more focused on making code monkeys rather than people who can actually think. What is some useful and INTERESTING stuff I can work on, parallel with getting my degree? (I AM very interested in CS, I love programming - unlike maybe 70% of my class). Also, what sort of stuff do American universities look at? I'd like to keep tuition costs to a minimum, get a few scholarships if possible.

This probably sounds like more of a rant than anything, and I sound like a stereotypical douchey college kid with an overblown superiority complex - but I'm really frustrated and depressed, seeing so many thousands of people - including my best friends - get into streams they hate (read: engineering/CS), just for the promise of a nice job and an arranged marriage 10 years down the line. And nobody CARES about anything - not the students, not the professors, not the companies, nobody has any passion. The system is more focused on giving marks to the students who mug up the most - but then again, that's one of the hallowed traditions of Indian education."

Me[25/m] I apologize this is gonna be a long one but i really need some advice. I graduated from college a few years ago and during that time I had a ,for the most part, awesome relationship with a girl i have known for almost ten years. We had an instant connection when we met as young teens, and when we wound up going to the same college together things blossomed in ways i have never experienced with another person. We dated for about 2 years, we had our issues like every other couple, but for the most part things where good.I worked at one of the few popular bars in town and oftentimes would grab a drink with coworkers after work. At the end of my senior year i drunkenly went to a co-workers house (who is a known lesbian and i had no intentions with her) to try to sober up a bit as she lived right nextdoor to the bar. Honestly the details are vague but i ended up hooking up with her that night, that much i remember. After realizing what i had done, I couldnt come to terms with it, was afraid to tell her, and decided to break up with her without ever mentioning what happened, and basically used our impending separation after grad. and me wanting to find myself as an excuse. 

Fast forward a year, im living in our hometown, she has a semester to go and doing an internship somewhere else in the state. We run into eachother randomly during this summer, agree to meetup later on, sparks flew old feelings were dug up, and all i wanted was her. Weeks pass and i see the direction things are going and she is reciprocating those feelings but i knew i could never be with her again unless i came clean. I confessed what happened, of course she was hurt, I gave her a little bit of space but things didnt change drastically or so i thought. Our birthdays pass we get each other gifts, i actually invited her around my family for mine, a few i love you's where exchanged over the course of a few months. 

I let her stay at my place while i was away on vacation, by the time i come home she has returned to her internship.My laptop battery is shitty and takes less than an hour to die. When i plug it in and turn it on her fb is logged in and i see a message from a guy i noticed earlier that has been blowing her up lately on fb. Turns out hes a guy she had hooked up with during the year we were not together and she has been flirting with him, and saw that he had asked her if he liked the pic he sent her etc. , this was a few days prior to my bday and weeks after hers. Im hurt i ask her about it she says its just flirting, she likes the attention, we arent together right now, etc. 

So i was cool with it, tried to not let it get in the way of what I thought we where building, even though we def had a few arguments about the guy. Even though we established we werent going to commit to one another it still hurt to know i wasnt the only guy she was talking to. He lives in our old college town in which she has one semester left. So my thinking is as soon as she goes there its gonna be on with the two of them. She insists its not like that, and spends every night with me in the 5 days leading up to her going back. I notice she is being standoffish her last day or so in town, something was up for sure. so i  check her phone to night before she leaves while she is asleep in my bed and see she has been sexting this guy all day and planning to hookup with him the following night. So i wake her up, ask her what her deal is, and basically ask her to leave without telling her i saw the messages. Not knowing ive seen the messages she goes on this rant about how im assuming too much, and making her out to be a bad guy, and that it's not like that with him. As she is leaving  i throw a few things i read in her face, letting her know i saw it all. She was shocked disgusted angry, we have a text argument the next day and now we arent speaking. 

I guess you could say she got her revenge, im not sure if there was a definite motive there. And because of my previous infidelity i guess i am not allowed to feel any certain way about it. I know i broke her heart when we broke up before, and after the fiasco this summer with me being a nosey asshole she said she doesnt know if she can trust me again. I dont blame her, but it is all i can think about. I love her so much and have always seen her in my future. We havent spoken in weeks. My question is, Do you all think too much has transpired and i should move on? I really do love her, and i want to fix it, im leaving her alone to give her some space, but i honestly have hopes for the future as foolish as that may or may not sound.

tl;dr reunited with past love, I disrepected her privacy, saw how things actually where, not speaking at this point. What do?

I started ""eating healthier"" around the end of April. I'm guessing I was 310+ at that point. After poking around /r/loseit, I found a link to /r/keto and decided to give that a try (start date: May 2). I went home from college about a week into May, finally got my scale on May 11 and officially weighed in at 301.6. Today's weigh-in: 251.2!

I don't really go out of my way to exercise, mainly because I'm too lazy and am still nervous about being the fat guy at the gym :P

I do, however, walk quite a bit (since I'm on a college campus) and I had an internship over the summer where I was on my feet for a large part of the day and consistently registered around 10k steps a day (according to my fitbit). 

For my diet, I stick mainly keto, though I don't limit myself from a dessert or drink here or there and try to stick to around 1500-1600 kcal a day. I've been averaging about .44 lbs/day lost, so I think it's working for me :)

z7njk,0,2012-09-01,My Best Friend Committed Suicide 4 Months Ago Because of a Teacher AMAA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z7njk/my_best_friend_committed_suicide_4_months_ago/,"Four months ago, my best friend committed suicide.

She had been pursuing her degree, and she was enrolled in an internship course. She was excellent on the internship, but the teacher would not pass her in this course because of 15 minute power point. She needed this class to get her degree, and could not afford to retake it because she had given up her job and used all of her savings to drive to the internship.
In efforts to fix the situation, my friend made one last attempt to reach out to the professor before going to the dean of the school. She sent an eloquent email stating the problems she had, and telling the teacher that if she did not pass her in this course, she felt like she had wasted that last few years of her life and all over a 15 minute power point presentation that had no expectations made by the teacher, only to show pictures and talk about what she had learned. 
Many other students have come forward and said they have had very similar problems with this professor.

The teacher wrote back with an email ranting that my friend was being immature, and had in fact been wasting the last two years of her life.

We believe it was at this moment my friend had felt as if all of her dreams had been ripped away from her, she was home alone, and had a access to a weapon. It was shortly after this email we believe she committed suicide. 

My friend was 20 years old. "
z7lkx,4,2012-09-01,Feel really empty in new situations,alecbenzer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/z7lkx/feel_really_empty_in_new_situations/,"Short history:

1. Be a bit depressed throughout high school
2. Go to college, things get worse (though in slightly different ways)
3. Start taking Prozac after a not-so-great first semester
4. Second semester much better

So after my second semester, I started working at as an intern. The job was ostensibly really awesome, and it was working for a cool company that I've always wanted to end up working for, but despite all of this, I felt sort of empty and sad at work a lot. I'd find myself almost on the verge of tears on my way home, and I was sometimes even borderline suicidal, not because anything was really all that wrong, but because I just didn't find much to enjoy.

After a while, though, things got better. I started to feel like I belonged more and the job, got a bit closer to some of the people, and began enjoying my work more. By the end, it was really fun, and in fact in the few weeks before I left the internship, I probably felt better about my general situation than I had for a long, long time. That being said, I was still looking forward to being back at school.

Then, I went back to school, and I feel like I'm feeling the same kinds of things I was at the beginning of my internship. Even though I'm around friends and taking classes I enjoy for the most part, I still feel that same kind of emptiness, and it's bothersome.

Does anyone else feel like this at times? What do you do to feel better?

[1\) Do you feel like the job makes you less scared of your own death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|2) When picking up a body, ""We'll take good care of him/her"" I try to stay away from, ""He's in a better place now."" I don't believe in heaven so I just feel weird saying it.
[2\) Are there sort of catch-phrases that you use to comfort people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3) I was always curious about it in High School and when I graduated I just went to school for it on a whim. The more I learned the more I liked it.
[3\) What got you interested in the job? Anything that you really like about the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3.5) Being able to help people in what's probably the worst moments of their lives. Whenever someone comes up to me with tears in their eyes and hugs me and shakes my hand thanking me for giving them closure...it really does feel good.
[4\) Were you squeamish at first, or can you still be sometimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|4) At the very beginning I was. But the schooling takes care of that. First night in embalming lab was a lady that was in a car accident and launched out of her front windshield.
[5\) Cremation or burial, or being set in amber or taxidermied?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|5) I'm always back and forth on this. Right now, I'd say cremation. 
[Are there any conditions in which you simply cannot allow an open casket funeral?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qyrv?context=5)|It depends I guess. We had a person who died in a nasty car accident and on top of that had a full autopsy, so needless to say they were pretty messed up. The family INSISTED on an open casket and in situations like that you have to be honest with them and say something like, ""We'll try our best with restoring and embalming him and we'll let you know how everything goes by the end of the day.""
 |That particular case ended up being open casket. Dude actually looked pretty good (all things considered) 
[My sister-in-law committed suicide (gun to temple\) and sat in her car, in the hot texas sun for 24-hours before being found. my mother-in-law insisted on a private viewing. they told us the same thing. it was horrible. :\ she didn't look like the same person at all. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620sve?context=5)|Yeh, that is unfortunate. Anything involving trauma to the head or face is very tough for a funeral director. We all look different when we die, regardless what the cause of death was. So when I'm embalming people, I really have no reference as to what they actually looked like. It can be tough...

[Do you ever cry at the funerals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qi6u?context=5)|Nah. Don't get me wrong, there have been some sad moments but I've never full out cried. Saddest day for me personally was when a 19 year old kid came in to make arrangements for his dad that died out of state. 
[Hey, my sister in law is a janitor at a funeral home who is totally into the zombie craze.  I'm going to prank the shit out of her.  Would she get fired?  Also, any ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61uyq0?context=5)|Would she get fired? I don't know. Hopefully not haha. You should go into the funeral home and steal a body when shes not around and then put it in the back seat of her car.
 |But seriously don't do that. 
[My friend, Frank Reynolds, asks ""You bang the dead bodies?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wa4x?context=5)|Nah. I'm not even banging living bodies right now.

Solid mahogany casket and a bronze burial vault. I know what you're thinking, and I agree with you. It's ridiculous.
 |Also in case you're wondering I don't make any commissions. Strictly salary.
[Man, it must be a humbling experience to see people spend that much money on the deceased. But I can understand why they would want to spend money on someone that close to them, but still, that's a lot of money haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rc8z?context=5)|They paid in cash too &gt;.&gt;

It smells horrible. And one time they absolutely butchered a body on us. They didn't use sterile instruments for the autopsy and gave the  body whats known as ""Tissue gas."" Really really bad stuff. They also cut the left common carotid artery almost all the way up the neck. Not sure if it was an accident or whatever but I was not a happy camper.
[How do you go about dressing up the decedents, since they're all stiff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|It's hard dressing them. We don't cut clothes either. You just have to lift them up with one hand and slip the clothes on.
[What is the embalming process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|Embalmings not that bad. You have to make sure the body is positioned the right way on the table and you'll be fine. Once the embalming fluid sets in, the body is going to become hard and it's not going to break position. The actual process is typically just one incision above the right clavicle and then fishing for the right common carotid artery. Raise that up, cut a slit into it and put the arterial tube in and start shooting down into the body.
[Sorry to be the one, but...proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tql2?context=5)|I'm not really sure how I can go about proving this haha, I can take a picture of my embalmers permit I guess?

[Why do funerals cost so much? What is the average profit do you make a week? How long does it take to embalm a whole body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rbpd?context=5)|It's hard to explain why funerals cost so much. A funeral home operates differently from most normal businesses. There's no guarantee of steady income for the funeral home owner. So what I guess I'm trying to say is when you pay that 10,000 dollar funeral bill a good part of that money is going to pay for the funeral home's overhead. There are other reasons too but that's a big factor in things.
 |It's hard to say how much business we do dollar wise in a week. We've gone weeks without any deaths and we've had other weeks were it's just nonstop. But if you're talking me personally, I make the same amount every week regardless of what's going on.
 |To answer your embalming question, it varies by body. But anywhere from an hour and a half to two and a half hours. 
[It's not steady income when your Clients are dying to get in there?!  Sorry i'll see myself out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wtef?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obKLdou0LH0)
[So what you're saying is...funeral homes aren't assured of a steady income?  But aren't funeral homes the only business that could get new clients every day for the rest of human civilization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s1cm?context=5)|Well kind of. There are a lot of funeral homes now a days. One in my area just recently had to close down. The competition just wrecked it. 
[That's utterly fascinating. Can you go into greater detail about the competition among funeral homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s4lv?context=5)|There are always new funeral homes sprouting up. And as of recently cremation services that undercut traditional funeral homes. The cremation service I work at charges 1300 dollars for a cremation while the funeral home equivalent is about 3000.
[What kind of prep goes into the bodies before they can be veiwed? Any differences for prep between open casket and cremation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qlud?context=5)|Huge difference. For a direct cremation you honestly don't have to do anything preparation wise. If the deceased had a pace-maker or other battery powered medical device it needs to be removed before the cremation can take place, and that's just one incision on the chest.
 |For an open casket viewing the whole body is washed, basic sanitary care (cleaning fingernails etc...) embalmed, dressed, casketed, and finally cosmetized.
 |And if they were in any sort of accident then we have to get into using wax for restorative work but that's a whole other thing, and I honestly don't have much experience working with wax. 
[Do you guys always at least try to get a photo of the deceased, so you know how to best ""cosmetize"" them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ynio?context=5)|We usually don't have a photo to go by which is why situations like that occur.
[An old friend of mine died; he was a true redneck.  His hair was always a mess and his beard scraggly. They had an open casket and his hair was trimmed like a banker and his beard could have felt right in place on some boy-band douche.  In death, he looked damn near nothing like he did in life.   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ynio?context=5)|I always get told to do the same style of cosmetics for everyone but like you said, they need to look like they did in life. So it's that thin line between what I think and what my employers want..
[They don't always remove implanted medical devices. I've worked as a cremationist and have had a few explode before.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tnuc?context=5)|I always check first thing when I get the bodies into the prep room. 
[The major culprit was a rinky-dink funeral home. It's scared the crap out of me a few times. Afterward, I'd have to sift through the cremains and find all the little pieces.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wu5e?context=5)|That's really not good.

I wouldn't be able to embalm my parents...just thinking about it...nope. 
[When I go, will you stitch up my eyes and mouth for me? I'd rather know the person that does it. Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61r1kd?context=5)|I don't stitch eyes, there's a small plastic eye cap that I can slip under your eyelids for you though. 
[Nah, I'm good. Just some heavy coins will do, if you've got any. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61r8jv?context=5)|You know me, I always carry a satchel of heavy coins wherever I go. 
[Do you ever feel sad about the people you deal with or have you been desensitized? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s1gq?context=5)|There was this young man who died and his son came up to me and with tears in his eyes he said ""hey thanks for doing my dads make up"" He was about my age. I wanted to vomit out of sadness.
[Ever had any paranormal experience or something that you can't explain while working in the morgue?

I'm not a believer in ghosts. Every once and awhile I'll hear a strange noise or see something out of the corner of my eye but the fact is, the funeral home is a reallllly old building. The noises are probably it just falling apart. 
[You mentioned you dont believe in heaven. I would think that religion is a pretty big thing with funeral homes and directors. How do you go about doing your job? Just fake it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c6222or?context=5)|Nah, when families talk to me about heaven and being with God and stuff I usually just smile and nod. I'm never the person to bring it up first. I respect people's beliefs especially at a time of loss and just roll with it. 
[Mortician.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qlpq?context=5)|I actually was big into death metal during High School, but I never got into Mortician.

(That's my ULTIMATE dream job\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61uob5?context=5)|Not really, I think you need a masters degree for that and I just can't deal with more schooling right now. Being a coroner would be interesting though. 
[How do you handle the smell of decomp? Do you just grin and bear it? Do you shove cigarettes up your nose? How do you embalm bodies with damage to the circulatory system (amputations or massive trauma\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vvrf?context=5)|I've gotten used to the decomp smell. Don't get me wrong, it's still nasty... But I just champ it out and make sure the exhaust fan is on.
 |Embalming bodies with a damaged circulatory system is a pain in the ass. Instead of a one point injection using the carotid artery, typically we'd have to make incisions in the arms and legs and raise the corresponding arteries to inject (axillary for arms and femoral for legs) and that's whats called a 6 point injection. 
[A friend of mine recently decided that she wanted to be a mortician and at first I couldn't believe it and could not understand why anyone would choose this career. It seems creepy (to be around the dead bodies\) and sad (to have to face grieving people everyday\). also, my mom's best friends father was a funeral director and he lived on top of the funeral home and that freaked me out as a child. Is it really as creepy as I think when you are there alone with dead bodies around you? How do you get used to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61sxhh?context=5)|It's funny that you mention that. The other day I was driving a body to the crematory and in that moment I realized that I drive around more with dead people than I do with living passengers. It doesn't really bother me to be honest. I'm at that point where I see a dead body just about everyday, so it's really just another day in the office for me. 
[Hate to be the one to ask you, but have you ever experience anything you couldn't explain?..You know, paranormal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ymiv?context=5)|I haven't. And I've been alone in the funeral home many many times. A buddy of mine works in a funeral home a few towns over and he claims his is haunted. He told me a story of his co-worker being pulled down the stairs by a random mysterious force.

[Whats the most embarrasing body/cause of death you've worked with? -How long does preparation take? -Have you ever made friends through funerals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621qhu?context=5)|Not really so much embarrassing, but I get a chuckle whenever I see ""Failure to thrive"" on a death certificate. Basically just means dying of old age.
 |Preparation could take anywhere from an hour, to 3 hours for a normal body. If restoration is involved you're talking a full day project.
 |I met this really awesome black guy once. It was raining and I walked him back to his car with an umbrella so he drove me around in his Mercedes and we just chit-chatted about cars and stuff

It might sound harsh but I try to detach myself as much as I can. When I'm just doing removals and embalmings I don't even ask for the persons life story or details about the death. It's not that I'm purposely trying to be an asshole, but the more I know about the person, the harder it gets.

[Did you take the National Board exam? I graduated with a funeral director degree and passed the Science, but did not pass the Arts. Then life got in the way and I procrastinated, now I'm trying to self learn everything else I need to pass a few years later. How did you study? I have a lot of books that may be outdated, I wonder if they change the test too much to reflect new material? I wasn't exactly motivated to attempt the test again because it costs $200, I'm not currently working at a funeral home, and I would hate to fail it again. Any words of encouragement? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621lu3?context=5)|Yep $200 per section. I passed both sections on the first attempt. Honestly, when it comes to studying hit vocab really hard. Even if you get a question you don't know, you'll be able to rule out which answers are wrong because you can recognize key words. It helped me out a lot, and also your books probably aren't all that out dated. I really don't think they update boards all that much.

It gets busy in January and February. My guess is that people that are sick hold out long enough to get through the holidays and once it's over and they've been around their friends and families they feel ready to let go.
 |Just my speculation though. It could just be coincidence.  
[I'm a pall-bearer (a couple of hours per week, I'm still in college\) and so I've been to many funerals, with many different funeral directors. I notice that when I'm near the coffin, most of the times you don't smell anything, but on rare occasions theres this weird smell. A couple of weeks ago, when it was very hot in my country, we had a coffin which smellt awful. The thing I can compare it most with is sour milk or something. My questions are: is that the body you smell or something else (chemicals to preserve the body for example\) and is this something the director is responsible for? Thank you for this ama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61w6wp?context=5)|It could be a few different things. I suspect it could be a tiny bit of feces falling out of the bodies rectum. That shit happens pretty often. Or it could be that a limb didn't take the embalming fluid very well and is starting to decompose, and that's not always the directors fault. 
[How does your job relate to your personal life and style? Do you consider yourself 'weird'? Are you interested in 'darker' stuff, horror movies, collect skulls, anything like that?

I actually hate horror movies, but I love ""Dark"" movies and movies that make you think. Shutter Island is a good example. Also I love metal, and I played guitar in a couple metal bands that never went anywhere. 
[I hope I'm not too late to the party for this. What do you do when you get a body that was discovered weeks or even a month after the time of death? Does that qualify for an automatic cremation?

One time we went ahead with the embalming and only allowed a private viewing. The other time the family just wanted direct cremation. Which is good...the body was pretty badly decomped at that point.
[What are your/the industry's views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|It depends on the funeral home. The place I did my internship at allowed me to come in looking scruffy with relatively long hair and stuff. The place I'm at now on the other hand makes me shave every day and get a haircut every 2 weeks.
[Edit: Also, any tips on getting an internship at a funeral home after schooling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|But I wouldn't worry too much about it.

[Is it difficult?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|Honestly the best way to get an internship is to just knock on the front door and ask. The internship is the easy part, and its also required for the schooling.

The funeral home I work at is family owned and we've never been dogged by corporate to sell. Even then I don't even think corporate funeral homes are bad. I'd work for one. 
[Sorry to ask another question. How about the restoration of the bodies? They often talk about things that seem rather unorthodox, like cans of cat food under the body to make it look more life-like. How much goes into restoring the bodies? And whats the best restorative work you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wzhm?context=5)|Ask away man. The best restoration I saw actually came out of a different funeral home. It was some politician lady who was in a head on car crash and her face got absolutely destroyed. But because she was a public figure the family wanted an open casket viewing so the funeral home restored this ladies entire face. I know the directors that did it and they took pictures of the whole process to show students, absolutely incredible. They used a series of hidden sutures and wax and she looked ended up looking pretty good.
 |We do unorthodox things I guess. When an autopsy is performed the persons throat is removed so I like rolling up some cotton and sticking in the person throat and then taking another sheet of cotton and rolling it into a ball to make an adams apple. We'll also take empty embalming fluid bottles and put them under their feet to prop them up and stuff like that. While we're dressing them we'll take pieces of tissue paper and stick it under parts of their jacket to make them look ""fuller""
 |A lot of funeral service is strictly visual. And sometimes you just gotta do some weird stuff to get the job done I guess. 
[Do you bury them with that stuff in the casket, or is there a time period in which you can remove it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620k1f?context=5)|Sometimes we get the chance to remove it but we mostly leave it in.

[Is there such a thing as ""coffin riders""? Did you think the show 6 feet under did a good job of showing the realistic issues of the mortuary profession (the job not the family drama\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vw67?context=5)|Never heard of coffin riders. I've heard of Casket divers which is when a grieving family member almost jumps into the casket with the body, never seen it first hand though.
 |6 feet under was okay. Of course it was a little bit sensationalized to be interesting but yeh, some parts of that show are accurate. 
[If you donate your body to the local medical school is it true they pay for the cremation thus saving money for the family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tbzc?context=5)|Correct. You have to wait a year to get the ashes back though and the medical school might not accept the body into their program. 
[What is the cost of cremation as opposed to a traditional burial using the cheapest caskets?  Assuming the medical school didn't accept the body.  I think when I die I'd like to be cremated and have my ashes spread in the ocean or shot into space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621j0h?context=5)|There's a cremation service that will do a direct cremation for a grand. Most funeral homes charge about 2-3 grand for a direct cremation.
 |Also fyi, a body needs to be cremated in a cremation container, doesn't actually have to be a casket. Our crematory requires a minimum of a cardboard box. We don't charge the families anything for it.

I don't want to be buried in some sealed coffin though (e.g.: lead lined or something\).  My understanding is that although you think you'll be kept untouched, in reality anaerobic bacteria get to work in that environment and turn you to slush.

If the baby died during the gestational period then I'll just take a sheet of cotton, soak it in cavity embalming fluid (Really strong fluid) and wrap the baby in it. At that size it's arteries are too small to use for arterial embalming.
 |If it's a larger baby, it's one incisions through the ribs and injecting using the aorta.

Basically you can help filing all paper work, assist at wakes and funerals, and I believe you can even go on removals as long as you're with a licensed director. Some of the corporate funeral homes hire for UFD's because it's just cheaper than hiring a licensed guy.

z7hd6,9,2012-09-01,Smoking out of a hookah; You're Welcome.,FrankCashio,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/z7hd6/smoking_out_of_a_hookah_youre_welcome/,"I've smoked a lot of weed. I've smoked out of Bongs, Vaps, joints, Pipes ect. Just about anything you can think of. By far the best way to smoke weed is out of a hookah. I've done side by side comparisons with my extream Q vape and my weedsha and the weedsha wins hands down. I get higher and the high lasts longer and the flavor profile of the weed really comes through well too. Not Quite to the extent of as the vape but cloes. Also one bowl of weedsha will last for at least an hour.  It's just magic. Anyway, I made an album showing how to make it. Its dead simple just mix a little glycerin with your ground bud. pack it into a bowl and smoke it up. http://imgur.com/a/kHZVz
 in the album it was about a tablespoon of weed and a half teaspoon of glycerin. 

Also you can even smoke the leaves with this. So if you have alot of thoses grind them up add some glycerin and honey. Tates pretty good and you will get pretty toasty with them. 


Sorry about the grammer and spelling errors I wrote this while high. 
Your welcome internet ;)

P.S. This is my Hypothesis on how this works as well as it does. This isn't my field but I am a scientist (Computer Science and Physics). The glycerin has a boiling point of 290 °C all of the cannabinoids vaporize from 180c - 212c. Glycerin is a non-polar solvent and has been used as a replacement for ethanol for making of Botanical extracts. What I think is going on is that the THC CBN and CBD cannabinoids are dissolving into the solution of hot glycerin and part of that will intern get boiled off when you take a hookah rip.  The Glycerin may also be helping in keeping the cannabinoids from breaking down ""Burning"" when you smoke this might also account for why it works so well.

zas93,2,2012-09-03,Teachers: How can I make the best impression as a Student Intern when I visit my 3rd grade class tomorrow? ,Elasti-Girl,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zas93/teachers_how_can_i_make_the_best_impression_as_a/,"So tomorrow is going to be the day I  just visit my classroom where I am placed: a 3rd grade, highly Hispanic populated, ESL classroom. Wednesday will be my actual start day. I read the thread about the teacher interviewing her student teacher tomorrow and I was scared that was me, so I read every suggestion and question that was asked and tried to answer them myself. They were extremely helpful. 

But now I want to ask what can I do to show my eagerness and my devotion and my yearn to learn as much as I can from the very start? Some of my ideas so far:

- introduce myself to the class, talk about my background, why I am there, what I will do, show and tell my excitement; ask my friend to translate some of my introduction to Spanish on paper so that I can read that to the class as well. 
- bring cookies/cupcakes. (What is the rule about bringing snacks now? Does it have to be store bought and packaged?) 
- bring a book to read aloud (if permitted) possibly a dual language book, in Spanish. (my accent is terrible and I don't know many words but I want to show that I am willing to try. Is this a good idea?)

If you have any other suggestions, PLEASE let me know what I can do. This is going to be my second internship, it will not be my student teaching which will be in the spring. If all goes well, fingers crossed, and I like my experience at this school and classroom, I will have the option of staying there in the Spring which would be amazing for my transition and learning experience.

Thank you very much!"

We learn the the infinity's voyage is sabotaged by guilty spark. I believe before cheif destroyed installation 04, guilty spark duplicated himself and shot his duplicate into space (later to be found by the heretics in halo 2) and the original was damaged in his flee from the exploding ring. this means that in halo 3, cheif kills the duplicate, and the infinity picks up the original monitor. If the storm factions are trying to complete the covenants original goal of destroying humanity (before the sidetrack of the great journey/great schism), and seeking the didacts help, then perhaps we are their biggest threat and with us out of the way, they could possibly overthrow the didact, take control of the promethean army and become what they always wanted to be: the keepers of the mantle. Maybe guilty spark wants the force of the infinty to back up the cheif in making sure the didact is protected and with the storm faction defeated, the didact could resume his power and put humanity back in its place. without guilty spak in a monitor casing (residing only in the infinty infastructure) it will be up to cortana to eliminate his presence. this could intern temorarily heal cortana, for i believe halsey is not capable of doing so. there is also mention of surviving precursors, so if the didact lives through halo 4, his priority will be capturing the remaining precursors."

I've always had horrible social anxiety and I decided putting myself out on a limb would be a wonderful way to build character, and it was. I had an amazing time, learned so much about myself, and changed so much as a person. I was right where I wanted to be on my road to recovery.

The problem is that now I am back on the east coast. Settling back into the same environment, it's almost like I settled back into the same old person I was before I left. My old thought habits, my old self-image, they all overpower me. I was very calm, relaxed, and optimistic in LA. However, back here I had my first anxiety attack in a while before I had to move back in to college. I'm also feeling the depression creeping back in. The critic in me, having been mute for a while, has found it's voice again and is picking up right where it left off. I forgot who and how to be the person I was this summer. **Seeing the same people again and the same environment again is somehow reinforcing my old self.**

I keep trying to be positive, but I just can't. My positive thoughts don't affect my emotions and anxiety at all, and trying to think positive just makes me feel more uncomfortable and anxious. I don't know what to do."
z9pfx,2,2012-09-03,Post break up troubles,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z9pfx/post_break_up_troubles/,"My ex-bf [23m] broke up with me [23f] roughly 6 months ago.  He had moved across the country pre-break up, which obviously put a strain on the relationship, but also made the break up slightly easier for me.   Post break up we went through a long patch of not talking because I was traveling and he made little effort to respond to my emails.  When I returned we started talking a bit and eventually he tells me he's seeing someone.  Of course my heart drops a little bit because it hits home, but he's single, so I just tell him he's free to do what he likes.  A couple days later he tells me he broke up with this girl, implying it was because of me, and that the relationship wasn't serious anyway.  We start casually talking more and he begins to sound more and more like a completely different person.  He starts saying superficial things about women he meets, telling me about hot girls at bars and women he's having sex with.  Of course these things bother me, but I just deal with them cause I know he needs to get it out of his system, and hey, it's pretty normal post-break up.  All the while I hadn't been seeing or interested in any men, but when I do finally mention a friend I was interested in (roughly 4 months) he goes crazy.  He gets mad at me because this guy is my friend and says there's more emotional commitment than what he's been doing, which is purely physical.  Then he tells me that he feels like our relationship of 1.5 years meant nothing to me.  I still think this was really unfair of him to say.  I went on one or two dates with said friend, and nothing more. 



All of this culminates into an argument that ends in me essentially yelling at him via fb chat and him blocking me from fb and gchat.  So after a month of no talking, I try to add him on fb and he doesnt respond.  Almost a month after that I send him an email of an article I think he'd be interested in and just say that I hope he's doing well.  He responds, and we share a couple emails back and forth and then it ends.  Then he adds me back on fb.  Then a couple nights ago he ims me and we talk for 3 hours or so.  And it's a really nice conversation, but during the course of it, he asks me if I'm seeing anyone.  I just say no, I'm not, and I change the topic.  I'm not interested in hearing more about his exploits.  Later he goes back to the subject and I say that I went on a couple of dates, but I'm just not ready to be with anybody yet.  That I need some time to be single.  The truth is I'm not completely over my ex, and I don't want to burden other men with that.  Completely unsolicited he tells me about the women he's been seeing and the great sex he's been having.  Honestly this doesn't bother me much at first.  He tells me about this girl he was dating and how they broke up because he was cheating on her.  Then he tells me how he's done with his wild streak and is looking for a nice girl to settle down with.  And I think that's when it started to bother me.  I still remained diplomatic throughout the night, though I was super erked.  The next morning I did something I shouldn't have and I messaged him telling him I didn't ask about the women in his life because I didnt want to know.  And I apologized if it came off dickish sounding, but that was just how I felt.  Of course he didn't respond.  



Today I had something happen with my father and was anxious, worried, in tears, and alone.  I don't have a phone right now, otherwise I would've tried to text or call a friend, so I email him asking if he would talk to me for a bit cause I was feeling frazzled.  He responds right as my mom comes home, though I don't see his response.  I end up talking to my mom for an hour and feel better, but I respond to him anyway and tell him what happened and why I had wanted to talk.  He doesnt respond much and says he has to run to a friend's soon.  After I'm done explaining everything he says that he's hopes everything works out and that he's heading to his friends.  


I was literally in complete shock at this point.  Maybe I shouldn't have been, but I was.  Not even a ""sorry"" or a remote sense of empathy.  Then being fueled up I did another thing I shouldn't have: I said fine, fuck you too.  I can't believe I don't get an ounce of empathy from you.  

It was dumb and it probably satisfied him, but oh well it felt good in the moment.  


Anyway I'm trying to avoid communication, but I feel obligated to check up on him because of his depression and counseling, which few, if any, of his friends know about. I still love him, but I'm not trying to get back together.  We live thousands of miles away from each other and are at different places in our lives, but I still care about him and want to be able to talk casually once in a while.  I just can't understand why he's being so cold and aggressive towards me despite the fact that he's the one getting laid, getting dates, living on his own in a cool city with a super awesome and well paying job and his dream internship.  Honestly anyone looking at the two of us right now would say that he got the better deal.  I still live with my parents, work at a restaurant, and am trying to ""figure out"" the rest of my life.  Also, like I said, less than a hand full of dates and absolutely no hook ups post-break up.  So I can't understand why my ex is being so hostile, especially considering he's usually a very placid man.  Do I really have to completely cut off all contact with him permanently? And HOW do I do that. I think it's been extraordinarily difficult for me because our break up came at a very strange and critical point in my life.  My coworkers are all a bit older, and I'm not really into the part scene so it's difficult for me to meet new people (I made an Okcupid account but have met very very few people from there, and nothing lasting).   

baaagh, I hope this isn't completely stupid. I guess I just need some outside perspective.  


**TL;DR: Ex-bf being hostile in our few and far between conversations, but I can't quite seem to completely let go.**

It seems like an internship would be the best way to get my foot in the door, but when looking at the offerings, most of them seem to require going to school at the same time or being enrolled in a program. 

My question is somewhat open ended. Would it be reasonable to apply for those like one would apply for a job, relying on the strength of your project portfolio? Are there any places where an internship can be acquired where that is not a strict requirement? Or would it be possible/advisable to skip the internship and attempt to go straight to a job, again leading with the portfolio?

Thanks for any advice."

Currently I'm 23 years old and trying to finish college. I did pretty well in high school and managed to get into college and ended up choosing an engineering major without giving too much thought, just because math and physics were my favorite subjects. The college I go to is in my hometown, so I still live with my parents and in the country I live you don't get into huge debts to get into college, so this all led to a situation where I never really needed to get out of my comfort zone.

All this while having social anxiety. Never outgoing in middle school and high school, I was pretty much just the smart kid. I managed to get a group of friends who went through pretty much all of middle school and high school with me, so at least I never had that problem of being bullied or not having any friends, but just because I pretty much grew up with them. 

Never had a girlfriend or even tried to pick up a girl because of how anxious I'd get, always finding a way to rationalize a reason to let it go and maybe next time I'd try something. Parties were a nightmare, the few times I'd go to one, the only thing going through my mind is how to leave as soon as possible.

Then college came and I got worse. Never made any friends, just some acquaintances because I'd avoid going out. Got really fat until last year when I pretty much needed to change all my eating habits. Getting less and less motivated in college because I was never sure if that was what I really wanted or if I could pull through.
Classes were easier because I'd just sign up for them online and show up and study alone for tests but still had a lot of anxiety every time I needed to speak in public, to the point of barely being able to brush my teeth because I felt like throwing up. Without the motivation I was a mediocre student pretty much in all of my classes.

But then came the part of needing internships and building up a resume and this is where I'm fucking everything up. I spent the last 5 years dreading internship interviews and would again rationalize some excuse to avoid it. That it was too soon to get an internship, that I'd need time to study for hard classes, that my classmates that were applying were better anyway so I shouldn't bother...Until I ran out of classes and just needed the experience to graduate. I couldn't even apply anywhere even though I needed to, took me almost a month to gather the courage to start a word document to type my resume, even though it is pretyt much empty. So last semester at the last minute I got something in a college lab with a pretty chill professor because a classmate suggested it. So he recommended me somethings to do, even though I could tell he was doing that just to help me out and never really needed it. And still I went home and started doing, but never feeling it was good enough to go back and show him, and the more the time passed the more I thought I needed to do and felt anxious about going back. Long story short, I spent the semester doing pretty much nothing worthwhile. So now here I am with a new semester starting up and I have to clean up my own mess and stop being a piece of shit.

At the end of July I went to a psychiatrist by myself and told her this stuff and she diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, prescribing some meds and that I should see a therapist too. I didn't want to start the medication without talking to my family first about everything, so of course here we are at the beginning of september, I avoided this completely and I'm pretty sure the prescriptions are not even valid anymore and I was too scared to take the meds anyway.

I feel like my life has been falling apart while everyone else thinks I have it all figured out, an aspiring engineer about to graduate and everything while I know I'm messing everything up. And the worst thing is that I don't think social anxiety and depression are things people get, and telling all this I would just seem like some whiney spoiled dude who can't man up, and even I doubt I'm not just trying to make excuses for myself.

I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here, just needed to vent, I guess. I don't really feel like proof reading this, so sorry if this is terrible to read if you made it this far."

I already bought the previous one but it might not be too late to cancel, but I just wanted to see if anyone can confirm because I know barely anything when it comes to laptops. If the performance is going to be the same on the Intel machine, then I'll just stick with that.

Bear with me, it's pretty long. TL;DR at the bottom.

In my last year of highschool, I started going out with the girl of my dreams. Short red hair, athletic frame, rabid curiosity, loves learning new things, ... on and on about all the things I love in a girl. She ended it as I was about to go to college and she had another year left. We had both said that we believed we were in love with one another, and I at the very least really truly meant it. 
 
A couple of months later, she was dating another guy. I felt betrayed by her and so I went about proving to myself that I could find a replacement for her. In about 2 months, I had something like 30 girl's phone numbers that I had never called (and later felt like a jerk for it) and yet felt no better about the situation. 

In October of that year, I met a pretty cool girl who I got along really well with. At this point, I just wanted to move on and so another relationship felt like a way to do that. Me and this new girl, henceforth known as October, started dating in January. We dated for a few months, but me coming ""out of the closet"", so to speak, as an atheist really hurt our relationship (as she was Catholic) and almost caused it to end at that moment.

That summer I did end it, because she is actually a very needy soul. (Wants boyfriend time, all the time) I wanted to spend time with my family and working, not four hours a day on a cellphone talking about some coworking being dumb and saying ""I wuv u"" back and forth. During the summer, I went on a mission trip with DreamGirl (who had become single) and her church. Aside from all the awkward Jesus Camp moments, it was a really awesome trip and I got really close to her again. After the trip, she would come over to my place and we would lay on the ground and talk as we pointed out cloud shapes. I was falling head over heels for her again and I knew it. Anyday, I was going to ask her back out. About that time, October called.

Her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and I was the only person she could talk to about it. Though I'm not the most empathetic soul, I tried to console her as her life was seemingly falling apart. I didn't know what to do. She was still after me, her mother was at stage four, and I just wanted DreamGirl. I thought I'd decide this when I got back to college.

Only that didn't happen. October comes over to my new apartment, and out of weakness I am seduced into kissing her. I fall right back into the same pit that I had clawed my way out of earlier in the year. DreamGirl falls away as I am trying to deal with October in a way that lets everyone win. Problem is, there isn't one. After a couple of months of badgering, crying, and begging to get back with me... I consent. DreamGirl falls away as I allow October to shut her out of my life and gets a new boyfriend. Even so, I occasionally text DreamGirl for hours at a time about anything and everything. October finds out, and bars me from talking to her. I do it anyways behind her back. 

A few months later, October's sister is diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. She is distraught, sometimes says things about self-harm, but refuses to talk to a professional because ""I'm not crazy"". I turn 21. One night she stays over, we lose our virginity together. Puritanical upbringing of taking a girl's/losing one's own virginity creates cycle self-loathing/feelings of responsibility to her. Give October a promise ring out of those feelings, knowing it's a bad idea for both of us. DreamGirl is still with the guy she met last year.

Over the course of the next year. October refuses to have sex again because ""she is scared of a condom breaking"" (Catholic and doesn't use any form of birth control) and her family members with cancer have varied results with chemo. I am depressed, because my GPA dropped/lost my scholarships, I was stuck in a relationship I didn't want, and the girl I'm actually in love with is still with another guy, and I didn't see an end to any of it. 

Using my people skills, I land an awesome internship for that summer. A lot of verbal abuse, lack of appreciation, and differences in lifestyle leads me to break up with October. I finally explode on her about all the shit she's put me through and how I was sick of being treated that way. I resolved myself to staying away from her. I blocked her number from my phone. Would still get 20 calls a day for a couple of weeks. Worked my hours, lived life. Over the course of the summer, I wrote DreamGirl a long letter telling her how she was the girl who got away. She sends a response saying that she is sure that I will find a girl that will be able to fulfill all my needs like she couldn't. How can I tell her that she was, is, and will be more than I could ever want? 

October and I are heavily involved in the same orgainization. I'm the Treasurer, she's the President. Business necessitates us talking. She talks about how she's changed, how this summer was a eureka moment for her. Moments of self-awareness blah blah blah. The comfort of a woman's body and the promise of a changed soul draws me back into the arms of October, but my eyes still look and see my DreamGirl. I run into her on campus, we flirt, I want to think something is there. I don't know if there is for her, however. I want to tell her that I still love her, but ruining the fragile friendship we currently have would be almost too much for me to bear right now. Hope keeps me going. But at some point, hope must give way to reality. Only reality involves her boyfriend of almost two years...

Should I give up on them both?
Should I chase Dream Girl?
Should I trust October?

What's a guy to do in this sort of situation?


TL;DR: I'm a dumbass who let the girl of his dreams walk away on multiple different occasions and is constantly being sucked into a relationship with someone who probably is no good for me no matter how much I want/try to leave it. I don't know if I should just walk away from both of them, chase Dream Girl (who currently has a boyfriend), or trust that the girl who says that she has changed has, indeed, changed.

zc9q9,1,2012-09-04,My Boss is (possibly) terminally ill and the staff can't continue to keep the company afloat in her absence. What do we do???,thisisjustterrible,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zc9q9/my_boss_is_possibly_terminally_ill_and_the_staff/,"Okay, so here's what's happening...

I have be a ""freelance"" employee of a very small (less than 5 staff) office for about 2.5 years. Earlier this year I went from a full time to part time position because I got another job. I put freelance in quotes above because we have never been treated as freelancers despite that being our title. Basically she called us that for taxes and so she didn't have to offer us any benefits. Why stay in such a job? It was in my field, which has freakishly limited opportunities where I live, I'm newer to the industry, and I needed the work.

The set up of the company is The Owner, and below her The Assistants. The Owner is the figure head of the company. None of The Assistants has the credentials or professional title that The Owner has. None of The Assistants has worked with her for more than three years. 

Since early this year, The Owner has gotten sick. Very sick. She won't tell any of us the full details of her condition or what if any prospect there is of recovery. I gather from her vague answers to questions (or avoidance of them) that it is possible that she is terminally ill. There is a myriad of things wrong with her it would seem. She hasn't been in the office more than 5 times in the last 6 months. She stopped talking to anyone on the phone as well (this appears to be in part because of her condition) and now only communicates via email, and the majority of her emails for months and months were full of vitriol and just the meanest things, quite out of character. I'm the only person that has seen her in about 3 months, only because I went to her house to bring her mail (so I can verify she really is sick). She talked to me a bit. She is pretty much going through every stage of grief. She is angry all the time, she is really young and most of the health stuff shouldn't be happening to someone her age. 

But we The Assistants are in quite the pickle. Well not me so much, I have the opportunity to go full time at my other job, so my only vested interest is the well-being of the Owner and other Assistants. We want to be there to help The Owner, but she is making it practically impossible. She is frustrated that the company isn't bringing in money, but she keeps giving discounts and none of us is in the position to pursue new clients because we all lack the credentials. We aren't comfortable making sales calls because we feel pretty morally icky selling our company's services when we can't guarantee the longevity of the company. She has put the entire responsibility of the company in the hands of her one full time Assistant, a girl with less than a year's experience in our industry. And then she wonders why the Assistant is stressed and upset and wants to pursue other job options. It's their right to know what the future of the company is so if they need to look for other work they can. 

We have all given her so much and want so badly to help her because we like her and all have a lot of time and energy invested in this small company. 

Her full time Assistant just put in her two weeks notice. I'm actually at a point were I am working almost freelance-ish, so I can just walk away. But we still feel this obligation to help. What do you do when a small business has to close because the owner is sick? What if she can't pay her medical bills? Has this happened to anyone else? Anyone had to close a business due to illness? I'm saying close because at this point she has no one to run the office for her. And I cannot imagine her interviewing and training new people, she's too sick. She's known that the full time Assistant has been wanting to look into other areas of our business for a while, really since she started working with us (she started as an intern but this was actually never her career path of choice, just sort of a foot in the door, God bless her for sticking it out as long as she has). 

We can't just wash our hands of it, is there anything we can do to make this situation better?

TL;DR Boss of a very small business is possibly terminally ill and the staff can no longer keep the company afloat in her absence. How can we help?"

First of all, I'm European, male, 26 years old, just gotten my Master's in Computer Sciences 2 months ago. I took 2 years longer than the rest of my peers, never really had straight A's and had to deal with a massive burnout in the last few months. Now I'm supposed to look for a job, but I haven't dared to send out my CV yet, as I'm just not convinced I'm really good at anything in this field. I know lots of things and can have very insightful moments, but I equally mess up immensely from time to time (something bad happened on my internship), so that has had a terrible effect on my confidence to apply for jobs requiring a MSc. degree. As you might have guessed, my self confidence is very, very low and that episode on the internship really shook me. IMO it wasn't even my fault, I got the blame though. Bad communication, even worse planning by the manager and him yelling obscenities instead of finding out what was going wrong were the root causes IMO. Also, I've only recently begun learning how to drive a car, while I'm making good progression, I can't yet go everywhere I want to go.

My skills are the following (From strongest to weakest):

 
C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, XML, Java, Android, HTML5, JSON, REST and SOAP webservices, C++, Wordpress, Drupal, QT, WP7.5

Since my internship my main focus has shifted towards Android/Java on Ubuntu rather than web development.

Furthermore I do know my way around in OO-programming and have a good understanding of Software Design Patterns and Project Management.


From the looks of it, it's more a psychological issue than a skill-related issue, anyone else have experience with this? How do you deal with it?


Any advice is welcome!"
zbzxa,0,2012-09-04,So I broke up with my girlfriend after 4 years when she was abroad and now i deeply regret that decision.

From there on everything between us went straight downhill. It began with her doubting of being still in love with me followed by me losing faith in our whole relationship.
Long story short: we broke up 2 and a half months into her internship.
A fews days after that i started to realise this was a big mistake (at least for me) and now I'm going to try getting her back when her internship ends next month.

Within my circle of friends this created some kind of controversy since some of my friends fully support my attempts, others believe that getting back together never ends well and the rest stands in between.. That's why I decided to ask you reddit:



Do you think it is possible to get back together with a former love? Is it in the long term?

Did you ever try to start a 'comeback'? How did it work out so far?

I moved away from new jersey to complete an internship in florida a few months ago. I have a long term (3 years) boyfriend [24] in NJ; we both decided that an open relationship would be the best for us while I was away for a year.

I started dating another guy [25] about a month after I moved here. I like being in a relationship more than just sleeping around. My boyfriend from home knew I started seeing this guy.

After about a month of dating this new guy, he turned into a stage 5 clinger. If I didn't answer his phone call, he would call me literally 10 more times, text me another 40 times, etc, and wouldn't stop until I called him back. If I texted him back, he would just blow up my phone until I called him. He was emotionally abusive with this, accusing me of cheating on him when I didn't answer, calling me a bitch, slut, whore etc, threatening to break up with me unless I called him.

I could put up with all of that. It was stressful, but I could just roll my eyes and forget about it. Now hes physically abusive. My long-term boyfriend doesn't know about the abuse, my roommates are starting to catch on.

I don't want to be in this relationship, but I'm terrified and I just don't know how to even go about getting out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. My long-term boyfriend and parents are coming to visit me in a month and I'm afraid what will happen if I'm still stuck in this relationship when they come.

Reddit, I ask for your help! I don't know anyone here other than my roommates, co-workers, and my abusive boyfriend. I have no one else to turn to. I do live in a gated apartment complex with security, so I do have some sort of safe-haven to turn to. But, I often find my boyfriend waiting for me outside my complex when I walk to the bus stop to go to work if I don't answer his calls.

**tl;dr- I'm in an abusive relationship and I don't know what to do.**

zbo7t,1,2012-09-04,Advice for a copywriting intern,[deleted],copywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/copywriting/comments/zbo7t/advice_for_a_copywriting_intern/,"I'll be starting a copywriting internship soon for a relatively new ad agency, and I'm very excited about it. The creative director has taken a personal interest in me, and has plans on hiring me if the internship works out. However, he also told me that internships like this are difficult for him because it's hard to think up of ways to keep interns busy. That worries me, because I've been hearing that for most internships in ad agencies, an intern should go above and beyond what is expected of him or her and always make sure they have things to do. I really want to be kept busy and prove that I'm a hardworker, but I'm afraid that there just might not be a lot for me to do and I may end up a nuisance.

I guess my question is, how can I make the most out of this internship without becoming a burden? Should I volunteer to get coffees for everyone, clean up the break room, etc. when there's no copywriting stuff to be done? Or would that be too weird?"

The downsides to my situation are that I live at home with my grandma, I hit a rough patch bouncing between a few different jobs this past month so I don't have much money, I do not have any close friends that live near me, I have no girlfriend, there are no men in my family so I am constantly surrounded by women who hen peck me because I am the only guy, my Dad is super busy with two businesses so we rarely get time to hang out, my mom moved to 200 miles away when I was a kid.

So whenever I go out, and I try to meet a girl that is my age, I do not attract the attention that I want. The girls that I think could be interested in me are not, and it bums me out. It would be great to have the support of a significant other that is my age and has the same struggles. Unfortunately what seems to keep happening, is that I keep attracting older women, and not by choice. 

When I was younger and in college, I was enticed by the idea of a ""cougar"" but I am really not anymore, and I want to have a meaningful relationship. I had girlfriends in college, but now all I can seem to get is casual sex with cougars. Not all of them are great looking, or good in bed (many have this idea that these older women are awesome in bed and more experienced, hate to burst the bubble, but people are the same no matter what the age). 

I am working hard to get my money right and get my own place, but I feel like that is not really the problem. I feel like it is more the way I carry myself, I don't know why girls my age are not as into me, even when I go out and cold approach women, I feel like I am largely ignored. Maybe living with my grandma has aged my soul a little bit, and the hen pecking has hurt my confidence...maybe moving out will be better for me to get in touch with my young self again. 

 have been looking at other things like /r/confidence and /r/getmotivated which have helped, and I have been trying really hard to get it together.

I know this isn't the place to ask for advice, but this is a place for long rants....so I figured I could come here to get this off my chest.

He then looked at me and said my look is a big problem, and being white is going to bring me a lot of issues.

I'm an intern for CenSoC (The Center for the Study of Choice) at the University of Technology, Sydney. We are currently doing a project involving various structures that implement ""Follow the Leader"" type dynamics. We look to see if the choices that people make are dependent on the influence of ""leaders"" in their community, and try to analyze why this is/is not an attribute of the community.

We would like to do some simple data mining through the Reddit API, since Reddit is already effectually a simple choice experiment (upvotes/downvotes). We were planning on collecting content and user data to see how they influence each other, however, we hit a snag:

If we try to request user info one at a time, with a 2 second delay between each, the time taken to collect all of the data would be overdrawn. We have been considering restructuring the data mining approach, but we also wanted to know if a patch would be simple enough to allow GET requests by_id. Something of this nature:
    


in the file which implements GET username about API:    

    /r2/r2/controllers/listingcontroller.py, line ~679

to go from something like this:
    

    def GET_about(self, vuser):

        ...

        return Reddit(content = Wrapped(vuser)).render()

        ...

to something like the following, where the username(s) url portion is split using regex (much like in the 'by_id' api code):

    reddit.com/user/userA,userB,userC/about.json

... and then looped on the server-side appending to the returned http response without having to re-initiate the http request/response every time:

    def GET_about(self, usernames):

        ...    
        splitter = re.compile('[ ,]+')    
        return Reddit(content = [Wrapped(x) for x in in splitter.split(usernames)]).render()    
        ...
    

obviously, the correct Python-syntax and various variable-validation in reddit arch. will be necessary, but the logic of the above, albeit incorrect Python-syntax-wise, remains.

    

Would something like this be feasible? We currently don't have any team members who are well-versed in Python, and we also don't know how things look on Reddit's end.

Moving back I figured things would change. We'd see each other so much more, be happier together. Really, nothing has changed. She's busy with grad school and I've got an internship. Even though We have time, we have seen each other maybe 5-6 times in the past few weeks.

I once put my shoe on the bed rail on top of the bed skirt to tie it and that sparked a huge uproar about how I am a ""filthy person"" because I put my shoes on the bed. I was told to move my shoes off the ottoman despite the fact that her roommate's dog lays and licks the ottoman constantly.

I am a dog person, I have to have a dog when I am able to get one. You dog people will understand you can't just get any dog, it has to be the right kind of dog for you. It has to be an inside/outside dog because nothing is better than having a dog (or any animal) with you hanging out watching tv. She is completely against having a dog because it will shed. She's more worried about cleaning where as I don't care if I'm covered in dog hair because I have the company of an animal who doesn't judge. 

 Little things like that add up and make me tiptoe around when I do things so I don't upset her but then I can't live the way I would normally live. 

Let me have it, Reddit."

I've traveled across Europe and I also think it would be cool to live there. Moving to another country seems like a daunting task, so I would like to live somewhere else in the US before leaving.

I'm 20 years old and currently attending a university. The thing is I live with my parents and I commute 40 minutes to school. They won't help me in getting my own place because they're just strict and overprotective in general. I would like to move to another city in the US that has affordable living and somewhere I can get by without a car. I've heard Portland and Denver fit this description. I really really do not want to stay in this city for another two years. I'm willing to transfer to another university if I can get loans.

My plan would be to possibly look for a roommate and a job. I did a 1 year internship at an IT firm (mostly doing routing and infrastructure). I also know some Java and C++. Any advice on how I can move out would be appreciated."

zekxj,25,2012-09-05,Career Dilemma: I don't want to do Graphic Design anymore. What now?,abqcub,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/zekxj/career_dilemma_i_dont_want_to_do_graphic_design/,"So here’s my dilemma and a little background. I received my Associates Degree in Graphic Design (emphasis in print) in ‘09 and was on the track to pursuing Graphic Design as a career and eventually work my way up the ranks to Creative Director or something similar. I knew how to use the software and was usually at the top of my class in terms of design skill. I wanted to pursue my education further so I’m currently working on my Bachelors in Advertising and Studio Art (Double Major) to fill in the holes that my Associates left out. I had it set in stone that this was going to be my life, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about it.

I’ve done the freelance thing, and also worked as an in-house Designer/Prepress for a local print shop, and now currently work as a Marketing Intern at the University. All this “real world” experience has taught me that I don’t think I’m cut out to be a designer, or rather it’s something I no longer wish to pursue because its taken a negative impact on my life.

This idea is mostly due to the fact that dealing with clients and my boss in regards to designing has left me feeling incredibly frustrated everyday. I know dealing with said people is part of the job and there’s no way to get around it, and that as designers we just suck it up and learn to deal with frustrating people while at the same time working on our communication skills to convince the client that as an experienced professional we know what's best and thats why we were hired. 

What's happened now is that all the creativity and inspiration has just been sucked out of me. Designing has become a chore, and I find myself blatantly ripping off others designs just to churn out work and get the project over with. There’s no more enthusiasm, no more sense of accomplishment, just an empty feeling that leaves me staring at a blank InDesign document.

So I graduate in December and I’ve come to the conclusion that what I enjoyed was the innovation, thinking outside the box, and fitting all the puzzle pieces together in a design. The more artistic part has just been something I don’t care to pursue anymore. 

Now the big question is what do I do with all this education and training? How can I transition from Graphic Designer to something else? How do I market these skills to take my career in a different direction? I ask you wonderful people of reddit if you have any experience or advice that could send me in a new direction. Any ideas for jobs or areas of interest that I can focus on? I know no job is perfect, and there's always going to be bad days and bad people to work with, but I think I can do a little better than the rut I’m in now. So please save the negativity and criticism I see so much on here, I’m really facing a daunting life change.


**tl;dr** - Spent six years wanting to be a Graphic Designer, but no longer feel the same. Now I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, and I graduate in four months and want to hit the ground running. What do I do with all my experience? 

***update*** -  I appreciate all the outpouring of support, I really do, but I would like to discuss more alternatives to a career in design. I know my employers suck and that it's not all like that, and that I just need to find inspiration to keep me going. I just don't feel like this is the right path for me, but I don't want to waste all the time and money I sank into school and jobs

***Update 02/07/2013***
*Apparently people are still finding this, so I'm posting my latest response to user clydefrogforever which I think wraps up this post:*

Wow, I'm surprised people are still finding and replying to this.

Thanks for all the support and kind words, but as you can probably see from the rest of the post I've made up my mind. Recent developments since this post have been that I did graduate and had to resign my position as the Marketing Intern since I'm no longer a student. I've spent 2 months job searching and living off savings. I applied for many positions, mostly marketing but a few design positions as well. The design positions were more light work, such as doing book layout and cover illustration, real easy stuff.

I received nothing besides ""we regret to inform you"" messages, had a grand total of three portfolio views, granted my portfolio was thrown together and doesn't have nearly enough examples which is completely my fault. There's no market in my area, and my state (New Mexico) is ranked among the highest for unemployment, and ranks lowest in new job creation. I've applied to jobs in other states but with no luck because I figure most are trying to hire local and quickly. I also have the added disadvantage of looking like some 21-22 yr old kid who just graduated, because I indeed did just graduate. What doesn't carry through is that I'm 27, which may not seem like a big deal but it can work in my advantage that I'm older and possibly have more experience than a typical recent grad, and indeed I do have more experience than most of my graduating class in the same fields.

**End of story now;** I ran out of savings to live off of and just need to pay bills, so yesterday I interviewed to be a Barista at Starbucks. I figure its pretty much a given job right now because my partner is a well respected employee at the hotel the Starbucks is licensed and housed in. The company is really big on promoting from within and so far just from the interviews I impressed everyone with my knowledge and drive for furthering my career. While this hotel does not have a marketing department due to budget constraints, I hope to work my way into the small amount of marketing they have and eventually move to another hotel that does have a better marketing department.

Is this what I had in mind when I set out to push myself in school? No, not at all. It took some time to realize that this may be the best way to start a career. Start out in the mail room if you catch that old saying. This economy and job market is awful. I had high and unrealistic expectations. My lack of desire to keep designing bled out into a desire to not want to do anything anymore and made my life and dreams crumble. I picked my ass up though and reprioritized what was important. In a few days I'll hopefully have a job, I have a partner who cares for me, friends who care for me, I realized I'm in the same situation as many of my peers and people with much more skill than me. I think if I just work hard, show people what I can do, open my mind to different possibilities as far as a career, then I'll be fine. I'm optimistic about the future, even if its not my dream job.

Sometimes you just need to move on, and maybe that thing you thought you wanted so bad was just getting in the way of something better. "
zek8v,8,2012-09-05,I never thought I would be this mad at you.,pissinthewind,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zek8v/i_never_thought_i_would_be_this_mad_at_you/,"Now that it's over its easy to chastise myself for making the mistake of getting back together. You struggled with distance before, but you never betrayed me. You know my history, the last time I was in a serious relationship I was engaged, and when times got rough she gave me an ultimatum I couldn't accept. It wasn't cheating, but I thought of that as a betrayal. When we started you knew I was a forgiving person. I wasn't mad at my ex, but I told you that I have no tolerance for betrayal.

But you convinced me. We've known each other for two years now, and you said you hated denying what we were to each other. I loved you, you loved me,  and you were confident that after so much time thinking this way, that you could handle distance again. 

Then two nights ago happened. You go back to College, one closer to me, that I would be able to visit semi-regularly, at least. Things were looking good, you were away from the people that gave you so many problems, I have internship opportunities coming up soon, money coming in, we could have made it work. Instead you chose to spread your legs wide open on the very first goddamn night.

I'm not usually a mad person. I harbor no ill-will towards any of my exes. Except you, now. You were the first one to cheat on me, and that it was so easy for you. Or that you were so easy. Never in any other break-up in my life have I wanted to say so much more than ""Its all over"". I couldn't believe you had the gall to ask me where we stood, saying you and he both felt terrible. 

I have to admit, I thought I was prepared for this, not that you knew I was thinking that. Maybe that was part of the problem, maybe it would have just ended sooner if I had admitted a couple weeks ago that I was still worried you would succumb to temptation while you were away. But even I didn't think it would happen on the first night. 

I thought I could handle this, if it happened. I would just immediately move on, after all, there are plenty of good looking, nice girls in my classes at my own college, and this is my last year where it will really be this easy to meet new women. You've made me madder at a single person than I've ever been before. I never thought I could really think of someone as a lying cheating whore before, like I think of you. 

Whenever I do a voice in my head says that there are good things there, the same things I saw before. And most of them are still there, but I'll be damned if there worth anything now that you have ruined yourself. Sometimes I just hope you fuck all the guys on your floor, so they all know how easy you are, and that they should stay the fuck away. 

Why the hell am I so fucking mad at you?"
zejjr,0,2012-09-05,22F moving in with 23M. How do I avoid making current roommates and parents angry about my decision? ,roseangela13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zejjr/22f_moving_in_with_23m_how_do_i_avoid_making/,"I [22F] have been dating my [23M] boyfriend for almost 3 years. We both graduated college in May. I've been living in a house my parents own and bought for me to live in while attending school. Since I graduated, I've been paying rent. I have two roommates: one ex-best friend turned acquaintance for unrelated reasons and one current best friend who both also pay rent. 

Boyfriend was supposed to be away at an internship from July to October. Ended up finding a paid job so he came back early and just moved into his own place. He and I had planned on moving in together in December, but with the way things have changed, we'd like to move in together in October (he's going to have a tough time affording the place alone and I'm going to be starting a new well paying plus benefits job). 

Problem: I had told my parents and roommates I'd be living in the house until December. I don't want to piss anyone off. Pros for living with boyfriend: boyfriend's new place would be cheaper than what I pay now plus it's closer to my office. I also have been having a really tough time living with this ex-bestie turned acquaintance and my parents are extremely overbearing and I've been ready for a while to move out. I also have been ready to live with my boyfriend for a while. We have plans to get engaged within the next few months. However, I know my roommates feel that I have betrayed them and I have yet to talk to my parents about this change, and am not ready for their wrath. 

Extra info: I have a sister who will be moving in in December with her own roommates, so me moving out in December was inevitable anyways. Both current roommates are moving out in December. Parents don't make a profit on the house, so roommates' rent won't go up.

Any suggestions? I also don't want to make my boyfriend's life harder or make him feel shoved aside by not moving in with him now (as he wants). 

TL;DR: Moving out of house earlier than planned to move in with boyfriend. How do I not piss off roommates and parents (homeowners)? "
zeefl,1,2012-09-05,For-Profit School Bounceback?,Envoke,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/zeefl/forprofit_school_bounceback/,"So, /r/ITdept, I was the unfortunate victim of a bad experience at a state university, and ended up at a for-profit school, which will remain unnamed. Let me give you guys a little backstory.

I went to the state college and attempted a comp-sci degree. Unfortunately, they focused on the programming and software engineering aspect of comp. sci, and offered little to no lab or hands on courses that let you delve into the networking or actual physical aspect of IT. It was extremely math-heavy on the front end, and after speaking with the chair of that department, was told that any hands-on or physical classes took place senior year as internships only.

I was hurt, because I'm not a programmer, and really find myself hitting a brick wall when it comes to the stuff, and ended up changing to a different major, then having to pull out of school a year later due to financial issues.

Cut to 2 years ago. I enrolled in a local for-profit university, mainly because I was guaranteed financial aid, and 2 years later graduated top of my class with an associates, and a+ cert. My teachers all worked in the field, and I got a great education from the place; I got a job working the help desk at a massachusetts based healthcare organization, and couldn't be happier. Sure, I'm in an assload of debt, but it got me to where I wanted with the knowledge I need.

Now though, I find myself at this crossroad. I really want to go back to school, and after calling a couple colleges and investigating online, found that none of my associates credits will transfer, and theres nothing I can do about it. I can go back to the for-profit school and deal with the fact that I'll be facing Harvard-like financial burden for a bachelors degree, or I can start over at a state or private university in MA.

What do you, the IT professions of Reddit recommend for someone like me? I love the hands on, troubleshooting aspect, and server management, but when it comes to general software engineering, I could never be a script monkey. I know I will eventually need to learn code to do basic functions, and I'm willing to accept that, but I can't do that for a living. What programs do you guys recommend? Do I just suck it up and go straight comp-sci and be unhappy doing the programming for the 4 years while I get my shit together, but have an applicable degree, go back to the for-profit and learn the hands-on lab stuff I want, or are there alternate programs available that I'm just not seeing?

Thanks for any help :)"

Shaniqua and I met a few months ago, we really hit it off great. We get along well, laugh together all the time, and we have about 95% of the same interests. In an ideal world, we would have been dating, but about two weeks into knowing Shaniqua, I found out she had a boyfriend of three years.

Often times we would spend 10-12 hours a day together. For a while, we would always hang out, but her boyfriend would always be around too. It's not that her boyfriend made me uncomfortable, he's a decent human being...but it really sucked because of how I felt about her. It was almost like I was getting teased. I mean...wouldn't you guys hate being around the person you're crushing hard on, as well as their SO? It's just sucky.

Because it was harder to keep it in than it would be to face the consequences of telling her, I told her how I felt. I also told her that I felt as if I was getting some mixed signals. I stressed that I was expecting nothing, I just needed to get it off my chest. I also told her fully well knowing that this might be the end of my friendship, and was willing to accept that if need be.

She wasn't upset at all...she was very understanding, and said that she wouldn't let anything get in the way of our current relationship. She also immediately told her boyfriend. The eerie thing is that neither of them were upset. Her boyfriend was like, ""yea it's cool dude I would have told her too...wanna hang out?"" Like, wat? Is this guy even a guy? I'm not really friends with him in the first place. Anyway, I digress...

She had told me in a different world things would be different between us, but she just can't drop her boyfriend for someone she recently met. I understand that. I get it, really, I do. I wouldn't want her to, because then it would make me paranoid.

Anyway, since she stopped being an intern at where I work, I have seen her a lot less. We text and chat once in a while, but it's not the same, which is probably for the best. I've been happy about things for a while now after a brief really sucky period, but just the other day she texted me wanting to go out for some dinner and hang out time later this week. 

Without even thinking, I said I would love to and setup a date and time. I haven't seen her in two weeks, but as much as I want to, I know I shouldn't. I know it's disrespectful to her, her boyfriend, as well as myself for seeing her when I know I still have feelings for her. I know that, in a relationship, **we would never be compatible** because she values religion so much, and I could honestly give two fucks. I know all this, yet the burning desire is there and it's hard to handle.

Now I know that the right thing for me to do would be to call this off, because I've already made it clear that being ""just friends"" with this woman is just going to be too difficult.

Women of reddit, why is the right thing to do so hard?

**TL;DR: Met amazing girl, girl has boyfriend, get mixed signals, tell her how I felt not expecting anything, we distance a little while then she keeps asking me to hang out...I reluctantly say yes but know I should have said no and need to stop contact**"

Never doubt that.  I have seen a congressman make a 3 star general wait in the lobby because the head of the local PTA was visiting.

Global reach is expanding.  There is going to be some friction.  With destructive power going up that means people are going to die.  But hopefully, after some time and exposure we all learn to live with each other a bit more.  As long as people keep thinking every meteorite shower is a message from God we are going to have problems.

Great comment.  I don't think anyone wants conflict.  The issue is going to be whether we can manage a peaceful rise of China.  Remember there are factions in EVERY government.  Military, diplomatic, intelligence, legislative, etc.  It's like a car speeding down the highway with everybody grabbing at the wheel.

I think I'm one of the few space supporters that is not worried about the NASA budget. Considering we are coming out of a recession they did pretty well.  Also, there is enough waste in the space community to make up for the budget cuts (and more)
[B\) What do you see is the biggest threat to the United States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63epyc?context=5)|B.

But a superpower is more than an economy and military.  Great nations must export ideas.  That is ultimately why the Soviet Union crumbled.  People just didn't like what they had to offer.  This is also China's problem for the future.
[The more we use them for cheap labor, the sooner we are enabling them to surpass us by not only pumping money into their economy and out of ours, but every worker we hire there must meet a certain level of qualification.

How long can this continue before chinas middle class becomes as complacent as our and they start exporting jobs to here for cheap labor from our growing number of slums.  Isn't our education system already behind them and plenty of other countries if you don't account for college levels? How long can we do that until the affects are too difficult to reverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63vlau?context=5)|I think they are a ways from the scenario you've developed.  The CPC has been trying very hard to develop an internal economic infrastructure to develop domestic consumer demand.  But they really don't have a middle class yet.  Our educational systems suffers but it is not because of lack of resources, teacher pay or some other crap.  We pay more per student (K-12) than any other nation.  It is a cultural issue that is hurting us.

Most people are very limited in their definition - GNP.  Even if China's economy surged past ours their (larger) population would (per capita) probably be making only 1/5th of what the average US workers makes.  They have a few decades before they will be a blue water navy, so they have very limited force projection capabilities. They have no appealing political model.  Certainly no judicial model anyone would wants (other than dictators).  It is anyone's guess as to what their economic model will look like.  For any country to be considered a global power all these aspects will play a role.  India is pretty far behind as well.

Is this something you agree will generate political tension between major powers in the near future? If so, are you willing to say how you think that might play out?

There will always be an evolving set of defenses and new offensive techniques.  I speculate this will be the future of warfare along with advanced robotics.  People are getting very tired of shedding their blood (of that of their kids/parents etc.).  We will move towards forms of conflict that allow us (everyone) to wage war with minimal loss of one's own population. Cyber is in the lead here.

Since this is a documented public incident, I accept it as fact.  With that admission, I'll just cut to it: in your opinion, are off-planet cultures monitoring the United States Space Program?

zdifs,1,2012-09-04,[22m] Girlfriend back from internship in other state.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zdifs/22m_girlfriend_back_from_internship_in_other_state/,"The girl that I love had an internship on the other side of the country this summer. We went into it together and absolutely in love with each other. About a quarter of the way through she told me that she was interested in taking a break because she felt as though she wasn't in the moment enough. A few weeks later I went on a pre-planned trip to see her. Things were absolutely amazing for both of us. After the trip, we started the break. The summer was great for her. She met a ton of new friends and started dating a guy out there. We had planned on getting back together from the conception of the idea. Now, two-months after I visited her, she has returned. She's unsure if she wants to pick things back up because she felt something for someone else and because she's interested in taking a year LOA from school to travel abroad.

I should say that when we were together, everything was perfect. We never fought and everyday was full of laughs and interesting conversation.

I think that since what we had was so great that we should finish off this semester strong. I want her to be happy and I want her to adventure and explore but I really think that we should end things between us right.

Should I fight for us or should I just shrug off the best relationship of my life?

tl;dr: The girl I love loves me but the timing is awful."
zd9vu,2,2012-09-04,I'm unhappy in my relationship. But I'm not throwing in the towel yet. (Wall of Text incoming!),badjellydawitch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zd9vu/im_unhappy_in_my_relationship_but_im_not_throwing/,"We've been going out for two years, one of which was in a long-distance relationship. She has some pretty big insecurities physically, which were not helped by me looking up porn, saying that I check out other girls etc. (The latter was when I was unaware of these issues, the former has happened several times.)

Call it a hunch, but I believe 90% of the issues we have stem from this. She gets really worked up over small things (leaving a few crumbs on the counter, for example), has called me a ""fucking idiot"", as well as ""disgusting"", ""untrustworthy"", and other similar terms (the last two related to busted-watching-porn issues.) She got angry with me when I told her that I was loving my intern job back home, and that I might take them up on the offer if they gave me a full-time job. (Dream job.) She was adamant that I'd move to her since she was going to apply for her dream job, but she wouldn't do the same for me. She didn't get her dream job in the end; I was offered mine but I turned it down to live with her. Something I kick myself over way too fucking much.

I help her out at her work every morning before I go to mine. I don't get paid a dime, and it's often here where she gets really mad at me over little things.

Granted, I'm not perfect. When she came back from a flight in the weekend, I was absent-minded, and didn't offer to take her bags for her. Not only that, but I left my wallet in the car, so she had to pay for that. (I paid her back, but that seems to be beside the point). I kept getting busted with the porn thing - and although I believe it's not a big deal personally, I gave it up. (/r/nofap was the lynchpin to this, the potential of an improved relationship was more of a plus than a driving factor. I simply wanted to make the most of my time instead of fap. To each their own.)

Having said that, we've both done some awesome things for each other. I brought her to tears when I gave her her first Valentine's Day gift, and her parents were kind enough to fly me overseas with her family for a holiday. She's supportive of my goals (I'm guessing, provided I don't move away). If you're actually reading this, you're a fucking champion. I feel like you care, and that makes me happy. I do my best to bring her up emotionally, although I'm struggling in that department.

But it's more bad than good at the moment. She doesn't listen when I mention something she's doing when she's bugging me - she keeps going, like a naughty kid until I have to really put the foot down. Although she gets frustrated with me over little things, when I (jokingly) rib her over something she does, which is not often, she gets mad and insults me. Since she last caught me with porn, there's been no sex. She says she's not ready (which could well be honest, but it still makes it hard (*heh*), especially with nofap).

And I'm falling into not caring. I've been fantasizing over a mutual friend for the last week and a half. When she's nice to me, all I'm thinking about is when the next big episode is going to happen. I'm legitimately happier when she's not around. I want to break up with her, but I feel like I'd be that guy who destroyed her self-image with porn, then said later. And I hate myself for it.



But you know what? I'm not ready to quit yet. The way I see it, is I've been letting her step on me all this time. No, she shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but I should also have the power to firmly say, ""I'm not cool with that."" I should be able to calmly state my issue and listen to what she has to say in response (provided it's mature), as opposed to weakly telling her to stop. I should be able to walk away when I think she's truly being disrespectful.

So here's my plan. I am going to find out if the change lies in me or in her. I'm going to be the guy she fell in love with again. (Luckily, nofap has already helped in this somewhat.) I'm going to be more sociable all-round, I'm going to be kind to my girlfriend (because **I do love her**), and I'm also going to stand my ground when I think she's acting muffed up.

If I can successfully do that, and she becomes the girl I fell in love with again, then that's AWESOME. I'll be a happy man.
If she doesn't change, or if she gets worse, I'll know I didn't walk away at the first sign of struggle. I'll know I gave it as much effort as I was willing to give, and that it wasn't enough. And I'll be able to walk away with a clear mind.

**WHEW**. I feel good now. By the way, I'm happy to talk about whatever. :P"

The point of this post is: Don't go looking for jobs in March, because the positions get filled **NOW**


Most companies that I worked for, would post their campus recruitment adds in early september, interview in late sept/early october and send out offers by the end of october.


These would be STEM type jobs, but nearly any summer corporate internship type job likely does the same.  Most of the interviews were behavioral based.  We weren't looking for people who actually KNEW very much - we were looking for people with the right attitude who were progressing through programs which would eventually yield enough knowledge to work with.

Generally, if you're a student, applying for your first office/profession job expect mostly behavioural questsion. Have prepared examples and answers for questions regarding:

- when you've shown initiative
- when you've dealt with conflict
- when you've worked in a team, and your role
- what courses you enjoy/do not enjoy in school
- how you keep yourself organized at work/school
- what helps you unwind, what you do to relax
- what do you want out of a company, what do you see as a good work environment
- what do you know about my company/my industry
- why are you interested in pursuing a carreer

Try not to relate EVERYTHING back to a class project, or a group presentation.  Try to vary your responses over some volunteer work, or a previous job even if it was unrelated to the field.  Don't try and sound like you ONLY go to school.

A ""good"" interview, from my end anyway, is one in which these questions do not actually get asked. A good interview is one where it turns into a conversation with some back and forth, around these topics and the result is that they all get answered. Communication skills are key, so try and not be nervous.

TL:DR **start checking your campus recruitment office's website daily for jobs in your field, not getting an internship will really hurt your chances finding a full time job after you graduate, and lots of people dont know that most jobs, which start next summer, are POSTED VERY SOON**

The title is Network Engineer.....I kinda feel silly when people ask me what I do for a living and I sorta grin and mumble under my breath ""im a (pretend) network engineer.....""

Maybe its a combination of both who im working for and the people im working with but I cant really seem to make any headway, or it could be all me, which Im readily willing to accept.  Ive been here for almost a year and I still dont understand thing one about what exactly it is Im doing here. About the only thing I do know for sure is that I love the Data and Voice side of my job....the systems side i have no interest in whatsoever. We do have a senior tech that does everything I should be doing but he usually takes over any issues that are network related. Which in a sense I dont mind, but again, if hes capable then exactly what am I doing here?

I dont want to go up to my boss and tell him all this cause I fear it may not end well, after all he did hire me on the basis of my capabilities according to my resume. Which to be fair is honest about my knowledge of certain protocols and etc but what I left out is that I have never done any of those things in an enterprise environment. I cant and have no interest in hiding behind other techs who do actually know what they are doing, for fear of it hurting my career in the long run. 

The other part of my issue is confidence, ive always felt that I missed something by not getting an intern job after I graduated college and now im paying for it by struggling with my new job. I never got an intern job cause i switched into a computer career in my mid 30s and had a family to support so I couldnt afford to take a 10dollar an hour job. But then again... I know many of you IT professionals have never taken an intern job and flourished in your careers. So what gives with me?

So Reddit, heres my question.....
What do I do?....look for a different job or position that will allow me the freedom to expand my field experience? 
Or do I stick it out for as long as im willing and they will have me?

Any ideas or suggestions or anecdotes are much appreciated...

zg02h,41,2012-09-06,I'm seriously frustrated.,grrarghlisten,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zg02h/im_seriously_frustrated/,"So I have always known that I do not want to go through pregnancy. I can't explain it, I've just always known. I have always wanted to adopt only. My mother was adopted, so at the very least I feel like I'd be honoring my grandmother. I have nightmares about being pregnant. I literally wake up screaming and clawing at my stomach. I can't look at pregnant people without getting nauseous. I refuse to watch movies/shows with pregnant people. It's disgusting to me.

When I was 16, I collapsed at work. I was a grocery bagger, and I lifted one of those 50lb dog bags and just collapsed in pain. My mom was luckily in that line and rushed me to the hospital. After a couple MRIs, I was diagnosed with severe PCOS. Seriously, my ovaries looked like raspberries. 

I was sent to follow up with a gynecologist in a few days. It was a male, and he forced me to do a transvaginal ultrasound. I was screaming in pain (I hadn't even masturbated, let alone had sex so it was super painful). He told me to shut the fuck up and that I was a weak bitch. Of course this just makes me start crying on top of being in pain. He told my mother I had a cyst burst and still had some fluid in my abdomen and it would pass. I was put on the patch, which made me absolutely crazy depressed and suicidal but my mother refused to take me to a different gynecologist and I was not going to go back to that one. The moment I got to college, I stopped taking the patch and just let my body try to regulate itself. 

Flash forward four years, and I met a wonderful guy. I finally felt comfortable with him to want to have sex, but I wanted to get on birth control because I absolutely do not want to be pregnant. I went to one of the two gynos my insurance covers in my tiny Texas town, and she told me she wouldn't give me birth control because I wasn't married and she refused to help a slut. Yeah, little me who was finally going to have sex with her first partner after about a year of dating.

So I went to the other gyno. She was slightly more understanding, but was hesitant. I had to bring in my boyfriend before she finally relented and said she would give me an IUD, but also said she would've felt more comfortable if I was married because then she wouldn't have to give me the IUD because I would need to make babies for Jesus. I kid you not, this is what she told us. But she at least was going to give me the IUD, so I just ignored her comments.

For the IUD, she gave me a pill that normally would kickstart labor as it widens the cervix opening. It was the weirdest feeling ever, and even typing this makes me shiver with dread. I hated it. I had contractions. It was just another nail in the already sealed coffin of no pregnancy for me. I got the IUD in, even though it was super painful.

Let's just say Mirena and I aren't friends. Two weeks after I got it in, I had a 5.5 month long period. Not just light spotting, but full on changing pads several times a day flow. I had two days off before another 2 month long period. And then, nothing. It was several months later when having sex that suddenly I felt a lot of pain, and noticed I was gushing blood. I was in terrible pain. I went to the doctor first thing in the morning and their conclusion was an ill timed period. Several months later, I got another horrible period. My gyno decided to put me on the pill on top of Mirena to try and regulate it, but all it did was give me 3 week long periods (and yes, the dummy pill weeks I didn't bleed) and depression. I stopped after 3 months, and just gave up. I still have the Mirena, but I still deal with 3-4 week long periods with about a week off. I should also mention that same boyfriend is now my husband, and we are both each other's only sexual partners.

I've always had this hope of California being this awesome place where I could finally get sterilized. My field of work meant at some point I would end up in California, and sure enough, here I am for a few short months on an internship. I saw a post in 2X a few months ago where I read you can't be turned away from sterilization in California for age/number of kids/etc. which was what was preventing me in Texas (my gyno said it was clinic policy to not do it until 30 or have 2 kids, and I simply can't drive to a big city easily enough to get it done there). So I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood, but they told me they didn't take my insurances (I have two) and it would be $250 for the consultation and $2700 for the procedure. There is just no way I can afford that, and I don't qualify for the grants because I'm not a state resident. So I got a list from my insurance and started calling. I made an appointment and went. My husband isn't with me, he's back in Texas. I was alone. And now, instead of being told they won't sterilize me because I should have babies for Jesus, I'm now told I have a mental illness and should see a therapist because I should want to be pregnant and have kids by now. I started sobbing while the doctor talked to me. I collected myself enough to leave and walk to few blocks to my car. Then I just lost it. All my hopes and dreams were crushed. A little old lady knocked on my car window and patted my head until I had calmed down enough to breathe and talk. She felt so sorry for me and I was thankful I had at least someone, even if it was a random stranger, to help me calm down. I went home and cried more to my husband on Skype.

I just can't help but think I would've gotten it had my husband been there with me. We both agree for 2-3 kids, and he doesn't care if they're adopted or biological and that it's my choice. He told me to make another appointment at a different doctor, but I don't know if I can handle that rejection again. A very close, trusted male friend who I know here has offered to pretend to be my husband and go with me to the doctor. But I simply don't know. I'm so upset.

Why can't I just control my uterus?!"

[How do you think some of the most terrible movies actually make it to the big screen?  I would assume at some point SOMEONE read the scripts and thought, ""Wow, that's awful.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xoeb?context=5)|Funny you should say that...  we interviewed Jason Statham, and some thing came up about some movies of his that weren't well received, and he said that you don't think you're making a bad movie when you're in the middle of shooting.  Cut to three months later, I'm interviewing Rosario Dawson, and she's joking about some of her Tomatometer scores, and I tell her what Statham said about not thinking a movie is going to be bad, and she says ""Oh no, I knew that Pluto Nash would be bad""  But she said she couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with Eddie Murphy.
[Aha! Great to see you here, I'm a producer on a Documentary called Beijing Punk that's somehow been listed incorrectly on your site, the descriptive text and cast info on Rotten Tomatoes is from another film called Beijing Bubbles. I've tried raising trouble tickets and emailing to get it fixed but nothing's been done for months so I figured what the hell and thought I'd ask here :\)  Also we received a glowing review from the Huffington post but the Rotten Tomatoes page hasn't picked it up. How do we connect the two?  And to ask a general question to be on topic, how hard is it for independent filmmakers to get their film listed on your site? Do they have any control over the information presented or is it gleaned from sources automatically such as the IMDB? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c640ril?context=5)|Hey, hit me on Twitter @matchity, and I can help you out.
[Any chance of getting rid of this popup? Or maybe just stop showing it after we have seen it 100 times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yqpy?context=5)|For what it's worth, I don't like that pop-up either.  
[Given how influential your site is, do you ever get pressure from studios to try and fudge the system to move an expensive stinker from rotten to fresh? If so, how do you respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xmo3?context=5)|We'll get a bunch of links to reviews from critics or sites that don't meet our qualifications.
 |We'll get asked to change a rotten review to a fresh one, because the review is neutral.
 |In the case of #1, we'll just say that the reviews don't qualify.  In the case of #2, we'll ask the critic if we've scored it right.  If they tell us to change it, we will, but we have to hear it from the critics.
[Going off the end of that, do you feel the critic's recommendation for each film is a good idea, rather than going strictly off the numbers? A 2.5/4 rating isn't necessarily ""rotten"" or ""fresh"", yet it goes either way. On top of that, I recently saw on early reviews of The Master, Richard Corliss' rating is a 7/10, and remains the only ""rotten"" rating (at this time\). Do you fee one way is better than the other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y1hr?context=5)|2.5/4 may mean fresh to some reviewers and rotten to others.  Our hope is that people are actually clicking through to read reviews, rather than basing their *entire* decision about the score.
 |We've thought about the possibility of changing things up, but in all honesty, keeping the system mostly simple is probably going to be our best bet.  It allows for a level of transparency that we like, where as averaging out scores adds in a lot more subjectivity and reinterpretation than I think we're comfortable with.
[Why isn't Taken 100%?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xkhj?context=5)|Because we didn't get a threatening call from Liam Neeson yet.
[What rating have you disagreed with the most? What has been your biggest surprise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xigy?context=5)|I *hated* The Tree of Life, but most of the critics loved it, so maybe I was missing something.
 |And I was pleasantly surprised to see Fast Five get a fresh rating, but I love those movies anyway.  I was kinda surprised to see Expendables 2 end up as fresh.
[Speaking of Terrence Malick have you seen his new film To the Wonder and if so what do you think of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yfsg?context=5)|Haven't seen it yet.
[Have you seen Crank 2: High Voltage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c641rec?context=5)|I love the Crank movies.  Totally trashy, totally awesome.
[What are your Five Favorite Films? I'm a big fan of Rotten Tomatoes. Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xoit?context=5)|We put our own five faves on the back of [our business cards](http://i.imgur.com/82t0R.jpg)
[I'm a long-time metacritic user.  How would you convince me that Rotten Tomatoes is better?  I prefer metacritic because they use numerical scores (which allows greater accuracy than a simple rotten or fresh\), among other reasons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xsvd?context=5)|I think we have a broader pool, and a more democratic system, but I think Metacritic does a fine job doing what they do.
 |But if you like them better, then hey, that's like, your opinion man.
[Any thoughts on Metacritic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xp44?context=5)|I think they're good at what they do, but I think our site is more fun.  But obviously I'm biased.
 |I think a weighted average like theirs potentially opens the door to a lot of subjectivity on behalf of the aggregators, but we get similar criticism about how we handle neutral reviews.
 |Ultimately, we're both assigning numerical values to subjective analyses, so users have to pick which version of that they like more. 
[How does someone become a ""Top Critic""? Do you feel the ratings system is weighed fairly? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xngt?context=5)|The criteria for being a Top Critic are [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics.php).  In a nutshell, we're looking for the people or sources that have the largest reach of the best writing.
 |We do try and make the system fair, in that it basically boils down to one critic - one vote.
[""Print publications must achieve and maintain status as one of the following: - A top 100 daily US newspaper - A top 100 weekly US newspaper""  What will you do when there are no more newspapers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c6402rr?context=5)|Not sure yet.  Honestly, that's something I really worry about.
[Tomato a fruit or a vegetable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xnrt?context=5)|Botanists say fruit, government says vegetable, I think.
[Whats your favorite guilty pleasure movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw6q?context=5)|Probably The Fifth Element.  It's kind of a mess, but I love it.
[My question is how can you hope to control this, if at all on your website? Obviously when it got to death threats it was necessary not to allow commenting on the thread anymore, but there seems to be the amazing split with RT commenters where one person will trash the reviewer and the person directly below will say ""hey we're allowed our opinions"". Which side do you fall on, and how to you hope to gain traction with your users, if at all when it gets ugly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv46?context=5)|Ultimately, we're going to change how our comment threads are set up so that there isn't a thread for each review, and I think that will help a bit.  But we're a pretty big platform, and once you hit a certain traffic level, the trolls definitely come out.
[*The Godfather Part II* shows 2 rotten reviews, but when I try to read them, only one critic is shown.  What did you do to the other guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw0y?context=5)|Ask Luca Brasi.
[How do you determine whether a critique is Rotten or Fresh if the general tone of the article seems to be neutral? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In many cases, the critic submits the review with their own rating.  But when we pick up the review, sometimes everyone in the office will read it, and if we really can't agree on a rating, we'll ask the critic.  But if something's truly neutral, we'll usually mark it fresh; the phrase we use in the office in that case is ""tie goes to the runner""
[I'm sure you remember the ordeal with internet users flooding message boards of movie critics who gave *The Dark Knight Rises* a negative review, but there was one article in particular that I read who admitted that he hadn't seen the film yet. How can you add to/take away from a movie's tomato score based on someone who hasn't seen the film's opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In that case, we took the link down to that review as soon as we saw it.
[How many miles do you recommend between tire rotations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|About 5,000 miles, depending on how you drive.
[Will the Rotten Tomatoes Show ever come back? And what's your personal opinion regarding the scores? Would you see any ""fresh"" movie as a movie one should go watch? I personally like the seperation into fresh and rotten because oftentimes it's just too much about critics ratings.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw34?context=5)|That incarnation of the show if over, but we're trying to cook up some other things.  And I'm trying to get Brett and Ellen to come on the Rotten Tomatoes Radio show; I see Brett every week at Current, when I'm shooting What the Flick.
 |Regarding scores, I think they can be a good tool in the decision making process if you're on the fence about seeing a movie.  But if you're dying to see a particular movie, then go see it; it's ok to see (and like) a movie that the critics don't like.
 |Except Twilight.  Those movies are terrible.
[Obligatory.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y73v?context=5)|Bone...
[If I may, what are some of the ideas on this ""to do"" list?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c642056?context=5)|#1 and #2 are ""Don't talk about the 'to do' list""
[I had a feeling you'd make movie references.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c644b2r?context=5)|We can't have any conversations in the office without some quote from something.
[Editor in Chief of an influential website like this.. should be at least..150k right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zhe0?context=5)|I'm sending this recommendation to my boss.
[How does the Flixster/TWX ownership structure work?  Do you get Time Warner stock?  How much editorial freedom do you have, and are there any guarantees?  Theoretically you could get a call from your boss's boss's boss's boss telling you to find a way to give the latest Warner Bros. film a push over that line from rotten to fresh or else he'll fire you and find someone who will--right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c641ehv?context=5)|No stock, but total freedom to write and cover what we want.
 |If I'd had any doubts about that, they were erased the week Dark Knight Rises opened.  No one at WB gave me any direction on how to handle the commenter issues, or what to do when the incident in Aurora happened.  After that week, we got some feedback from corporate PR that they thought we handled everything well, but at no point did they ask us to do anything differently.
 |We never heard anything like that while we were part of News Corp, either.
[Texting in theaters - what should we do here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw3p?context=5)|I could go on a huge rant here (I just did on last week's Rotten Tomatoes Radio show), but I'll just say that I don't think there's any justification for texting in theater full of people.  You're either too dumb to realize you're distracting others that paid to see the movie, or you just don't care.  Take your pick.
[What actor do you dislike the most, out of everyone you can think of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv6n?context=5)|There are some people I'd like to see do better movies, like Adam Sandler, but Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison still make me laugh.   But there's no one I really hate; I save my hate for people I know personally.
[What is the highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes? Lowest? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xm6i?context=5)|Best reviewed movie of all time is Toy Story 2 - 100% with 161 reviews.
 |Worst ever is Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever - 0% with 108 reviews.
[*Worst ever is Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever - 0% with 108 reviews.*  Already added to my downloads list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zgb6?context=5)|There's more where that came from [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/worst_of_the_worst/)
[Personally, what did you think of The Dark Knight Rises?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yhqc?context=5)|I liked it a lot.  I don't know that it stands alone very well, but as a trilogy, Nolan's Batman movies are damn good.
[Do you receive fan mails? what's the weirdest one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|I don't get fan mail.
[Has any of the film promoters ever tried to bribe you to review their movies? what's the weirdest one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|No one's tried to bribe me, but we do get filmmakers challenging our interpretation of a review.  When that happens, we'll check with the reviewer to make sure it's right.
[What about hate mails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|I don't get hate mail, but I do get nasty comments on YouTube.
[Hello.  What is your favourite movie that has a 'rotten' rating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xiyv?context=5)|Probably the first thing to come to mind would the The Fast and the Furious franchise. 
[I feel that the neutral comments really get me.  For example, one of the reviews will be bad and i read it, and sometimes I feel like its a good review and shouldn't be a rotten tomato.  Is there a system to determine if some of the neutral comments are rotten or not? It throws me off sometimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xplc?context=5)|The neutral ones can be really hard to interpret sometimes.  Sometimes three or four of us will read the same review to try and find a line that really defines where the critic stands.  If we really can't figure it out, we'll ask the critic directly.  That comes up a lot with Hollywood Reporter and Variety, where some of the reviews are as much about the box office potential as they are about the quality.
[Have you ever *eaten* rotten tomatoes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xis4?context=5)|Not knowingly.  I have been known to drink milk the day after it expires though.
[Thank you for doing this AMA. Welcome! Do you consider yourself to be movie-savvy? What was your occupation before this? Do you know of some amazing movies that have gotten little to no attention? If so, can you name a few? (Sorry to ask so many.. pick and choose if you wish!\) :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xuz9?context=5)|I like to think I'm relatively movie-savvy, but there are plenty of people who know more about the art and the business of movies than I do.
 |Before I was at RT, I had an online music business that failed (which is why I got back into web-based entertainment journalism) and before that I was at Yahoo Movies.  I've been covering entertainment on the web off and on for about 15 years.  I started out as a Universal Studios Tour Guide and I think I've taken that training to it's ridiculous extreme.
 |One movie I really tried to talk up last year was Warrior, and I was really happy to see Nolte get an Oscar nomination.  He had a scene in that movie that had me in tears.
[Hey Matt, what would you say is your favorite ultra-cheesy movie to watch for laughs (Something along the lines of The Day After Tomorrow or The Core\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xqgw?context=5)|My favorite genre of movie is probably sci-fi or action/adventure.  And I love a good martial arts movie.
[What is your favorite genre of movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xqgw?context=5)|I just re-watched The Rock on cable the other day - does that count as cheesy?  Loved it.
[What was it like in the beginning of your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|Rotten Tomatoes began as a side project for a few employees at a company called Design Reactor in Emeryville, CA. This allowed them to fully develop and take risks with the RT concept. Once it became clear this was going to be huge, the site branched off onto its own.
[Was it hard, did people have doubts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|You can see some of the stories about the early days of the site [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rumble_in_the_bronx/news/1736415/an_oral_history_of_rt_part_one_the_beginning/)
[Have you ever spoke to an Actor/Actress who have had a joke or discussion with their film's ratings with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yg0g?context=5)|A lot.  One of the coolest things about working at Rotten Tomatoes is that almost everyone in the film industry seems to know who we are and they use the site.  I interviewed James Remar a couple of weeks back and he joked about how many bad movies he had on our site.
 |My favorite was probably interviewing the Broken Lizard guys.  I love Super Troopers, and they all said to us ""we love you guys, but you HATE us.""
[Is there any movie with a 0% critic and 100% user or the other way around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xyuw?context=5)|I don't think there is that large of a difference, but there are some with a difference of 40-50%.   But I think comparing critics scores to user scores is an apples/oranges comparison.  Users mostly choose movies they think they'll like, and they're usually right, so most users scores come from a self-selecting pool of people biased towards liking the film.  I'm painting in broad strokes here, but the I think the numbers are kind of a false comparison.
[ can you bring him back? Please, oh, please, will you let him on the site again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xvu7?context=5)|Armond has the ability to post on the site if he wants to.
[How do you feel about critics who slam overwhelmingly acclaimed movies, such as Toy Story 3 and E.T.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y6ky?context=5)|If someone can legitimately back up their criticism, that's their right.  We don't expect everyone to agree.
[What is your opinion on critics writing a negative review to gain traffic to their personal website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xrj9?context=5)|Regarding writing reviews to get traffic, if someone's flagrantly doing that, we try and address it.  But it's slippery slope - we're not trying to enforce some kind of group think, and if someone can legitimately argue against the popular opinion, that's their right.
[Did you ever want to be a filmmaker growing up (or still want to\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xxjw?context=5)|I wanted to be in movies, not really direct them or produce them.  And then I realized I'd rather watch movies than make them.
[**What is your opinion on the future of movie distribution as a whole?  Will the days of $15 movie tickets and $8 popcorn go the way of Betamax tapes?  Or do you feel that there is something stronger in a community experience (actually sharing the moment with a crowd of strangers, much like a concert\) that a home theatre can't convey?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y39o?context=5)|I'm not sure what the future holds for movie distribution, but I think we're going to see fewer story concepts get distributed in a theatrical experience as the years go by.  But I don't know that it's going to be a sudden tipping point, so much as it will be a slow erosion.  I think we're going to end up in a place where most movies are released ""day-and-date"" - all countries across all media (theaters, TV, internet) at the same time, and movie theaters will be a specialized event experience, like going to a ball game, instead of staying home and watching it on TV.
[Would you be willing to become a regular contributor on the Adam Carolla podcast, like David Wild from Rolling Stone has? I would love a weekly segment discussing the crap coming out at the theaters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63z86n?context=5)|We're working on that, but Adam's schedule gets really full really quickly (or so they tell me).
[How did you come up with the idea for the site's rating system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xl2y?context=5)|That was created by the founders of the site (not me), but my understanding is that 60% works as a pretty clear supermajority.
[Thanks for doing this. I love RT!  What's the process of deciding which reviewers should be listed/counted towards the Tomatometer like? Additionally, what are the qualifications needed for one of them to be a ""top critic"" on there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xpae?context=5)|I just posted about this, but we have our criteria [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics.php)
[One of the things that really stand out to me on the website is the user comments on the professional reviews. I think there is a very clear hivemind mentality among the user comments that is really disturbing - there are SO many hostile comments towards negative reviews for those ""good"" films and then so many patronizing comments towards positive reviews for ""bad"" films. How would you go about regulating these comments and improving discussion of these professional reviews? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y4vr?context=5)|Yeah, we're planning to move away from having individual comment threads linked to specific reviews, because I think that helps focus the dogpile that happens when someone goes against the majority.  We'll have one thread for each movie that will be easier to police.
[Hi Matt! I'm an accredited film critic (not listed on RT yet, though\). I love your site, but there are limits in the RT system because of review nuance. Would you ever consider putting the option on RT where a user could see a page based on ratings (ie 3 stars our of 4\), not the fresh/rotten binary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xrgm?context=5)|We've thought about doing something like that, but we suffer from a severe lack of development resources, and it's hard make the case for that level of expense (developer time=money) when other parts of the larger corporate organization have other priorities.
[P.S. - I was the longest intern the Rotten Tomatoes show had. I enjoyed my time thoroughly and look fondly back on the company as a whole.

Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be a lot of time planning coverage for the coming weeks, and then going to screenings in the evenings.  On Thursdays I do a bunch of radio press appearances, my team is amassing reviews, shoot What the Flick, and then we have Rotten Tomatoes Radio.  Fridays have more reviews, more press, and then eventually I go home.

zfkuu,1,2012-09-05,My best friend's mother passed away last week.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zfkuu/my_best_friends_mother_passed_away_last_week/,"I wanted to post this here because... well, while I understand that it may not be the same for everybody, there's just something about losing your mother that I feel hits a girl, especially considering my friend is a mere 21 years old. I apologize for the wall of text in advance.

Her mother passed away after battling stage IV colon cancer for a long and torturous five years. She had previously had colon cancer that had gone into remission, and in between, she even had breast cancer. This woman was as tough as a woman and mother could be, her biggest concern was that her battle with cancer was causing pain and sadness all around her.

Very few people make it past five years of colon cancer, in fact, [only about 8% do](http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/guide/treatment-stage?page=2).

Five years passed, she was deemed unoperable, and it was only a matter of time.

Now, I want to tell you a little about my friend. She is a strong, stubborn, passionate young woman whose life goal is to save the world through animal conservation. During these daunting and scary five years, she went to college in the next state over where I had the luck to meet her, went to Africa for a study abroad, and we started an extraordinarily successful animal conservation club at our university that took up a significant amount of time and weekends to accomplish. After she graduated, she moved across the country to study snakes for a summer internship. Once she was done, she moved in with her long term boyfriend that had found a position not far from her internship. Basically, she was a long ways from home.

She then had to decide when she had to go home. When she would spend the last moments with her mother. She thought at this point that her mother would still have at least a few months left, but the doctor told my friend that her mother's heart could fail at anytime. Not willing to take the risk however small, she went home as soon as she could. 

Her mother passed away two weeks later.

I could make this whole post about her mother and how strong she was, but that isn't what I want to talk about. My friend and I sat down a day after her mother's funeral and she confided to me that she always knew that this would be it, that the cancer was what was going to kill her mother. But, then she said something that really hit home.

**""I couldn't live like my mother was dying.""**

And that is entirely true. Her mother fought and battled a disease that could have taken her within the first year of having it, much less the full five years that it did take. Was my friend to stop living her life during some of her most pivotal and defining years in case her mother was to pass away the next day? I feel as though her mother was much happier watching her daughter progress and strive in life than she would have been had my friend been holding her hand every second of the day, with nothing new to add to the otherwise daunting conversation.

People often say to live like you were dying, but in another sense... live as though the people closest to you were dying. Because it's true, we are getting closer to dying everyday. Enjoy and take full advantage of the moments you have with them, be kind and respectful and a decent human being. And live your life, because that makes a better conversation.

Girls, always remember your mother, your best friend, or even your neighbor could die tomorrow. Don't stop living because of it."
zfi3i,0,2012-09-05,F[20] trying to interpret my ex's intentions [19],[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfi3i/f20_trying_to_interpret_my_exs_intentions_19/,"God, I feel like I've told this story so many times. 


So, here goes: It's been about two and a half years since we broke up. I loved him, thought he loved me, one day he told me he didn't love me any more, later found out he cheated. Awesome. Not the point. 

Two years later, I find myself in Florida for an internship. Keep in mind, I haven't spoken to the kid in about eight months. Out of no where, he texts me. I found the timing odd since my internship was going to end in two months and I would be returning home. During this time frame, we text every other day about just stuff. It felt like how we used to talk and it was nice. I return home, he invites me over to show me his new place, I accept the invitation. The first time I go over there, nothing happens, but he flirts and drops hints saying things like, I would give you gas money if you came and visited more often, I could help you study if you needed it, etc. Whatever. I go over there again to watch a movie we've been meaning to watch together for awhile. Let's just say things quickly escalated and bad decisions were made. I caved. 

Now, he hasn't said a word to me. My current plan of action is to not talk to him and wait until I run into him again (it's inevitable, we have a class together) to see how he acts. My question is this: Are we friends? Are we fucking? Are you pursuing me? Are we starting over?Did I just become a two-month-old booty call?What is the best way to ask him this? I just want all of this craziness to be over because a part of me still loves him, but I'm not about to be led on again and frankly, I'm goddamn sick of playing this game. I want an answer and I want to be done with it. 

TL;DR My ex and I hooked up after a month or so of talking and now I'm confused. What's the best way to approach this situation without coming off as clingy or creepy?

zfbv4,11,2012-09-05,Why can't I find a job?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/zfbv4/why_cant_i_find_a_job/,"Hello fellow engineers. To explain more about the title, I don't know if I am looking in the right places or not, or if I'm just an idiot. I graduated almost a year ago with a BS in Electrical engineering, and have been actively searching for entry level positions and internships, but I haven't had any luck.

I think that my fault was not looking for internships/research opportunities during my undergraduate years (I actually never knew what an internship was until my last quarter of my undergrad). So basically I have had no experience other than from school projects; which I've included in my resume. 

I have had only one real interview, and five phone interviews, which I did call them back to follow up, but they end up saying I wasn't the right person (I assume I'm not good at interviews too, based on those). I was thinking of getting a recruiter/consultant soon, and go back to my college and ask for career resources once they begin school. So my question is, what am I doing wrong? What else should I be doing? "
zj2n9,0,2012-09-07,"I went at least a year and a half w/o PMO, and now have fallen back into old habits. I want to share how much of a difference it makes, and also get out of these habits once again. (long-post)",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zj2n9/i_went_at_least_a_year_and_a_half_wo_pmo_and_now/,"First off, I found this subreddit today, and I'd like to say that this is awesome. It's so cool to see a community that's striving to eliminate the most sick, and most prominent things in today's society out of their lives. Like come on, that is awesome.

So I as I typed this out, I was trying to make it short, but I had too much I wanted to say, so it's a long post, my apologies. 

I was 16 when I started at stopping my PMO. And lasted from about April 2010 to about October 2011; so about a year and a half. It was awesome. I was free from all that crap and I just wanted nothing to do with it, it was an amazing feeling, especially at 16&amp;17, no one does that at that age (not trying to sound braggy). I was definitely very much involved in the church, I lived for God, and for others, and that's what kept me going. I had an amazing girlfriend and yeah, life was sweet. So come October 2011, I start kind of drifting away from the church (it was my senior year you know, can't let the church hold me down; yes I was a stupid teenager) and I relapse for the first time in over a year and a half, over 450 days of being free of PMO, gone. And from there it just got worse and now brings me to today.

I am glad I found people who actually want to rid themselves of this crap. Let me tell you though, it makes a HUGE difference in your lifestyle.

So as I say all this, keep in mind I'm not trying to talk myself up, or brag, but I'm just being real and speaking from experience. So as I was free of PMO, I was a really enjoyable person. I got along with everyone, I was very social, and people really seemed to like me as a person. Also communication with girls was easy for me, and who doesn't want that? Since I relapsed into it, I'm much more anti-social, I get more agitated, and most of all I feel A LOT more self-conscious and worry what others think of me way too much. I find it hard to talk to girls, and not be nervous around them. It sucks. I can't give you an explanation of why this happens, but it does. I am just not the same person I was, and I don't like that.

Also things were WAY different with the two relationships I was in. When I was with a girl and without PMO (we will call her girl#1) my relationship flourished. We had so much fun and were always happy it seemed. I always wanted to hang out with her, and visa versa, no matter what we were doing. We enjoyed each other's time a lot, without the physical side of it. But with the girl I was dating and self PMO was also involved things were nowhere near as good, (and we'll call her girl#2). With girl#2 I was not always wanting to hangout with her, I got annoyed with her easily, I looked at her in the wrong way too often (not that I looked at her as a sex object 24/7, I really did treat her well, but I was kind of corrupted in my thoughts) and it was just not as good as girl#1. Also in comparison, I was with girl#1 for around 9months, and girl#2 for less than 2 months. 

That being said, I ended things with girl#2 because I am doing an Internship at my church soon and want my full focus to be on that and growing with God, and learning more about myself. Even if I wasn't doing the internship though, I would have been with her for the wrong reasons, and it would have been not okay.

But to summarize everything, life is a lot better without PMO being involved. You have more confidence, you're relationships improve, you aren't comparing your significant other to what you see on the computer screen, and you feel so much better about life and yourself, you can't hide from experience, and that's what I'm speaking from. I know this is all kind of thrown together and not really well explained or written, but if you have any questions or want me to elaborate or offer advice, message me or leave a comment (I'll notice comments more so on my mobile app than messages).

And as I said before, I am not trying to brag of my 450+ days, or say ""Look at me, I'm great,"" trust me I'm no where near great or perfect, I just wanted to share encouragement. I'm stuck in the same place as most of us here, I'm on day one again today, but that brought me here. Support for each other is definitely the greatest thing we can provide here. You all are awesome."

If you're interested in coming out they'll be there in the Hidalgo Room from 4:30PM to 6:00PM on September 11th. I know some of you guys are interested in working for Rackspace and this would be a good opportunity to meet people who have the ability to hire you. Good Luck guys!"
ziqsq,1,2012-09-07,I'm afraid to improve my life because I'll have nothing to blame this feeling on.,deeperanddown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ziqsq/im_afraid_to_improve_my_life_because_ill_have/,"I have been very fortunate in my life. I was born into a comfortable middle class family in one of the richest countries in the world, my parents never struggled for money and were never to strict on me.
I'm now 23 years old and am just about to complete a year long internship before returning to study for a year. I am 99% sure that I will be offered a permanent job once I complete my study with the company I've been working for for the last year. I've earned enough money this year to life independently of my parents, but I know that if I was stuck my parents would let me access money left to me by my grandparents, if that ran out I know my parents would support me in what ever I do. I also have good health (apart from a bit of weight issues which I'll come to in a bit) and a set of friends who are there for me if I need them.

All of this is great, however I have a paralysing fear ingrained into my brain. I feel incredibly lonely and it is only exacerbated by being in the company of others. I have never had a relationship and I blame it on being overweight although I know that's not the whole truth. I have zero self confidence when it comes to meeting strangers and a paralysing fear that I am doing something wrong in any situation.

In my mind if I hit the gym, cut down the calories and went out more I could find someone to share my time with easily. Despite being a virgin it's not just sex I want, I want someone to come home to; to cook and eat dinner with, to share the washing up and lean against while watching TV. If someone asks about what I did at the weekend I want to be able to say '*we* went to the park', '*we* went to the theatre' or '*we* just stayed home and did nothing' rather than '*I* just sat and moped' or '*I* went to the cinema by myself again'.

My fear is that if I find this magic person who puts up with me and smiles when she sees me come home everyday, I'll still be depressed. Now I have this thing which I know is missing, I can blame that for my misery and depression and know that it could happen one day and I should look forward to it, that's what keeps me going.

I'm terrified that in 20 years time I'm living in a nice house, with a brilliant partner and awesome kids I'll still feel like this. I'll have nothing to blame for the depression and have to acknowledge that I just have a brain that makes me feel miserable and worthless and leaves me spending an entire day curled up crying in bed when I know that friends have invited me to go do something fun.

I haven't been diagnosed with any form of clinical depression. I'm too scared of going to a doctor and being told that there is nothing wrong and I should cheer up. My doctors surgery is in a small town and all the staff know all my family. I know about doctor patient confidentiality but I just can't get this though out of my head. I have and will happily go and see a doctor about my swollen balls or anything physically embarrassing, but the though of someone going 'Did you hear about deeperanddown? He thinks he's got depression!'

Does anyone else have this kind of attitude?


P.S. I hope this makes sense as typing it has been a struggle and I just can't face proof reading it."

[How nice are the boobs you get to look at? Do you ever get a semi chubby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|I'm happy that I didn't post it but that gif is the closest SFW image that I can stand by. That is basically what we do with bounce testing but the floor is more of a spring board, and we test 3 at a time. Any more and its just a room full of girls bouncing around in bras. Not a bad thing, just too much data to be collected at once! But yes, I do have whole days that consist of that sort of thing.
[Please for the love of god tell me your average day goes a little something like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|And a straight male doing my work, HOW could I never react? I just keep it under wraps.
[Well, now that we've established that you have the best job in the world...  How much do you make, if you don't mind me asking? You don't have to be exact... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jke0?context=5)|I don't mind due to the certain amount of anonimity that I somehow am about to maintain here ~80k it fluctuates depending on if/when patents go through.
[How can I sign up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64r02r?context=5)|Lol! Umm.... Apply?
[So do I just google boob tester? What's your job title? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64uvbf?context=5)|Lol that would be funny to see the results from that. And my official job title is quality engineer.
[I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\). I know there's limited demand for some sizes, but why not sell some of the less-popular cup sizes with a range of adjustable bands? Would there be an engineering problem with making adjustable bands? Are the different sizes constructed differently, or are larger sizes just scaled-up versions of the smaller sizes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ooki?context=5)|This is a very good question. The problem becomes more intense when the fact that Boobs don't scale up in proportion with height or width with body size. I know right? I was just as baffled when I learned this, having been a self appointed. Ion expert before this job. But long story short. In order to make a bra comfortable AND adjustable there would be so many places to adjust it that most girls I assume would go commando (is that what girls call it with bras too) instead of fool with it at all.
[Do you ever use a wind tunnel? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iiy9?context=5)|Long story short, we have in the past. It is extremely more cost effective to just use a fan to implement most normal wind conditions. However, the factor of safety after bounce testing is well enough to withstand a gust of wind.
[Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?  What is something that we don't know about bras but should?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iq7u?context=5)|Yes - Yes - and that when in a bind for a sling, a bra is better to use that a shirt. It yields more immediate support with essentially no strain. Other than that bras are pretty straight forward. Oh, and for the ladies - If you pop out when you are bending over or jumping, you are wearing the wrong size. Most people will probably think I'm stating the obvious but I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.
[Would you be able at determining bra size than the girls in the store? They kinda suck at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c656n3a?context=5)|Of course.
[What kind of engineer?  Mechanical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64tgsc?context=5)|Mechanical indeed.
[Wait so when I finish my engineering degree I can work with boobs all day?  O.o.  (female here\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64lhk0?context=5)|If you apply I'm sure! Actually for obvious reasons they seem to be more motivated to hire females. I'm sure if I wasn't so relaxed and smooth with my words I would never have gotten this position. The last thing our testers want is a creepy slobbering guy taking measurements of their melons!
[Did VS like show up at the job fairs?  How did you get that job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64u0bz?context=5)|Mostly luck but also my resume. Found the need for this position on the internet.
[So how good are you at telling boob size of a girl? Can you look at one and say ""Oh, she's a B"" or ""She looks like a D, but because of her bra she's a B""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64j5q7?context=5)|All of the above. Great way to pick up a girl at the bar.
 |""I'll buy you a drink if I can't guess your boob size. It's basically my job to know"" She gets confused, I tell her were I work. I guess right. I buy her the drink anyway because I'm an officer and a gentleman.
[Did you google 'boobs'? Because I've been doing that and haven't found a single job going yet...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64v14s?context=5)|If you've been googleing Boobs and not found one ""job"" yet, you are on a different internet then me xD.
[Does that work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64vb1b?context=5)|More than you would think, actually.
[So i have to ask... The Bro? or the Man-Zear?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ja9z?context=5)|Soul patch. The ladies love it. But, it's about winter time so the beard is soon to make a reappearance for snowboarding season.
[I think you misunderstood me, i was talkin about a line from seinfeld where Kramer and Jerrys dad are inventing a new Bra (like you do!\) but its for guys with manboobs and they argue about naming it the bro or man-zear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jf2j?context=5)|Oh lol, I feel like the time I was working at an un-named printer company and they referenced this [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_hF_RhD-x) when I had never seen the movie before. Can confidently say that that scene is pretty accurate how the engineers felt about most of the product haha.
[Why doesn't your company create VS male underwear that will withstand all of my forces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ij7j?context=5)|Great question! Not my department sonny boy!
[Nor would I want you testing it on me :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ilyg?context=5)|I'll pass on the message though haha.
[WHY WON'T THEY CARRY MY SIZE!?!?!?!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jhhr?context=5)|Jaded - This might be too forward for reddit but what size do you wear? If you don't feel comfortable answering that I will tell you that most stores will tell you that you can special order from the company but 9 times out of 10 its cheaper/faster for you to special order directly from the company.

[Not even with a Brazilian wax tester?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ut2m?context=5)|Lol no just because I'm aware that some of the testers are not always desireable. With Boobs this is not a problem. Boobs are good no matter how loose the girl. Waxes I imagine are not. Lol.
[I really don't believe this guy one bit ....  I've worked for Limited Brands as an intern and had frequent conversation with the Sr. Engineer of Innovation and Tech Services at VS.  *depending on if/when patents go through.*  Limited Brands/VS does not file patents with bra technologies.Les Wexner believes, by the time the competition figures it out, it is too late, and the fact that when you think of bra and lingerie, you always think of VS.   *Do you ever use a wind tunnel? Actually no,  the testing that are done with the bra is .... gas chamber - to test the reaction of the fabric with certain gases Laundry Machines - Test several different type of pH levels of water, reaction to detergents, and drying methods  Stretcher - Idk the real name for this machine but its primary use is to stretch the bra as far as possible and somehow measures usage over time.  Machine that literally spins the bra and shreds it, also it measures how long the shine lasts on the bra over time.*  What is interesting is, they have a lab with different types of lighting and a book of the different types of fabric. What they do is study how bras look under different lighting \) at the stores.   *Why doesn't your company create VS male underwear.*  I know this is a joke, but LB main focus is womens apparel. In the past LB has owned Abercrombie and Express but due to poor performance they were let go. LB recently started re-focusing on women's apparel and fragrances.  *Prove to us that you work with boobs all day. Prove us what's on the menu today!*  Actually people who work for VS do not work with boobs all day. Most of these people who are involved are from a textile background. The mentor I was with worked on Kevlar and now is the leading tech for Bra Technology.   *I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\).*  You need to call Victoria Secret Direct, they have a wide variety and items not sold in stores. They are pretty good with shipping and you can always catch deals online. Always direct call.   *Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?*  Most of the people I met in Bra Tech had some sort of materials study or actually went to school for textiles.   *What is something that we don't know about bras but should? VS bras are not about comfort. The mentor I met explained this to me... VS can make the most comfortable bra in the world but thats not why people buy VS bras. People buy VS bras cause of the appeal of sex. What the tech has to gauge is comfort level, and how far they can go with style and sacrifice comfort. He explained to me that comfort is only a tolerance of pain.*  The one bra that intrigued me was the VS Incredible Bra. First of the the elasticity of the bra is amazing. It is able to attain its elasticity even after being stretched 2-3x its initial length. On top of that it has a high comfort level and does not have side fat build up (I really dont know what the real term is\). Another interesting thing about bra technology that is so hard to control are white bras. Many ladies get frustrated because the white bras will not stay white. First the edges will lose color (light brown/tan\) then the bra loses its shine. This occurs because of exposure to different gases in the environment, and simply the fact that over time materials will decompose towards its natural color/state.   *I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.*  Seriously? VS bras even the same sizes fit differently, this is why they have a fitting procedure when you go to the stores. If you ever looked at the card it states the size, model, and color. A size from one brand or within the same brand isnt the same all across the board.   *How do I start a company for this?*  Www.limitedbrands.com apply there.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64pvsu?context=5)|Sir I got a few lines into this comment and realized that you are either trying to hijack my thread for your own position or count an interns work as an equivalent engineers work at a company that sells essentially higher quality products. So with that being said. I'm sure you had your own experience but here at vs we are a huge company. Do you honestly believe a ""lighting lab"" and the lighting and color of the bras are all that we worry about?
[How do I start a company for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64k8yi?context=5)|To answer your questions in the order you gave them -  No idea my friend, no idea...
[Do you try to make sure the girls you work with are hot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64k8yi?context=5)|Actually funny story.. when we have to test for generic cups (bra sizes that are very common, example: 34B, 36DD, etc...) the testers go through screening and it is random who chooses so sometimes myself and sometimes others. So I guess you can say, I don't make my job boring :)
[Are you worried Obamacare is gonna take your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64k8yi?context=5)|And no sir Obamacare will not effect me in any way shape or form. As long as their are titties in the world and girls who enjoy our high quality bras, I intend on making sure those titties are good in my hands..

It must be a slow day lol. And no problem. After a friend found out a was a redditor he asked me why I had never done an AMA with the job I have. 
[I doubt you know the answer, but...  Why are all the VS bras in larger sizes (38DD, etc\) never in the store?  or if they are, why are they are ugly colors, never anything pretty, cute, or sexy?  I would think that the bra business is all about big titties.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64lavu?context=5)|Oh trust me, we are. Well we as in the people who put in the work because we are motivated to make those girls feel good in your shirt. Now, the marketers, I cannot speak for. But I can tell you that I started a list of things to send on to them since in this thread I've had a similar complaint. I know it doesn't help but if it were up to me, the bigger the tits, the cheaper the bra. (No offense small tittied girls - I like them in all shapes, styles, sizes, variation, etc...) But I should note this is strictly a personal opinion and does not reflect the company as a whole I'm sure.
[I like your system of rewarding the big busted chicks.  please take this to the higher ups.

I like to think I have two different mentalities. The first is the professional who barely notices a bare chest (unless of course its attached to a beautiful set of eyes, I'm a sucker for eyes) and then there's the animal outside of work lol. But no, there have been no decreases in my arousal rates due to some great titties because of my job. Thank goodness right?

I don't know much about it since I'm on the quality side but as far as quality is involved in the matter that is one of our main causes for falling out of the bra when going from an arced to erect position.

[I appreciate your advice here to engineering students. Short story about myself, I am now 33, and just recently decided to go back to University with the hopes of getting into Mechanical Engineering. I have a degree from when I was younger (23\) in computer science. I'm not totally sure I'm prepared for how difficult/different a mech. eng degree would be for me to work towards. I'm also aware there seemed to be a lot more comradery between engineering students, and I worry that being 10 years older than everyone would make that difficult as well. Do you have any thoughts on this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64u7la?context=5)|You are speaking with a someone who was a community college student that transferred to a university so I am more than aware of how it feels to be left out of the conventional student groups, in the two years and only the first two years. After that, if you work hard and know the material, everyone works together (as long as you're not a douche of course, the douches and people who believe they are smarter always get left out). So this can be summed up by, just work hard and eventually the material gets hard enough that small differences are just that my friend. Small. Good luck.

Tips and tricks for the rest of us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64qol0?context=5)|The only way that I can't take it off %100 with the method I'm about to tell you is with my teeth.. but basically think of the strap where it connects as a single hook. I think most people get confused because many times its a clasp of many hooks. If you treat it like a single hook and then with one or more hands pull the two sides in and stick a finger between the material and the skin and give it a nice trust out (finger only not the hands that you're pulling the bra together with or else you snap it into her back when you let go) the forces holding it together will act as a jerk resistance to the hooks at it will release. Hope that helps:)
[How do I find a bra that best fits for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64r6n7?context=5)|The answer I give in real life when asked this is ""I think various stores have people in them that can help you but if you would like a professional opinion I would be glad to lend a hand."" :) and its true.

Being closer to my family brought on a lot more then I thought in regards to the box and the contents. My brother, even after hearing the tapes and wanting to never hear them again, sat me down and told me he wanted to talk about everything I was finding. 

He's never been someone to fear things, often in our childhood he would tease me over being cautious. You see, I have to be cautious because of how I am. I'm not dyslexic, but I do have trouble with balance and reading. At times it proves to take it's toll on me when I do my studies and my internship.

He sat with me and stared at the box. To be honest, he didn't really stare at it as much as he was *glaring* at it. I found it amusing and told him to be nice to the box, I said, ""If you glare at it you might hurt it's feelings."" 

He didn't find it very amusing. 

""That box is going to get you in trouble, Austin."" Yes, finally a name, my name is Austin. We'll leave out last names. 

I shrugged it off. 

I showed him the files on Evan and instead of looking at what I was showing him, he was looking at me. He was watching me carefully, almost as if he was trying to figure out a riddle. As kids, our parents gave us riddles to figure out to keep us busy.

While I was very eager to solve each riddle, and I was also very good at most of them, not all; my brother wasn't. He was always annoyed with the riddles and would have me give him the answers.

I told him simply, ""It's just to keep me busy."" 

It's the truth, this keeps my mind busy. Too much time and I often get very uneasy. I need to keep busy.

""No one wanted the case, that should be a hint.""

He took the papers and slammed them into the box. My mother came in and just crossed her arms over her chest. She told him to fix the papers and to apologize, but all he did was walk pass her.

I told her it was fine. He could be nervous for me, and he had his own worries on top of this, so he must have had a bad day. A bad week. Something bad.

My mother said something very odd to me, which is why I am putting this here for you all. 

""He must be nervous ever since last month.""

Last month? Well, what happened last month?

I asked her this.

""Your grandparents adopted me."" She said, and I laughed a bit. 

Just a coincidence, right? She was adopted. I don't love my grandparents any less. I don't love her any less. Just because a case had a foster family in it doesn't mean anything.

""They were foster kids, not adopted."" I said, and I took the box to put it into my car. My mom just smiled and sighed, hugging me before I was fully set to head back home with all of my things.

""They adopted me a little after they got me. I suppose they really enjoyed having me."" She waved at me and I watched her go into the house. 

The house we grew up in. From the apartment to this house, my mind was a bit confused. My parents stayed as long as they could with me in the apartment until they finally went to the house once more. Apartments aren't for them, they love having their own space without people above or below them.

I live in the apartment alone and pay some of the rent to help them, they own the house so they help me with the rent so I could get through school and my internship.

But the house, it was odd to me suddenly. Not familiar like you would expect from a house you grew up in.

I didn't stay long, just drove down the same road back to my place and unpacked everything. (When I say unpack, I mean I shoved the clothes from the bag to a hamper, clean or not, and then sat on my couch. I'm guilty of being a bit of a lazy person when I'm tired.)

With my eyes shut I remembered something and came here to type. I'm going to keep putting the things I find up here, but also some new things. Because I remember something from my childhood, I remember a riddle that was like a scavenger hunt. 

One of the hunts led us around our house and then over to some doors that were in the ground. It wasn't extremely close to the house, but not very far either. My father came to us during that hunt and said it was time to head back inside. 

I asked what it was, thinking it was some doorway to a magic world. I had a very wild imagination. He said it was a shelter, and that he never thought to really open it up at all. It was just there, and now, so many years later, I'm wondering if I can go to that shelter.

Coincidence is something common. An adopted mother and a shelter by our house. I texted my brother about it.

**Remember the shelter we found? Let's go there this Sunday together. You and me.**

**No.**

**I'm going anyway, I'll take pictures.**

**Don't go, now you're just being stupid.**

As you can imagine, this went on with us bickering like brothers do with one another over it. But now, he's agreed to go with me. We go, we look, we leave. No snooping, no lingering, no 'hunting', just looking. 

I'll post another content from the box tonight.

With Ubi dropping its DRM and releasing a F2P game, and EA talking about not green-lighting any exclusively single-player content, it got me to thinking. With the end of the console generation not far off, the PC is in a unique position, and as such, everything either seems to be an MMO or F2P property these days. Even the consoles are allowing F2P now.

To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?

[How effective has LinkedIn been in finding great candidates? 90% of my interview calls were based on my use of LinkedIn for networking with the right people.  In this economy is there a preference for hiring US citizens with less experience and skill (and provide them training\) instead of a highly qualified immigrant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|Yes, I work for a company in the addiction treatment field.  A lot of our employees have a past and we work with them case by case.  Bigger companies might be more hard and fast in their selection process and disqualify workers because of a record.  Although google Seymour Schlager and see how some companies are clueless, I have a great story about this guy, personal experience.
[What personality traits do you look for in a candidate based on your experience with big companies? Working in a startup, apart from talent and skill, we look for people who fit the company culture versus 9-5ers.  Any experiences hiring candidates with criminal records? Are they vetted out in the application filters itself? From your experience what's the general policy among big corporations on hiring someone with a record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|I have primarily a small company background(inside) and a bigger company background working from the outside.  I always look for someone that can demonstrate ""flexibility"" to me especially if they are going from big company to a more entrepreneurial start-up environment.
[I posted this in the other AM, might as well try here!  At the company I work at, I went from being a Unit Manager to a Reporting Analyst, essentially two levels below.  Will this ""demotion"" of sorts have a negative impact when other companies look at my resume? How can I make it positive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ebzj?context=5)|Was the demotion due to a company wide reduction in force or something similar?
[Not an official demotion, but the team was restructuring. So my role doesn't exist anymore. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64efpr?context=5)|It has been restructure mania for years so recruiters and HR get it.  Spin it by explaining that your position was eliminated but they valued you as an employee and wanted to keep you.  You loved the company and wanted to stay.  Coo, thing is they definitely took a risk by putting you in a position you were overqualified for knowing you would probably be looking.  Good HR people will get that.
[What is the largest salary you ever offered someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dx3q?context=5)|Base was over 500K, package with stock options and everything took it over a million.  Deal took over 9 months to put together and fell through at the last minute because of an amended non-compete the candidate had forgotten about, never got over that one.
[What is your cut on something like that, if it had gone threw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e177?context=5)|In the firm I was working at it depended on how many people were assigned to the search.  On that one the total fee was probably just north of $150,000.00  I would have seen at least 30K.
[I work for an ex big firm partner who's gone on his/her own now - you should really do that if you have the contacts...pure profit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fdmo?context=5)|I work on my own now, its all mine.
[Can you give a reference on the BEST way to format a resume? I can read five different sites and get five different answers..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dy1n?context=5)|Love this question and you are right, you can get a million different answers.  For me the most important thing is that I shouldn't have to ""work"" to figure out who you are and what you do.  For those just graduating you should list your education first and then your employment history.  I think a chronological resume is best, use highlighting carefully, try an include a concise objective to tell the employer what type of position you seek.  Include a ""skills"" section listing your technical capabilities.  And whatever format you use check it 50 times for any grammar or spelling problems.  Hope that helps and feel fee to DM me for my email, be happy to review your resume.
[From your experience, what would you say is the percent of applicants found through online job postings versus applicants that ""knew"" someone in the company already and applied that way?  In other words, is filling out online job applications really just a huge waste of time that would be better spent trying to network?  Or does the private sector really actually hire people through online applications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eeb7?context=5)|Companies absolutely hire through job postings although they aren't my favorite way to find someone unless I am under a tight deadline or I need multiple people.  Always network as much as you can, best method by far for finding a new job.  
[Thank you for doing this. I have a few questions I've never really had the chance to ask someone who may actually have answers.  I graduated about a year ago from a very well-regarded university. Unfortunately, while I was in school my personal life severely imploded (repeatedly\) and my grades really suffered. Staying in school was difficult enough and I did not partake in any internships/jobs and hence have zero work experience in my field. I took the last year off to deal with all the aftermath and get my feet back on the ground. I feel like I'm finally ready to start working again. But I'm wondering how I can convey to a potential employer that I'm a good candidate despite the fact that I have these giant red flags? The last thing I want to do is throw a pity party on my cover letter/interview. I'm sure they don't want to hear my sob story. And how do I explain such a large gap in my history in a way that won't make it look like a potential liability in the future? I know I'm quite competent, but how do I convince them that I'm worth taking a chance on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64elnx?context=5)|Thanks for this and the biggest thing right now is that you must be sure in your heart and mind that you are ready to take on a job. Have you gotten the help that you need and is your personal life settled?  The worst thing that can happen is that you land a new gig and another nuke goes off and you implode again, make sense?  If you are ready you need to be as honest as you can be without going into too much detail.  Interviewers don't like to feel uncomfortable so don't take the there.  Try and paint your ability to overcome some personal obstacles and actually finish school as a positive achievement, which it is.  You have to really exude confidence if you get an interview and keep you expectations reasonable for a first job.  Also, get some good references lined up that can speak to your character.  I hope this helps a little, good luck.
[1\) Is an executive recruiter functionally a headhunter? I keep thinking of Mila Kunis in Friends with Benefits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Yes, I am a headhunter and who is this Mila Kunis?  Kidding of course.
[2\) What does the fee look like? Is it 20% of a person's gross salary? Does the jobhunter pay you a fee?  3\) What fields do you work with? I'm asking because i'll be a PhD (no time soon though\) who might look to go into industry in a marketing or management capacity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Fee can be anywhere between 10% if you are a shitty recruiter mucking up the profession to over 30% in a retained situation.  I am typically at 20 - 25% of a persons first year gross and guaranteed bonus.  Jobhunter pays no fee. 3) primarily healthcare, place many graduates from doctoral programs but primarily thise with at least 5-10 years of industry experience, pharma and biotech mostly.
[20% seems phenomenally high. You only need to make 5 placements a year working for yourself to hit median income? How many placements do you actually make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64omsn?context=5)|Working part-time I have place four people this year in positions ranging from 95 to 160K.  I hope to do 2 more by the end of the year.  Of course I have had at least 7 or 8 deals go south which I worked very hard on so yes when things work the fees are good, but it evens out I think.
[So minimum 114-192k before expenses part-time? That's ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c650pfd?context=5)|I guess you could see it that way.  Expenses can be high, taxes are a killer.
[How much knowledge do you generally have in the field a candidate maye be applying for? For example if someone applies to be in IT or your software engineeeing department, would.you be well versed in that field or the requirements of the job, or is that something you leave to the technical team?  If it's a field.you don't necessarily know the details of,  what do you look for in a candidate when eeading their resume or interviewing them? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e5oo?context=5)|Great question and on the executive recruitment side that is why I specialize in healthcare. I have learned the field and can talk somewhat intelligently about most positions.  Now in HR where I am asked to review resumes from all walks of life I am a bit hamstring by my lack of technical and subject matter knowledge for some positions.  I do however take the time to meet my hiring managers and learn as much about what they do and need as possible.  That being said I always get a list of must have from the hiring manager, if I don't see them on the resume I probably won't call the person.  If I see the must have then I look for stability and career progression.  If that makes sense then I call and do a quick screen.
[Can you explain what a recruiter does and who you (generally\) work for? Do you recruit within a certain field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eclm?context=5)|Love the name, healthcare mostly.  Employers come to me when they are having a tough time finding the right person for a particular role.  My job is to learn about their company and basically sell it to a candidate.  I am lucky that I have been successful and can choose the companies I want to represent, my motto is cool jobs for cool people.
[If I was applying for a new job while currently having one, should I mention that I have a job already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ei0g?context=5)|Yes, and make sure you tell them they cannot contact your current employer. 
[What if they ask for reference and says that they'll need to contact the references?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64o4hf?context=5)|Say you are currently employed and you can't jeopardize that status and give them refs from previous employers.  If a potential employer pushes and want refs from you current job then they are clueless and you don't want to work there, make sense?
[May I ask why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64hu69?context=5)|Well I guess I should qualify that statement.  If your current employer knows that you are looking for a new job and they are ok with that, then by all means allow a prospective employer to contact your current one.
[If you tell a potential employer that you would rather they not contact your current employer, are they likely to ask why you're leaving in order to get a feel for the way you'd speak about your job / how you deal with stressful scenarios if you're leaving due to an unhealthy workplace? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64lyr8?context=5)|I ask that question right away and if they start bad mouthing their current employer I tend to shut down the interview pretty quickly.  You can explain a situation by painting a picture of what is making the workplace unhealthy.  If you have an a hole for a boss, don't say that, give an example of how he/she treats people.  Does that make sense?  
[What is your take on hiring veterans who have college degrees?  Does being a veteran matter at all and influence potential employers?  If it does, please explain how.  Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fmr1?context=5)|Personally I will do everything I can to hire a veteran, and I can tell you that the president of our company thinks the same way.  I guess the trick is to be able to show how your military experience directly relates to the position you are seeking.  Best of luck!
[I have two questions,  1.\) Why is it that most companies will not contact you if you didn't get the job?  2.\) Since applying to jobs online proves to be one of the worst methods with around a 4% success rate (What Color is Your Parachute by Richard N. Bolles\), what are some better methods to an effective job search? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64g17w?context=5)|Hi, first question is a pet peeve of mine since I always try and call the people that interviewed and weren't selected.  I have two answers, one is that people don't like giving people bad news and the second is that some HR people think they don't have the time, which sucks.  I find open positions online and then hunt down the players.  There are wonderful social and business networking tools that are very effective at assisting with the job search process.  Use LinkedIn, use twitter, use facebook and try and find a recruiter that specializes in your field.
[Is it socially acceptable after finding these people to contact them over LinkedIn or and equivalent source? and should they be contacted them after you apply or before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gcvw?context=5)|LinkedIn was built for professional networking and always feel free to reach out either before or after replying.  Ask for help, people love to help.  Something like Hi, I am thinking of applying for an Accounting position at BDO and I was wondering if you might have a minute to tell me about your time there?

[Difficult situation...  My SO was fired 18 months ago and is finally looking for a job seriously now. He was fired after 7 years for not-optimal attendance, and has only a high school GED. But he is very personable and very very intelligent.  Again, not-ideal situation overall...  What's his best avenue he could use to find a mediocre but non-crappy job... something full time in an office environment doing something like billing or customer service, 35k-40kish/year? Hire a professional resume writer? Should he lie and say he tried running his own business during that 18 month gap? Etc? I already assume the firing circumstances will have to be sugar-coated/border-line lied about because they can't verify that anyway, only that he is not rehireable (right?\) Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64jynk?context=5)|Unemployment starting to run out huh?  So if I understand this correctly he was at his last position for 7 years?  What does he do?  Don't hire a professional resume writer, usually a waste of money.  Don't try and cover a gap by lying, we'll find out.  And you never know what a company contact will say so don't count on them saying only, he is not eligible for rehire, which in and of itself is a problem.  His best avenue right now is probably through a temp employment agency.  They can help with the resume, they get a shitload of job orders and if he gets out there working and does a good job he might get hired permanently.  Cover the gap by telling the truth.  he had attendance issues but was there 7 years, ready to work hard again it has been tough because of the economy, etc.
[I'm 43, no education, and have been running my own engineering consulting company for the last 10 years.  Prior to that I was an independent contractor for 13 years.  I also do a little bit of management consulting, but mostly programming and electrical engineering.  I've worked inside a lot of different companies (20 or so\), which gives me a very broad perspective on what works and what doesn't.  Do I have any hope of transitioning to an executive or management position at a real company?  Would you consider a guy with no education, who's never had a real job?  How can I spin this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ux0u?context=5)|Love it, ""real company"", like what you have done doesn't count or something.  I would say your best chance would be for a smaller ""real"" company that doesn't have a degree requirement. I am sure you have met a ton of people, network and see what's out there.  So yes, if you want to go that route I think it is possible but you need to be ready to convince someone you really want to take on more of a traditional role.  This is a hard one for me, sorry of I wasn't much help.
[I'm trying to change careers, but my 10 years of experience is mostly in a small family run print shop doing a little bit of everything.  What do I highlight if I want to get into a different field?  Been getting the short end of the stick regarding call backs and so forth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fgyr?context=5)|You highlight whatever in your background is most relevant to the position you are seeking.  I always tell candidates that switching careers is no easy task and you have to manage your expectations, you may have to settle for something that might seem a bit beneath you before you can actually start to make headway in to a new career. Stay focused and put yourself in the hiring company's shoes, does it make sense for them to hire you for the role?
[I've read articles such as these: Link to www.forbes.com that talk about obesity and salary. Did you find that to be the case? Does it influence hiring too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64f67g?context=5)|Unfortunately it does, people have biases whether well founded or not and employers can make a case that obese people will increase healthcare costs for the company.
[Lately I've been hearing that your degree isn't as important as it used to be when looking for your first job, but that recruiters primarily look at your (social\) and out-of-college activities. Is this actually true?  E.g. if you could pick between two candidates - One with good academic credidentials but 0 experience outside of it - One without a degree, but actively involved in planning and organising things for organisations.  Which would you pick, and why? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gjq2?context=5)|Personally I would take candidate B without the Degree however most companies now require a 4 year degree for professional positions.  
[Thanks! Does make me wonder why on earth I spent 5 years in college :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64i7j0?context=5)|I'll share something with you, I attended but didn't graduate from college and I regret it to this day.  
[I'm hoping you can provide some guidance on my current situation. I've worked at a startup for a few years now, and am one of the first 10 employees (we have around 100 now\). We're very profitable. I've been in Support for that entire time, but have done a lot of other unrelated things for the company, so I make a bit more than a typical Support rep, around $64k / year.  1\) They want to wait until my annual review in December to adjust salary, despite a start date in October. Is this typical of internal promotions?  2\) They said a jump to an $80k+ salary from where I'm at is out of the question, reasoning that internal promotions are typically not paid market rate. They said a more realistic number is in the low $70s. Are internal promotions typically paid out at a lower rate than external hiring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64it98?context=5)|Probably the best advice that I can give is never hold a current employer hostage over salary, even if you get paid they will be bitter.  We have an employee right now who did this and he doesn't know it but I am looking for his replacement right now.  From an employers perspective a jump to 84K would be a 31% increase which is in my opinion too big of a jump.  When you mention market rate for PMs, is that for an experienced PM?  And how many years of experience?  It is a new role for you so temper your expectations initially, 74K would be a healthy 16% increase and more reasonable I think.  They want to delay the salary increase so that don't have to re-visit it when they do the annual.  Try this, see if you can get 74 starting in October but would agree to no salary discussions in December during your annual.  However, since you believe the market for a good PM is higher, you would like a ""salary"" review in 6 months.
[This is a pretty general question but could you go over interview etiquette?  I.E. what are the best questions to ask, what makes candidates stand out, what are the little things you notice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64evym?context=5)|This has been fun although I am getting hungry, might have to grab lunch.  Have at least 2 or 3 questions, can be general about the company or job specific.  If I am the job seeker I want to know why the position is open, career path from here and ask the interviewer what he likes about his/her job, you can learn a lot.  Always dress professional, even if you think it might be a business casual environment.  Turn off your damn phone, don't forget.  Don't talk too much and give concrete examples when you answer questions. Show interest and at the end of the interview ask for the job.  Some red flags for me are lack of eye contact, inability to tell me what you did or do, no knowledge of the company, etc. Be yourself, be on time.

It never ceases to amaze me that people won't do that.  
[I don't understand.

Say something like, ""From what I have learned today about xyz company I am really excited about joining the team, what is the next step so that I can start as soon as possible?""  This leaves no doubt in the interviewer's mind as to your interest and will force them to make some type of decision on the spot.

Usually people don't make huge jumps.
[I was the subject of a large pay increase.  Had put in my 2 weeks to move to a better position in a new company, then I received a counter offer from another dept that beat the new company's offer (I went from ~$38k hourly to $58k salary\).

And sure, so in this example this person had already accepted and offer at a new company which means he really wasn't happy at his current company.  So bottom line he dissed the new company, will be happy for a short time in his new role because it pays more.  But there were other reasons he wasn't happy there as well, guarantee it.  He'll be looking again soon.

Long story but here goes, back in 2003 I quit a position with a medical staffing company and ended up starting a recruiting business and did ok but my wife didn't appreciate the uncertainty of the business so when one of my clients approached me about joining them as their internal recruiter I took the job.  I helped grow the company from about 20 people to over 150 and then things at the company changed and we started letting people go.  One of the departments that was hit was HR, we let go our Director and generalist.  The President of the company kept me on because he knew that as we restructured and changed the business model we would need to recruit people again at some point.  So I took on all the HR duties and he has allowed me to have my business on the side.  There are some synergies between the roles so it works well.  So I primarily wear my HR hat during the day and my executive search activity is done in the evening and on weekends.

I also have realistic expectation and know that if I have a placement every other month on a very part-time basis I am satisfied.  I pick and choose my clients and have a pretty deep network of healthcare people through professional associations and sites like LinkedIn.
[A professor said that you should send all your resumes to the president of the company, because even though they will most likely never see it the secretary will probably send it to HR.

Ask them what the range is for the position and then tell them that you are seeking something withing their range, if indeed it is a fit.  If you are pressed and they won't move forward with anything before they learn your salary then you have a decision to make.  If you want to be considered for the position give them your current salary and just say that you feel you are worth more, comparable positions at my level of experience pay more, and that is one of the main reasons I am speaking with you today :)  Now, show me the money! Ha.  Oh, I will find out of you lie to me.

[Thanks for the reply! I would rather not fudge my salary, but I always struggle with the salary question. A lot of recruiters I have spoken to recently want to know my current salary during the first conversation itself. Is there a good away to counter that question without divulging your salary? Something on the lines of ""I'm sorry but my employer has a very strict policy against divulging salary information""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64wj45?context=5)|Let's separate the recruiters for a minute.  If it is an internal corporate recruiter I wouldn't tell them what I make during the first conversation, period.  Just tell them you would be more comfortable discussing salary at a later time.  If it is a third party recruiter you can usually get by at first by telling them the salary range you are seeking, but they will have to know at some pint exactly what you make.  I usually request W-2's from my candidates before I present them for senior roles.  Hope that helps.

If the range is 30 - 40% above what you are making you have done a great job actually getting through the interview process.  Shoot for 30 and be happy.

I have been with my current employer since I was an intern while in college.  When I was hired on full time I was moved from Wisconsin to Dallas into a Network Administrator position and have been here for the last 7 years.  Currently I wear many different hats and would like to become a bit more focused in my career.

I have experience with Microsoft Server 2000, 2003, and 2008.  I am responsible for planning and deploying my local servers to support our storage and software needs.  I also work with Windows 2000, NT, XP, and Win 7 machines on a daily basis for troubleshooting and deployment reasons.  I set up, deploy, and maintain our wireless (3Com and Cisco) and anti-virus (Sophos) systems company wide across 13 business units and 2500+ users.  I also maintain several other system on the local and corporate side as the need arises.

I would like to continue to work in the DFW area.  Though depending on compensation I have no problem driving as far is Irving.

zibos,9,2012-09-07,How valuable is the CS Degree in obtaining employment?,lennybird,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zibos/how_valuable_is_the_cs_degree_in_obtaining/,"A friend of mine did a summer internship at Intel. Intriguingly, they told him (I'm paraphrasing), ""90% of what you'll learn in school will not be related to what you'll be doing here."" They then emphasized on-the-job training. This made me a little nervous. Am I wasting my time and money?

Similarly, I've just stumbled across this subreddit. And viewing the advice from others, it appears that a computer-science degree is less about application and programming and more about going into theory (which can be great to expand the mind's capabilities in some instances.).

I'm about half way through obtaining my Bachelors. I'll have obtained more than 64 credits at the community college due to switching from a BA to BS (can only transfer a max of 64 in the end). Following my current path I will have an associates in both arts and sciences after next summer—providing an okay platform to springboard into universities (I'm hoping).

But is it worth it?

Is there anything I learn with this degree that I cannot learn on my own? In regards to willpower, dedication, and ambition, I have no problems teaching myself. And is the portfolio or proving yourself more valuable than the degree?

My interests in the field of programming revolve around web-design (front end, back-end), software design, game development, and entrepreneurial ideas such as apps.

I'm unsure what the specific field/position would be, but I would also love to work on, say, Google's search algorithms, or Reddit or Digg. I would like to be in research, such as the IBM team who worked on Deep Blue or Watson.

In responding, would you mind explaining the path you took with your education and how long you've been in the field? 

Thank you."

I am very competent, and I know I'm a good coder. I am about a year out of school already and have about a year of experience now. About 2 months ago, I was laid off due to company budget, and have been working on my own projects/ going over data structures/algorithms etc. During these 2 months on working on myself, I realized how much I miss school and really regret how I pissed away some really important classes. 

Mind you at this point I'm really on top of my theories/fundementals, but I know I could learn more and I want to work at a company like Microsoft/Google/Amazon. The problem is actually getting the interview. 

So lately, I started thinking about trying to go to grad school (and actually striving for a 4.0), and trying to get an internship at google/microsoft while there. However, I don't want to go to just any grad school, I want to go to a top one like -- carnegie mellon, or..UC berkeley. I have a year of experience already, and I know my stuff, and I know for a fact given the opportunity to go to a great school I would definitely obtain a good GPA, however, I feel like my 2.8 undergrad GPA is essentially going to screw me in the ass when applying. 

Do I have any shot at this? Is there any way to prove to the college recruiters/ or to whomever looks at the applications that I would do well there? 

Also, is it even worth going back to school? Perhaps I can just find a lower end job and just get paid, create projects and teach myself for a couple of years then try to apply to the big companies? Any tips would be awesome.

zho37,12,2012-09-07,"My rational physician mom is voting for Romney because she thinks the Repubs have the right idea about ""not giving more money to trash"". How the hell do you combat this worldview? Can it be argued with?",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zho37/my_rational_physician_mom_is_voting_for_romney/,"My mother does not look like your stereotypical Reddit-approved Republican voter. She is a minority who is well-educated, with a science background, staunchly atheist, and anti-patriotic. She is racist and classist, but I believe no more so than many Americans in the privacy of their own homes. 

The reason she votes for Romney is because she thinks it's fair for rich people to dodge taxes because ""I wouldn't want to give more money to the poor either"". She wants to get rid of Medicaid and welfare *completely* and thinks that the poor are all lazy drug addicts who refuse to work and cheat the system, thanks to her experience as a doctor in a low-income community. Essentially, her entire reason for voting Republican is to de-fund Medicaid, and everyone in her physicians' circles feels the same way.

I don't get it. The only reason she could go to medical school in the first place was thanks to a (communist) government funding her entire education. When she arrived in America she was poor in terms of money, but not in human capital because *she had a medical degree*. In fact, the only reason she got to come to America in the first place was due to a PUBLIC university with PUBLIC science funding paying for her salary. 

She has it in her head that the only reason she's reasonably well-off now was because she worked harder than other people, so she deserves lower taxes and shouldn't have to ""help"" lazy people. But the only reason she had these opportunities in the first place was *due to other people's taxes.* I'm proud of her for taking advantage of these opportunities, but she can't see that other people don't have the same opportunities, or that other people can work their ass off and never become upper-middle-class, or that quite frankly not everyone is born with the brain capacity to become engineers and computer scientists and *it's not just a matter of laziness*. 

I do think that sometimes culture is the problem, as much as systematic issues and the death of blue-collar and manufacturing jobs that has created a gap between ""unemployment"" and ""white collar jobs that require internships poor people can't afford"". I think that too often American parents do not push their kids to work hard in school and succeed in math and science and academics, and that is a problem as much as education funding and poor teaching methodology. But I also think that we are demanding that our poor be Supermen who can overcome the culture they grow up in - the drugs, the gangs, the lack of parental support, the need to work while others are developing their human capital through studying and internships - while being satisfied that people like Mitt Romney aren't *too* evil, even though they're spectacularly greedy because ""hey, I'd be greedy too if I were rich"". 

Most of all, I don't believe the answer is punishment. The reason I don't count on the existence of Supermen (if you starve them enough) is because I am a pragmatist, not an idealist. I don't know what the answer is, but I know it's not depriving someone of access to basic needs. I can understand many traditional fiscal Conservative desires like small government, but I just don't understand this urge to punish, or this notion that most of our taxes are going to welfare queens and Medicaid cheats. 

I see a lot of moderate people claiming that both parties have the same fundamental vision, but different ideas on how best to get there. From personal experience, I have to disagree - I think my mom and I fundamentally prioritize different principles, where she cares more about ""personal freedom"" and ""fair taxes"" while I care more about ""personal responsibility"", ""fair opportunities"", and equal access to this freedom. So my question is: with the kind of argument she and the Republicans make, is it a matter of personal ethics, or of being lied to about the real world? Can it be combated with logic, reasoning, and real numbers; or are we simply too different in values, such that we're not even working towards the same vision?

**tl;dr: I don't believe Republicans are crazy or evil, but I cannot accept this kind of moralism. How can we address it with reasoning, logic, and real-world data? Can someone help me construct an argument, or can this worldview not be reasoned with?**"
zhi57,1,2012-09-06,Lost and confused. What should I (22F) do with 4 year bf(23M)? Long post.,theconstantjuggler,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zhi57/lost_and_confused_what_should_i_22f_do_with_4/,"My boyfriend and I are coming up to our 4 year anniversary. But I want to be single. He and I are best friends and the reason I'm hesitating is because 
1) I'm scared that I'll make a huge mistake and regret it forever. 
2) I don't want to hurt either of us. 
3) We've been talking about getting married and having babies for like 3 1/2 years. 
4) We're living with his dad at the moment so that I can save up and go on an international internship next year - logistical nightmare.
5) I love his mum and little sisters to death. 
6) He is the most important person in the world to me.

Earlier this year I cheated on him with a girl i had been pursuing (I'm bisexual). I felt absolutely awful for it and eventually he forgave me. I can't help still feeling like I want to be with other people. I dream about being with others every night and I don't even feel guilty about wanting to be with someone else (though I won't cheat again). It was at the beginning of the year that I told him I would want to take a break over summer (Sth hemisphere), where we would both be free to pursue other people and I would have a chance to get my independence back. He's been up and down ever since, sometimes being very understanding and other times being incredibly cold. He can be negative and pessimistic, anti-social and unrealistic. He is also incredibly un-ambitious. I try to be positive and am very ambitious. When we met he was at uni but the next year he just started working full time, everyday talking about how much he hated his job. 

For the first year of our relationship we were both just loved up, living together and smoking weed too much. I realised that that was not the way I wanted to live my life and toned it down. Last year it became harder for us to source but then ""legal cannabis"" came onto the market. We went from buying a pack every other week to him buying a pack every other day. This year he would smoke it before work and constantly in the evenings. I would have one cone and be done but he would just smoke sooo much. A few months ago I was looking for a packet I had bought the day before. He swore black and white that he had no idea where it was, i even found the empty pack in the bin and he denied everything. We went for a walk and he admitted his lie, saying that he has been smoking before work every day when I've accused him. --Basically I would accuse him of smoking it (i can smell it), he would deny it, I would put on the pressure and he would get very, very nasty calling me a control freak and a nazi. --The fact that he'd been lying the entire time really took its toll on me emotionally. he promised he would never lie again and then a week ago he lied to my face - again, then quickly told the truth.

One more thing that really hurt me was when I opened up about my depression, the catalyst being my estranged father's death 2 years ago. He said ""I don't think you're depressed, I think you want to be depressed"" Here I was, feeling suicidal, trying to open up to my soulmate and he was just shutting me down. I said it was the nastiest thing anyone has ever said to me.

But he also is so loving, caring, funny, sweet. We still laugh and cuddle and kiss and fuck but I feel like this isn't where I want to be anymore. 

I don't know if I should stay and fix this or leave it now.

If I wait until November when i go overseas, I'll want to do it before I leave so that I can just be single and enjoy myself over there. I'm only going for 2 months and I don't know how I'll feel at the end of it.

Long post I'm sorry, this is my first on Reddit.

couple months ago, I was looking for an internship and I found this one where I would be working for a big mining company. Which is 1000km away from home. 

I applied and got it. But then I took a closer look and the work I would have to do wasn't interesting, that would be a boring internship. I said might as well try it. 

Then 1 month before the start of the intership, I was begining to make these panic attacks more and more often, I was really scared of what it would be and how could I make it. 

I started two days ago and I just realized that I would not make it through the four months that I have to do here. So I took the decision to quit. Tomorow I'm flying back home and I have to call the company to tell them they are not going to see me again. 

Just wanted to share my story.

We met at work in Chicago, and pretty soon, we were spending 24 hours a day together. We would awake in her place or mine, get ready for work, and take the bus to our job. Spent the evenings together, and repeat the next day. This went on for 2+ years.

We were independent too. She had her passions and friends, and I had mine. So we would also go our separate ways for entertainment. But since we spent so much time together, we REALLY got to know each other.

I proposed after 9 months, and we got married in May last year. Great marriage, great relationship. Simply put, we were each others favorite person. 

In May of this year, I got offered a job in Austin. It was as close to a dream job as I could get in my career. They were going to allow me to work long distance, but through the encouragement of my wife, I accepted the job, and we planned our move. 

I was nervous the entire time, and was saddened to leave our condo, friends, and in-laws. She comforted me, and motivated me to move as we were ""young and adventurous"". 

She was going to have to stay behind for a month to finish up the summer semester of college where she is studying Justice Studies. Her last semester just required her to finish an internship, which she got permission to finish in Austin. She was so close to being done. So I moved at the end of July, and she was supposed to join me 8/22.

She got here, and then everything changed.

She acted semi-normal, but I could tell she wasn't happy. Not as happy as I was to see her. I was pretty lonely here, as I don't have a way to get around really. (She kept the car in Chicago, and I bought a bike down here to get around in 100 degree weather). Distance made my heart grow fonder. It wasn't the same for her.

She opened up and told me that she was really sad, and didn't really know why. We sort of chalked it up to homesickness. But she went on about all the opportunities she is leaving behind in Chicago; the classmates that she'll miss, the professors that are championing her career. She started to show signs of depression, and it was obvious she didn't want to be in Austin. She was barely affectionate, and wasn't the same loving wife that I knew so well. She basically did not want to be here.

After a few talks, I suggested that she go back to Chicago to finish the semester. If it was the only way that she was going to shake the sadness, it was all I could do. She agreed, and suddenly everything seemed fine. Once she knew she could go back, she saw light at the end of the tunnel.

I started to question if something happened in that month apart. She denied it, and did a mediocre job of convincing me that she still cared deeply for me. But I did start to question if she still cared about me. I mean, how could she leave me here in Austin for months while she tries to shake the sadness?

She went back on Monday, and honestly, I'm 100% miserable. I feel abandoned. I don't know anyone here, and I only have a bike so going to bars means showing up drenched in sweat. We can't afford another car (that she took back to Chicago since she needs it a bit more than me), since we are a single income family as she finishes her degree. We talk, and all I can try to do is support her and hope that she shakes the depression and wants to come back.

Bottom line, it's not the loneliness. It's the feeling of abandonment.  

I'm cracking. (signed up for therapy and everything)

But what do I do, guys? How can I get through this? Was I right to try to help her figure it out?

tl;dr Wife was supposed to move with me to Austin. She came, got depressed, and went back ""temporarily"""
zkoj3,4,2012-09-08,Can't access a company's YouTube account- lost Gmail pasword,jgrossnas,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/zkoj3/cant_access_a_companys_youtube_account_lost_gmail/,"I'm trying to help out a friend who works for a company that had an intern set up a Gmail account and then a YouTube account for them.  Unfortunately, the person left and didn't leave the contact info (they can't contact him either).  They have some embarrassing stuff on their YouTube channel now but can't access it without accessing the Gmail account which the intern used to set it up.  

The other ways to access the account are 1) answer a security question (which no one knows the answer for) or 2) use a partially hidden e-mail address (which no one knows the identity for).

Google is saying that without the G-mail password or answers to the security questions, they can't help.  The company that can't access YouTube/Gmail is stuck now and doesn't know what to do.  What can I advise them about getting back access to their YouTube account?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!"
zkkhc,25,2012-09-08,"Stayed too long, now stuck",burdalane,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zkkhc/stayed_too_long_now_stuck/,"I got my BS in computer science almost 10 years ago from a well-known school where many alumni go on to jobs at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I had an internship and a good GPA, but I didn't do much programming outside of class. I also never really mastered topics like algorithms and operating systems. I ended up taking a job that was billed as programming and system administration, which was also new to me. I went on autopilot for years and didn't really think about my career until the last few years, when I realized that my job has become less and less programming. My only programming now is modifying a few lines of code in an existing program, reading source code, or writing a one-off script to automate something. My typical day is modifying some software configuration, swapping hard drives, doing a backup, or trying to fix some Linux problem.

I'm now in a situation where I don't have much real programming experience, and I haven't really developed my sysadmin skills beyond what is necessary for the job, nor do I really like doing administration or working with hardware. My resume apparently still looks impressive because I get contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn for programming jobs, but I don't have the confidence to actually get through a technical interview. 

I'm trying to rectify the situation by working on a side project that has potential to be monetized and will let me learn new frameworks, and taking online courses like on Coursera and Udacity.

I'm not sure what my specific question is, just looking for feedback and advice, I guess, and to hear from people in similar situations."
zkkea,36,2012-09-08,Tips for Seniors who want to avoid unemployment.,irndk10,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zkkea/tips_for_seniors_who_want_to_avoid_unemployment/,"Just a little background, I graduated in May with a solid GPA (3.3), but 0 internships and very little CAE experience. This made it very difficult for me to even get an interview. After months of improvement, knowledge, and perseverance I finally landed a dream job with a great offer. Unemployment was a miserable and depressing experience, however, I learned a lot a long the way. I kept finding myself saying ""fuck, I wish I would;ve known to do that"". I'm sure you've heard a lot of these, but I think it's more helpful to hear from someone who recently wen through first hand.


* Hopefully I'm not too late for this one, if you have the choice, choose your senior design project wisely. If you have no internship experience, this will be your major talking point. Make sure it's a project that you are interested in. Do good work and maintain a professional but also personal relationship with your company contact. Many people get job offers through this. This is especially important if you have a less than desirable GPA. They won't care about your GPA if you demonstrated your can produce good work. Even if they can't offer something you have added someone to your network.


* This one is obvious, but go to any career fair your school offers, even if you want to work in another geographic location. It will give you valuable interview experience. Also research the companies beforehand, to give you a talking point. This will also allow you to speak about any other location you are interested in.


* Start skimming job postings now. This is extremely helpful. See what types of opportunities are out there. For example, if you are an ME, you can be in multiple types of design, aeronautics, HVAC, testing, manufacturing and the list goes on. Once you see exactly what's out there, research and decide types are best suited for you. Then, look at the common qualifications associated and use the remainder of your year building towards them. For example, if you want to be a manufacturing engineer, take a production engineering class your last semester and gain a working knowledge of any program commonly listed in job postings. This will go miles.


* Start seriously applying right before your final semester. Like anything, you will get better at job hunting/interviewing the longer you do it. If you start early it gives you more time to figure it all out. 


* I personally recommend using engineerjobs.com as my main job search tool. It compiles searches from multiple job hunting sites. Craigslist is my #2. Nobody thinks of getting an engineering job on craigslist, but they are certainly out there. You have a much higher chance of getting a response, because less people apply, and your resume goes straight to the correct person.


* Develop a somewhat personal relationship with a couple professors. You don't have to kiss ass or work as their research assistant, just be a good student and a alright guy in their eyes. This is easier senior year as classes are smaller and professors tend to respect you a little more. Companies often ask professors for recommendations. As long as you ask them, they may be able to recommend you.

* If you have any sort of connections, utilize them. You can get a lot in life by simply asking.

* Update/Improve your cover letter/resume every few weeks. Just like doing a tough problem, sometimes just walking away from and later returning can really help. I can't tell you how many times I revised my resume/cover letter and said to myself ""well that's as good as I can possibly do."" only to come back 2 weeks later and saying ""wow I can definitely improve this area."" Also try to make your cover letter semi custom. I had a template and just went off that for every posting. My cover letter was 85% the same every time, but it still had that personalized feel.

* One more thing. Go back and skim any labs or projects that you have done in your Jr and Sr year just to jog your memory on what you actually did. Every once in awhile an interviewer will ask you about your experience with something. A lot of times you can use your experience with a simple lab or project to talk about. They eat that shit up. It's what got me an on site interview with the job I recently got. 


Cold calling/emailing random companies didn't seem to help. In my experience 90% don't answer and the other 10% turned me down, so don't waste your time.


There are a few more that are slipping my mind, This was more geared towards someone who who doesn't have a great GPA, internship experience or connections. I know it's not great, but it's something.

zkggg,0,2012-09-08,I need help reporting abusive behavior by an exec director...,Hana3487,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zkggg/i_need_help_reporting_abusive_behavior_by_an_exec/,"I was recently hired as an intern for a nonprofit. On my first day, the Executive Director, who was supposed to be training me, was extremely degrading and patronizing in his behavior. He scolded me for not doing my job, and often wouldn't even explain exactly what I had done wrong. When he told me that I had a bad attitude and that if I didn't watch out he'd hire someone else, he wouldn't give me any examples of what I had actually done wrong. After giving me a task, he would call me over to his desk every 20 to 30 minutes to remind me that work had to get done fast. 

During that same day, there was another woman (S) ""shadowing"" me. Rather than sitting down for an interview, my employer had asked this woman to donate a day of work so that he could observe her at work. He did the same thing with me. He was also very rude to this woman and almost had her in tears. 

At the end of the day, He refused to give me employment papers even though I had already worked a full day.

The next day, I sent my employer this email explaining how I felt about the situation:

I wanted to write you an email to say how very disappointed I am at how I was treated at work yesterday. Not only were you extremely rude to me, but you were unjustly rude to S. Even though you may think of her as a job applicant, she was also a volunteer, and deserves to be treated with the respect and dignity of a volunteer. In my view, even if you do not believe S's work was up to par as a paid intern, she should have at least been thanked for the work that she did do. I have worked with hundreds of volunteers while serving with AmeriCorps, and in that time I have learned that there is a huge range of natural ability and an even greater difference in learning styles. However, almost every single volunteer I have ever encountered--from eleven to eighty years of age--have, at the very least, been deserving of thanks and respect for trying their hardest,

I really do believe that ---- is doing some of the most important work of our time. The modern food industry is literally poisoning the population and we need to stop this trend. I would love to be part of an organization that is doing this great work, but I am not willing to sacrifice my self-respect in the process. I have come to this organization with years of work experience, an education, and superb writing skills that I am happy to utilize for very meager earnings. I love to work hard and I also love to be pushed to be better--but this push must come from a stance of positivity or else we will both be miserable people. I want a happy working environment for myself because I deserve it and because positivity will encourage me to thrive at whatever I attempt.

I understand that you are under a lot of pressure and the lack of sleep might be making you irritable. I am actually concerned that your lack of sleep might be affecting your judgement. You might not even be aware that your behavior is pushing people away and might be the cause of your inability to retain a reliable staff. If after a good night's sleep you believe that you can be polite and treat me with dignity, then I would be happy to return to work on tomorrow. But if you truly believe that you acted justly towards me yesterday, then I quite, because I will not stand for that sort of treatment. 

Sincerely,

H

Of course I never heard a word back.

I truly do believe this man is having some mental and emotional issues. He tended to blank out a lot without realizing it. At one point during the day, he asked me a question that involved multiplying 16 by 2. When I answered 32 he just stared at me with wide eyes until I spelled it out again. The man was actually wearing a shirt that said ""sleep is for the weak,"" and had made at least a few comments about living his work day and night. 


 I would like to contact the board of directors about this incident but I can't find a list anywhere. Can anybody help?"

I'm particularly proud of the ""you gotta place there"" bit, which has become legendary. We're always making one another laugh.
[Hey Josh!  Follow you on facebook all the time!  Two questions here: First, have you ever said or done anything on the show that you got in trouble for? Second, is it the same two guys in Secretariat or do they just swap interns or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654n99?context=5)|Once. It was the last time I did Geoff as a drunk robot. For some unknown reason, it didn't go over well. That was the last time. And Secretariat is a real horse! How dare you! ;)
[What's it like working with the one and only Craig Ferguson?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654iky?context=5)|A treat. It's a dance out there. You gotta be quick. I'm honored he lets me play along.
[I know in the old studio they had you near Lesbian Row, where do they have you now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654oab?context=5)|Near Lesbian Row. CBS cares.
[JRT, I'm a big fan of your work on the LLS and your youtube stuff, but I do have a legit question. I've seen your name next to some scientology stuff, is that true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654k5t?context=5)|I did some acting stuff for them for a while, but I am definitely NOT a Scientologist.

[Hi Josh.  How much of your bit is scripted, and how much do you come up with on the fly?  P.S. You are funny as hell !!  You and Craig make a great team.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654mcq?context=5)|Nothing Craig and I do together is scripted. Rarely a writer might work in a line or two, but that's it.
[The Late Late Show was great, but you helped make it amazing. One of the best shows on TV, period. Where do you sit while controlling the puppet?

Did you prefer the Agora or Peabody's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654ldb?context=5)|The viral thing means very little to me. I mean, it's cool and all for promotion. But I know guys, professionals, who live and die by that stuff. That it was pulled is stupid and speaks to the stupidity of things today. It's like, here, I've made something that so many people love and respond to immediately and is an overnight sensation, and it gets ruined because a few people got a stick up their ass. Sad.
[Also--which surprises you more: going viral or having the video pulled 24 hours later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654ldb?context=5)|The Agora.

On the show, it works. Having another actual person as a sidekick would be strange. But I've got a number of other projects that you'll see my face in.
[What is your favorite joke to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654pd1?context=5)|I really love having Geoff say that he has his robot friends over for a party.

[What ever happened to the old skits that Craig used to do? Like the Ask Aquaman bit, the Prince Charles and Sean Connery impressions, and one of my all-time favorite LLS bits, his James Bond audition tape?  Are they just one of those things Craig got tired of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655bio?context=5)|Yeah, skits come and go.

A few words about me: I'm German, male, turning 18 this month, finished my Abitur this summer and I'm starting an internship in October. I don't live in Berlin yet, the room/flat should hence be available a few days before the start of the internship. I'm quite tolerant and as long as I get my personal space, any roommate should be fine.

My budget is ~400€ max. for warmmiete and the place should at least have a small kitchen included. Work is in Mitte near Wedding and I'd like to live somewhere nearby (Prenzlauer Berg, Tiergarten, Pankow, Moabit, Friedrichshain etc. - you get the picture).

zjjod,9,2012-09-08,Questions about post-college job prospects as a CompSci major.,qaruxj,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/zjjod/questions_about_postcollege_job_prospects_as_a/,"**tl;dr:** Are the claims of a massive shortage of CompSci majors true, and if so are the available jobs going to be mostly good or mostly bad? Finally, will the salaries still be as good, or will they somehow decrease and become more comparable with other STEM degrees?

I've seen a few articles talking about how there's going to be some huge shortage of Computer Science majors in the US come 2016 (which is about the time I'll be graduating), which obviously seems like good news insofar as it means I should definitely have a job. However, I have a couple of questions about that.

First, as context, I'm taking on *a lot* of debt to go to college. My family is quite poor and so I'm basically taking the maximum amount of loans I can get, since my university doesn't like to give scholarships to freshmen. Later, I expect this to subside since I'll be getting a job, hopefully scholarships, and will also be required to do a couple of paid internships my senior year that will pay $40,000, which obviously should help me out quite a lot, but I'm nonetheless worried about the prospect of having tens of thousands in loans, much of them accumulating debt over the 4+ years (my department says that, due to their internships, the average graduation time is actually four years and a term, and since I'm not some kind of crazy amazing student, I expect that I will probably do at least that).

Right now, I'm really excited for CompSci, but I know that a lot of people do change their majors and end up pursuing something completely different from what they started out with. I really don't think I could bring myself to major in something like English or History, having seen what's happening to all these people who've graduated with way better and more specific degrees and still failed to find a job, but I want to know how accurate these shortage claims are. Employment opportunities are not my only concern, because I do want to major in something that interests me, but when I see these claims that other Engineering degrees aren't experiencing much of a shortage while Computer Science majors are looking at crazy opportunities in four years' time, it really makes me want to stick with CompSci at all costs, just so I know I can have a good job that pays decent money.

Getting to actual questions:

First, are these claims even true at face value? I've seen a number of articles claiming flat out that this is a myth and that demand for CompSci majors is being greatly overstated. Some of them seemed rather dubious to me, but I feel like that might just be me being biased after having heard about there being a shortage of millions of CompSci majors and demand so high that salaries will be ridiculously good compared to the national average, which obviously sounds really appealing and too good to be true, but also would be so beneficial to me in terms of job opportunities and salary that it's hard for me to really weigh it equally.

Related to that, are there any ""gotchas"" that could turn this from true to not true really quickly? I read one article saying the response to the shortage should be decreased immigration restrictions, but I don't know to what extent that would change things. Is there anything with a reasonable chance of happening (so not an asteroid strike or WWIII) that would drastically alter my job prospects that I should be aware of?

Second, what are these jobs actually going to be like? I'm really interested in software engineering/development and databases, but I'm kind of worried that most of these jobs will be glorified IT jobs or something that won't really be what I'm interested in. I'm assuming the huge glut of jobs would have enough diversity that it wouldn't be a problem, but if it's a million small business owners who want me to set up their network for them and build a custom Access database to track their orders in, I'm probably not going to be very happy.

Third, I know software engineer salaries are really good right now, but is this expected to stay the same? I assume the increased demand would mean higher salaries all around, but if it's the small businesses I mentioned or something like that, I could see them going down because they're mostly intended to replace whatever the owner or their kid threw together and not increased demand in the same way that every major company needing a lot more software developers would be. I guess this is a largely irrational concern, but the reason I bring it up is, if I would end up making a similar salary to any of the other jobs that might interest me, I would not be quite as attached to CompSci as I am now.

Thanks for any help with this."

I'm a 20F involved with a 26M; it's still pretty new, been together about a month.

Here is the context of this relationship: I interned at the company he works for (a very big company-- however, within a tight-knit industry) this summer. I'm no longer employed there, but hope to return; he works in an entirely different department than I did and holds a senior, but non-management position (emphatically: he was not my boss and wouldn't be if I returned). 

We struck up a relationship at the end of my internship and kept it quiet. My internship is now over, we continue to keep it quiet. 

I never flirted or entertained advances from anyone else at this company, and starting talking to him in a 'romantic' way only after getting to know him.

I really care about him, and the feelings are reciprocated. He's probably the best guy I've ever met, and I want to see where this goes. 

However, clouded as my judgment is -- is this a good idea, given the workplace connection we have, and particularly my position as a (now former) intern?

TL;DR: I got involved with a ""real employee"" who worked in a different department than mine while on an internship. Now that the internship's over, is it appropriate if I date him? I'm looking for outside input here. 

So, specific question: Is this relationship appropriate?"

What were your most favorite and least favorite jobs?",Journeyman42,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zm9q5/reddit_what_is_your_job_history_what_were_your/,"I started a new job a couple weeks ago, and it made me realize how many jobs I've had.  I'm a 26 year old guy.

February 2001-August 2004: high school part-time job as a bus boy at a restaurant.  It wasn't too bad, but my boss left halfway through and her replacement didn't like me and stuck me on coffee detail, which I didn't mind because customers suck.  Left because I was starting college.

October 2004-May 2006:  part-time job at college campus food court.  Included work at Burger King, a taco place, and a panini place.  Left because serving food to high/hungover college students sucks.

Summers of 2005-2010: full-time seasonal cleaning assistant during the summer at first an elementary school for the first four years, then at a high school for the last year.  It wasn't too bad of a job, I didn't have to deal with customers and I could wear headphones while I cleaned.  Also the other janitors were laid back dudes who took hour breaks while only clocking out for a half hour.  Yeah, our tax dollars at work lol.  It wasn't bad money either.  Elementary and high school kids are equally messy, but the high school kids are definitely far more malicious about it.  I saw some little bastards throw their soda bottle at the feet of one of the other janitors and demanded that he throw it away.

September 2006-December 2006: part-time job as a cleaning person at a hotel.  Don't ask why I got it.  I sucked pretty hard at it as they needed the rooms perfectly cleaned in too little time, which I couldn't manage.  Left because job sucked and I sucked at it, and I found a better job.

February 2007-December 2008: part-time geology lab tutor at the university I went to.  I found out that geology minors can also be lab tutors, and they had need for one, so I did that until I graduated.  It was pretty good other than the students bitching about why they needed to take earth science classes (the school has a pretty big business and nursing colleges).  After I graduated, the economy had pretty much bottomed out and I didn't find work (aside from that seasonal cleaning assistant job I mentioned earlier) until fall 2009, when I was living with my parents and spending too much time on the internet.

September 2009-May 2010: Substitute teacher at the middle and high school level.  Found out that the only requirements you need to become a substitute teacher in my state are any 4-year degree and a clean criminal record, and I had both.  High school kids suck.

December 2010-January 2011: I wasn't getting asked enough to substitute teach so I took a job at a restaurant as a waiter.  The restaurant had just opened and the guy that owned it, who owned a bar previously, picked a really shitty manager to run it.  It was supposed to be a part-time job but increasingly worked more hours because other servers would call in ""sick"" or just not fucking show up.  Kitchen was too small to keep up with orders when the restaurant was food so I got a lot of complaints from people bitching about their food taking too long.  Eventually fired on a day I literally wasn't supposed to be there (I was covering for someone who asked to take the day off and I accepted) because of some customer's bullshit claim.  This was the shift after a particularly brutal steak night and, after I clocked out, the owner bought me a beer at the bar to thank me for working so hard.  Customers still suck.  One of two jobs that I would say were my least favorite.

It was during my time at the restaurant that I realized I should probably go back to school, because my 4 year degree wasn't helping with shit.  I eventually picked a 2 year degree in a biotechnology lab technician program at a tech school in the nearest big city from home.  After I got fired, I realized that I could apply to substitute in multiple school districts, and eventually was working at least two days a week (it paid about 100 dollars a day, depending on what the district paid).

September 2010-December 2011: Tutor at tech school.  I was randomly walking down the hallway near the library when I saw an ad for gen ed tutors.  I was virtually hired on the spot due to my geo lab tutoring.  I tutored mainly for chemistry, biology, and earth science because all the other tutors specialized in either math or English, though I did have to help with English and math sometimes.  Was a pretty sweet gig at first, I tutored at night and the last hour of the day was pretty much dead, so I could do my own homework or dick around on the computers, waiting for people to show up.  However, the next two semesters I switched to tutoring mornings and it was busier.  Left because there's only so many times you have to explain what a meter is or what chemical bonds are before you snap.

May 2011-May 2012: part-time research assistant to a PhD student internship at UW-Madison.  My first lab tech job.  I got it by asking one of my profs at the tech school (who did research at UW) if she knew of any open positions, and they created one for me.  PhD student researches iron-reducing bacteria that live in anaerobic conditions in sediment or rock.  I had to perform a lot of chemical assays, chromatography, and some molecular biology to sequence ID the bacteria in the samples.  Easily my most favorite job yet.  I had to leave after I graduated because it was a student-only position.

January 2012-May 2012: part-time lab tech internship at a bioenergy company.  Though it was more chemcial-oriented than biotech-oriented, it was a good time.  Would be instrumental later.

May 2012-July 2012: full-time (finally!) ""lab tech"" position at a huge contract research biotech/chemistry company.  Got the job through a recruiter who upsold the fuck out of it by saying I could transfer to a new department pretty much any time I wanted to.  The company was starting a new contract project that included refabbing existing build space and would last for six-ish months.  However, when I started working, I realized my error.  The specific department was sample prep for food chemistry, which involved putting cereal and other food into blenders and then dumping liquid nitrogen on them to send to the actual chemists.  I also did sample pitching, which was going through all the boxes of archived samples and then pitching (ie, throwing away) the expired samples.  I had to work near the trash compactor, which, due to the 100+ degree weather we had this summer, stunk the entire area to high hell.  I was let go because they overestimated the amount of people they needed for the project and apparently the other person was more of the drone-type they were looking for.  I was miserable there and was actually happy to be fired.

The job hunt after I was fired, however, wasn't too bad.  Like I said, I got a job a couple weeks ago at a startup that researches battery electrolytes, and it pays much better than the food chemistry place did.  And no garbage smell.  I'm also taking a night class this next year in Stem Cell Technologies, so hopefully that pans out after I get my certificate and I can finally get a stable full-time job."
zm9cg,1,2012-09-09,"I [23M] am 'stuck' in a relationship with SO [22F]. Utterly confusing and stressful situation, help me.",IAMATrappedThrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zm9cg/i_23m_am_stuck_in_a_relationship_with_so_22f/,"Okay, I have been in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years now and we have been living together for about a year and a half. 

The beginning of our relationship was amazing, with some rocky parts (but what relationship doesn't have these?). However, since she first moved in with me she had conflict with my best-friend/roommate and my other roommate and essentially seperated me from them and a few other of my friends who she has had arguments or fights with. She is loving and cares about me for the most part but she can easily turn into a monster, especially after drinking. 

I work full-time at a hospital after having graduated last year, while she is a senior in college, works part time, and does an internship so she has little in the ways of income which results in me buying literally every meal/drink for her for the most part; she also pays about a 1/3rd of what I pay for rent (we currently share a 2BR apartment with another couple). 

For about a year my friends have said this or that about how I deserve better than her and how she's an awful person... during this time I have had to walk a very thin line to please both parties and try to compromise things between them.

Sex has literally dwindled to nothing as since the beginning of our relationship she has always had pain during intercourse and it almost turns me off that she gets basically no satisfaction (just the opposite) out of it. This isn't a huge problem, but it's obviously an issue of frustration.

There are many times I tell myself that I continue the relationship strictly because I am too lonely and would rather suffer these problems with her rather than suffer alone... I hate an empty bed.

Now this is where things get a little more complicated, an extremely attractive girl [20F] came into my hospital the other day... While she waited around we exchanged glances across the room the entire time... I left without saying a word to her, but I don't know what it was... but I went home and went on craigslist and made a missed connection regarding her. Now I honestly didn't expect anything to come of it but lo and behold, the next day I look at my emails and she replied, saying ""I hope I had caught your glance!"" I was floored to say the least.

Now this is where my stress starts... she asked for my number and we have been texting back and forth... hasn't asked me if I'm in a relationship and wants to get together for coffee or a meal and now I feel uneasy and almost ashamed that I am either A) emotionally cheating on my girlfriend, or B) leading this other girl on. 

The situation wouldn't be so hard for me if I didn't just get around to moving into a new apartment with my girlfriend the beginning of this month. She is not on the lease, but I don't think I can afford the extra $300 with her not there, nor do I think I would have the heart to tell my girlfriend to find a place on her own with absolutely no money or other options as far as her continuing her education/internship/job out here. I truly feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no idea what to do, I haven't told anyone else and it's literally eating me up.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I am desperate for help.

**TL;DR: I am stuck/living with my girlfriend and have been approached and been talking to another girl**"

zm0px,3,2012-09-09,"Here goes nothing.  Sorry, this is long.  It's years of explanation that have been pent up. ",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zm0px/here_goes_nothing_sorry_this_is_long_its_years_of/,"I feel pathetic posting this on a public forum.  I guess I'm just looking for someone who would have some kind of reason or even can relate to what I've been going through almost my entire life.

I can remember my first thought of suicide at the age of 6.  I wanted to run out into the middle of the street and hoped to get hit by a passing car.  I remember where I was standing in front of my house, looking around to see if anyone saw me, and, then, I started running towards the street; but, I stopped.  My thoughts were, ""What if I don't succeed?  Then I'm going to get the worst beating of my life and still have to suffer through all of this."" 

It's almost 20 years later, and that has been my biggest fear ever since.  I do not want to get others involved, and I do not want to fail.  

At the age of 13, I started cutting myself, and I have been struggling with this off and on throughout the years.  I kept it a really hidden secret for two years until I confided in a close friend about my cutting and about a beating I had received from my father.  That friend then called the cops, and they came over to my house.  I told them that my father didn't beat me because I didn't want to see him go to jail; they took pictures of my scars from cutting and threatened to take me away if I did it again.  After the cops left, I kept getting yelled at for being a stupid, ignorant bitch for getting my father in trouble like that and for doing those things to my body.  I can understand this view of things.  I really can, but the cutting, for me, is almost like an addiction.  It has been my only friend during my depression and sadness.  The release is almost euphoric.  And, just the thought of how wonderful harming myself feels, gets me excited for the release that I could feel from the pain of suicide.

I have been planning my suicide for a very long time now.  I've had the gun to my head; I've had the rope around my neck.  I just haven't gone through with it because attempting suicide is like a gamble.  I do not want someone that I love to have to clean up a mess.  I do not want to have to see my mutilated corpse.  I don't want them to be the first to find me.  I wish there was just a place that could assure me that I will die and that the people that I love will not be able to view any part of it.  

I'm very confident in my choice to commit suicide.  I know that I will do it one day.  I just need to find the perfect way to do it.  

Lately, I have been thinking more heavily about it.  The only times that I don't think about suicide is when I feel like I have purpose in life and when someone is relying on me.  How pathetic, huh?  I see no point in having a life that imposes such burdens and frustration on others.  

I'm a complete failure.  I had my first professional internship in the engineering field before I even graduated high school.  I was accepted to some of the most prestigious colleges in the states.  I had a wonderful plan to marry my now ex-fiance (of 5.5 years) and have a family with him.  But, now, I was denied the ability to go to these colleges because my parents did not want me so far away.  And, even after going to a local college, I couldn't finish school due to finances.  That wonderful ex cheated on me with 5 girls in the time we were together and stole my virginity.  I can't even walk into my church for help in fear of getting excommunicated because I had sex with my ex.  My life is a complete waste now.  And, I would really like to be able to find a way to end it as soon as I can. 

Has anyone else felt this way for so long?  Do you know why?  Did you ever get over it?  How?

zlx51,2,2012-09-09,Multiple Internships or One job? ,techonomics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zlx51/multiple_internships_or_one_job/,"I'm currently a Computer Science student right now and the I've been working as an employee (basically as a junior programmer/(and occasionally IT support) at small company(200 total employees) for the past year. I like the company, I like the people, etc. I get paid the standard internship rate per hour and yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.

I work on multiple different products. Basically, every new product our company comes out with, I am responsible for a feature or two. The majority of my work though, is maintaining, updating, + testing our internal tools for software development ( we have our own language, own server architecture, and our own IDE.

Other than that, I would say about 40-50% of my remaining time I spend programming internal data reports ( work a little bit with R and integrate it into our own language) and also programming electronic forms.
So far, I've been at this company for about a year, but I definitely think that I can stay for the long haul if I'd like to.

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question:

**To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?**

Some people are advising me that It may look better for me to have 5 years experience on my resume than 2 or 3 five month internships. The only reason I've been questioning.that is because the company is not, you know, a huge company (it's not considered the number one tech place to work in my area or anything)


One of my other concerns, regarding internships, was the work they do. Most of my friends complain about how the work they do at their internships is quite **menial and boring**...(Sort of makes sense, too. Interns at my current company get all the busy/boring work as well).
Looking at it from the HR perspective, would my title be more respected than the title of intern?

Currently, my title is Junior Programmer and I feel that HR departments will consider that a notch or two higher than the title of intern...One of the HR guys I've talked to advised me to stay at my current job(especially since I think I have good chances of being promoted in in the next 4 years while I'm in college) because it would make my salary for my next job a bit higher than it would be for the average student who completed a few interns. Not that I necessarily agree with all this HR crap, but the more I think about it and the more people I meet, this seems to be increasingly true.


**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?**

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company."
zlf6g,0,2012-09-09,Half-Asian 25m having difficulties getting over father issues.  Biological father appeared back in my life after 2 decades and wants me to help him.,asterysk,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/zlf6g/halfasian_25m_having_difficulties_getting_over/,"Hi /relationships, wondering if you might have some advice for me.  My father left me when I was very young and I'm still having trouble getting over his absence.  Also it's complicated by the fact that he is from a foreign country, which has caused... racial identity issues for me as well.

Background, I'll try to condense this as much as possible:

- American mother (white) travelled overseas to work as an English teacher in...lets say, China.  (Close enough.)

- Met my soon-to-be father (Asian) who was relatively well off at the time.  Had a 3yo daughter from a previous marriage, son of an affluent, well-respected doctor in his town.  

- Decided they wanted to get married, moved back to US, mom's family **freaked**.  Maternal grandmother and aunt on my mother's side gradually turned mother against him, started trying to indoctrinate and kidnap my older half-sister.  Temporarily cut off contact between father and my older sis esp as he was working long hours trying to make a paycheck...difficult for a foreigner with no degree.

- During this time I was born.

- 2 weeks later situation was so bad, dad decided to ""cut his losses"" and take his older daughter back to China.

**TL;DR - Mom brought home a ""foreigner"", her family freaked out, dad left 2 weeks after I was born.**

**Childhood:**

- Mother remarried when I was three, mother and stepfather had a daughter when I was six.  Growing up, my sister and I fought a lot, I wasn't too close to my stepfather, but these have both improved over time.  I'm on good terms with mom, stepfather, and younger sister today.  (The four of us are essentially ""the family"".  I call my stepfather ""dad"" nowadays.)

- Predominantly white (&gt;90%) public school in a socially conservative small town in the deep south was difficult for me.  I was strong academically but had difficulty making friends from middle school onwards.  I always felt ""different"" and that I didn't belong because I was Asian (compared to everyone else I might as well have been 100% Asian, they couldn't tell any difference).  Was not as well off as everyone else.  Wealth equated to social status in the town I grew up in.  I used my mom's last name but even that was weird.  European name, but not common.  I was teased a lot for being: 1. Asian. 2. Poor.  3. Weird last name. 4. Nerdy, overly concerned about studies.  One the one hand, everyone identified me as **the Asian kid**, yet on the other hand I didn't know much beyond just a little bit from what my mother had told me about China, what I read in news/books, a few words.

- Mom and stepfather divorced when I started high school.  Turned out to be not as traumatizing, both my younger sis and I have gotten over it decently.

- I basically hated living in Small Town, had only a few friends (but I still keep up with them loosely today).  I doubled down on my studies knowing I was at least intelligent and could go to college and GTFO of Small Town.  

- Looking back at high school it's actually painfully obvious to me now that I had several good opportunities to have a relationship with girls in school.  I guess I always second-guessed myself thinking that I was too poor (and didn't want them to know) and that no one would be legitimately interested in me because I was this nerdy Asian kid.  I felt also that I didn't really know how to talk to them and reciprocate as it was something a ""dad"" was supposed to teach, and my stepfather and I weren't too close growing up.  I was too nervous to ever make a move and ask them out, even though it's obvious now they *were* interested.

- Mom and sis moved to a different state when I was a senior in high school.  Stayed with my stepdad to finish HS, he was cool.  Family pressured me to go to school in the new state, and I wanted to get as far away as possible so I went ahead.  

**TL;DR - I was a nerdy half-Asian kid growing up, no connection to Asian side of family.  Difficulty with social interactions in general.  No biological dad to talk to which bothered me frequently to the point of crying.**

**College:**

- I basically took a ton of courses and double-engineering-majored which basically killed social life beyond classmates I did projects with.  During college (and even today, still) I had difficulty with social interactions in general.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do (doctor, optometrist, work in private industry, grad school?) so I basically hunkered down hoping that something good would come.  I was also concerned about not getting a job out of college in this economy, so I tried my best in school.  (Have a good job now, at least.)

- Sometimes I would still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about not knowing my biological father.  Spoke with several counselors in college trying to get over issues with father's absence but nothing really helped.  Still had difficulties with friendships and relationships.

- 3rd year of college, Christmas break, this girl Facebook PM's me out of the blue claiming to be the daughter of my father's best friend (lets call him Bob).  **Verified legit.**  Turns out in the last 21 years my biological father has amounted to basically nothing.  His father kept bugging him to find me, he ignored.  Tried to forget about his first son completely with a third marriage.  3rd wife conned the entire family out of nearly all of their savings.  Works as a cab driver now, and wastes whatever he does manage to save gambling in commodities markets (like stocks, basically).  I worked at an internship the following summer so *I* could pay for a plane ticket to see him the *next* Christmas break.  

- I've seen my dad twice now in China, and once when he visited for my college graduation in the US.  Roughly a total of a 3-4 month period.  He says he's proud of me, but it seems superficial.  He and Bob want me to put my financial ass on the line and sponsor him to obtain a work visa so he can work all the way across the country, in CA (I'm in northern US).  My dad has basically spent the last 2+ decades turing to waste what was once a pretty damn good living situation.  He's irresponsible, is a stimpleton that I really can't relate to, has poor manners, **essentially abandoned me**, and now wants me to lift him out of his shitty situation that he is 100% responsible for.  

**TL;DR I busted my ass from before I walked into grade school until I stepped out of college with a diploma so that I would have a better life than I grew up with.  BioDad basically erased me from his memory, turned his life into a shit hole, appears out of thin air, and now wants a successful son he's suddenly discovered to put his ass on the line for him**

**So, questions:**

1.  What can I do to get my self past having ""father"" issues, and this feeling that I don't belong... that I'm a foreigner in my own country?  I've tried just ignoring it when growing up, but it seems to come back repeatedly, contaminating my confidence in work, social interactions, relationships, and sense of self-worth.  Should I just try to man up, ignore that this ever happened, and get over it? (Hasn't worked for the last 2 decades.)  Or, is there something else I can do?
2.  Should I try extending a hand this stranger, or tell him to F-off and solve his own problems that he brought upon himself?

Thanks you guys!  End of rant.  I won't likely get around to checking back on this post until Sunday evening after work."
zl8mh,3,2012-09-09,Playing out all the mistakes. Slightly self destructive life story of how I got to where I am.,Anonimityforcourange,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zl8mh/playing_out_all_the_mistakes_slightly_self/,"TL;DR at the bottom

Well I don't want to bother people to much but am just getting this off of my chest and looking for some kind of shared connection since I will never talk to people I know about this.

I over think things a lot and have just ended my longest relationship to date (2 years)

I know it is not long at all but I seem to be really bad at keeping girls around. I will give a quick background on everything and what situation I am in now.

I am a 23yo male and only started having relationships since I was 18.

 I had slept with a girl right after grad(first time and while I was a bit large). It went bad since I had no idea what to do and it just turned into a one night stand essentially. Three months later her friend told me she was pregnant and I began freaking out. This led on for another few months before I found out it was a joke (ha...ha...ha.......) So this made me take a step back from women for a while and focus on myself and losing weight. I lost a lot of weight quickly and gained a lot of self confidence that I lacked before. About 6 months later I met an older girl (22) then me (18) and she pursued me. I had no idea what was going on really and just ran with it. It was nice and a learned a lot about sex but nothing really matured me emotionally regarding relationships.

During this time I had met a girl at my summer job and couldn't believe how much I liked her. I ended it with the 22yo girl I was seeing for a few months and told her that I liked this other girl. I really pursued this girl from work who was 2 years younger then me and still in highschool (going Gr12) I felt something intense for her and never wanted anything so badly. I scared her off in the beggining and after 5 months of back and forth I finally asked her out and she said yes.

This was the most emotionally intense relationship I have ever had. Looking back I don't think it was real, and more of a build up of wanting her so bad and finally getting her after so much work and obsession. She was the first girl I ""loved""(Not sure anymore) and it only lasted 4 months. These were not great months and I was always getting hurt and struggling to keep her. She ended up breaking it off before grad due to many reasons, but the main one being her growing feelings for her friend. She ended it and ended up with this other guy who she is still with (but not happy)

This destroyed me. I did some really bad things for a few weeks. Contemplated suicide, listened to sad music all the time, cried a LOT, played it out in my head, harassed friends by asking about it all the time and complaining about it, etc. I started my summer job up again with her there again which made us argue a lot when working together, and make me even worse seeing her all the time.

Only a few weeks into the summer job I met a gorgeous and very happy girl who worked on contract at the facility. Being lonely and sad, I went for a rebound. I was in no emotional state to get connected again, so it just turned into sex and hanging out all the time. By the end of the summer I grew feelings for her, but she was moving across the country for school. I never told her I really liked her and even felt love developing.

I was lonely again once this new girl left for school and tried to stay in contact but it didn't seem she was very interested in me as anything more then we were.

I cycled through a few more girls over the next year and just never grew attached. I kept distance from them and made sure not to get attached. looking back I can see I sabotaged many of the relationships once I felt them getting attached.

Now when I turned 21 I was back at the same summer job but as a supervisor. I met another girl and kept my distance due to me being her boss. At the end of the summer we dated and it was going well. In the beginning I knew I was just dating her cause I knew she was interested and I just went with it. Once again I distanced and ended it once I saw her get attached. We were apart for around a month then I became lonely and got back together with her.

I only had my memory of my short intense relationship being what ""love"" is for me. So I didn't say it for a long time. I said it too soon and because the relationship was going down hill. The relationship got better but there were always bumps. Now we dated for just over two years and it just recently ended. I ended up running the summer job as the head boss for the last two years and it put a huge stress on the relationship during the months I was her boss. 

The relationship has gotten to the point where we were always fighting and just generally unhappy with each other. I began thinking of other women and wishing that she could just be like them. Things began getting awkward for me around her. For someone I loved I had no idea how to behave around her and began to doubt all my actions and interactions I had with her. She just ended the relationship and I felt nothing for the first 3-4 days. I was more happy it was over, because I can relax and not have to feel so stressed.

Now I am feeling really down and thinking about how great she was. I have matured a lot since I was 18 and realize that even though I miss her now, we won't work together. It is sad because I just can't see it working and I know I can't be what she needs, and she will be happier with someone else.

Right now I am feeling less need for the recent relationship to be back, and I am finding myself going over old footage and pictures of the happy gorgeous girl I met after my first bad break.

She is amazing and I never got a chance to tell her I liked her so much. But once again I don't know if it would work even if she lived here (she is living across the country doing an internship after her grad from university)

I really just want to have someone where it will work, and who I can trust without destroying the relationship before it even starts. I seem to have a lot of trust issues. I over think almost all of my interactions with people and have a hard time being real with someone, in fear of the outcome of what I share, and having them think differently towards me. I have a hard time dealing with rejection and even an acquaintance relationship is worth holding then letting someone I know my feelings and being rejected.

I just don't know what to do right now. I am going to focus on hobbies and getting back into shape now that I am single but as far as getting back out there I don't know if I can for a while.

If you read the entire thing, then sorry it was so long haha. I just wanted to share where I am. I am not looking for answers and suggestions but do appreciate them and want to read others input. I wish I had someone I could be honest with like this but I just feel I am a burden to them and no one wants to deal with it more then one day.

TL;DR
Just dated when I was 18. Lost virginity to a one night stand. She faked pregnancy, so I avoided girls for a bit. Dated an older woman and learned lots of sex but not emotional. met a girl at work who I was very attracted to. pursued her and ending up dating for 4 months really intensely. she fucked me up after the break. Almost right after the break met a gorgeous girl who I started to grow feelings for at the end of the summer. She moved for school. I cycled through a bunch of women over the next year. Met my last girlfriend and dated for two years. Didnt work and know it wont work between us. Have second thoughts on never telling the gorgeous girl how I felt and find myself caring more about that relationship now. Dont know what to do, or feel. I am really bad at relationships.

Thanks for reading, will come back for replies. Feel free to ask questions as well.

zl4uv,1,2012-09-08,"Isolated, alone and feeling pretty down... all for a job",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zl4uv/isolated_alone_and_feeling_pretty_down_all_for_a/,"From February to June, I was desperately trying to find a student internship. As a civil engineering student from UoT, I realized had no almost job experience let alone one relevant to my degree. So to my luck I got an offer before my senior year. Problem is, it's for a small civil firm in the middle of nowhere in Saskatchewan with low pay and mostly office work.


Because of the necessity to actually have something on my resume before graduating, I immediately accepted the offer. The people at the office are great people, but I'm becoming extremely depressed. I had to break up with my boyfriend as he was going back to school and I was moving a province away (we both can't do long distance). Not only that but he's planning to move to the States for grad so I wouldn't even see him for another couple of years.


I'm so used to sleeping with him beside me that now I sleep on one side and can never sleep well anymore. I keep waking up, expecting him to be beside me but, no, just me by myself. I really miss him but when we saw each other for the last time (he had to go home for a month and that was when we semi-officially ended it), we were like strangers and he was acting so distant that I ended up trying to block him out of my life/avoid him completely (even though we had mutual friends and get-togethers before I left) as I was always on the verge of crying whenever I saw him acting like we never had anything.


I'm away from all my friends who are graduating this year and I'm in the middle of nowhere (there isn't even an ATM without 40 minutes of walking). I can't talk to any of my friends because they're all partying it up right now before classes start and then they'll be shut-ins working on final year projects. If I do manage to survive the year, I'm going to go back to my uni with no friends there, hardly any money to show for it and an enormous sense of loneliness.


This emptiness I'm feeling is starting to kill me inside I've only been working for 2 weeks but I'm terrified it's going to start making me a horrible employee, which would entirely defeat the purpose.


I feel so pathetic and sad."

I did an internship in the city last summer and want to move back in a few years and would love for her to enjoy the city as much as I do. Help me sell her on the city, AskNYC.

We're both working entry-level jobs but we'll be splitting the cost of the vacation. We're talking about doing a long weekend away (we live in Ohio) some time this fall, but I'm finding airfare and hotels to be fairly (and expectedly) expensive. 

Any hotel recommendations? I've looked into Sohotel, the Gershwin Hotel and quite a few others that I've stayed in before. I considered a hostel, but the idea of a romantic weekend with 5 other people in our room isn't attractive. 
Romantic, good, inexpensive things to do?

I have a few ideas, ranging from the High Line to going up into the ESB, depending on how cold it is by the time we go. I've never taken a girl out in NYC though so I don't know the good romantic spots, but I do know the city well enough to get around.

I'm trying to do this for around $600/person including airfare, hotel, food and entertainment. Hard to do, I know, but I'm pretty good at being frugal.

I figure (per person):
$150 airfare
$200 for hotel room
$40 for trains/taxis
$100 for food
$110 for entertainment/sight-seeing

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

I like the company, I like the people, etc. I get paid the standard internship rate per hour and yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question:

To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?

**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?**

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company.

zohrm,8,2012-09-10,"21[M] went on two great dates with 21[F], then a series of increasingly shitty ones. ",throwaway215T,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zohrm/21m_went_on_two_great_dates_with_21f_then_a/,"Hey r/relationships, I know you give good advice and I could use some myself. I was dating a girl for a couple months, and it just fell apart. I need some help looking for answers.

I'm a 21 year old man in college, and I have no experience with women. This past spring, I met a girl in one of my classes and hit it off immediately with her. After a couple months, I asked her to hang out and smoke with me(I'm a big pot smoker) and she said sure. I texted her asking to smoke for several weekends in a row, and each time she would say she was busy, but she'd always make a rain date and she would act genuinely disappointed. 

Then one weekend, before we got a chance to smoke together, she asked me to be her date to her formal(she's in a sorority) which was a week before the semester ended. I went and we had a good time. I got pretty shitfaced(which I didn't intend to) but it wasn't like she was babysitting me or anything. We kept touching and flirting all night, and went to an afterparty together. We went back to her place, but she was falling asleep on the couch and I was hammered, so I decided to not push my luck and left for the night, especially since she kept telling me all night she wasn't a 'typical sorority slut'. I only got a hug on the way out. 

We went out once more before classes ended for the summer, the smoking date I asked her on a month ago, which went well. She completely did herself up for the date too, she had her hair done and everything. I tried apologizing for getting too drunk at her formal, but she wouldn't hear of it, so I know that wasn't the problem. She ended up inviting herself back to my place to meet my roommates, but had other plans later that night and left after like an hour(She told me that she had those plans when I picked her up earlier that night). The entire time she was at my place, I was sitting on my bed but she sat right down at my desk and didn't move. 

Then classes ended and she went home for two months. I kept up with her through texts and everything. When she got back she was starting an internship, taking online classes and going to the beach every weekend, so she was super busy. I only went out with her every couple weeks throughout the summer though. Something changed from the time classes got out to the summer starting. First, she bailed on the first date I asked her on when she got back(but I think it was cuz I picked a shitty movie). All our dates felt like first dates though, it never really went anywhere. We went out about 5 or 6 more times. I even told her that I really liked her, but couldn't tell if she was trying to nicely tell me she wasn't interested or if she was legitimately busy. Not that I thought she was lying about being busy, I wanted to make sure I wasn't bothering a girl who wasn't into me. She didn't directly tell me she liked me, but said she actually was always busy, and had never had so much to do in her life. Also, I should mention that I borrowed a textbook from her over the summer.

I always wanted to ask her back to my place after one of our dates, but she'd always throw up a roadblock at the last minute, like how she had some massive form to fill out for her boss that night, or that she had more homework or something. She'd also always find a way to avoid me walking her to her door, so I never got a chance to try and kiss her at the end of a date. Once, I took her out for dinner and then drove back to her place. She had my door open when my car was still moving and practically jumped out of my car. I figured Fuck it, she doesn't want to be with me, and I stopped talking to her.

She kept texting me and stuff though. One night she texts me asking if I wanted to hang out, and telling me she wanted to smoke too(I don't think she had in months b/c of work). When I got there, she told me that her roommates weren't there, so I had a good idea of what was going down. The entire time though, I sat in the middle of her couch, and she sat sideways on one side, resting her back on the armrest and facing me, but she kept her legs between us the entire time. I even got up to get water just so I could sit back down with my arm out to put it around her, and she sat as far away from my arm as she possibly could. We made small talk for like an hour after that, then I left.

After that, I'd texted her to hang out once or twice, and she wouldn't text me back, or text me a one word response. I think once I asked to hang out, and she didn't text me back, so I texted her again saying 'I guess not hahaha'. Pretty sure that was a mistake. A couple days later, I asked her if something was wrong and she said that we needed to talk, I was being crazy and creeping her out, and that it was hard to like me. I offered to meet up with her at a neutral, public place and she declined. She said she didn't have time for a relationship, and needed space. This was at the end of the summer, and at the time I was angry because I felt like she led me on all summer and dumped me right at the end. I assumed she was really busy and stressed out all summer, and didn't want to start a relationship at that time, but I had it in the back of my head that classes would start again in the fall and she'd have time for me. 

Last week, she asked me for that textbook back, which was strange because it was a useless textbook for a class she already passed and didn't need. I thought she would have let the book go to avoid seeing me again. I tried not to make conversation when I dropped the book off, trying to give her the space she said she wanted, and left without saying much past 'thanks for letting me use the book'. I realized though that I wasn't over her and still wanted to be with her. 
I texted her today, first asking if it was alright for me to ask her something and then I asked if she really thought I was a creep and what did I do wrong. She told me she didn't want to have that conversation. 

I really don't know what to make of this whole thing. I'm pretty sure she was in to me at some point at least, but beyond that I'm pretty much lost. I think one of a couple things happened: either it was slowly going bad the whole time but she was into me and let it slide until it was just too many little things going wrong, or I was an idiot and should have been more sexually aggressive and eventually she gave up, or it was going fine and I did something seriously wrong. Or maybe it wasn't my fault at all, but I doubt it. I could tell that the last few dates weren't going well, but I didn't know what to do to fix it because I didn't know what was going wrong. Where did I go wrong with this? I'd like to avoid making the same mistakes I did with this girl.

tl;dr I dated a girl for a couple months, she broke it off without much warning or indication. What did I do?"

I managed to nab an interview at an internship as a software tester in Leeds, and I have been preparing for a practical programming test which will apparently be in C# and winforms.

I've mostly been reading old notes and Head First C# which goes into a surprising amount of detail into forms, so I am feeling pretty prepared. I was just wondering what I should expect as I really want to blow them away. Perhaps anything I can avoid?

I'm ready to be done with school and move on with the next part of my life. I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

 -Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that. 

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'.

 If you're still reading this, thanks. And if you want to know anymore I'd love to hear from you."

I wouldn't call it awesome, because she's pretty moody and very very immature.

She has this very strange habit of getting really close to guys. Even when she's dating people. She did it with her previous ex as well. No, she doesn't make out/get physical with them, but she gets EXTREMELY emotionally attached. It gets to the point where most of her conversations revolve around The Guy, and they're constantly texting. Her life starts to revolve around that person, and she starts ignoring her boyfriend.

This happened three times with her ex before me (in a span of 2 years) and then it happened thrice with me (in 7 months). Every single time, after being told what she's doing, she has broken down severely, regretted about it and been confused about WHY she can never understand when she crosses lines. Her ex was VERY cooperative in trying to make her understand, and I was even more understanding... but she's understood NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. Her behavior is EXACTLY the same, still.

She was in a different city for an internship for 2 months. In those 2 months, she got really close to a guy [24m], made out with him once, and then completely dropped him. She told me about it and I guess it happened because she craved something physical, and then she dropped him because of the intense guilt. This is the only time she got physical with someone not her boyfriend. I'm sure of that.

A few weeks later, she got really close to another guy [27m] at her workplace. Here's the serious bit -- this guy is married (been married for a year only). He has a very troubled marriage, his wife seems to not give any shits about him, apparently doesn't come home a lot of nights etc. Again, my gf got REALLY close to him. It doesn't take much to guess that the troubled married guy got an outlet for everything. They text all day, video chat on Skype countless number of times. I happened to read an email she sent to him, and it made it very clear that they were having an affair.

More than being shattered, I was and am shit scared out of my wits. OK, she cheated on me twice. OK, we're done. But I know her inside out. She's a kid. She's immature, she's under-confident, she's very very unsure of what she's doing, and has no idea where her life is going. I can decide to forget her, which will take very little effort, but I can't bring myself to do it. Anything could happen with the married guy. If word gets out, if Guy goes for divorce, the affair could spill out and it would destroy her. She comes from a normal family and it would end up destroying her family as well. Already, people around her suspect something strange is going on. And considering how ""soft"" her personality is, I wouldn't count out self-physical-harm either. She has no ""best friends"" that she can take advice/help from. Really, she's broken in every manner possible.

Note: I am the only one who knows the full story. No other friend or family member does. I haven't shared this with anyone either.

Reddit, I don't know what to do. I really don't. If there's anything that will make her understand or realise what she's doing, I'd be willing to try it. I don't care if she hates me for her entire life, but I'll be happier with her hating me and having an OKAY life, than having NO life at all.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend has crazy habit of getting emotionally attached to random guys, is now having an secret affair with a guy who is in a troubled marriage. She's an ex, but I want to, if possible, drill sense in her head and not see her destroy her and her family's life.**"

so here's a deal , i graduated from UoA a few months ago, degree in CompSci.

Been applying for jobs ever since. Got 1-2 interviews,  ..one being recently , still waiting for news , but it's been a week so i'm guessing that's off the table.  (they had me sit a test, 3 questions on web services and array/loops ..i got 2/3 correct)


I'm interested in web dev /programming ( C# , .NET , JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, HTML/CSS , ASP.NET , Web Services).
Right now i'm also doing some self learning, but it's hard to find good material with clear precise instructions online on stuff like ASP.NET...and MVC.

Books in library are even more outdated.

So 2012 for me will most likely be a bust year, but there's still 3 months left of it ....and i don't wanna waste it too much .

I've been discussing with my parents and they suggested getting a certification.

But i've looked around geekzone, and people are saying getting certs like MCTS  or MCICTP  etc etc doesn't help if you're just getting ""your foot in the door"" and that it's more suitable for people who's already working in IT and their employers want them to get a certificate.

Can you guys experienced (and seasoned dare i say) IT people give me advice ?

As far as NCEA LV3 (graduated high school)  and a Bachelor of CompSci from UoA.....i have Zero work experience ...i never had a part time job in high school or uni (subway etc etc) ........and i don't even have a referee. I feel like hs dip and Bach degree is nothing without those exp.

Should i get a random ""flippin burgers"" PT jobs to help my CV ?   i doubt it tho ...i dunno, confused right now.

Last night i went to the AMES IT website , and looked at their certs,
The only one i'm kinda interested in is  "" MCTS - ASP.NET &amp; Web application  (microsoft certified tech specialist)   ...it's 12 weeks , ends in december-ish , cost  ...$5300 ..( Ughhh)    , teaches asp.net, javascript ...and gets you the certification test.

what i wanna ask is , is it useful ? is ames any good or as **** as people "" say""  ? .....   Microsoft's USA site says "" MCTS has ended development, but those with the certificates are still recognized ""  ......i don't wanna be getting a cerfiticate from a program that has been discontinued ....why are ames stil offering it ?
The test itself is like a written-exam right ?  i did that alot in UNI,  very little practical stuff .....employers prefer practical exp vs written knowledge right.

I don't even know how to get a java certification in NZ ...who offers it.

I know some people just learn on their own from various sources and just book a test at that ""pro.somethingsomething"" test center in Auckland .... $100 or something as opposed to 5K .......but i can't find a thorough step by step tutorial on ASP.NET , MVC, javascript online that's decently good.
And no way of knowing what's in the test..........


I""m more than willing to work for free for 2 weeks or as part of an internship on any company in Auck if need be.  at this point, the experience is more important than $$ ....i'm not focused on that at all right now.

so,  ...help a brother out ?"

what i wanna ask is , is it useful ? is ames any good or as **** as people "" say""  ? .....   Microsoft's USA site says "" MCTS has ended development, but those with the certificates are still recognized ""  ......i don't wanna be getting a cerfiticate from a program that has been discontinued ....why are ames stil offering it ?
The test itself is like a written-exam right ?  i did that alot in UNI,  very little practical stuff .....employers prefer practical exp vs written knowledge right.

I don't even know how to get a java certification in NZ ...who offers it.

I know some people just learn on their own from various sources and just book a test at that ""pro.somethingsomething"" test center in Auckland .... $100 or something as opposed to 5K .......but i can't find a thorough step by step tutorial on ASP.NET , MVC, javascript online that's decently good.
And no way of knowing what's in the test..........


I""m more than willing to work for free for 2 weeks or as part of an internship on any company in Auck if need be.  at this point, the experience is more important than $$ ....i'm not focused on that at all right now.

so,  ...help a brother out ?"
zn5cb,3,2012-09-10,Has anything like this happened anywhere else?,xistag,Staples,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staples/comments/zn5cb/has_anything_like_this_happened_anywhere_else/,"Well, I've been snooping around this subreddit quite a bit tonight but I figured I might as well add this to the stack.

I am a CP Associate that started at my store in May of this year. I told them up front that I have an internship I would be leaving for five weeks after my hire date but that once I was back I would plan on being there for a while. (the internship was 8 weeks). Even with this, they hired me on and put me in front of a computer for training the next week.But once the computer training was over, I pretty much got slaped behind the counter and told good luck.
I was so confused. The computer modules only cover so much of the job. As far as customer service, I am used to it. I've worked in customer service related positions for about 5 years now, not to mention Disney for nine of those. Naturally I had questions most of the day, but any time I had a question I was ridiculed for how I dealt with the customer or how unprofessional I was. I didn't know how to take this because it's not like I don't know how to be professional. I am simply not trained as much as I would like to be. So I started asking co-workers instead of managers. That only made matters worse. It turns out the way they have been doing things is /also/ the wrong way to do it, only leading to more riddicule and when I tried to say that it was how someone else was doing it, they did not believe me. So all in all I felt stuck.

About a week before I left for my internship, I had a day this is difficult to shake from memory. The events leading up to this are hazy, but I was completing an order of 50 full sheet letter size laminations when my manager came up and said they wanted to have a discussion with me. At this point I knew they were going to tell me yet again how I've done something wrong, but it was different. They were now telling me that they don't think I am a very good fit for Staples and that I should consider whether or not I want to continue working here. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and it grit a deep hole inside of me that day. 
A bit of background info would be that my major is related to what is done inside the department. I took the job (and the pay cut hopping over to this job) in order to better myself and gain experience with the terminology involved. The equipment and the functions involved are second nature to me, but I feel that my manager has become the source of a lot of judgementalism and any time they are around me now I tense up and get nervous, because it is in that moment that everything I am doing is wrong. Sometimes as far as undoing anything I had learned in college relating to print.

Well regardless of that day, I worked there a couple more days and then went to my internship. I came back to find my nametag had been taken off of my apron. I inquired about it and the managers there had no clue about it but gave me what seemed like a ready made nametag, but this was different. This one no longer said ""Copy Print Associate"" it now read ""Sales Associate"". To make a long story short, since that time (about a month now), i have been doing small jobs around the store, not even allowed to go anywhere near copy and print. Anytime I try to help minimize a line or even print a job I am told to go back to what I was doing. I feel like I'm being corralled like a retard and this has made my job that much more of a hell for me. I can't tell you guys how much I feel out of my element now. 

So I must ask, if there are any tips you guys might have for my situation or anything. I've been asking my GM for an explanation but all he is telling me are unspecific remarks about ""cross-training"". But they sound more like dodgey answers than anything real. I've gone as far as asking if I will be back in copy and print anytime soon. I have yet to get a yes or a no. :/"

""Potential Girlfriend"" problem.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zmu3y/i_need_advice_from_you_potential_girlfriend/,"So the story is that i [M/22] met a girl  [F/22] this summer whom i've known for a while we went on 2 dates and it went amazingly good like we hit off directly and we have so much in common it is driving me crazy!

Now the problem is that this girl happens to live about 400 miles away form me and she is probably going away maybe even further for an internship for the next 6 months... 

When she got back to school after we had our dates and such we continued to chat and it was all happy and dandy untill she started school again and we started talking a little bit less everyday and she got more and more work on her shoulders although we still chat almost everyday.

but the last weeks has been hell for me emotionally because i may have fallen completley in love with this girl and i think she knows and she has been a little off and i really wanted to know how she felt about me since i felt so stupid writing to her all the time with me being the one to always write her and not vice-versa made me feel desperate and unsecure... So anyway we have a good friend in common and i asked him to talk with her to kinda get a grip of how she felt about me ( i didnt ask myself because i did not want to put any emotional pressure on her, since she is already fed up with the workload and is stressed out) he then told me she had said ""i really like him but maybe not in the same way right now ( basically he is awesome and i like him but for now i just want to be friends with him"") and that made me really sad and confused... ""right now""? what does that mean? i understand the circumstances for a possible relationship is horrible but if the feelings are there form both parties its still possible..

So what i got out from that was that she likes me and there may be potential between us but under these circumstances with the long distance and her internship and workload she dosnt really have time for a relationship!?  

My questions are: Should i just chat with her and ""stay friends"" or should i just give it up and try to forget about her for the moment being?

If i stay friends with her i fear that she would just start seeing me as a friend and the romance we had would never come to be again (friend-zoned?) or if i stop talking to her and try to be more passive maybe to the spring when she gets back home ( where i live ) i could ask her out again? (and start ""fresh"")?

What would you do reddit? How would you handle this situation? What is the best way i can handle this to still be able to have a chance of her being something more than a friend? Or is it all hopeless.. "

Ever since I was a little tyke, my mom would read to me every single day. I remember being two or three years old and reading the book along with my mom in my mind. When I got to first grade, I never struggled with reading. It was just like reading the Cat in the Hat or Green Eggs and Ham with mom, except with different wording. In first grade, I was placed in the back of the room because the other students would get discouraged whenever I raised my hand, because I was right almost every time. 

Being the youngest child, I suffered from the traditional ""look at me"" syndrome. As a result, I really liked being the smartest kid in class. It brought me attention that was looked fondly upon in society, and it brought me a sense of superiority over other students, even if I only ever recognized that concept in my mind while playing with my friends during recess or interacting in class.

As we progressed in elementary school, I remember one day where I realized that being able to read better than everyone else was a skill I no longer had, as everyone was essentially on the same page (ha, pun). I then proceeded through middle school without ever getting any grade lower then a B, because that was my only way to maintain my edge that I had cherished so much as a 1st grader. 

High school progressed, and I basically ran the table. Valedictorian, Homecoming King, Class President, full academic scholarship to college, and above average in the sports I played in. 

The driving force behind so much of that was still maintaining that edge. I made the connection between money and power. In 1st grade, reading Harry Potter may have put me ahead of everyone else, but as adults, having a six or seven figure salary was the trick. 

If you look at the definition of psychopath, it includes having shallow emotions, superficial charm, impulsiveness, and a need for stimulation. I certainly feel for others I'd like to think, but I would be flat-out lying if I solely judge myself when talking to others to see if I can am dominant or not. 

I workout several days a week, and although I am not physically imposing (5' 9''), I still have a very muscular build and am in very good shape, as it is important to me that people can see me and respect me at first glance for being ripped or in great shape. 

In college, I currently have an internship at a large firm and am majoring in Accounting and Management. I chose these majors because although science may provide a steady stream of high-paying jobs, the opportunity in the financial world to get mega-rich was very alluring to me. 

I sometimes wonder if too much of my life has been centered around wealth and power (wealth in itself is a symbol of power). Has this internal motivation of mine provided me with great amounts of opportunity and success? I'd think yes. But at what cost? I know that I am hopelessly screwed if I fail, because I will have failed at basically everything I have ever worked for in my life. 

And for what it's worth, movies like Ocean's 11, Dark Knight, and Dark Knight Rises intrigue me to no end because the villains or freakin' Danny Ocean have such thorough plans executed that put the balls of their opponent right in the clenched fist. And I wonder to myself if I could ever pull off such a feat? So many criminals in today's world are seemingly foolish. I am curious to know if I could ever break the system and get away with it, like a Ponzi Scheme that never gets ousted. 

Am I alone? Have any of you corrupted your thoughts or motivations like I do? So many of my friends don't have that natural killer instinct that I do when it comes to striving for success. I know I can't be the only one. 



tl;dr Everything in my life has been driven by power and money, and Bane and the Joker are my idols. "

I'm ready to be done with school and move on with the next part of my life. I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. 

Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

-Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that.

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'. 

If you're still reading this, thanks. And if you want to know anymore I'd love to hear from you.

I majored in Econ and Political Science and graduated Cum Laude with a 3.5 GPA. I've taken some challenging econ courses (econometrics, forecasting) but I feel like a BA hasn't gotten me anywhere. I come from a low to middle class background. When I first started college, my first two years consisted of going to the gym and going to parties. I never got involved in any clubs, volunteering, or internships. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I did a study abroad in Africa studying history. The summer after my junior year, I volunteered tutoring poor, uneducated people who were trying to get their GED and as a counselor for urban youth in the inner city. During my last year, I was a development intern at a non profit for two days a week for an entire year. Although I met some cool people, I feel like I didn't really do much with this stuff and didn't learn any important skills. 

Now I'm stuck at home with my parents and I can't find a full-time salaried job. 
I want to work in Research/Public Policy but I can't get any of those kinds of jobs. After months of searching, mostly on idealist, I landed two research related internships in Washington D.C. They were both really awesome, but were unpaid and I couldn't afford to spend anymore money. 

I hate when people ask me what I'm doing all the time, especially my extended family. I feel like I've fucked up because most of my friends and cousins are already making bank. I don't want to work in corporate because its not me and I don't have the experience. I also can't afford to go back to school. I didn't go to an ivy league school and my resume is not that exciting. People have told me to join the peace corps or the marines but I want to stay and help my parents with the mortgage and car loans.

Can I find a job with the skills I have? What can I do? Will I ever get an actual salary doing something I really enjoy? I've tried networking, finding unpaid stuff near me, and learning more skills online, but it all seems pointless. I can't focus, i'm not motivated, and I wish I was in grade school again. I'm frustrated and sometimes depressed. Is there any hope? HELP!

SKILL SET / WORK XP
English is my native tongue.
I am fluent in Mandarin Chinese. 
I spent the past 13 months in Beijing. During this time I worked as a BD and marketing specialist for a software start-up and also did a short internship at a prominent social networking firm. I left the marketing job b/c I had to return home to finish my degree and research project. 
During my junior year I interned for 6 months at a branch of a Wall Street bank. 
I spent a long time as a Boy Scouts volunteer after I earned Eagle Scout.

I am considering moving back to Beijing after I graduate. On the other hand, I am also considering moving to Australia b/c one of my long term goals in life is to move to a country aside from the US that better fits the lifestyle I want. I visited Australia once as a child. I have a cousin who lived in Sydney for 11 years when his company posted him there. Unfortunately, he moved back to the US 8 years ago, so I am not sure how things might have changed regarding visas and job prospects.

TL;DR: Soon to be college grad with minimal work experience is interested in what sort of job opportunities I could find in Australia involving BD, marketing/finance.

zmjxh,1,2012-09-09,"I (M22) have a FWB (F24) who I want more with but am trying to be respectful of what she wants from this, yet I am pretty sure she feels the same way, where do I go from here without loosing her?",throwaway_585,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zmjxh/i_m22_have_a_fwb_f24_who_i_want_more_with_but_am/,"I have known this girl for most of my life. We share a genetic condition so we see each other every two years at the national convention for this specific condition. This year I find out that she thinks I am very cute and I start to look at her less as a friend I see every once in a while at these things, and instead as a possible fuck buddy. We bang at the con and it was a fantastic time, and then spend the next month trading texts and phone calls. At the time I knew it was infatuation, and I was also just getting out of a relationship so I was really just looking for someone to have fun with not a serious relationship. A few weeks after the convention I spend the weekend at her place and after starting to actually get to know her I realize that this girl is a great fit for what I am looking for in a relationship, and start developing feelings for her. We continue to talk and text and it seems that she is developing similar feelings for me. Fast forward a bit and she is starting grad school, we both knew that realistically because of the distance between us and the amount of time she was going to need to spend focused on school a relationship wouldn't be a good idea because one of us would start to feel neglected or feel like they were neglecting the other person and it would go down hill and as we both want a relationship between us to actually work long term we weren't willing to try distance and fail. So we continue being FWB and things are good right? 

Well the last visit was a strange one. The last couple times I have been to visit her, we are very couple-y and almost acting as if we are dating, yet this time she would swing from acting like that to 5 minutes later being very firm about the fact that she can't date me right now, and that she isn't perfect for me, and I should go out and try to date other people to make sure that I find exactly what I want, and not just her because this is easy and fun. Every time I reassured her that I understand the boundaries and expectations of the relationship, and that yes I would love to eventually get together with her because even though she isn't perfect (but honestly who is) she is a much better match than any other girl I have been with, and with us both having the same genetic condition we both completely understand a big part of eachother's life that no one on the ""outside"" will ever be able to fully understand. It just feels like when I am not there it is easy to put me and her feeling for me aside, but then the moment I show up it all comes rushing back and she is almost trying to talk herself out of liking me because she doesn't want to get hurt / hurt me. And to complicate things even more, I have managed to fall completely head over heels in love with this girl (though I haven't told her that much yet). 

It is just hard because I am trying to be easy and put no pressure on her, yet at the same time maintain some presence (for instance every morning when I wake up I text her good morning beautiful because I know that if I can make her smile first thing in the morning the stress of the day will be just bit less) but trying to be careful because I don't want to smother her and then get pushed away completely. In the long run I can deal with her not loving me back, I can deal with us giving a relationship a shot and it not working out, but I just don't want to lose her in my life. In one month I managed to get into 2 serious accidents (neither were my fault, but that is another story), and breakup with someone I had been dating for 4 years, not to mention a few other personal issues and she was there through all of it being the one thing I could completely count on. Seeing texts from her or hearing her ringtone could instantly pull me out of the worst mood and put me into an amazing one. I guess I am just worried that if I continue to be easy and put no pressure on this that there is the possibility that a classmate or fellow intern could swoop in and steal this girl from me, but if I put pressure on it to do distance (even though I would spend basically every weekend at her place because it is a 45 minute plane ride and financially I can afford that) until my lease is up and I can move closer to her I am scared that I could loose her that way too. 

**TL:DR** 
Became FWB with girl I have known for a long time. Between distance and school she doesn't want a relationship but even though she has feeling for me. I fell head over heels in love with her, and am now worried that if I continue to be laid back that I will lose her to someone else, but if I put pressure on it I will lose her because she will push me away completely.

I've decided this is what I want to do in life, but I need a few questions answered.",CookieMan0,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/zqgl0/im_a_senior_in_high_school_ive_decided_this_is/,"Just some background on my experience as a modder and such;

Some Halo PC modding. Mods ranged from simple projectile replacement (ex: make a sniper rifle fire rockets) and eventually some which reworked the combat system (made it melee only or removed shields entirely) and toying with how vehicles worked.

Attempted mapping in Jedi Knight 3. I eventually *did* come close to completion of a small map with functioning lighting and spawns, but no AI routing.

While it's not technically modding, I avidly used the Forge map editing tool for Halo 3/Reach. I have 10+ fully-functioning maps and many more which are unfinished.

I developed a few Flash games last year as part of a larger technology class, focusing mainly on web design. Most of this class was HTML and the like, but Flash was covered. I also learned C++ and Java in unrelated classes earlier in my school career.

I've been cut off from tools for a while now though, as the only computer in the house is my dad's laptop from 2008. I already have a student license for 3DS Max, but nowhere to install it. I plan on making a few trial items for Team Fortress 2, I believe my experience in mapping from JK3 may aid me in familiarizing myself with Max.

Now then, on to the questions. Since I am now a senior in high school, I need to start planning for college. I have heard from a professor at a local university that a Computer Science degree will get me farther than degrees such as game design or game programming. Is this true? Any courses I should strongly consider?

My dream studio job is as an environmental artist (mapping and architecture) at either Valve Software or Bungie (big surprise, given the 3 listed Halo titles). They ask for professional experience in the industry, what's a good way to *start* and get some professional experience?

My school has a game design club. But like most amateurs, probably +80% is composed of idealists who think they're making a AAA-level game as their first project. I've stopped attending because of this mindset, as I believe they're getting almost nowhere with this sort of goal. Should I attend and do what I can? Or should I find something more productive in my free time?

**TL;DR:** Is computer science a strong degree for college if I want to be in the gaming industry? If not, what would you suggest? What colleges offer the best courses in that degree? Where do I begin to get the often-requested ""professional experience""? Is it a good or bad idea to attend my school's game design club, no matter how unrealistic their ideas are? Also unlisted, is an internship at any local studios a good way to get some first-level experience?"

While watching TV the other day I saw an ad for Rob Sobhani, an independent running for senate. I didn't really care much for the senate race, Cardin and Bongino are both run of the mill democrats and republicans, and Cardin is favored to win by a long shot. Cardin has voted with his party around 97% of the time, been in politics for 40 years, and Bongino who's funding is dwarfed by Cardin's was recently endorsed by Sarah Palin. So I started looking into Sobhani and have been pleasantly surprised that he seems to be a really serious candidate with resources and decently thought out plans. I'm disappointed too that there is little coverage of his candidacy from the local mainstream media, though you'd think they would find it would add a bit of excitement to the race. So I did a bit of research myself to get people a bit more excited for their senate race

- His 5 point plan is to marry Maryland to the international market by seeking private funds in the billions for roads and bridges, reconstruction of homes in Baltimore, cancer/alzheimer research, exports, and internships for low-income students. 
- He's big on promises: won't seek more than 2 terms and promises to not run for a 2nd term if he doesn't keep his promises.

His plans raise a lot of questions so I hope that they will release more information soon and that other media will pick up so we can learn more. 

Looking at the pitiful state of Congress, we need to support independent candidates even in states like Maryland. He looks to be moderate, a lot less focused on social issues and much more on economic/business ones. If somehow he can bring in all that money from private funds rather than increasing further our debt, why not ?

Thoughts ? I've included a blog right under which provides a pleasant read.

zqcp3,4,2012-09-11,Friday at lunch I am speaking to a group of high school students about a career in IT.  Any points of wisdom you would like me to share with our future sysadmins?,megabsod,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/zqcp3/friday_at_lunch_i_am_speaking_to_a_group_of_high/,"I've been invited to speak to a group of high school students as part of a mentoring program at a local magnet school.  The organizer has given me a quick rundown of questions to expect (why I chose this field, what educational background I have, how I landed the job I have now, etc.), but what do you wish someone had told you when you started out?

Update: The speech went great!  I ran out of time (I thought they said 30 mins originally but I was told 20 when I arrived and I got cut off by the class bell), but I had a lot of students come up afterwards with questions related to your suggestions of starting a home lab, various appropriate college degrees, where to find internships and side jobs, and whether or not they would be well suited to IT.  The organizers asked if they could send some students over to sit in on some of our staff inservices (we have weekly staff inservices on Fridays), and if they could send some to do job shadowing.  I had a lot of great questions from the kids and you guys gave a lot of great insight that I think helped them to better understand what a career in IT would be like.  Thanks r/sysadmin!"

Recontextualizing our history for whatever purpose – well-intentioned or nay – can be informative, but here it's simply a heinous act. World War Z was fine and fun: that was zombies. The West Wing had Sheen in the White House. Not bad.

It’s an entirely different thing to dig up the past in order to throw dirt on the present.
Why go to lengths to band together to boycott a book, when, as 
Americans, we should value free speech, regardless of the content? 

Chomsky, though “reflexively anti-American” isn’t a threat, nor is Buren or this Danson fellow, right? And even if they were, their message is less hate speech, and more revisionist history and misdirection. Why get fussed? A book is just a book. If people are feeble minded enough to be bent or misguided by ink and paper, then they can be manipulated by anybody or anything…

To ban is to violate the positive liberties of the writer and the would-be audience. To permit violent, regressive ideologies to prevail, on the other hand, is to threaten America with the imposition of foreign restrictions. 

A boycott – the willing and formal avoidance of a particular title seems the best course of action. We have a special role as citizens of a country with a moral conscience. Faultline 49, like the other books on our list, is more than immoral – it’s anti-American. I don’t give a damn if Danson means well. He’s gone about it all wrong.

MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA If you didn’t encounter it, fantastic. If you do, ignore it. IF the filth’s not permeated the border, then forget this old soothsayer’s warnings. Don’t buy Faultline 49.

zpv5s,11,2012-09-11,To those applying for the College Program in Spring: Some tips and advice for the phone interview.,puapsyche,wdwcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wdwcp/comments/zpv5s/to_those_applying_for_the_college_program_in/,"Put together from stuff DIS people and I wrote on college program. I did my CP Spring Advantage 2011 and applied, interviewed for, and am now on a Professional Internship.

**HOW TO MAKE A LIST OF THINGS TO SAY IN THE INTERVIEW**
1. Think of the roles you want to apply for. Doesn't matter what it is, just think of the roles.

2. Identify what makes someone THE BEST at that role. Not just good, the best. What does the picture perfect cast member look like? If you want to be a Fairy Godmother in training, what in your mind is a perfect FGiT?

3. Think of that list of traits and qualities, and then think of how many of those you exemplify or that experience has given you. For example, if you're applying for Concierge and you know Concierge folk have to be friendly and welcoming, and you've gotten lots of experience and were told you were definitely friendly and welcoming, that's a good thing. Write it down.

4. Now you have a list of things YOU'RE good at that match what the PICTURE PERFECT CAST MEMBER is good at. It may not match completely, but that's OK. You now want to remember stories of your experiences- what was one EXCEPTIONAL time that you displayed the traits you know you're good at? If you're having trouble, try thinking back to times you had to deal with difficult Guests/customers, and situations like those where you handled it well. Remember several of these stories, and write them down. The more the better.

5. Practice recalling these stories out loud until they are natural. 

6. You're all set. Now all you have to do is, whenever they ask a question of you, see if you can answer the question by steering the conversation in the direction of your experiences. 

**QUESTIONS SOMEONE WAS ASKED DURING THEIR INTERVIEW**

1. We talked about my past work experience and she asked which job that I’ve had has been my favorite. 

2. The ever important why you want to work for Disney and if I’d ever consider working full time with Disney. This is definitely something you’re going to want to have an answer prepared for as it is always asked. I was also asked if I had a favorite park or attraction. 

3. Would you rather work in groups or independently? 

4. How would you describe your work pace?

5. She of course asked what my top 3 roles were and asked if I would be interested in adding custodial or housekeeping. She made a comment about how I had a good long list of roles at the beginning of the interview. This really made me nervous even though she said there was no right or wrong answer and after I said no, she just said ok and we moved on. It’s quite common for interviewers to ask if you’re willing to add roles such as QSFB or housekeeping to your checklist as these are roles that require a lot of people but not many people want. If you really don’t want to do them, don’t be afraid to say no. I said my top 3 were Attractions, Merchandise, and Character Attendant. 

6. Why do you want to be a character attendant?

7. What have you done in your past jobs where you’ve made a guest feel special?

8. How would I instill Disney magic from beginning to end at the entrances? Or something like that. This was a question directed towards Main Entrance Operations.

9. Do you have any cash handling experience? I mentioned working at a fast food restaurant at the beginning and after asking this she was like, “Oh at Culvers’, right?” 

10. She asked about my experience speaking in front of groups and how it makes me feel. I mentioned most of my experience was from presentations in class so she asked what the longest speech I’ve had to memorize was. 

11. She also asked how I’d feel about doing a job that was repetitive. Then she asked what I’d do if I was interrupted while giving a speech or something."

* Computer Programming / IT (current internship is Android app programming) [github page](http://www.github.com/rdavison)
* Classical Music Performance / Instruction (Bassoon, Flute) [youtube account](http://www.youtube.com/user/richivinsky)
* Speak English (fluently), Spanish (fluently), Mandarin Chinese (not bad) and am willing to teach.
* Web Design and Editing

I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm an American currently living and studying in China, with an internship which pays $15 per day.  My (chinese) girfriend has a very dysfunctional family, and is incapable of supporting her in the least.  She just graduated college in May, and is taking an extra year to continue her studies on her own.

The past two months I've been living as frugally as is possible, while maintaining my internship and supporting her... but in the absolute worst case scenario, last night as we were sleeping, a burgular broke into the very bedroom we were sleeping in and both of our absolute most valuable material things. From her: an ipad, a laptop (with extremely sensitive documents), and an electric dictionary.  The burgular also took my laptop (also quite sensitive documents), my iphone, and all of the money in our wallets combined (about $115). Both of our bank accounts are totally empty right now.  She is absolutely devasted and is even toying with the idea break up, but nothing decided yet.  I'm soooo worried :(

With my current job, I have no chance in the world to make enough money to replace even one of the lost items in any sort of reasonable time, much less eat for the next month and pay rent, so I'm looking for some extra work.  If you need ANYTHING done, make/edit a website, make/edit an app, teach child music, teach child language, translation, or anything else you can think of, please let me know and I'll do my best to do it for some extra cash.  Please, please, please, and thank you!

Ps. I'm in Beijing

She's the love of my life and the person I want to be with forever. We've been through the good and the bad times. We didn't go to the same high school, but that's when we met. When we both went to college, we were only 45 min apart. Recently, we both transferred to colleges back home.

That aside, We talk about marriage and we are both 100% committed (not as ready as counseled couples, but we are not at that step yet.) The only catch is that we're both in college. We're both juniors and go to schools that are about 15 min from each other. My plan is that we would get engaged soon and be married after college.
What would you guys suggest I do to bring in some money? I'm a computer engineering student, manager/owner of a small landscaping company, and intermediate software engineer with several non-paid internships.

Anything online worth trying?

First Text Post, be nice ;) I really appreciate your input


Edit* paying for the wedding isn't the issue, it's just simply coming up with the money to pay for the ring

Recently, in one of the administration meetings I have attended to with my supervisor, I heard a lot of talk about the waiver Obama recently approved for certain states that were considered at risk for not meeting the unrealistic academic standards outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act. There was a lot of talk about the repercussions that would have ensued if the waiver had not been granted, one of them being that the principal would have been replaced despite the fact that he has literally put all of his efforts into obtaining better testing results. It seemed to me that the pressure of reaching the results outweighed the teacher’s concerns of attending to each student and their individual needs. I read the NCLB act this last weekend, and still feel like I don’t fully understand/have all the info....so, I would love to hear thoughts about the pros, cons, or whatever anyone feels may be helpful to me to better understand this policy. Please let me know your position, and what state you are referring to!"

After this I'm planning on making a C compiler, then making a bare bones UNIX OS, then messing with an Arduino board.

My questions are:

1. How is the job outlook for a systems/embedded programmer?  I love doing what I'm doing so far, but I don't want to be trying to get a job in a field that barely exists.

2. Are there any internships specifically for systems/embedded programming?  All I've found so far are software engineering internships.

3. What else should I familiarize myself with?  Aside from being able to program in a high level language, networking, and databases.

4. Most importantly, am I on the right track?

I'm in Computer Science and I'm looking from some life advice from you guys, I strongly need it.

Currently, I have a CEGEP DEC in Management Information Systems (Mostly about building IT systems, Done 2 internships as well). As a result of that, Concordia credited me 4 classes, which are: Object Oriented Programming I and II, System Hardware, and Statistics Math. I'm stuck in a situation where I have to take a bunch of generic I don't really want because I need at least 4 classes to get my loans/grants. I'm sort of getting bored over this, because I'm not going to have anything programming/production related for a whole year because I need to do Math for Computer Science and the ENCS writing class before doing anything.

I'm pondering what I should do about this. I've been thinking of looking into foreign study programs because I'd like to go study in the United States at some point, and maybe move to the American east coast eventually. Now, that's the other problem, I'm currently in the Computer Games option, and looking at the state of the games industry right now sort of scares me, and I'd like to immigrate to the US after a bachelor or a masters, I'm thinking of changing options, but I don't know what to pick or who to ask advice from on the matter.

I do have my own projects, and I'm currently okay with my finances, but I'd like to get involved somewhere where I can further my skills or put my skills to use, I've done the conception of a few IT systems while in cegep, the cegep also hired me for a contract after I finished in June to build an online system for a department in the cegep. I'm wondering if the university itself offers any possibility for students to help with research in the faculty of computer science, or if there's a possibility for me getting a part-time job somewhere, pocket money wouldn't hurt.

Another thing I'm pondering about is what I'm supposed to do to study, I'm not sure how to take notes during a lecture, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to study. I usually go over the material covered in class, do exercises if applicable, and try to understand the material.

Anyone can help me with these issues?"

My current boyfriend is everything I've ever wanted in a guy and more and a senior in engineering at the same school.

He supports me in everything and over the summer I supported him a lot through his summer internship. We've been ""involved"" for six months, seriously dating for four. 
My dreams used to be pretty much solely getting a job at Google and/or a beach house but now those are mixed with marrying him/getting pregnant.. which freaks me out to no end. I'm not ready for these urges :( Especially since he already has a career and I'm just starting out.

I had a surgery consultation for the cyst, the doctor said I'd go home the same day and it'd only take a week to heal. 
I figured I'd rather miss one week of school and just make up my work rather than wait until October when I graduate and miss out financially working full time, and also it was just very painful and embarrassing living day-to-day with it. So I said yes, let's do surgery. I had that performed 8 days ago and since then there has been 0 progress to my recovery. I still cannot sit for more than a minute, I can't drive, and it kills me to lay down / get up. Did some searching online and I found out its not uncommon for this procedure to take up to a month or longer to heal. I absolutely CANNOT afford to miss any more class time else I will fail, but I physically cannot get there nor do my work. CompSci student so everything is on a desktop PC, I don't own a laptop and am posting this from my phone. My school professors / dept. chair hasn't been very helpful. I have no idea what I can do... if I knew recovery would be like this I would have waited until after graduation but the surgeon was not upfront with any information at all, in hindsight.

I graduate in May with my B.B.A in Computer Information Systems. More technical than MIS, but not near as technical CS. 

I have enjoyed programming in my classes and would like to continue to program as my career. I fear I do not have the experience that most graduates will have and that will cause problems with my career outlook. 

Languages:

* VB.NET - Proficient (Used for Desktop/Web/Mobile development in class)
* HTML/CSS - Well
* PHP - Some
* SQL - Well
* BASH - Some

I would like to get into mobile/backend web programming (at least I think I do). What am I missing from what language types I've learned?

I've been ""learning"" Python, but it seems nothing more than the syntax.
_____________________________________________________________________
Resume overview:

Pursuing BBA – Computer Information Systems, May 2013 - 3.2 GPA


VB.Net Programming | WP 7 Programming | SQL Database 

* Summer internship - Fortune 10 company - Worked on scripting project
* ~2yrs of phone technical support
* President of CIS Student Organization, was VP who handled website 
* MTA in Database Design 

Our organization is part of a national organization that puts on regional and national conference. These include contests. I took home 1st in the Application Development and 3rd in Database Design. 

_____________________________________________________________________

Next Question

I have a full time offer from the internship with a great starting salary/benefits. It wouldn't be guaranteed programming, but I could choose to have a technical career there. I'm looking at other opportunities in different cities within my state, so how should I, if possible, use my current offer to my advantage?

How is my resume looking as far as a candidate for software development?


Thanks!

I am interested in web development with Python and Django.

I have good reason to believe that I have the potential to become an excellent developer, but I have little means to prove it at present. I imagine that in an ideal world I would have a GitHub full of completed personal projects to show off, but having Asperger's syndrome makes it hard for me to motivate myself to invent and complete a project in an unstructured environment. The same traits that hinder me when trying to code in my spare time will prove desirable to an employer, such as my desire to work under pressure.

What I would love would be for a London employer to ""adopt"" me by giving me a reasonably structured project to complete for them for free in order to demonstrate my potential, with a look to subsequently being offered an internship (though if that weren't possible I'd still be happy for the boost that the project would provide to my CV).

If any representative of a London employer is reading this (I figure you must be pretty open-minded anyway if you're browsing this part of Reddit), then please consider sending me a PM to talk about this. I am eager to realise my potential with you."

But the past 3 weeks I've been very strict with my diet and have successfully been 100% paleo! And although I'm seeing the benefits such as weight loss, more energy, and less toilet time, I have been experiencing the worst stomach issues. I feel nauseous way more frequently, go through dizzy spells, and such severe stomach cramps that I need to lie down.

I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through this? I really hope it's temporary. I'm getting at least 1200 calories a day, and since beginning my internship that is from 9-5 everyday, my diet is essentially the same each day:

Breakfast = piece of fruit paired with almonds

Lunch = large salad with tomatoes, onions, peppers, cucumbers, and a hard boiled egg

a stir fry containing chicken sausage with peppers and onions

Dinner = piece of fruit paired with baked chicken breast

Any advice or stories of the same issue would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

We were speaking about whats good here and out of everything I mentioned Opie and Anthony. To me it is that important as I have been listening since I was ten. I compiled a list of links so that he can enjoy the show and not get confused with who is who, and to ease his learning the many personalities on the O&amp;A show.

[Anthony Cumia](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Anthony)- One half of the Duo. Hilarious gun advocate and ""Racist""


[Greg ""Opie"" Hughes](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Opie) AKA ""Opie the Destroyer""- The other half of the Duo. Father with another on the way, he is the more radio savvy host. Many hate him for his complaining about the industry. But he serves a pivotal role on the show.



[Jim ""Yimmy"" Norton-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Jimmy) Stand up comic and lovable third wheel. This Tranny loving mush brings many characters to the show such as Chip Chipperson and Paul Hargis the pedophile old man.


[Primetime Sam Roberts-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Primetime_Sam_Roberts) Corporate good guy and cheapskate. He remains one of the few people working at XM that are good at their job. When opie and anthony are gone and dead, this man will rise and wear the XM radio crown. This much he is destined for.


[DJ Troy Quan-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Troy_Quan) You know that guys that is WAY too old to be living the clubbing lifestyle, drinking, partying out and fucking all the ladies, but does it any way? That's Troy Quan in a nutshell.


[Danny Ross-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Danny) My personal favorite guy working with Opie and Anthony. He is a heavy drinker, porn lover, flesh light duel-wielding fella. He is a frequent drinking buddy for Anthony Cumia. He is superior to Sam Roberts when it comes to finding pictures and videos for O&amp;A to talk about, but sadly works more in technical and production. He occasionally comes around.


[Eric ""EROCK"" Nagel](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Erock) AKA Sex Bagel, AKA Hawk, AKA Hogey Boy, AKA Lazy- This self destructive but lovable oaf is a Senior producer for O&amp;A. He is also the ass of every joke under the son as he ""Is a fat lazy mess"" Not much to say, but I pity the man.


[Travis](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Travis) AKA ""Doctor Gay""- Travis is a former intern and now permanent staff member of The Opie and Anthony Show. He often makes homosexual statements in various show promos and is goofed on for being a little too feminine in nature. That was copied from the wiki... as I could not come up with much to say about him myself. He is consistent, and helpful. I'd be sad if he died in a car crash. His wife is also gorgeous... why can't I find one like that.

[Club Soda Kenny](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Club_Soda_Kenny)- Ex-cop and current security for O&amp;A. He is a big man, who is very set in his way of doing things. He wears vomit colored suits and looks like he has a tiny doberman head.

zr03r,5,2012-09-12,"Needing to raise rates, but finding myself in a wonderful situation",[deleted],videography,https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/zr03r/needing_to_raise_rates_but_finding_myself_in_a/,"Allow me to present to you the story of a college videographer who found himself working with people that he could only dream about...

He started out his sophomore year with nothing but a cheap camcorder, limited knowledge, and embarrassingly low rates. As a matter of fact, he only charged $150 for his first few videos! 

Here's the catch: those videos were made for a song-writer and producer who's a major player in the country music business, his wife who just got signed to a major Christian label, and a song-writer for a few famous names that just opened his own publishing company. 

This led him to a point where he landed among some of the greats, and he went on to spend his summer as an ""intern"" at a record label in exchange for the chance to produce videos with some major artists (which he actually listens to on a regular basis). Granted, this wasn't all he earned – he got a full three-hour credit and marvelous resume material as well.

Time went on that summer, and he began charging $500 per video. During this time, he got a chance to work with one of the industry's best stylists and an artist from The Voice. Now he's a junior, and he's set to shoot an artist from Sony next week. He also just got done producing an $8000 music video for a country artist, and even though that is low-budget in the big picture, it's still pretty awesome.

His dilemma:

He discovered that in the grand scheme, $500 per video doesn't cut it. 20% of it goes to his yearly business expenses... 30% of what's left needs to go to taxes... In the end, he would be left with very little per video.

Worst of all, he's not getting a ton of work yet. However, his name is getting out there, and he's already got a few good gigs under his belt. He's at a point where he can hire if the money is available, so just bear in mind that this isn't the typical college scenario where he makes about $50 for shooting a video of his friend's band...  

Most individuals his age only work as PAs with these kinds of artists. In his case, he's producing and directing them at age 20. (Well, he turns 21 in about an hour.) It's a wonderful opportunity, but yes, he's aware that he's being slightly taken advantage of.

However, he's stuck in this situation: he doesn't charge hourly for his editing, his flat rate isn't enough to live on right now, and he knows that artists realistically do not have the budget to spend on sporadic video content like he offers. (After working at a record label, he saw the actual budget for some things.)

He plans on starting an LLC in the next two months, but his future looks bleak since there is not super consistent work right now. That's maybe two to three big projects a month, so that's only $700ish income for a month. If he raises his rates, he may lose the bigger name clients. If he keeps his rates like they are, he will be taking a huge risk. If things go well, he graduates with a harem of even bigger clients under his belt that are willing to pay more. If things go bad, he graduates with a few cool things to his name, semi-consistent work, but a low income.

With that said, I'm tired of referring to myself in the third person. I'd really like to raise my rates, but I don't know if I should while I'm at this stage. What would you do in my situation (age 20, naïve, and apprehensive about everything)?

By the way, I've no longer got the cheap camcorder... Up to a Canon 60D, Canon T4i, and a Panasonic AC130. Woo-hoo.

As a note, I'm aware that I am no-where near where I would like to be as far as talent and technical knowledge goes. I learn from whoever I can however I can. Most of my peers know more than me. I just may have found myself in a decent situation.

A lot of this also stems from the ignorance of how video rates work. Not mine. Mostly clients."

No idea how to approach this, really need input.",dreamsofastronomy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ztzz3/heading_into_long_distance_again_with_many/,"Hey everyone,

So my girlfriend and I have been togerther 1.5 years now. Out this 11 months were long distance where she was away on internships and travelling.
We´ve always had our problems in the past since the setup was really difficult to begin with. But we were both determined to pull through. She was in a different city for 6 months where I visited her every 2 weeks for long weekends. we talked on the phone everyday and got into small fights which eventually ended in us agreeing that the problem was that one thought he/she was more in love than the other. 
My family was often a problem in that i get along with her family really well but sort of shielded her from my family because my father is an egocentric alcoholic and my mother can be reall ydifficult although I hold a decent relationship with her.

From February until June my gf was home for almost 4 months. it took some adjusting but we ended up in a really good spot before she went to south america for 2.5 months. This is where things went really out of hand. At the airport she had cried her eyes out because she dreaded leaving me again and going onto the plane. I told her that I loved her and was sure she would have a great time. She was scared I was going to forget her or cheat (I have never ever given her any reason to believe this, have always been very faithful and loyal, justz talked too much about my ex the first 2 months which I stopped once we talked about how it annoyed her). When she went away to travel I was feeling really secure about our relationship and was just genuinely happy for her. While she was away I spent quite some time with friends and went on weekend trips. But I made sure to write her an email every day. We skyped twice but it was really difficult to understand her so I was not incredibly keen on doing that regularily. But I did enjoy seeing her. 

Things went okay for the first few weeks. Or so I thought. Messages with kisses and sweetly written. taling about missing each other and so forth.
however when she went on to Ecuador after one month things went bad. she stopped responding and just wrote 4 liners without any form of sincerity. Also there were pictures of here partying almost every night and in the arms of different guys. I got extremely sad and jealous and didnt know how to react. I didnt want to escalate into a fight so far away so I just really didnt say much, which I regret now.

Anyway she comes back 3 weeks ago and is a) really sick (coughing that turned into pneumonia) and b) very very distant and cold, harsh even.
She told me how she met all these inspirational people nad had so much fun time with them. I had just been here writing my masters thesis and didnt have much new to tell. Seh told how she met all these super muscular guys (I am somewhat skinny). she also mentioned how she had the feeling some of the people she met now knew her better than I do. She was also much more annoyed of me not being able to remember details of her stories or my clumsiness (has been an issue before and I´m trying to do better but its difficult). Eventually I had lost almost all of my self-esteem and security and cried many times in front of her. She said I am not as fascinating as I used to be and am pressuring her way too much and that it´s stressing her.
And I have been too quick to bring everything back to normal before even discussing what had really gone wrong.
She eventually even had to go to the hospital for a week. And I left her in peace due to her request for a few days. I did however send flowers and cupcakes to her which she really appreciated.


Eventually we had a big fight and talked about it all.
She said she missed me so incredibly much in the first weeks aways and thought i didnt care. Seh was also really disappointed that I didnt want to skype and said that many others she knew skyped with their SOs on daily basis. She also said that she was so pissedat me after one month that she just decided to go do her own thing and not care about it so much. Obviously showing me the cold shoulder.

and although some may think she might have cheated, I do not think so and didn´t ask. i do think she was quite attracted to some of the guys she met. i always try to make a point to leave her to her freedom and not become too jealous. But this was really upsetting. I feel betrayed but still dont think she cheated.

I told her I was really mad for her bahving so shitty towards me and she appologized. i agreed to talk about when something is bothering me. We were ok for 2 days and had good sex, cuddling and so forth. 

However we quickly got into a fight again when I was so ""unattentive"" and forgot to dispose the condom wrapper in her room before I left and her mom saw it  (how old are we?!). 
Arrgh she just gets annoyed at so many things I say. In my head i always think about what i say next so that she ownt make a snide remark.

She left this tuesday to go study in France (We live in germany) for 9 months. I made it super clear that I want to stay together and would come and see ehr 5 days a month (I have a really great well paying job which lets me allocate my holidays flexibly). I told her I still loved her very much. She however says she doesn´t understand why I only just now love her so much now and not earlier. She herself says she isn´t sure of her feelings towards me anymore at this point. Saying she had always said that I was her one big love and outshone anything before (true, she did say this often) and she was always disappointed that I couldn´t make this statement too (I have been in 2 3-year long relationships before and dont like comparing).

Anyway she is gone now. We are not seperated. But in a ways it feels that way. the last day was weird. In a way she showed affection in that she wanted to be hugged often. but then again she didnt want me to stay the night and thought it would have been better to say goodbye the day before. I ended up staying anyway and we hugged long in the morning and she didnt really want me to go and held on. I started crying again. ughh..

Well so she left. I have not been myself lately and realize that I couldnt have been very attractive in these past few weeks. I also despise how she treated me. I still love her very much and want us to return to normal state. I would still love to have a future together. But the way things are now i cant have a relationship with her.
We agreed that i would try to calm down and she would need some space to see how her emotions develop.

She texted me in the night when she arrived: ""arrived well.. Hope you are ok. Luckily there is no more time-difference :* "" (as in compared to south america... 

Now...  I have no fucking clue!! I love her and want to do this. But I have a stupid habbit of holding on to long and romanticising. I do believe in fairy-tales though as in love is not rational sometimes and I will do anything for the woman I love. I dont know how to approach this situation...  do I just leave her alone and let her contact me? Am I betraying myself since the relationship seems somewhat broken already? I really want to visit her for her birthday next month and wold have to buy the tickets soon but I dont think now is a good time surprises. Do I try to be relaxed and slowly ease back to communicating without pressuring? Or do i tell her how I feel and tell her: either you love me and we try it or you dont and we break up! I also really dont want her to just stay together with me out of pitty.

i want to make this work...  I hope its not lost... but am I being stupid?!
I really really dont know. I have never been so emotional about anything in my life before. i must have cried at least 15 times in the past 3 weeks.


Any input would be so welcome! 

**TLDR: Gf and I have been in LDR for quite some time. Everything worked out and were really in love just recently. but she went to south america for 2.5 months and things have gone really bad from then on mostly due to major communication problems. We didnt manage to get better in the 3 weeks she was here and is now off studying in France for 9 months. I want to make things better but dont know how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated**

zto3e,3,2012-09-13,I am worse than pathetic...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zto3e/i_am_worse_than_pathetic/,"I don't really know where else to turn to.  I have friends and family that would lend an ear and want to help, but for some reason I just can't face it, and I think in part I just don't really know how to describe what's going on... I guess I'm hoping that it might be easier for me to type it to strangers...

I have everything going for me... I'm in good health, I'm a good looking guy, I am widely recognised as being one of the most intelligent persons others meet, I have one of the best educations money can buy.  

I had a beautiful and amazing girlfriend all through college, an exceptional young woman in many respects, that I by and large neglected and didn't know or try hard enough to treat right.  She stood by me anyway because she knew that I was not in a good place in college, and she believed in my potential.  I hated education.  By the time it got to graduating from college, I was so good at doing the least amount of work possible to get the necessary grades, that I could learn entire courses from scratch in one or two days and get As.  I did the degree that was as difficult as possible for everyone else that I could imagine, but that I found exploitatively easy: theoretical physics.  I always liked physics, but the reality is that I did it at college because it is easy for me.  I'm sure some of you can relate to this.

As a result of my severe lack of engagement with my education, I turned to pot, video games, and the internet primarily through college to pass the time, which of course steadily built a number of bad habits, making me have destructive/evasive reactions to emotional discomfort, very bad work ethic, and a growing depression/dissatisfaction with my inability to apply myself to things that I thought were productive.  I can't count the number of times I've finished an epic video game, and then mournfully looked at the stats realising that at the end of the day, all that time means absolutely nothing.

I graduated college two years ago, and I moved away from my girlfriend back to my family to try to start a career.  I knew that the last few months had been particularly hard for her, since I'd been in a particularly depressive and dysfunctional state.  She'd been working for a year while I was in my final year of college, and it really contrasted against my life-style.  We agreed that I'd go home to my family after college and start to build a career, with the aim that not far down the road we could move to be in the same city.  For some reason, she decided that it would be better for us, two months after I moved away after college, that we go on a break.  I tried my best to fight that, but she wouldn't budge, and after a month or so of being extremely upset I finally caved in.  I was very upset that she had broken her promise to me only two months before, and that she didn't seem to care that I was agonized by what was going on.

Life went on though.  I got an internship at a pretty cool little company, and I dated a few girls too.  I got progressively more depressed with work though, and the girls I was dating were all not even in the same league of quality as my ""ex"", which made me even more lonely and hurt by what she did.  Eventually I found myself drinking too much in the evenings (I'd given up pot entirely then), working alone at the office and incapable of getting much of anything done but procrastination.  Ultimately the boss of the company and I decided I should work part time from home instead of full time, and while I did do that for a couple weeks, I ended up just falling into a depressive rut, returning to pot and video games, and somehow I managed to stop communicating with my (ex)boss for long enough that it became so awkward that I just couldn't bring myself to contact him.  I was living with a friend at the time and he eventually got fed up with my dysfunctional lifestyle too.

My ex-gf and I were in contact throughout the year, and by a stroke of luck really she invited me to come for a holiday with her family back in her home country.  We did have a good time there together, and at one point she actually asked me to marry her.  I was quite taken aback by that and I responded by saying I thought we should get back together as gf/bf first and work on the issues we had from the past before we make that decision, but it was something that I liked the idea of very much.  At the end of the holiday we had a fight.  I was hungry and tired at the end of a long day, and her and her parents randomly stopped at a mall on the way home and started buying her stuff (I don't speak their language fluently).  I was good company for a couple of hours, waited outside a boutique for 30 mins with the sun disappearing, and when she emerged I thought we were going to the car, but on the way she made a move towards a shoe store... I jokingly tried to stop her from going in, and she flipped out on me... I lost my patience and stormed back to the car to wait.  We had a further 5 minute argument in the car about it in front of her parents.  It seems now that as a result of this fight, it tainted the memory of the holiday quite significantly for her.  After I got home from the holiday, she was reluctant to agree to be gf/bf again.  I tried pushing her for a month over the internet/phone on that, before settling down with a reaction where if she would ask me what I did that day, I'd tell her that's an effort I would make for my girlfriend everyday, but it's a lot of bother otherwise to tell someone about your days all the time over IMs.

Behind this I was working on a new career direction, I was teaching myself how to trade financial instruments and getting myself set up with a system for that.  My hope was that I could use it as a way to make plenty of money on my own, and live a life intimately with my family and have time to pursue hobbies.  Unfortunately I never really fixed my bad work ethics, which is even worse when I work alone, and pot had managed to work its way back into my daily life.  About 3 or 4 months after the holiday with my girlfriend last summer, I decided with my mother that it would be good to get professional help for my alcohol/pot issues, and start working on the fundamental self-discipline issues too.  I told my (ex)gf this and she seemed to be happy with that and hopeful.  One month into doing this course (3 hours a day, 4 days a week), I find out from her that she's dating someone else... I tried and tried to tell her that this was really not ok with me, for her to be moving away from me after all that's been said and my efforts to set myself onto the rails... she kept telling me that it really wasn't a big deal, it didn't mean anything, she just missed the thrill of going on dates... and I kept telling her that if she respects my feelings and wants to be careful not to impede my efforts on the course to improve myself, she would stop.  She did finally stop, but not after 5 weeks or so of my being really very upset with her and talking with her almost every day, and not because she cared about my feelings after all, but because she went on a final date with him and decided that he wasn't inspiring enough.

This episode affected me harder and deeper than I realised at the time, it's difficult to describe the agony of feeling like you're losing someone you care about a lot and that you're helpless to stop it.  I came back to the city she was working in as soon as I could, after doing the minimum three months of the course.  I reasoned to myself that this city would be better for me to attempt to day trade financial instruments in too.  When I came back I was still in shock to be honest, and I still hadn't really solved the underlying work ethic issues that ultimately lead me to destructive avoidance behaviours like drinking and smoking and playing too many video games.  I started ok, this was March, and for the first month or two I was making some progress on my work, even though it was slow, and I did enjoy spending time with her, even though I was always feeling discomfort about the unresolved issues.  Her and I and not that good at communicating.  She has a family background that makes her generally quite a quite, private person, who likes to avoid conflict.  As I say too, I also just in part didn't understand what I was feeling towards her, I just knew that I was not happy.

Things started to slide.... she went on holiday, I went off to other places, she was always working and tired when around anyway.... I barely got to see her in person more than one or twice every fortnight, and it just wasn't enough for me to fix my feelings towards her.  I felt betrayed by her, I felt like she didn't really have my back like I thought she did, I felt like she didn't care as much about my future as she so much seemed to from her words... I was just angry and sad... I withdrew from the world... for some weeks the only other person I would see would be my pot dealer (yes, I fell back into pot after a few months back in her city, I just couldn't cope emotionally, but it makes it worse and worse... I know it's desperate).  I just... I just wanted to be alone... but in the end my hiding from the world and being constantly upset towards her, it drove her away.... and now she says that she's given up.  I really don't understand, from my perspective it seems like she's done almost nothing to reach out to me, to make peace with me over what happened, and I'm too stupid and upset to find a way to tell her what's bothering me about her behaviour in a way that gets her to respond to me in the way that I want....

I've reached a point now where I find it hard to eat any more, and I keep having suicidal thoughts.  I'm deeply depressed about the world, I struggle to find hope.  I can't find what I want to do with my life, I can't get myself to work effectively alone, I can't train my body like I want, the girl I thought was of my dreams is slipping away, and I can't tell if she's disappearing because she'll never really be the woman I thought she was and she doesn't know how to treat me in a way that gets the best from me, or if the best thing that ever happened to me is gone because I'm too fucking pathetic.

The only reason I'm not dead already is because I can't bare thinking about the damage it would cause to the people around me, especially my family.  But it's what I really really want right now.  I just want to escape, I can't take it any more.  I'm sorry for so many words, thank you if you listened to me."

However, we're moving in May for my internship, and we've got a three week break before we have to be in Fort Worth.  We're starting to think that it would be better to get married before we move - I'll have time for a honeymoon (I'll be starting a new job in October, so probably no honeymoon), I'll be able to come a few days before the wedding to start decorating, and when we move to Fort Worth into our house where we're planning to stay and start a family, we'll already be married.  I think there is significance to that, even though we've already lived together for 7 months or so. 

We've been engaged a month, and I've been planning the wedding since.  I've got a venue, a caterer, and my mom is coming in from Colorado to go dress shopping in October.  Am I bonkers to think we can do this by May?  Even with graduate school?

Thanks!

*EDIT*  Thank you for all of the advice and positive thoughts!  We've officially moved it up, and I am SO excited!  Venue's booked, we're talking to caterers, and we're lining a photographer up today.  Can't wait for May!"

Well I haven't really done a personal post like this, ever!

Some of you know and some of you don't know. But I failed my summer exams, quite badly. In my college we are allowed sit repeats (suplementals).
The result for these repeat exams come out tomorrow and being honest here, I am petrified. I bite my naiils and they have currently been chewed down 
to the point on non existence. Between now and then, I wouldn't be suprised if I lost all my hair (melodramatic I know but sue me!). Some people would
say "" Ah sure John, if you didn't pass that just means that you didn't put the work in"" but thats the thing, I did! I put countless hours into studying,
to reading over college notes and looking up online for extra explinations. Exams...well exams just are not my thing. Continous assessment is where my 
strong point it. Heck, I've gotten best in my coarse in a good few assingments and projects, I've become project leader (and actually got the work done) and 
done so well that i was even offered a internship by my course director. That clearly shows i've put in the work during the year, that I'm a lazy asshat who 
just sat there at the back of lecturees ( besides Maths 2, but that shit was easy) and done nothing. I went to my lectures, I done the work. I was even personally
noted a few times by lectures. The BIG end of year project , we had to assemble a mangonel (a roman catapult) and redesign a new arm to get the projectile to 
travel further. My group basically left the re-designing of the new arm to me fully. The ammount of effort and calculations that were put into it and while it 
didn't look like much, there was a shit ton of maths behind it (well, maths to my best capabilities). One of our experiment co-ordinators came over and was 
talking to me about it, even he said it was interesting and offered a last minute suggestion to make it better. When the module lecturer came over, he commented
on how it was a highly ambitious design but a very well and the most creative design there. 



So it's clear that my work during the year is good and it's not laziness. I just don't do well under exams. I don't know what it is, if it's the pressure that 
gets to me or what. i mean I did repeat my leaving cert so I'm already a year behind and now if I don't get true that's going to put me another year behind 
people and I'm not so sure I'd be able to handle that. I find out tomorrow what's going to happen, and all of this worry might be in vain, but right now, I 
just don't think I'm good enough, that I deserve this coarse.



This year has been a combination of high and low, forced myself to realise a lot of things about myself, that I needed to adress me confidence issuues, that 
my father is a part of me no matter how much a try turn it away, that sometimes the wicked go unpunished. But I can easily say that this summer was the accumilation
of these highs and lows. I failed my exams [bad]. I found someone who made me smile in a way not many can [good - I don't like people. I've ever had a thing for one other person]. 
My close uncle was diagnosed with cancer[bad].
I put my self on the kidney transfer list to save a close family friends life [good]. I found out that me and my brother might have a genetic problem that might
cause us to randomly have strokes whwn we're older and would stop me from donating said kidney [bad]. Went to Arcadecon and the following event [Good, easily 
the best memories from the year are from this,  Thank you again Declan for putting all of thart time and effect into making arcade as amazing it is]. Close uncle 
who had heart attack gets worse and gets a heart attack, Bells paulsie, a stroke and blood clots [bad]. Mammy getting depressed and not being able to do anything
about it [bad]. Finally get the courage to ask someone out, get's rejected [bad - I know this ain't major but it was not long ago so the sting is still fresh]. 
Such a flux of feelings and experiences and on top of that, exams to worry about.



One person that did make this summer was Mark. I was able to like him, and he liked him. For the first time ever, I allowed myself to date someone. Getting close
 to him felt good. Things were going well until his athritus kicked in. After that things neer really were the same. Good but not the same. I asked him out on
monday and while I knew it deep down what his answer was going to be, I didn't want to believe it. It was a no. He gave the reason that he doesn't think he's
boyfriend material and that just means I failed. I failed to make him feel as good about himself as he made me feel good about me. I should have been able to
make him see that he is a truly fantastic person in so many ways, that he'd be worth any struggle that might happen.



My heads just all over the place right now.



I'm sorry for the lenght.



But thank you let me get that off my chest.

Honestly."

I'm majoring in Aerospace Engineering, but I'm mostly going to be working with software. 

Can someone point me in the right direction of a project I throw together for my resume? I've never done unit testing in Java or C++, but that's what I've seen on internship job descriptions.  I just need a push in the right direction of a project that would require lots of unit testing. Something vaguely related to aerospace preferable, but not required. I can work out the difficult parts if I get a short summary on the project and what I should make sure make sure I cover with my programing: different types of testing.

This is something I'd put 30 hours a week in to and try to have ready before October for an upcoming career fair.  I'm thinking of doing it in both C++ and Java.

Currently, I'm finishing up a java applet that shows a random walk and some graphs so the behaviors can be studied. That's my first project to host on git and put my one resume. I just want something specific to the industry that I can really show gusto with.

zsz92,7,2012-09-12,Internship Opportunity Advice,senornerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zsz92/internship_opportunity_advice/,"Recently I applied for an internship, namely an ""*Undergraduate Research Programmer*"" position. It was a tough interview and it certainly wasn't my best but I felt I still did well. Well enough to be offered a position, however it was not the position I wanted nor applied for. 

They offered me a ""*Systems Administrator*"" position possibly thanks to my few years of work experience in a related field. This position will not include any programming per se. It will be technical in nature and therefor I do not see how it can benefit me as I'm trying/hoping to get relevant programming experience and find an internship that can stimulate and aid my growth as a student of CS.
I'm unsure of what to do. The job will come with a few sacrifices, like reducing free-time I'll have available to study, and it will require more daily travel. But it is paid, not much but some.

I wonder if taking the job will help me land the one I wanted when another round of hires happens, but that's a risk. 
If there's no intrinsic value to this job, and no foreseeable long term value... is it worth it?

Thanks for any advice!"

I've always wanted to be on the giving end, but never thought I would have to ask for help. Here's my situation. I am a mechanical engineering student with just two quarters to go to finish my degree. I pay for my own school, I pay for everything on my own. I was working an internship at a chemical plant in Joliet and it was supposed to go until November 21st which is the week I return to school. Well they ran out of money to pay me and I've been laid off. I just bought a car, it's not much but it gets me around. And boy am I glad I have it as it's also my apartment right now. I had a nice place that I was renting in Joliet, but I couldn't afford the rent and I lost my apartment. I've exhausted my savings and pretty much have nothing left. I've been driving around applying everywhere and got a call back to deliver pizzas. However, I can't make ends meet with this as I am paying $200/MONTH on my truck. I've been applying to pretty much every Craigslist gig in the area to no avail. I got taken advantage of once after working a 12 hour day and the people refused to pay me. I applied for unemployment and was told I will receive $51/week. Not much but it helps. Today I found out my truck needs new brakes and I'm looking at $550 to replace them. Oh well, I guess I will just have to live with them at the moment. I'm done crying, I feel like that's how I've fallen asleep the past week. I came here because I need help. If anyone could give me a job in mechanical engineering as an intern I promise you will not regret it. Or if someone needs yard work done. Or really anything. I am a very hard worker, I am reliable, I am motivated. I wanted to return to school this winter to finish my degree but now that I have no savings to do so that seems like an impossibility. I hope there is someone out there that can help. I don't know what else to do. I never thought I would find myself in this situation. I guess no one does. 


UPDATE:
So I met up with 420is404 and he is an incredibly awesome guy. The kindness he has shown me brought tears to my eyes. He is one of the most genuine, kind, awesome, generous, and epically incredible people I have ever met in my life. The repair ended up being a little more involved than either one of us could've imagined when we embarked on our journey to repairdom. Being that the truck is almost 20 years old, there were several parts that needed to be replaced in addition to the pads and rotor. Needed new wheel bearings, new caliper, new cam assembly, grease, and some specialized tools. 420is404 purchased all of this for me. Not only did he do that and spend his day off helping me, he also let me borrow his truck so that I could work. I have never before in my 22 years on this earth experienced such kindness and genorosity from a complete stranger. But stranger no more is he - I think I've made a friend for life. And when I graduate and get a full time engineering job I'm going to pay him back for everything. Also, I hope that I can do something like this for someone when they need it the most. This experience has completely changed my outlook on life. Never again will I take what I have for granted because I know how quickly it can all be gone. Also, It has taught me that people are an inherently good species. I feel so so SO fortunate for someone to have done all of this for me. Another good development - I was approved for emergency food stamps so starting Tuesday I will receive more than enough benefits to take care of my food needs. SOOOOOO many thanks to 420is404 for everything he has done for me. Words alone cannot express the monumental depth of my gratitude. 

Now all I need is a full time job that pays in the neighborhood of $12-15/hr and I'll be set. If anyone has connections that could land me an engineering internship let me know and I'll shoot you my resumè. Thank you to everyone for the advice and kind words, I really appreciate the uplifting comments. Of anyone needs some help around the house or office let me know l; I'm a hard worker!! 

Reddit is truly an amazing place full of wonderful people. Like I told 420is404, 20 years from now when I hopefully have a son of my own I can't wait to recount this experience to him and tell him about the time his dad was down on his luck and he was pulled up out of it by a truly wonderful person. 

I'll finish this book length update with one of my favorite quotes of all time.

zsve5,1,2012-09-12,[21/m] Is my girlfriend (20/f) trying to break up with me? Or am I just paranoid? I need serious help.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zsve5/21m_is_my_girlfriend_20f_trying_to_break_up_with/,"I wrote a lengthy letter to my girlfriend to call her out for dragging me along a break, when I somewhat know she is just using it as a way to break up with me so that I am not offended. I'm a journalism major, sometimes words are necessary.


I just need to know if my points are valid/reasonable, and if I have any reason to be upset. 

tl;dr I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me, and has used some really weird tactics lately. please read below to understand more.
 
ARTICLE START---- APOLOGIES FOR WEIRD FORMATTING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT! 

	Jennifer, the last few weeks have been indescribable. This will be very hard to get through, so excuse me while I try to. I’ve never come into a serious talk with a prepared statement. I have so many things flying through my mind at a million miles an hour that it seemed like the best option. I can’t think of any other way to address all the things on my mind without forgetting something, without rambling, or making myself unclear.
---
	I will start with what scares me the most: That you are such a kind and gentle person, that you are afraid to hurt me in any way.  When we started this relationship, and we sat down, I asked that we communicate with each other and be honest. I have a sneaking suspicion, that I will add I really hope isn’t true, that you have known for quite some time that you didn’t want to be with me any more.

----
	I fear that you may have used the supposed break that I never really agreed to as a vehicle to break up with me so that I would see it coming and take it easier. I don’t know if this were just I being paranoid and terrified, it certainly wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. 
	 All I know is that if you did this in any way, I would be angry. I am not accusing you of this – I am simply saying that I am worried that it might be the case, due to your word choice over the last few weeks, and due to your friends, whom I know you confer with and get advice from.
	I have a few reasons to believe that this might be the case, or they might just be coincidental.
	When you first sat me down in tears, back when you first visited me at my Allston house, you broke down crying. What you told me that day has completely changed how I looked at our relationship. There was no way it couldn’t change things: That night you had told me that I had been too stressed out with my life, and that we simply weren’t having fun anymore. 
You said that I was going through a hard time, and that it was carrying over to our relationship, and had been doing so for over a month. You told me I had certain characteristics that weren’t ever going to be compatible with you, and you stressed that you were worried that I wasn’t the right one for you. I am deeply sorry for that, and that night, I felt absolutely crushed. But I knew I had to change if I wanted to save us. I had no fucking choice. I had to buckle down.
	Of course, the fact of the matter is, you broke a rule of our relationship. You were supposed to tell me, stop me, before things got bad. You were supposed to communicate. And so by the time it was too realized, I realized that I was the one that needed to change anyway.
	And then an odd thing happened, just 12 hours after you cried and cried and cried about all of this, right on my shoulder. And then, the VERY NEXT DAY, it happened. You did EXACTLY what you had critisized me for doing, and then cried about. 
 You spend an entire afternoon texting me about things that, quite honestly, paled in comparison to what I had been dealing with over the last month, and what you are dealing with currently. Hear me out Jennifer, you’ve put up with some horrible stuff lately. You’ve had TONS of stress in your life, and a brother leaving for college, and other things I don’t need to mention. But that day, it was just petty things, and you were out of control with rage. 
Personally, I was absolutely livid at what I saw and heard from you, just HOURS after you had emptied your heart to me in a last ditch effort to save our relationship. How dare you cry on my shoulder and tell me that I need to change how I handle my stress because it was dragging me down, cry on my shoulder for thirty minutes, like it means the world to you, and then the next day, you do that same thing to me. I just don’t see how you could have done that. And that’s when I began to worry that you were going to break up with me.
Why wouldn’t I think that? How can the girl I love cry to me over something so exact, saying how painful it was for me to throw all that stress on you, and how it was dragging us down, and then you do that very painful thing to me the very next day!	It seemed so bizarre. At the very least, if that was the only thing bothering you at the time, then you owe me an apology for your actions the next day. 
The only thing I could think after you did that to me was that there was something much bigger pulling at your strings, something more important that was drawing you apart from me, and that you just didn’t have the will to continue with me. There’s just no other way I could explain you doing that to me hours after you claimed it was so hard to deal with. So pardon me if I am wrong, but I had reason to think so because of what you did.
	Just to clarify things, let me read of the texts you sent me, so you can remember:

“My mom is so frustrating I could cry cant wait to move out of here”

“And to top it all off I lost the cord to my iPhone so I need to order a new one ugh I am so annoyed right now”

“I can’t even get a response about this internship because the professor is a moron and doesn’t want to do his job

“I’m not going to relax until my life is finally settled I can’t deal with all these pending things.”

That last quote, my jaw dropped. Jennifer. You had nearly broken up with me, you had given me an ultimatum (e.g. “fix this, or it won’t work out”) You looked me squarely in the eye, cried to me for over a half an hour about how I had put so much stress on you, while you shook and sobbed. This conversation in my room had directly altered one of the most Important things in my life, and I realized needed to overcome the stress in my life to treat you better. 
Once your texts started to trickle in 12 hours later, I sat there in my room, confused, texting back encouraging things as you absolutely stunned me with your lack of consideration for what you had just done. You challenged who I was as a person, to my very core, and then you spent a good 5 hours complaining about an iPhone cord and a situation you literally could not control under any means at that point. You said I wasn’t relaxing and dealing with the pressures of my life well enough, and said I needed to fix it for us to be happy. The very next day, you said that you weren’t going to relax until your life settled down.
Just days later, you acted like everything was completely normal around me at 10 Carmel.

For sake of not making things awkward, I appreciated you holding yourself together. I appreciate that you didn’t walk out, break down or act awkward. But there wasn’t even anything close to a middlegroudn that entire night. You acted completely normal, hardly acknowledged me, and had absolutely flawless, normal conversations with everyone as if nothing was amiss. I shot glances over at you, wanting to see if you had any sign of discomfort or sadness. You laughed loudly dozens of time, joked with everyone, and in general, not once showed ANY sign of hurt THE ENTIRE NIGHT I WAS THERE. That devastated me beyond words; I couldn’t bear to see you that normal after a situation so devastating to me. I didn’t understand how you could do it. 
	
I had so much pain in my heart and all I wanted to do was cry, but the girl I loved was 5 feet away, acting as if our relationship wasn’t on pins and needles. While I appreciate your composure in a certain sense, it was so hard. I can imagine (or at least hope) you felt a lot of strain in your heart that night, but you put on an absolutely FLAWLESS image that everything was 100% ok. I honestly don’t think I could have ever done that. As much as it probably makes me a horrible person to wish you were a bit sad, I really wished I saw a sign of sadness in you that night. I saw nothing. 

Once again, I will get back to the subject of all of this. Ultimately, my biggest fear has been that you have already made up your mind that you no longer wish to be with me, and that you are simply using this break as a means to cut to an easier break up. It would be so hard just to break up with me flat out, but If we took a few weeks off, then you could just play the “this isn’t ever going to work again” card, and because of our basic mini-break up slash break, it wouldn’t be as devastating to me.  You don’t want to see me sad, so I can understand that, but I would still be furious.

In the days that preceded the 10 Carmel run in, life got a little better. I started to see my friends at school, and it really took my mind of things. Your grandmother died, and I tried to be there for you. It was around this time that I started picking up on language that indicated that you didn’t want to be anything but friends. 

You said things like, “You will always be an important person to me,” which implies that I will always be important to you, even if we break up. To me, you don’t say that to someone in a situation like this unless you intend to break up with him or her. 

Then, you removed your relationship status from facebook. I can’t even claim that was a step towards breaking up with me, that just hurt for whatever reason.
	
And then, when you asked for a hug, you said “you needed a friend right now.”

Anyway, by no means are those few texts proof that you just want to be friends.

But then, that day, I started to panic a little, because I saw the trend coming back. I saw that you started to treat me like a friend, so I texted Mary and Sammie. What Mary said to me was really hurtful, not because of anything insulting, but because it sounded like a prepared statement that went through you first.
	Mary said that you needed to figure out what you needed and wanted.
What else could that mean? Clearly, she had at some point, figured out that you had a decision to make. Why was it that Mary thought that you needed to decide on something? What did you need to decide on? What did you need and want? From what I understood at our last talk in your new room, you just wanted a break and were strictly against breaking up. When I said that I wouldn’t do breaks, you kept asking why not.
	So what lead Mary to believe that you had to figure out what you wanted to do? I thought we had just agreed but not really agreed to take a break…
	To me, it sounds like you’ve been telling Mary things that you haven’t had the courage to tell me, which is that you want to break up with me, but might not be 100% sure. 
	Let me put it to you this way. Let’s say that I’m just completely scared out of my mind and that none of this is true. Let’s say that all you’ve told Mary is that you want a break to let things heal and see how they go.
	Why then, would Mary suggest to me that you need time to figure out what you want and need? Supposedly, you know what you want and need, and that is a break. It sounded to me that Mary had some extra knowledge, and that you were once again using the break, which started weeks ago, as a means to break up with me without hurting me.
	If that is the case, All I can say is this. You broke the trust of this relationship. You failed to communicate with me, and you deceived me into thinking that I had a standing chance to fix our relationship through hours of personal reflection and thought. 
	If this is the case, I don’t think we can be friends. If this is the case, we haven’t broken up because of inseparable differences; we haven’t broken up due to stress in our lives. If this entire entire essay was the case, you just don’t like me anymore and want out. Anyone that throws me to the curb because I’m supposedly not good enough for them doesn’t deserve to be my friend. To me, this sounds like a normal break up that you’ve been putting off due to your own fear, and if it is, I don’t think I’ll be speaking to you for a long, long time. If this is because you don’t think I’m a good enough person to make you happy, I can’t wait to prove you wrong.

	Like I said, there was really no way for me to come into a conversation and throw this all on a table. Any missed piece here or there, and what I’m saying sounds like a bunch of insecurity.

zsoei,2,2012-09-12,Best Approach for Getting an Internship in CS?,imbadatinterviews,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zsoei/best_approach_for_getting_an_internship_in_cs/,"Currently a second year Computer Science undergraduate in one of the two big Bay Area universities (won't say which one), but we get visits quite frequently from companies in the area, hosting career fairs or info sessions. I'm starting to look for internships for next summer, and I've worked on a host of personal projects and held a programming job before. I try to emphasize this on my resume but, my technical GPA is not too great (~3.0), and I'm not sure what my approach to getting summer internships should be. 

Recruiters often have dozens of students talking to them, and handing off my resume seems largely ineffective. However, applying online seems to put me into a pool of people all over the world, and seems much more competitive. 

tl;dr: Any protips for those of us applying for internships?

Also, does anyone suggest possibly an internship abroad? Are there any short internships available over winter break?"
zwisn,8,2012-09-14,"Girlfriend [28] moves in after 5 year relationship, last 2 years long distance, moves out after 11 days. [27 M] What happened?",thebigl58,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zwisn/girlfriend_28_moves_in_after_5_year_relationship/,"Hi reddit. I’ve been a lurker for a little while now, and this is my first post. I need some help figuring out my first real break-up after a long distance relationship. This is probably like the longest post ever, like a freaking novel. I hope that someone will take the time to read about the last few years of my life. I’ve spent a lot of hours gathering my thoughts. What I really hope is that getting this all out of my system will be cathartic in some way. Any advice that any of you could give would help me sleep better. So here we go.

A little back story on me. I played football in college for 2 years before I sustained a pretty devastating knee injury (pretty much the way of the offensive lineman). I was torn about whether or not to hang it up after the injury, but with the rigor of school (and the chance of further injury), I decided to quit. All of that is to say that I put on a considerable amount of weight before I started work in the real world after school because I continued my eating and drinking habits, but not any exercise.

I met my now ex at our first job out of school (We can call her Riley). I was hooking up with a former fling (nothing serious) from high school when I came back to my hometown to work, and I didn’t look at Riley as girlfriend material. I was just trying to figure out my new job. We became really fast friends. She played college soccer and was really athletic, and also a huge football fan so we fell right in. We seriously were inseparable. People at work were starting rumors about a relationship between us. We both shrugged them off as ridiculous, although I was beginning to have some feelings. I knew she didn’t reciprocate because of my appearance at the time. We started running together on a regular basis, and she pushed me hard. I started working out on my own and eating properly and lost a lot of the weight. Went from 290 to about 245.

So after about 3 months into our friendship, we decide to go to a UGA game together on our company tickets. We hang out with some of my friends who were still in school there, and proceed to get sloshed beforehand like any good SEC fan. She ran off to find some of her friends at another tailgate spot, and I stayed with mine. Well, she gets lost coming back in the mass of humanity, and cell reception is terrible. I eventually leave to go seek her out and she runs up grabs my hand and hugs me and says “Don’t ever lose me again”. That was it for me, seriously like a lightning bolt. I was in love, and I had to have her.
At the time, she lived with 2 of her soccer teammates from college (Aside: these girls were super hot and fun; which was totally awesome) in a house. I was living at my parents like a fucking loser, but she always invited me to stay at her house on weekends so I didn’t have to drive drunk back out of the city. I slept on the couch.

 I started becoming really good friends with her one roommate and confided my feelings to her about Riley. I was too much of a pussy to come out and ask her feelings about me myself, but I also didn’t want to ruin my relationship with the person who had turned into my best friend (and not to mention a coworker). Her roommate kept my secret. Eventually I made my move at the bar one night, and she denied me. She whispered that she didn’t want to have any PDA with work people around (which there were), we went back to her place and I was in.

We didn’t have sex for a few weeks after that but were definitely fooling around. Before we slept together, she did tell me this “I wish I had met you 4 years from now”, meaning she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a relationship. I told her I was here now, and that’s how it happened so let’s just go with it. We started sleeping together and everything was great like it always is at the beginning of a relationship. I don’t know if I’ve ever been happier. I had gotten out of the friend zone. I finally moved out of my parents and got my own place down the street from her and she was spending 3 or 4 nights a week at my place. 
Then the recession happened. We had taken an entry level job at a real estate finance firm in the investor services dept (read: answering the phone and listening to irate investors). IT WAS HORRIBLE. We were chained to our desks and working long hours, with no foreseeable advancement in that dept. Riley actually began to put on some weight because we were both so unhappy with our jobs and we had stopped working out because of the long hours. We felt like things would turn around soon so we stuck with it and didn’t look for other jobs (mostly because there weren’t any)

We both started studying for the CFA which is an extremely rigorous financial exam that takes about 3 years to complete to try and make ourselves more marketable. That took up a lot of time as well and added to the stress in our lives. Riley began having more body issues, constantly saying she was fat, and we kind of went in a slight downward spiral. During this time she also changed birth control because she felt it was too expensive on our medical plan. I believe it changed her mood for the worse. She never confided in me any feelings of true depression or extreme body issues, other than the occasional “I feel fat”. She was still initiating sex. You’ll see why I mentioned that later.

One night at her house, her roommate and her boyfriend were in another one of their typical knock-down, drag-outs so we go into her room so they can scream their heads off. Riley looks at me and she said “What we have is so much more special than anyone else I know, you’re the person I want to marry, I want to be with you for the rest of my life”. I told her I felt the same way.

So we’re now a little over 2 years into the relationship and Riley decides that she’s had enough of work and she wants to get her MBA. She applies to schools in a few different places, but the key is that she applied to Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, and SMU, in Dallas (where she’s from along with the last 4 generations of her family, everyone still lives there). She called me sobbing the day didn’t get in to Tech, but she got into SMU. I had just (finally) been promoted at work, and wanted to ride it out for a little while longer to get the work experience. I thought of it as diversifying our career risk. She goes to school, I get work experience. We talked about it this way, which honestly for a couple of 25 year olds is pretty mature. We were taking a long term view of our life together.

We decided that she would move to Dallas, and that I would continue to work at our company to get work experience before changing jobs. The goal was that I would try to move in a year. The day she moved to Dallas was, at the time, was the worst day of my life. We told each other that we would get through it, and we’d be better off in the end.

Things were tough (obviously), but we managed. I saw her maybe once every month on average, i.e 2 trips in 4 weeks then a 6 week stint. At her Christmas that year, she came and stayed with me in my new rental house for 5 weeks. I had to work some of that time while she was off for winter break, but we had a great time. It was really great. We went on a trip to the North Georgia mountains and had one of the best weekends of our relationship, and had tons of sex. 

After our trip to the mountains, she had to go back to school. We were going to be apart for about 3 months. We decided that for her spring break we’d go on a cruise. I made it a goal of mine to lose 20 more pounds before the trip. I started doing Crossfit (Riley was too) and lost the weight I wanted. I was in the best shape of my life, probably around 230 lbs. We had an incredible cruise, met some great people, and just laughed.

So at this point, while I don’t have a body like Matthew McConaughey, but I’ve taken great strides towards getting in shape so I can have a better sex life. 

At the end of her first year, the MBA students were required to go on a trip abroad. She chose South America. She ends up making out with a Brazilian guy while she’s down there. She doesn’t tell me until she gets back, but she had emailed her sister about it when she was there. I guess she wanted to tell me over the phone rather that email me about it. This was the week before one of my CFA exams and was horribly stressful and I wanted to die, but I forgave her because I honestly don’t know what I would have done if I got wrecked in a foreign country like Brazil and a hot chick tried to make out with me. I truly believe that she only made out with someone because her sister told me privately that was the case. I also hacked her email (which I’m ashamed of) and saw the email to her sister. I had lost some trust.

After that trip abroad for her, things were NOT that different. She got an internship in Dallas over the summer and we saw each other along the same schedule. I decided to stay at work until the end of her MBA program to give her the flexibility to search for a job where she wanted and we would move to that city together. I think it upset her slightly that I wasn’t moving out there when we had originally planned, but we were thinking about a move to a new city like San Fran or NYC after she graduated, and I didn’t want to jump ship from 2 jobs in one year.

 Things were starting to slow down in our sex life. She had stopped initiating. She was also denying a lot of my advances. I figured it was just the rigor of the long distance relationship, a 4 year lull, or the contrived nature of our intimacy because we only had a few days every 6 weeks to do it. It was like scheduled sexy time. Sometime she was on her period when I saw her and nothing could happen.  Once we were actually living together again, things would pick back up. I was sure of it. I spoke to her about it maybe once or twice and she just said that she didn’t have the sex drive that she used to. I asked her about birth control and she said that she couldn’t afford any other type on her schools’ med plan. I tried to try some different things like porn and a toy, but she didn’t really respond. She didn’t deny, just didn’t get excited about it.

Riley was nearing the end of her MBA program and I started asking questions about where she was looking for jobs, and what she wanted to do. She NEVER wanted to have this conversation. She would get really pissed. She started going out to the bars more and more because school was easy for her. I kept trying to press her gently for some direction on the next phase of our life but she just kept shrugging it off. I can’t tell you how frustrating this was for me. She had all of the control over my life AND her life because I had committed to her that I would move where she wanted to go. I was working rigorous hours, and she was going out on Wednesdays. I never confronted her about how unfair I felt she was being, and I wish I had now. 

Finally in May (after I did some assisting in her job search), she started gaining traction in the job market. I had been looking for jobs as well, just to see what was out there in case she wanted to move back to Atlanta. I was actively being headhunted by a firm in Atlanta. 

For the 4th of July, we went on a trip to Key West, which she suggested, to celebrate my taking of the 3rd and final Level of the CFA. We flew into Ft. Lauderdale to take the scenic drive down. I decided to splurge and get a convertible rental for the trip. She didn’t want me to spend any more money on her, she said. I wanted to do this, this was for me. She was adamant for me not to spend the extra money, but I did it anyway.  We had a great trip, and had sex twice, but she refused my other advances and said she wasn’t in the mood. I was disappointed because we hadn’t seen each other for 2 months, but I let it go.

During our trip she got an email request to go to a final interview for a firm in Dallas where she actually wanted the job. I was excited for her, but she just seemed down. I asked her what she was going to do if she got offered the job. Was she going to take it? Or move back to Atlanta with me? Or continue looking in other cities? She said that she couldn’t make a decision until she had the offer. I pressed her with a hypothetical situation, and she shut down like she did the previous few months. Didn’t want to talk about it. I again shrugged it off, and chalked it up to the fact that no one wants to talk about work on vacation. 
So vacation over, and we drive (4 HOURS BACK TO THE FLL AIRPORT). Her flight is before mine. I see her off at the gate and she tells me that she had an incredible time, loves me, and kisses me goodbye. I tell her good luck on her interview.

Her interview was 3 days after our trip. I waited to call her about the result until my drive home from work. She says that she got the job. GREAT! Before I can say “what’s next” she continues talking and says that she’s going to take the job in Dallas and she wants me to stay in Atlanta….whoa. WHAT? That doesn’t compute. Are you breaking up with me? To this day she has never said that she was breaking up with me when I’ve asked her directly. 

She goes on to describe that for a long time now, maybe a year; that she hasn’t felt sexually attracted to me. She said initially she wasn’t sure. She said that she thought her feelings would change but they haven’t. She also said that she’s been unhappy and very depressed for the last 6 months and she thinks that it’s because she couldn’t tell me these things. She was hysterically crying through all of this over the phone. I was in a living hell, this was not how the end of our time apart was supposed to be.

I asked her after all of this time, this effort, why couldn’t she tell me this in person when we were driving back to the airport not 3 days before? Or at any time? I couldn’t believe that she was hiding this from me for so long. That she felt so ashamed of her feelings that she couldn’t tell her best friend what was on her mind  (She still maintained that I was her best friend). She said she had been talking to her mom about her feelings and that she thought that she should end it now before we moved in together (our plan the since the day she left) She didn’t want me to move out to Dallas, uproot my life, and then she still feel the same way a few months from now and I’d be screwed.

I suggested to her that because she had never told me about her feelings before, that maybe she needed to take some time on it and see how she felt, now that it was in the open. Our conversation at that point was not being any more productive anyways. I told her goodbye.
I was hoping to let her think about it for at least 3 or 4 days. But she texted me at 11pm that night saying that she felt like she was making the biggest mistake of her life to give up on someone that she loved so much. I was so incredibly confused. I didn’t respond to her, and felt so sick that I didn’t go into work the next day. 

She called me the next day and I answered, stupidly. She said that she still felt the same way; that she needed to end it. First I told her that wasn’t really taking the time to think, but I made my case. 
I told her that our intimacy had been totally contrived for the last 2 years. That we could never be spontaneous as a couple because we had to plan our visits to see each other, and every time we went to each other’s city, we had an agenda. People who were friends with us wanted to hang out with us together. We also always tried to plan trips around a concert or event, so we were always scrambling to do things like a normal couple. I also told her that she had her own body image issues (which she expressed to me before), and that she was projecting her own image of her sexuality on me. I told her she hadn’t changed her birth control, nor consulted anyone about it to see if that was affecting her sex drive. I also implored to her that if she was really depressed, that she needed to talk to a professional. I couldn’t help her with that. I also told her that there was a serious communication issue between us that she internalized and never allowed us to work on together. She agreed with me, and that she would work on getting therapy set up so she could work on herself. 

I told her to take some real time to figure it out. I would wait. Please Riley, think about how much effort we’ve put in to this relationship to make it this far, and now you want to throw it all away before you even give it a chance again.

So she then proceeds to call me the next day and say “I’m not taking the job, and I want to move in with you in Atlanta” YES! I was so ecstatic that she was at least going to take me back that I didn’t think about the implications of her flip-flopping so much on her decisions. “Are you sure?”- I asked. “I can always find a job in a city, but I don’t want to regret the rest of my life losing something with you.”
I told her that we could start over when she moved in, clean slate. I was living in a 3-bedroom house at that point and I told her that we could sleep in separate rooms to start. That was the last of the discussions that we had about our relationship until after she moved in. Her sister drove her U-Haul over from Dallas, while Riley followed her in her car. Her sister had never been to Atlanta before, so I took 2 days off work to go do touristy things and help her move in. She brought everything with her. I mean EVERYTHING. She had a lot of crap. It made me feel really good that she going to be making a home with me. I was still scared though.

One night we went out to a bar and Riley went to the bathroom, her sister grabbed me aside and told me this: “I told Riley that she needs to get over her indecision and commitment issues with you. You are a great guy, and you’ve treated her, me, and the rest of my family so well. If this somehow doesn’t work out for you two, then you deserve someone much better.” I hate that this was a foreshadowing of what was to come. 

I failed to mention before that I had put in my 2 weeks’ notice at my firm of 5 years and I was offered 2 weeks of free time before my new employer needed me to start. This was perfect! Riley and I could take some time to figure out what’s gone wrong over the past few years, and figure the next step in our lives. Just take a vacation like we did a year before to the mountains and go hiking. Oh, and that same firm that offered her a job in Dallas? Well, guess what. They have an office in the building that I’m going to be working in, and that she can start with the Atlanta group in October!!!

So here we go. The Monday after my last day of work, her sister has left, and I have NOTHING to do.  It was like the most glorious morning of my life. I woke up, I had no obligations, and the love of my life was making breakfast for me and she had a job. But I knew that everything was too perfect. I knew that this feeling I had couldn’t last, somehow, I knew. We went to Crossfit that morning together and had a great workout and we decided we were going to go to this great sandwich spot that served Jack and Coke slushies and get hammered. I was putting my shoes on to leave and she said “I need to talk to you, do you want to talk now or after lunch?” ……Ummmmm.. how about now? Mind you, this girl has been moved into my house for 11 days. She’s put up her pictures on the wall. That’s about as far as she’s gotten. We’ve kissed a few times, but nothing else and have been sleeping in separate rooms.

“I still feel the same way. I’m just not sexually attracted to you anymore. I mean, you don’t have the greatest body, and neither do I, but I just don’t know how this is going to work if I can’t be intimate with you anymore. I love you, but I’m not in love with you and I don’t want to get married any time soon. I don’t even know if I’m the marrying type. I’ve changed over the last year. I want to be single again.”
I was in every sense of the word, dumbfounded. I told her that you didn’t even look into therapy, you didn’t try to express what you’d been feeling to me, in short, you did nothing! The very definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! This was not making an effort to restart a relationship. She said that she couldn’t afford therapy and she didn’t want to take my money for it, she didn’t want to feel indebted to me any more than she already did (See the parallel for the convertible rental in Key West). I had paid for half of her U-Haul and the gas for the last leg of her drive out to my house. And her Crossfit membership. She didn’t say anything then. Her parents had divorced when she was 14, and since then had always had trouble with money. I think the control over her own finances was a deep-seated issue for her. She felt I was giving her charity, but I just wanted us to work. I was putting in the effort.

So I told her that I wasn’t going to try to change her mind anymore, and that if she wanted it this way, she could have it. She proceeded to ask me if she could stay at the house until a wedding that we were both invited to in October. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? Um, no. “I know, I don’t know why I asked because I know that it was selfish.” Whoa…Followed up with “Can you help me move out?” Um….no. I cried a little bit, was generally a bit pathetic, but I packed my bag to stay with my parents that night. I couldn’t look at ther. I hugged her and said goodbye on the front porch of my house and turned and didn’t look back as I drove away. That’s the last I’ve spoken to her. Her dad bought a ticket for the same sister to fly out on that Wednesday to Atlanta to rent a U-Haul and drive back. Her sister was pissed.

Those two nights at my parents I was in total shock/denial. It was so fucking weird that she was in MY house while I was at my parents. She texted me a few logistical things, and I wrote her an extremely long rambling e-mail (not unlike this post ) on Tuesday night basically chronicling the best times I had with her. I ended the e-mail by saying, I don’t know why I just wrote that, I guess I was hoping that I might say something that would change your mind. I guess I was all over the map. 

She wrote me back saying that she loved me and she missed me, but she need to do this. She wanted to see me before she left. That she knew she needed help at that she was going to get it. She said that I was the best part of her life over the past 5 years. WTF?!? I’m still lost to this day. She wrote me another handwritten letter and left it for me when I returned on Wednesday. It basically the same thing except with the addition that “Maybe we’ll find each other again someday” I think that’s way too out of the movies. Also, she said that she would still like it if I came to the wedding I discussed earlier, so she’ll be back in Atlanta in a few weeks.

Just a little bit of irony as I wind this down. My new company’s headquarters are in Dallas (A part of the reason I chose to leave my old company, in case she wanted to move back to Dallas to start a family in the future). That Thursday morning I had to fly out to HQ for their annual meeting so I could meet some people before I started work. So Riley had stayed in my house without me as she packed her things Monday through Wednesday. And then I flew to her hometown, literally over her head, on Thursday, as she was driving back. That flight was fucking terrible.

So now here I am. I haven’t texted or spoken to her for about 3 weeks. I unfriended her from facebook so I didn’t see any posts she may make. Her mom wrote me an email saying how sorry she was about everything, that she thinks the world of me and wished me the best. That hurt, I already thought of her as Mom. Her sister reiterated her feelings about her sister being a dumbass. It’s embarrassing for me to have to tell everyone that she moved out after I told everyone that she moved in. I had even planned a surprise party for her that I had to cancel. It hurts every time I have to have that conversation.

I’m depressed, and I’m thinking about seeking help. I want to get established in my job over the next week or so, and then I’ll start looking in to it. I don’t know what the next step in my life is, and I don’t like it. I feel like someone stole my best friend, and that my best friend betrayed me all at the same time. Riley and I have so much in common. She’s the only girl I know that will go to a Phish concert, a Tool concert, Bonnaroo, kick the soccer ball in the park after drinking scotch and water, and take all of Sunday to sit down and watch the RedZone channel all day while talking Fantasy Football shit. Oh, and she’s hot.

Reddit, what have I done for the past 4 years? Am I doing the right thing now? Will she ever come back? When should I call her, or should I let her call me? I want to get over her and I don’t. Any comments? Thank you all so much if you could stand my incredibly self-centered post. I think that getting this all down on paper has helped me.

**TL;DR** Guy meets girl at work. Guy is fat, girl is not. Guy starts losing weight when girl kicks his but into gear. Guy falls in love, but girl keeps him in the friend zone. Guy and girl become best friends. Guy gets out of the friend zone. Girl says she may not be ready for a relationship. Guy and girl get into a great relationship anyways. Girl gains some weight. Girl says she wants to marry the guy, and guy feels the same. Guy and girl hate their job, and girl decides to get an MBA in a different city. Guy stays at job after promotion. Girl moves away. Guy loses more weight. Girl kisses a foreign guy, guy forgives her. Girl starts becoming more distant towards the end of her schooling. Girl can’t make a decision on where she wants to work or live. Guy presses her for this, and she gets more distant. Girl gets a job in her hometown. Girl wants to end it. Guy asks her to try to make it work and get counseling. Girl moves to guys hometown. Girl moves out after 11 days.

I'd like to thank everyone again for putting up with me when I just started out.  I'm now up to 2 pistols and a .22 rifle, and am looking to go a little bigger.

For ""serious"" rifle calibers, from my limited research it seems that an AR15 would be great from a budget perspective due to 5.56 and .223 being rather cheap.  This would most likely NOT be a hunting gun, so I'd be fine with that caliber.  Seems like it's sort of the 9mm of rifle cartridges, would that be an adequate comparison?

On the other hand, there's the Mosin, which I could pick up at a gun show next month.  Seems like it's a no-brainer, and I've quite enjoyed shooting my friend's.  Are there any other, lesser-known ""great buys"" that I should be aware of?

I'm a college student, so ammo costs are of concern (it's the main reason I'll have to skip getting a 1911 for now, since 9mm exists...).  That's where the AR platform seems to have its drawbacks.

Lastly, can anyone link me to some great reading material or even forums regarding rifles?  I'm sort of getting lost with all the calibers/manufacturers etc., which didn't seem to be a problem when I first started looking into handguns.  I currently read The Firing Line and The High Road.

As always, thank you gunnit!

Oh, I almost forgot.  I'm currently working a programming/research internship, and decided to live at home until the Spring semester to save up as much money as possible to get me the rest of the way through college.  Now my mother only allows me to have my .22 rifle in the house, she doesn't even know that I carry (I guess that's why they call it concealed carry ;)).  It's a stupid situation to get myself into in the first place, but do any of you have any advice on how to deal with it?  I somewhat recently started introducing my father to shooting and he loves it, but my mother wears the pants rather decisively, so he probably won't be much help.


Thanks, and sorry for the novel.

I discovered some serious design flaws in a few of the applications I was supposed to patch. These were not little mistakes, they were serious flaws that WILL cause trouble in the future and end up costing the company a substantial amount of money. 

I gave my boss a long list of all the issues I saw in the current applications and he just laughed at me. He said, ""You shouldn't care about good design, just follow the design document you were provided. Even if you know the design is bad.""

I thought that was crazy and that no one else in the office could think the same thing. I asked around and it seemed everyone had the same sentiment. I shouldn't care about the design, I should just follow orders. Note: This is not just because I'm an intern. My boss is tells that to everyone.

Needless to say, I am scared about my future here at the company. I want to get out of here as soon as I can.

What are some red flags you've seen in a job that made you realize you needed to get out of there?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all your responses. I still have a lot to learn in my field. My boss just came and talked with me about the list I provided him. He said after he looked at the list, he thinks they are a serious issue and we should fix most of them. No idea what caused his sudden change of heart."
zvmim,1,2012-09-14,"Never in a million years could I see myself posting here. See no future, no alternatives, I don't want to, but I feel like I have no choice.",cantthinkofanything7,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zvmim/never_in_a_million_years_could_i_see_myself/,"Nobody can know who I am. Please don't try to figure it out; it's probably possible. 

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

zvm8e,18,2012-09-14,For all you job hunters out there...,petraman,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/zvm8e/for_all_you_job_hunters_out_there/,"I've had multiple posts in this sub about the pains of finding a job as a recent graduate, which has really brought me down in the past couple months.  It almost seemed like I'd never get a job, especially in this economy...  However, a trip to a job fair last week gave me a ton of insight on how to get a job as a recent grad.  This would probably apply to others as well.

Positivity goes SUCH a long ways when it comes to getting a job.  An employer can easily see the lack of self confidence and negativity present in a prospective employee.  If you don't have self confidence, you'll never be able to defend and sell yourself to your full potential.  So, maybe you're thinking ""well screw you, I'm not a positive guy, how am I supposed to do that?""  Well, we are a pony sub after all...  Go watch ponies!  Listen to happy music before a job fair!  Dream about all the great interviews you'll get and pump yourself up!  Go into it thinking that the world is your oyster and you're just about to open it up and find the pearl inside.

Look at your weaknesses and find a way to twist them into positives.  For example, I don't have an internship, which in engineering is a big no-no and is hard to get around.  However, I've gotten around it twice at the job fair yesterday, and it was pretty easy to do so.  Instead of focusing on the internship, I focused on my other strengths.  How my leadership experiences running clubs and forums have helped shape me not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well.  Also, think about why the employers are worried about a weakness and what you can substitute as a defense for that weakness which will make you stand out.  Have a bad GPA?  Instead of focusing on that, focus on the courses you did well in and how that would apply to the company.

Also, makes sure you look at the SMALLER companies.  Sure, they may not be dream jobs, but they can certainly lead to them.  They're more accepting and personal and, from the people I've talked to, a lot of them are much better to work for just starting out.  A lot of larger companies treat you like a number just starting out...  and smaller companies would be much more willing to learn about YOU instead of just your GPA and internship work.

Look into the companies you're looking at and do some research.  Mention that research in your cover letters or when you're talking to them at career fairs so that you seem interested.  Also, ask a LOT of questions about the position.  Interest in the position perks the ears of HR up, since they know you're serious about working there.

You can do it.  I have faith in you.  All you need is positivity and a new outlook on your job search.  Sure, I might not have a job yet, but I'm now confident that I can find something in the near future because I know what I can provide to a company.  Good luck!"

Any good sites to look at for reputable rooms? We check out Craigslist and Padmapper regularly.

[Thanks for doing this Rep. Ellison!  I am one of your constituents (Fightin' 5th!\) and am wondering how much the political landscape has changed in the last 10 years since you took office in the MN house and then the US house.  I voted for you in 2006 and remember how much attention you got when you swore in using a Qur'an.  Are people still making a big deal out of your religion?  Has it been difficult to get people focus on the issues, like social benefits and tax policy reform, because of your diverse background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lvrk?context=5)|Thanks for the question. Things have changed a lot since i began serving in Congress. We're out of Iraq, which is one of the issues I campaigned on. We have a Health Care law that will offer great benefits to people. When I started, it was only a hope.  We went thru a massive financial collapse, and then passed major reform.  When I started in Congress, I never dreamed GM and Chrysler would fail. not only did they fail, the American people picked them back up, and now both are hiring and thriving. When I entered Congress, Obama was an IL state legislator. Now he's President. Also, perhaps most threatening, Citizens United became the law of the land, and it's perverting our politics in a way none of us have ever seen before. So, many changes have occurred. At the end of the day, one thing remains the same: for working Americans to have a better quality of life, we have to organize, come together, and call for a new politics of inclusion and generosity.  
[Do you feel that, as a Muslim, you and your family are watched more closely by your local media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lotn?context=5)|No, i feel that my family and i have been treated with respect and fairness. i know many people who have reported unfair treatment, and disrespectful treatment, but that has not been my experience. also, in cases where there has been bigoted or hateful treatment, interfaith groups have stepped forward. for example. when Terry Jones protested in Dearborn to incite against the Muslim community there, a multitude of people of all faiths stood and said ""no.""  so, thanks for asking and please go out and build interfaith understanding.
[I was at OccupyMN and remember seeing you visit the plaza. Would you agree or disagree with this statement ""Money Out Of Politics""? and generally would you support the freedom to protest in the plaza again this year in the same manner? (Will we see you again this year if there is another large turnout at the plaza?\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mb2x?context=5)|Yes, we need to get money out of politics. Let's do a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizen United. And also, let's publicly fund campaigns. In the meantime, let's pass Disclose Act; so, at least we know who's messin' with our elections. I really admire those Move to Amend guys. Sure, I will be happy to hang with the people on the plaza again. 
[What was it like to be on Colbert's Better know a District?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lrz3?context=5)|Colbert is a cut-up, isn't he?

[As an absentee Uptown voter, thank you.  Question: Do you think debt reduction is important, and what, if any, measures would you support?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lyh3?context=5)|Yes, debt reduction is very important. The real issue is how to address it. In the short term, it's more important to get people working. I prefer a major public works program, especially given that we have trillions in unmet infrastructure needs for schools, bridges, power grids, and transmission lines.  But we have a long term debt problem, and it will take a combination of spending cuts and new revenue to fix it.  Dramatic cuts now would cause the loss of public sector workers which increases unemployment.  Four features of any sensible debt reduction: invest in jobs to get more taxpayers to help shrink the debt, increase revenue by closing loopholes and asking the most well-to-do to do a little more, defense must share in the cuts, and finally protect social security, medicare, and medicaid.

And how many other members share your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m24j?context=5)|Citizen United is bad bad bad. let's repeal it. see earlier answer.

OK, enough people (even personal emails) asked me to come by. I'll take any excuse to procrastinate from writing.

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.
Although, I will say that when she was guest starring on the show, I was in love with Linda Cardellini. She thought I was too young for her. Boo.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus, I'm joking. No one was an asshole.

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel, etc.). So they went a different direction.

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

5. Maybe, but I guess I don't think there's much point in dwelling on it.
But you're kind of perpetuating the assumption behind your question by not asking what we're up to nowadays.
I'll tell you anyway. ;)
Danielle has been doing a lot of hosting (The Dish) while going to college, and is now doing an MSN show called Last Night on TV: http://tv.msn.com/last-night-on-tv/ She's on twitter here: https://twitter.com/daniellefishel
Ben went to Stanford and is now doing indie films and writing. He is also on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BenSavage
Will is the king of voice over work. Currently, he's Lion-o on Thundercats (he's also writing for the show).
I'm having dinner with Danielle tonight. Maybe we'll post a photograph.

Assuming this is Danielle because of her tweet.

Okay, got a lot of requests for this from twitter! Rider and I are going to start a thread together later but for now, I thought I'd answer these questions.

1. I dated Matthew Lawrence for a little bit when we worked together but other than that, we all felt like family. I did have a crush on every single one of those boys at one time or another though. How could I not?!

2. Honestly no one was an asshole. Even all of the guest stars we had were fun, cool, easy to get along with people. If there was any ""asshole drama,"" I wasn't aware of it.

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

4. Rider and Ben were always good friends. Watching them act in scenes together is one of my favorite memories. Seeing them put together the boy band dance they used to do every week for the live audience was even better! ""Backstreets back, alright!!"" I laugh just thinking about it.

5. I don't think my career has suffered, per se. I wouldn't have a career w/o BMW and Topanga so I won't ever complain. Do I think it's hard for people to accept us as anything other than the roles we played on the show? Yes. But I'm just happy people even care after all these years. :)

P.S. Make sure you follow Rider on twitter (@onthestorm). He is incredibly smart, talented, and funny. The work he is doing now (writing, directing) is exceptional and he also has amazing book recommendations. Click on his links when he posts them...check out what he's doing now. You'll be happy to know that it's just as awesome as what he did on BMW."
zusfb,2,2012-09-13,"Girlfriend (19) left for Australia, and dumped me (22) two weeks later. Need advice. ",Saius418,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zusfb/girlfriend_19_left_for_australia_and_dumped_me_22/,"My girlfriend (19, now 20) and I (22) had been in a relationship for over 8 months. It was somewhat unexpected; we both just fell in love with each other. We had met at college last August, the both of us being on the crew team. I was on my way out - I graduated this May. She was just starting, although she was already ahead - she had tested out of her first year (academically) of college. 

A few months into our relationship, she was accepted into our college's study abroad program at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I was very excited for her - I had been on a study abroad program at the same age and time she was going on hers. I had gone to Germany for mine, and it seemed so amazing that she was taking the extra leap and going even further!

We knew that this trip would mean that we would be far apart from each other. However, we weren't too worried about that. We had already spent some time in a long distance relationship. Although we met and went to college in Kentucky, I am from New Jersey, and she is from Washington (the state). We had spent our breaks/holidays apart, which went very smoothly, and without issue. We missed each other a lot, but it didn't stop the love we had for each other. 

I graduated in May, and then moved up to Washington DC for my internship. Our relationship continued, even through that. Before she left in July, she came to DC and visited. We spent about a week together, and then two days later, she boarded the plane to Australia. 

We didn't talk for a few days. Her computer wouldn't connect to the Internet, so I didn't hear from her until she got her phone. She was fine, and it turned out she was the only one from our college there. She was starting to meet other Americans, and of course, Australians. 

But then the partying started. At first, this didn’t bother me. We partied at college, we both drank, and we were both pretty social people. But then she started telling me about what she was doing. She took part in a wet t-shirt contest, which she won, but in the process was humiliated by four drunken men who pour their drinks on her. She took part in a jelly-wrestling contest. The University had “zero week” which is a weeks worth of university sanctioned partying and drinking (unheard of in the US) which involved drinking every night, and on one night, a lockdown in her dorm which involved naked drinking games. 

I asked her the basic question: why? She summed it up like this – if you aren’t drinking, no one will talk to you. I told her that I thought that idea was ridiculous, telling her that she is an individual and should have to bow down to peer pressure. I should add that we did not raise our voices or argue. 

The following day, she called and said we needed to break up. She said that she didn’t “want to hurt me.” I was absolutely devastated. We talked about it the following two days after. Through those conversations, we established we would still be friends and still talk to each other. This was also confirmed via Facebook message. 

We’ve been broken up since July 20th. The first week was incredibly rough. I missed a day of work, didn’t sleep and barely ate. It’s gotten a little better over time. The advice my friends and family gave me has helped. But, I still love her. I still want to be with her. Even through all of this, I still would never have a second thought about her. 

We’ve talked occasionally since the break up, but we haven’t talked in a few weeks. Word has reached me through her sister that she is now considering dual citizenship in Australia after two months. This hurts even more. 
I’m at my breaking point with all of this. I don’t know what to do. 

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend went to Australia, got caught up in the party scene, and dumped me because of it. This leads me to the following questions:
1: Is the University of Newcastle like this all the time? Does anybody know anything about this place? Should I have expected this at this university from the beginning? 
2: Should I remain committed to this? It seems like all that happened is that she got caught in the wrong crowd.
I’m more than willing to answer any questions if this doesn’t paint a clear enough picture.

Edit 1: Formatting and Grammar

**Update:** We finally talked again. It took about a month, but she finally picked up the phone and explained why she would not call. She is no longer interested in me. She felt that my actions during the break up and prior to it (during the relationship) resulted in her losing interest. Apparently this loss of interest started in late April. 

So, on my end, I'm living with two opposite mindsets at the moment. One side of me still strongly desires to be with her and repair the relationship. She meant the world to me, and losing he is one of the worst feelings in the world. But, the other side of me is very excited about the future. I've realized that someone who would wait until she was on the other side of the world to dump me, instead of in person, is *not* someone I want to be with. I've realized that I made mistakes during the relationship, but I'm glad that I know those mistakes now, and that I can work to correct them.

Thank you all so much for your help, and a really big thank you to all the Redditors either from or have been to Australia. I'm not typically one to hate on people because of their nationality, but if it wasn't for you all, my anger over the situation would certainly have brought me to that point. Thank you so much for bringing me back down to Earth and helping me realize that it's not the people around her, *it's her*. "
zxt36,5,2012-09-15,Am I[30m] being too needy with my girlfriend[24F]? Please tell me I am....,Iluvpeanutbutter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zxt36/am_i30m_being_too_needy_with_my_girlfriend24f/,"This is a throwaway and a word of caution, this is going to be a really long read. To anyone who actually goes out of their way to read this and respond, thank you. I feel like I’m going crazy, and I need someone to tell me that I’m either a) over reacting /being a pansy and need to man the fuck up and am too damn needy or b) have every right to be worried. 

My girlfriend was a foreign exchange student studying English that I met here (we’re both the same nationality and I’m fluent in both languages so there isn’t any miscommunication in language). She had a boyfriend when she first moved here but she broke it off with him a few months in. She told me she felt nothing when breaking it off with him, but he obviously still had feelings for her. We’ve been together for 8 months, we got together about 2 months after she broke up with her ex.  Right off the bat I know some of you might say “oh, you were a rebound.” But the things she left with me, the gifts she personally made me, and the things she said to me make me feel that she did everything with sincerity. There’s also a possibility that she used me to be shown around the city, taken to places etc, but if she did, she deserves an award for best actress.  Another important note - she tells me that her mother cannot know that she had/is in a relationship with someone in the States if she ever wants to come back here. There are no picture of us together or even a single picture of me on her Facebook. She asked if I wanted the pictures uploaded, I said no. I still feel like I'm being hidden for reasons unknown....

She returned back home to her country 6 weeks ago. I thought she was going to go home and never return so I just wanted to treat it as a fling, but before she left she kept telling me she was going to come back and find a job here as after graduating school(this December) and asked me to wait for her. So the relationship continues…. 

We are on an 18 hour time difference so it makes things somewhat difficult. For the first 4 weeks after she returned, she didn’t have school so we talked/texted a lot, from when I finished work until I went to sleep(around 5-6 hours a day).  She would text me when she would be on the subway/bus, while she was walking on the street, call me when she would get home from going out with her friends etc etc. 3 weeks ago her grandfather got deathly ill, as in the doctors tell her and her family everyday, “he might pass today” ill.  She is, to this day, by his side every moment she’s not studying or in school (from what she says).

One week into her grandfather’s illness, the texting didn’t exactly stop, she was able to text me/call me even though she was by his side, but sometimes the messages would pause because people would come visit or she had to be with her family etc, and she then started to respond to messages the following day. Then school started two weeks ago and the contact dropped off a cliff. Within the past two weeks there were days when we’ve exchanged a message just once. This past week there was a time when she couldn’t respond, it turns out her mom was so stressed out about the grandfathers illness that even she had to be omitted to the hospital. She apologizes profusely, saying she’s extremely busy taking care of her grandfather, going to school, studying for tests (work related, and school related), and busy writing her resume and applying for internships so she can gather experience and come back here. She’s busy, I understand that. But a handful of times and yesterday she had time to comment on Facebook pictures and post a status update saying she was sick of studying. She didn’t do this before; she would contact me first before anything else. 

Her and her ex have the same best friends, they’re in the same social circle. Sidenote *She never told me his name but when she was still in a relationship she put up a facebook link regarding her boyfriend with her boyfriend tagged in it. So I know his name. * She was worried about going back home because she told me before school started that it would be quite awkward around her ex, that she didn’t really want to talk/see him. Also her ex is in one of her classes and the same film club (she told me this before hand). On the first day of school she told me that around 100 of their friends/classmates got together and made the two of them promise to “get along.” I have no problem with her spending time with her ex (as long as other friends are there) and it’s pretty much inevitable since they share the same friends. 
Here’s why I’m a little worried. A week before school  began she told me she went drinking with her “Bestest Friends,”  and her ex was tagged at the location on Facebook. I find it weird that SHE TAGGED HIM after telling me countless time how awkward seeing him would be. Maybe her other friends brought him along and she felt bad tagging them and not him. I don’t know. 

She obviously doesn’t know I know his name, so we talked on the phone the day after and she told me she went drinking with her best friends. She never mentioned her ex being there. I tried to give her a chance to let me know he was by saying, “you’re going to see your ex at school soon, aren’t you nervous about seeing him?” she said that HER FRIENDS said that, “he’s okay now,” and that “there would be no more problems.” I just threw out there, “so this is the first time you’ve seen your ex since you got back right?” She replied “yeah.” I understand some girls keep things like this from guys, with the reason usually being, “I thought you would be angry,” but it irks me a little. Side note *My best friend broke up with his girlfriend of a year because she didn’t tell him a male friend that liked her was hanging out with her and I told this story to my girlfriend when she went back to her country. A very similar situation to mine at the moment so I understand that my girlfriend might have been a little scared to tell me after that story.*

Anyway, there were a few more times when she and her ex were tagged(not her update) in the same location but she swears she was at the hospital, that her friends tagged her in spirit because she’s always stuck there and feel sorry for her that she can’t go out. It does seem somewhat true as there are never pictures of her at the location but pictures of others. A few days ago, she uploaded a picture with 3 busted cell phones (her iphone looks like a truck ran over it, it’s been like this for months) and one of cell phones was her ex’s (he was tagged on it, SHE tagged HIM). She still tells me she doesn’t hang out with her ex and again, she’s too busy to contact me. 

The messaging system we use lets us know if the other has read a message, before she wouldn’t read them if she wasn’t able to respond but would respond after reading them. For about the past week or so, she’s been reading them but not responding until the next day saying again, “I was sooo busy.”  I asked her to call me two days ago when she had time, she said “okay!!!” but has yet to do so. 

I guess here’s my question, am I being too needy? She’s extremely busy, I can see that, but if she has an hour time on public transport everyday going to school, if she has time to check facebook and look at pictures and comment on them, if she has time to take pictures and tag her ex, if she has 4 hour breaks in between classes some days, am I being too needy in wanting a “hello?” during those times instead of an “I’m so sorry I was busy” the next day or a couple of days later? And then wait another day for the same ""I'm so sorry I was busy,"" response? I've never had a time where there has been this little communication with a girlfriend, then again, I’ve never been in a long distance relationship with such distance.  

What should I do? I see two ways in going on about this, 1) ask her what has changed, i.e. you still ride the subway/bus to school for an hour, stay next to your grandfather with your phone in hand, have hour long breaks in between classes, have time to upload photos  and update status on Facebook, why no contact? 2) Just laugh it off, she’s stressed enough as it is, and respond with “don’t worry, I know you’re busy.” 

Thanks folks, I need to get this off my chest.  My friends tell me to just “talk to her,” but it’s difficult to communicate with someone that I literally can’t get in contact with.  

TL;DR - girlfriend is saying she is too busy to contact me with school,work,taking care of a deathly ill grandfather after returning home to her country but has time to be on Facebook and tag her ex boyfriend who she still tells me she doesn't hang out with because she doesn't know I know his name. Facebook ruins relationships.

Edit - TL;DR

For the past 3 years my mother has grown more and more abusive towards me. All my siblings have moved out of the house and my father is always working; Leaving just me and my mother home most of the day. She is 59, i'm 19. I'm a full time pre-med student who commutes to school, i also have a job along with an internship. My mother spends her free time bullying me to no end. Her goal from morning till night is to convince me I'm: Dumb, wimpy, lazy, a ""sissy"", pathetic, ""i sleep too much"", and i'm a failure. Shes a small old lady with bad arthritis, yet she constantly slaps me in my face, kicks me in my shins, hits me various objects, throws various objects, and pounds on the door to my room.

Basically my mom is a malicious bully who 24/7 is in attack mode. I've pleaded with her to stop treating me this way. She rationalizes her extreme behavior by saying ""This is the way you deserve to be treated"", because of my mothers age she constantly needs my assistance to do basic tasks (work the tv, use the computer, carry groceries out of her car) She takes advantage of this by demeaning me the entire time i'm helping her, and because of guilt, i have to carry on helping her and take it.


My mom has bad arthritis and knows i would never hurt her physically, she takes advantage of this by constantly getting in my face, (then she'll slap me or kick me)


Backstory: My mother has been sick her entire life, but has always been very lucky, and always had an amazing attitude about it. She first got breast cancer, but she received a double mastectomy immediately and was fine. 5 years later she gets ovarian cancer, has her ovaries removed and was completely fine and completely happy. 4 years later her kidneys begin to fail (caused by doctors malpractice) She began dialysis (still happy and loving as ever). But then she received a kidney transplant and everything changed.


Upon coming home from her kidney transplant my mother had developed this evil rotten attitude. Since the surgery her personality has changed. She is on a ton of meds and I'm afraid these have changed her brain chemistry. (just assuming but whatever).
My mother has had an amazing life, wealthy upbringing, loving successful children, loving grandkids (she has 6 little ones). She spends most of her days shopping. and doing whatever she wants. my father is very loving towards her. (he has always worked ridiculous hours, so this hasnt negatively affected their long 40 yr relationship)
Additional info: I've noticed my mother only bullies me and my grandmother (her mother). the first 2 years she desperately tried to hide her crazy tendencies from the rest of the family, and would only lashout in private. Now she can't really control herself and the cats out of the bag. No one really cares to fix her probelm because no one has to deal with it except me, and occasionally my grandmother. everyone just kinda shrugs it off, blaming her age. everyone just tells me to be strong and not to let her bother me.


Also, this has been happening for 3 years, but it has gotten worse this past year, only because we have moved into a new home, our old home had many stairs and it was easy for me to keep my distance from her. Also sound didnt travel far in our old house. In our new home, there are less stairs and sound carries much easier throughout the house.


SHe takes advantage of this by coming and pounding on my door when ever she feels. ""Just to see what i'm up too"", she'll also talk badly about me, to herself, knowing i'll be able to hear her.
She also comforts herself using projection. she's beginning to lose her hearing, so her new thing is that she's trying to convince me i'm deaf.
when she first came home from her kidney transplant, her short term memory and vocabulary became absolutely terrible. I didnt mind because i know she's been through alot, but she began doing everything in her power to convince me i'm an idiot.


I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!
If i stick up for myself i feel terrible because i hate yelling all day, if i take her bull shit, i feel terrible for not sticking up to myself. This is ruining my self confidence and just fucking with my head...

**Edit: Should i go through her meds, figure out what she's taking, then mention to her that she should speak to her doctor about this drug?** The odds of her following through with this is slim, but if i hammer the idea that a drug is causing this she might follow through, she's extemely irresponsible, and blaming a drug (even though it may actually be a culprit) might be something she'll follow through with."

I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!

I'll be 21 soon and will be done with an Associates in Computer Science. I have some experience from an internship at a local repair shop, and am also currently working on certifications for my preferred field of work ([CCNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA), [A+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2B_certification#A.2B_certification), [Security+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2B_certification#Security.2B), [Network+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2B_certification#Network.2B)).

 I've never been convicted of any crime, and I'd rather not consider an alternate destination since my girlfriend currently lives in Canada (LONG story). How difficult would it be to obtain citizenship for Canada, or live there permanently and keep my current citizenship?


Edit: I don't have to gain citizenship to the country immediately before I enter. I would however like to begin on it while residing in the country permanently."
zwz0u,0,2012-09-15,IAMA PhD Student in Structural Engineering...have gained some decent insight of the program and the field. ,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zwz0u/iama_phd_student_in_structural_engineeringhave/,"I have been in the PhD program for SE for about 1.5-2 years now. I feel like I have an idea of what the program is like, and a vague idea of what to expect from here on out. I also have internship experience. I believe that I have an idea of how one should approach their time as an undergraduate engineering/CS student and beyond, and I would like to share my experiences with anyone who is interested. Feel free to AMA.

When I first started, I had NO idea what to expect or what I eventually wanted to do. My current research is radically different from anything I ever expected to do. That being said, I think it has been a great experience so far, and now it all seems to be coming together.

All this aside, I honestly feel that my education is incomplete. Although I am learning great things and delving deeply into my field, I feel that my knowledge in other fields (economics, biology, history, philosophy, english/literature) remains underdeveloped. I am currently trying to find a way to ""bring balance to the force"", if you will, and try to learn as much as I can beyond what my degree can offer. If anyone has some opinion on that, please feel free to share that as well :)

I don't know how I can prove that I am who I say I am (is it really needed in this case?). If you have any suggestions as to how I can provide proof, please let me know. I'd rather keep my name/location/institution/research a secret, if you don't mind."
zwxxu,1,2012-09-15,Need help resisting,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/zwxxu/need_help_resisting/,"Hi.  I need help resisting, and I'd appreciate any material to help motivate me to resist (drug addiction documents or adverse effects of smoking, stories, etc.)

If I get caught smoking marijuana I'll be kicked out of the house, with no means of providing for myself.  I am completely dependent on my parents for the time being and I just can't afford for that to happen.  My sister is currently ""kicked out of the family"" and my family means just that: no house, no financial support, nothing.  My family will at times be suspicious, it can be anything and sometimes not even substantial, like me being irritated and my uncle threatens to drug test.  The last time this happened was two months ago.  I was playing too much Diablo3 so my uncle suspected I'm smoking weed. I confessed to having smoked a spliff,  and my uncle hasn't mentioned it to my father, but if the suspicion arises again and I can't pass a drug test, my life will be over.  So the consequences of smoking are severe for me.

I find that on my own, I'm completely able to resist.  The temptation comes from time to time but I just ignore it.  On my own, I'd already be two or three months clean.  

The problem is when my brother is around.  He's more of an addict than I am.  At times he says he's done with it, or when I tell him I regret having done it, he says he's going to stop as well, but he never does.  When it's available just one door down from me, when it's right there, accessible and everything, I have a hard time resisting.  After that last incident with my uncle, I went three weeks without smoking until my brother and I went on a trip together.  First thing he did was get more weed and I joined him in it, thinking ""one more week of this won't hurt.""  We were both planning on quitting after the week was done, and called it our last shabang.  He is going to go to a medical internship in October, and he wants to end the habit before that happens.  

But then when we got back in town, he wanted to get more.  I had a hard time stopping as well, but then I stopped when he left town.  Then he came back in town and there it was again.  He left on Wednesday to go do some things out of town, and I haven't smoked since then.  Today he returned, with 5g of herb.  I'm sitting in my room, actively resisting.

The better part of me knows I can't be engaged in that kind of thing.  The consequences are too high to warrant the high that weed gives me, and I'm fine without it.  The sooner I can test clean on a drug test, the better.  When I'm independent again, I can reassess it.  However, I end up justifying it each time in the past, and I don't want it to happen again...thinking ""ok, one more dance with mary jane and then I'm going to stop..."" or ""...my uncle hasn't brought it up in some time, I can probably get away with it"" or ""if I do it just for two nights, it should be out of my system within two weeks...I probably won't get tested in two weeks"" or my best one: ""He's never actually taken me to get a drug test...I've just confessed each time he wanted me to go do it (and got in a load of shit).  Maybe if I don't confess, he won't actually test me..maybe it'd be hard for him to...his daughter smokes all the time and he has threatened to test her but he never has and she keeps on smoking.""  But that's a lot of risk to take, and I can't afford to be kicked out of my family.  It'd just be a lot easier if everyone around me didn't smoke, but that's not going to happen.

So, please, anything that can encourage me to resist while amidst it would be of great help.  Thanks.

EDIT:  TL;DR: Need help resisting weed when it's easily available every day."
zwqg5,1,2012-09-14,Student teaching semester leads to worst time of my life.  Stick with it or change jobs / careers again?,storyblue,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwqg5/student_teaching_semester_leads_to_worst_time_of/,"I've graduated with a journalism degree years ago.  After a year of not landing a job, I decided to go back to college for a Teacher Education certification and become a school teacher.  

While taking Teacher Education classes, I landed a summer job in a big hotel (I hate it) to try to make a little more money.  They offered it to me full time and even gave me a supervisor position.  The pay wasn't great and most of the time I just dealt with dumbass customer complaints, but I got to supervisor a big staff in multiple departments and looked neat on a resume.

Well now I'm in the final semester of the teacher education program, where I become a student teacher under the mentorship of an experienced teacher.  She runs the classroom for the most part, but I start out slow, get involved, get my feet wet, and then eventually I take control of the classroom myself for many weeks. 

Unfortunately because of the demand of what is essentially a teaching internship, I made the hard decision to quit my hotel job.  

I regret it.  My mentoring teacher is a bully with a huge chip on her shoulder.  Her temper makes her very difficult to communicate with, let alone get any advice from her.  This particular week took its toll on me when the last comment she gave me caused me to walk into an office and cry in front of some unsuspecting grown men (other teachers).  She's a great teacher in front a students, but she is not very good as a colleague.  I think I maybe not putting in more effort than I should, but I'm still just learning.  It just sucks feeling so isolated.

Even while I was unemployed, I kept positive.  Now I'm more depressed than I ever remember.  I don't think I want to become a teacher any more, and not just because of my bad experiences with the mentoring teacher.  Every day I come home I look for another job to apply to, something as an Editorial Assistant, medical, technical writing or anything to do with publications where my first passion lies.  I now think I don't have what it takes to be a teacher, and even if I learn to be a good, I think it's currently a terrible industry to be in...overworked, low pay, and tremendous abuse.

SO!!!!!:  Do I try to tough it out, turn this around, and stay optimistic for my future as a teacher, despite my faith in the world of teaching becoming broken?  Or should I try for another career?  Should I even bother trying to find a job that can take advantage of my journalism and team management skills?  What do I have to do to become a part of a scientific, technical, or medical publication?  Should I look into it after I get my teaching certificate, or should I just abandon the teaching quest and go back to school yet again?

Sorry if this got a little unfocused, but I'm emotionally drained and I dread the next day I have to go into that classroom.  I just want to give up and try to find something better, but I feel hopelessly under qualified for anything else that's out there.  I could go back to school, but I don't want to return to this same position.

Please help me or offer some advice / insight during the weakest moment of my entire life.

zzrn8,2,2012-09-16,[19/M]How to get a girl back? You can't make up stuff like this(20/F)?[[Pretty Long]],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zzrn8/19mhow_to_get_a_girl_back_you_cant_make_up_stuff/,"This is a TL;DR Post, sorry for not putting it in the title. It's my first reddit post.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl. 

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia. 

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things. 

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though. 

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations. 

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that. 

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned. 

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not. 

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag. 

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession. 

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her. 

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what. 

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it? 

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself. 

Thanks reddit for reading. I wont mind any tl;dr comments, because it is lol. I know I'm still a young guy, but I just don't know what to do.

The intern has been going to a german programming school for a while and can hopefully code his way out of a paper bag, but not much more than fundamental concepts of procedural programming (task-centric) and OO on the level of ""class Car : Vehicle"" have been taught. AFAIK they concentrate on teaching the platform (.NET, possibly php) just as soon as they're through with basic language features. I'll be very lucky if they did much more, maybe he's heard of design patterns and some of the more recently introduced (C#) language features - you get the idea.

I am quite experienced and have a broad knowledge, but i am self-taught so i never went through formal CS education, beyond a casual interest in some lectures. So i really don't know very well where to start.

While i have plenty of actual work i could dump on this guy, i want him to actually have a learning experience here.

What i am looking at is basically putting together a small curriculum, starting with evaluating how much he knows and hopefully fixing some bad habits he no doubt picked up, and then some weeks of sitting down and learning something interesting, with practical industry applications (so haskell is ruled out, sorry guys. =D).

What are your ideas - your own experiences while going from beginner to amateur are appreciated. What did you learn that proved useful, what did you wish you had learned that proved useful later?

Some ideas floating around my head:

- Intermediate level OO - working with established design patterns, their uses and limitations, in C#
- Asynchronous programming
- LINQ, anonymous methods, lambda, yield
- Another language, probably python
- c, so he learns pointer arithmetic etc.

A lot of what will actually happen depends on how he picks it up, so don't go into to much detail. Mostly interested in your most positive and negative experiences."

At times they are downright selfish. I am deeply sorry for any pain I have caused to the people involved. I have learned from my mistakes on a level that is profound and truly heartbreaking to myself as well as to others. Please do not down-vote or lecture me on the errors I have made out of niavity, selfishness or shame, I have already paid (and continue to pay) the price for the consequences of my actions in the real world, as I hope you will understand as you read the story...I'll try to make this as short as possible:


About a year ago I (22/F) moved to a new city with my boyfriend (24/M whom we shall call Brad). We had been together for about 2.5 years and living together in Phoenix. We acted as a team, and hoped to be together for the long haul. But money was constantly an issue, and he resented me for it. I was an intern and worked 80 hours a week, so for over a year and a half we didn't spend much time together. Just before the move, I learned of his (failed) attempts to cheat on me while he was out of town. But regardless of our hardships, we still remained together. I quit my internship and we moved to Austin.


Brad and I quickly made friends with our new neighbors. One particularly caught my attention. We'll call him Aaron (37/M). He first interested me because he was an artist, as am I. He began to teach me things about painting, and we would sketch together frequently. 


One night, when Brad had passed out in a drunken stupor, Aaron and I stayed up until the early morning, partying with the neighbors. As the sun began to rise we found ourselves alone, and he began to hit on me. Naively I tried to ignore it, until finally he made a move. At this point I told him no, that Brad was good to me and that I couldn't betray him. The next day Aaron and I talked about it, and agreed that it was just a drunken mistake, and that there was no reason to acknowledge that it had ever occured. I had Brad, and Aaron started a complicated relationship with a girl that lived in Mexico. But the more I thought about it, and the more time I spent with Aaron the more irresistable he became to me. Eventually we began an affair.


The relationship between Brad and I steadily and quickly deteriorated as I began to realize all the reasons we were wrong for each other, and as I became distant, he became suspicious and clingy. Meanwhile the relationship beteween Aaron and I began to grow. In short I had only known him for two months before he called me, saying that he wasn't sure what to do, because he felt like he was falling in love with both the girl in Mexico, and me. Of course, I had been realizing that I was quicking falling for him as well.


About a month after that, Brad and I broke up, and I moved out. But despite not being able to come around, Aaron and I spent the next 6 months nearly attached to the hip. There were many instances in which we decided we couldn't see each other any more, because his relationship with the girl in Mexico continued. On many occasions, he would become suspicious that I was sleeping with other people (I haven't been with anyone else since Brad and I broke up). We tried just being ""just friends"", but found that it was impossible.


We mostly kept our relationship a secret from the people we knew because many of our friends knew Brad, and because some of them knew the girl in Mexico. He rarely talked to me about his relationship with her, but I knew there were arguments, and she even broke up with him for a short time. Then, he told me he was planning on visiting her. He would be going to Mexico for two months. We both knew that when he did, it would be over between the two of us. He wouldn't have a phone, we wouldn't be able to talk. I wouldn't be able to stand knowing he was there with her. But I was in love with him, and I believed he loved me. I can't explain why I believed him. Anyone reading this has probably assumed I'm just a silly girl, and that he was using me. If I were you, that's what I would think. But there's a look and a feeling that can't be faked. And there's months of evidence that there's no way to put into words.


So, when he left for Mexico, I was heartbroken. I cried for days. I only got out of bed to go to work. I ate very little. And then, he messaged me. He told me that he couldn't get me out of his head. And (although most of our conversations revolved either around the fact that no matter how much we love each other, we can't be together so long as she is a part of his life, or about how much we missed each other) we continued to talk for the rest of his stay there. And when he came back, we were back together as if he had never left.


For the last three months we've been inseperable. We spend every minute we can together, to the point of absurdity. We've worked together, we go to the store together, we go to sleep, and wake up together. We have this beautiful relationship, we work on art, play tag in the middle of downtown, we go to galleries and have wonderful discussions, we cook and clean together, we've been accused of knowing each other too well when we began to finish each other's sentences. Our close friends know about and accept our being together, and really, everything is perfect.


Except that, I am the other woman. His girlfriend doesn't know about me. And soon, she is moving to Austin. Their plan is to live together. His plan is to stop seeing me. In fact he's tried to call it off with a increasing frequency since he's come back, and I've tried to respect that (but we can't seem to stay apart). He tells me that he loves me, but that he loves her as well. And I have to give him props for his honesty, as much as it hurts. Personally, I'm appalled that I find myself in this position. I'm not a cheater, and before I would NEVER have been ""the other woman"". I'm ashamed of myself, and I feel a soul crushing guilt for what I've done, both to the girl in Mexico, and to Brad. Her living a thousand miles away seemed to offer me just enough of an excuse to continue, but I know that my conscious and my jealousy won't allow me to continue to see Aaron when she is actually here. But more than this I know that I love Aaron with all of my heart, and that my heart simply cannot let him go. 


I know that he loves me, and that this isn't just some fling he's using to pass the time. I know that he's conflicted about leaving me. I know that he's afraid of losing me, and also afraid of losing her. I know he's torn in two. These are things I KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt. There isn't any way to explain how I know. What I don't know, is what I should do. How do you give up on someone you love? How hard to you try, how much do you give and how long do you wait, before you do?


**TLDR**: I started having an affair with an older man who had a long distance relationship. We fell for each other, but he also loves her. I truly believe that he loves us both. Soon she will be moving here to live with him. Has anyone out there ever been the ""other woman (or man)"" and it worked out? Does any have any advice?


EDIT: Spell Check.

**Update**: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has offered me advice and *constructive* criticism. I never expected so many people would respond. I appreciate those of you who have offered your opinions without judging me...I do that enough for myself. It appears that the majority of you hold no hope for this twisted relationship, and perhaps you're right."

Right now I'm mostly taking 10mg IR Adderall, but I also have 20mg Vyvanse. I haven't been taking the Vyvanse lately, as when I took it over the summer at my internship it made me feel depressed and anxious. 

On my medicine I feel like I'm never doing enough, and there's always something else that I need to be doing. Everything has to be perfect, and I feel the sudden desire to tackle everything until I burn out. I have also noticed that I feel really compelled to get in contact with people, especially those I've neglected or lost touch with. Since the Adderall isn't a very high dose I always feel the need to pop another one, even if I don't need really to. 

I'm really used to feeling strange on meds (I've tried them all) but I don't like the way they make me feel. I eat and drink a lot of water while taking them, this doesn't really seem to help. I cannot concentrate without my medicine, and the side effects make me very hesitant to take them, despite the fact that I desperately need them. I'm sure I'm not the only one with these feelings, how do you guys deal?

TL;DR: ADD meds make me feel anxious, slightly depressed and over-zealous. I hyper focus on stupid things (both academic and non-academic) and just feel strange over all. How do you guys deal with this? Any personal insight?"

I'm currently studying Finance in college and have never before had the desire/need to learn programming. While working as an intern this summer, I found myself and the other plebes doing mind-numbingly monotonous analysis (primarily sorting/analyzing data, searching trends, and monitoring market activity) day in and day out. After the 10 week program, I considered changing my major.  However, a friend mentioned that I could cut my work-load by almost one half and skip straight to the more interesting part of analytics if I learned some basic computer-programming.  So that's the goal.  Thanks in advance for your help, Reddit!

(Trying to get a job in the rotating equipment field)

Some backstory:

* In my second year, I tried applying for a summer jobs, no response. 

* In my third year, I made a 2 paged resume (I know, breaking all resume rules) and landed a 16 month internship and several other offers. Mentioning my other non-engineering jobs helped me get my internship position (liked the lifeguard role, liked my volunteer job).

* Now, after reading through reddit, I'm worried my 2 paged resume will still turn off some potential employers so I'm wondering if r/engineering can offer some insight on how my new one paged resume is.

TLDR; tried one page resume before and didn't work. Need help on new one 

Edit: Apologies, updated imgur link

**Thanks to everyone for their comments. I'm going use my discretion when applying to individual companies to see how much they value EC's. I've taken my resume down for now (a bit paranoid about having it up for too long on the internet). "

My wife was in Switzerland a few years ago for Christmas, visiting her sister who was doing an internship there. When she came back, she brought some tea from Coop which was some of the best tea either of us had ever had. On the website, it is called: 

&gt;""Coop Früchtetee aromatisiert assortiert 4 Sorten 20 Portionen 50g""/""Coop Assorted Flavoured Fruit Tea 4 Sampler 20 Tea Bags 50g""

[and this is what the box looks like](http://imgur.com/BZmnN).

I've looked high and low online and in town here but no such luck. There's even a Swiss store here that sells a lot of Swiss national brands, but I can't find this stuff anywhere, likely due to it being a in-house brand from a grocery store.

Anyway, I'd love to send some stuff from here (we're pretty well known for maple syrup) in exchange for a large case full of the teas I spoke of and linked above. My wife is pregnant now, and I would love to surprise her with a box of this stuff. Please feel free to contact me! Thanks!"
zyo4n,5,2012-09-16,"I'm an engineering student, how much is too much student loans debt?",Naxili,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zyo4n/im_an_engineering_student_how_much_is_too_much/,"Hi, I'm a third year astronautical engineering student in a five year program at my school. I recently decided to get serious about my financies, so I'm here to talk about student loans. So, here are my numbers:

**Financial Information**

My mother is unemployed, and has no money to assist me with. None. She's last year she made $16,000 (idk how), and she has 4 kids (including me).

The degree program I'm in gives guaranteed jobs in your field, so long as you have your shit together while your in classes. I do in fact have my shit together, so I'll have a guaranteed job at NASA when I graduate, which pays $60,000/year

I'm currently living with my grandparents, and do not own a car.

I'm currently projected to have $75,000 (high estimate) in loans when I graduate.

I am actively pursing all job opportunities open to me, from minimum wage part time jobs, to work study on campus jobs, to summer internships at NASA.

Now, here is my question. Would it be reasonable for me to take out another $30,000 - $35,000 in loans (total) in order to live on my own? 

On the one hand, that would put my monthly loan payments at roughly 25% of my monthly income, up from about 17%. And most places I've seen say don't exceed 10%.

By the way, a good percentage of my loans are private, so income based repayment will only help me but so much.

**Personal Information**

On the other hand, living at home is stressful, to say that least. It comes down to three things, really. First, I'm in a really bad neighborhood (one of the more ghetto parts of Washington DC) and sometimes I don't get back from classes until 10pm. I haven't been mugged or anything similar for 3 years, but as I take more advanced classes I'm starting to get home later and later so I don't know how long that will last. Second, my commute is roughly 3 hours, round trip, which should speak for itself. Third, I'm an LGBT person. Whether or not that disgusts you is irrelevant. It's important to my financial situation in that if my grandparents find out, I'd say there is a 40% chance they kick me out, 60% chance they add an unbearable amount of stress to my life. Both cases would lead to me having to move out before I graduated anyways. It's unlikely that they will find out, but the danger is still there.

Anyway, all of those issues would go away if I could rent an apartment. Now the question is, would that apartment be which the significant loan cost? Clearly I would prefer to move out, but I am unsure as to whether or not loans eating up an extra 25% of my income (or rather, an extra 8%) for 10 years would leave me so unstable financially that I wouldn't be able to live. I think it won't, since...

**Calculations ($/month)**

+$5,000: Income

-$1,200: Loans

-$1,200: Taxes

-$900: Apartment

-$200: Medical

-$200: Transit

-$200: Food

-$200: Misc

= $900"
zyk2m,12,2012-09-16,"Hey Ladies, I need some ""real world"" advice.",domin007,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zyk2m/hey_ladies_i_need_some_real_world_advice/,"So, I'm a commuting college student who still lives with her parents.  I just recently started working for Jumpstart, a program that goes into lower-income preschools and helps provide a quality education for those kids.  Because I'm going to have around 12 hours a week with this job, I asked to only be put on during the holidays at my cashiering job.  However, my parents aren't happy with this and think that I'm not going to get a job during the summer because of this.  

For some background:

*  I'm a Neuroscience major who is taking 3 fairly intensive classes right now, one stupidly easy one and one that unfortunately requires a bit of effort.  I also want some time to see my boyfriend who I don't often see during the week.  I know people can work 30 hours a week and go to school but I'm have a strong need for some non-stressful social interaction.

*  Jumpstart and Big Lots pay the same (I thought my Jumpstart income wasn't taxed but they said it was).  However, Jumpstart is an Americorp program so at the end of my term, I will get a $1175 education award as well as be part of this alumni network.  Heck, I already got a free American Eagle hoodie from there (our team won our pre-job recruitment and I'm not gonna lie, this is the softest hoodie I own).  

*  When I talked to my manager about possibly being on the schedule just one day a week, he said he didn't like that and it would either be no days or two days.  Although 10 hours isn't too bad by itself, you also have to put into account commuting time (which is pretty hefty coming from my college) and that drain of unfulfilling work.  

*  I'm also applying to be a Peer Educator, where I educate people at my college about sexual abuse and rape.  This would cause the same problem as JS with my parents but I want to do this and want to focus on Neuropsych (possibly being a double-major in neuro and psych).  I'd get a stipend and honestly, BOTH of these jobs seem like a much better resume builder than Big Lots.

*  I also realize that I need to talk with our internship office to see if I can get an internship for the summer (plus our college started this guaranteed internship program so I'm theoretically more likely to get one)

What do you guys think?  Should I have ""given up"" my cashiering job or was it impractical of me to do so?  "

I am a recent graduate with a BBA in Accounting &amp; Finance. I have been searching for work since graduating in May and have had little luck. As far as experience goes, I was unable to obtain an internship throughout school due to a heavy academic schedule--between class and extra-curricular activities. I did, however, hold the same part-time position my final three years and a couple of other part-time positions through the same duration--so I do understand what hard work means. I have all of the credentials to acquire my CPA and am considering that path, though not limiting myself to Accounting only. I have a heavy interest in securities, equity, and risk. Also, I am a very naturally analytic person. Furthermore, I am an advanced in all Microsoft Suite applications and hold experience with Peachtree Accounting Software as well as Bloomberg and Factset financial systems. Currently I am located in Kentucky, just south of Louisville. I am available to relocate with assistance/signing bonus.  

Thank you very much for your consideration!"
zyihp,0,2012-09-16,Move across the country and she sent me home,addedpulp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zyihp/move_across_the_country_and_she_sent_me_home/,"This story is mind-numbing, and I hate writing it out... if I leave things out, my apologies. I've talked to friends, and they just say ""what a bitch,"" but this is a brand new side of her. Prior to this, we dated a year and a half and never had so much as an argument. I'm 26, she's 22.

She graduated college and I'm a freelancer. She got a post-college internship at a place... let's just say it's the happiest place on earth. She asked me to come with her, so I found an apartment I could afford, sold the majority of my unneeded stuff, and started applying to gigs in that area. It's about 1000 miles away. She lived 15 minutes away in the resort's ""housing,"" basically dorms with 6 people per apartment, all the same gender (very family directed resort).

It wasn't long after I got there that I got irritated by how little I saw her, maybe two or three times a week, usually nights, and often times she'd fall right asleep. They work them like crazy, so whatever. Then she started dividing her time between me and her new friends. Irritating, but whatever. I saw her less, which only bothered me because she couldn't incorporate me with her friends. I was there 2 months and only met a few in passing when I was at her apartment... which I wasn't allowed at. She said they ""just don't have boyfriends or boys they like over.""

One week, I saw her very little, and on my way back from a gig, I felt nice, well dressed, and decided to surprise her. She said she was just eating dinner. I knocked on the door and she answered, and seemed very startled. She quickly rushed me back to the car, and when I asked to use the bathroom (several hour drive from the shoot), she told me to pee outside, which she would normally not permit. When I left, she texted me ""sorry for being weird, don't think anything of it.""

She had told me about this pushy, douchey guy from work who liked her because she was the only girl with a boyfriend that wasn't infatuated with him, and he got her number from the employee roster and started texting her. She told me as if it were funny, laughable. Well, at the end of the week where I visited and was ushered out, she came over late and fell right asleep, all her stuff on the bed. She keeps getting texts, and I looked. It was a guy's name I didn't recognize. I proceeded to do two shitty things: I skimmed her texts with him. I was looking for a few things. There was no incriminating language, no real flirting, just bullshitting. However, I was never mentioned, which is what a girl typically does when she wants an aggressive guy to go away. And, the biggest issue, they had hung out every night that week, when she was too busy for me. They also hung out at her place, where I wasn't allowed. This included eating dinner, the night I stopped by.

I confronted her. She was half awake and thought I was being silly. She told me he's just a guy from work. I asked what the guy that liked her was named. It was the same guy. I asked if they had hung out all that week. She said she hung out with friends. I asked if he was included. She said sometimes. She repeatedly told me they were never alone (they both have 5 roommates, so no shit), and that they were just friends. I asked why she needed to keep it from me, and she said simply that she thought it'd upset me to know she wasn't spending her free time with me. Fine.

I then noticed a few days later she was logged in on her FB on my computer. I looked at it a few times in the next month. I didn't read her messages, but I did notice a trend. She spent most of her free time with her roommate. There were several occasions where she told me she was with her roommate, and her roommate had posted photos. I could see the ones of the two of them. However, in three different instances, there were other photos where this guy in question was present. I couldn't see those from my account, only hers. They were never in the same photo together. However, if I asked who she was with, she just said her roommates, or, in one instance where she went to the beach, ""6 people"" (which, judging from the photos, was actually her roommate, the guy her roommate liked, and the afformentioned guy).

I tried a half dozen times to talk to her about why she would lie, why she kept things from me, why I never met her friends. She rarely said a word; that's how she is, and I know that from the few instances where her friends back home got upset with her, but had never experienced it.

Over those conversations, all I got is what I already mentioned, and that her coworkers didn't accept outsiders; when she first started, one of her coworkers brought her boyfriend, and they ousted her and the boyfriend completely. I asked if he moved 1000 miles, and she said ""I don't know, no one talked to him."" Fucking children.

She also said that the whole situation, and being in a position where she now has to worry about the real world, makes her have ""doubts."" She couldn't explain them, but she did say that she ""wondered if this relationship was forever,"" which I said was absolutely moronic, because there's no way to tell, especially when you're so royally failing at ""right now."" I asked her repeatedly if she wanted to end it, she said no. She just hated that I was so dependent on her, which I told her she should have expected asking me to move somewhere where I know no one.

So, I came back home. The night before the last night I was there, she told me she was at her place with her roommate, when I had glanced over at her texting earlier that day and saw her roommate's name, the guy's name, and the name of a bar (she's not a bar person, at all). The next morning, she maintained she was just watching TV when I went to bed, but I looked on her facebook the next morning (from her account, isn't visible from mine) and her roommate had posted a picture of them in dresses that said ""before we go out tonight."" I confronted her about it, claiming I noticed the dress in her room, and she said she didn't wear the dress out, and that she never LIED, she just didn't tell me what she did after I went to bed. She almost seemed proud of it, like it was cute. She since changed her fb password, so her fb activity has appeared as if she hasn't been tagged in anything to me since.


I visited from friends. They gave me awful ideas, namely about that guy, or that she intended to send me home so she wouldn't have to end it in person, like a coward. I got furious. I got in the car and drove back to talk to her. About halfway, I realized it was insane, and texted her saying I did a crazy thing that day that I'd tell her about that night. I still had (and have) and apartment there. I showed up, expecting to catch her hanging out with that guy. She wasn't, she said he ""confronted"" her about his ""feelings,"" she said no, and he told her they couldn't be friends. I asked her why she felt building that relationship was acceptable, and she said she thought it was harmless if he didn't get the wrong idea. I told her he must have, and he must have thought I was pretty insignificant, if he thought his plan would work. I later spoke to her best friend about it, and she said she just can't let people down; she tries to make friends out of boys that are after her and it always ends up with a pissed off guy.

I thought that my showing up would shock her into honesty, or at least make her give me some time. Nothing. I spent more time at the coffee shop that weekend using the internet than with her; she went out with her friends several times (granted, she had plans, but I would drop mine if she showed up on my doorstep), and we only ended up actually talking for a few hours. The last night I was there, I took her to dinner, and after she tried to go home. I straight ahead told her that was absolutely unfair, and she made me take her to coffee shop to use the internet because I had mine uninstalled. Absolutely childish stuff; I guess avoidance can go to crazy lengths, or she really felt it insignificant.

I asked her repeatedly if she was intending to break up with me, and sending me home to make it easier. She said no, she just wanted me to have people to hang out with. She then told me she wanted to ""Wait for her"" until her internship was over. I told her I would, but considering all I did and how she treated me, I found it incredibly unfair. All she had to say was she must have only been thinking about the fun we'd have there (which we had little of, since her friends got all her free time) and not the commitment it meant.

So I came back. I've been back about 2 weeks and every day I get upset about something else. We text, that's about it. Lots of texts, but considering she avoids talking about issues, and she's vague about what she's doing socially, there's little to talk about. Every time I get upset (generally because she's out socializing and it reminds me that I had to come home for her to do that without guilt, or because I try to coax out something romantic or sweet and get little back), she tries to tell me she does care, and she is trying, but I tell her words mean little when actions are scarce. Granted, we didn't talk much the month or two before we individually moved down there, but I was moving out of my apartment of 3 years, finishing up work, selling my belongings, etc... and worry makes time go much slower, or I wouldn't be typing this.

I don't even really know what advice I expect. I just had to tell someone that wasn't a friend who says ""what a bitch"" and then gets high. I felt like I was taking a big step in my life and now I'm on a friend's couch. I don't want to split up, but she's really fucked up my trust in her. I hate that, now, every time she goes out, I get angry because I think she might be lying or telling half truths. I get angry that that did nothing and get her in person and I gave everything and get texts. I have the apartment still, and considered asking if she wants me to come back and try fresh now that she's settled, but she keeps telling me to ""build my career"" here, which is one of her ""doubts,"" that I'm 26 and freelancing... but that just infuriates me that she asked me to drop my clients here and then expects me to get them back again that the season is over. I don't know why she's trying to keep it going if she doesn't want me, which she says she does, that she wants to ""miss me."" I have no clue.

TL;DR: Fuck."

Also, I'm a candidate for Beta Alpha Psi (accounting frat) but I'm not a member, should I include that on the resume? In the same vein, I've been invited for Accounting Honors, but I'm not in officially yet, so should I leave that off as well? I also just got a job as a finance intern, but I haven't started work yet, include that anywhere? Also, I started participating in martial arts at the university, include that in a section?

I also studied computer/electrical engineering for two years at uni. I can program a bit in Java/C++ (and yes, more than just ""Hello world!"", and I'm OK with JavaScript (and HTML/CSS), is there any place for that on the resume?

What sort of numbers should I put on the resume to stand out?

I know the ""Objective"" section is controversial, but if I do keep it, should I repeat the job I'm applying for as in this example, or specify it down to ""Obtain tax internship with accounting firm"".

[Have you ever seen any indication that this ""Maria"" is financially exploiting your dad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k3sb?context=5)|Not really. I mean my dad certainly has treated her well and buys her things but nothing too extravagant and she seems like the type of person who doesnt really care about material things. Who knows though, there could be a side of this story im not aware of. She's been nothing but nice to me. I dont have many negative things to say about her other than shes the one who introduced my dad to it. I dont solely blame her for it because my dad made his own decision to believe in these things. 
[I mean, I liked that show ""V"" and all, but there are limits. Is your dad into all that orgone and chemtrail stuff? Can you tell us a little bit more about what your dad actually believes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j9de?context=5)|Yes big believer in that chemtrail stuff. Heres a bit more into what he believes.
 |He believes that the world is run by reptilian humanoids from another dimension that control every aspect of human life.
 |He believes that many high ranking people such as george bush, the queen, etc. are these reptilians.
 |He believes that the world governments are going to come together and create the New World Order.
 |He believes that the NWO will try and get the worlds population down to 500 million for better control over the people.
 |He believes that America will be a police state any time now. ( which I actually somewhat believe to a certain extent)
[He probably knows all about the Georgia Guidestones, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kf7b?context=5)|If those are those messages on the rocks or whatever then yes he showed me those before. Sorry to oversimplify it but im a bit hazy on the details of them. 
[Has your Dad ever tried to y'know, convert you? I can imagine that being a highly awkward conversation. If so, how did you respond? Did you ever give his ideas any credence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j974?context=5)|Yes, he tried to convert me many times. It was honestly the weirdest thing Ive ever experienced the first time he tried. I think most people get the view of their parents as the super responsible and unflappable people and when one of your parents basically starts talking crazy its a very very scary situation. I cant say i ever did give his idea any credence.
[Well you stay strong man, you're right about a person of responsibility completely whacking out on you like that. Naht good.  Still as long as he respects your (sane\) views, then I'm sure you can still enjoy a decent relationship right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jd1x?context=5)|Yea i mean he understands that he'll never get me to believe in it and he respects those beliefs. We talk very rarely but when we do its respectful and i still love him very much and want nothing more than to just have a normal father son relationship. 
[I am not trying to be a dick because I am a huge conspiracy theorist but did your dad have any sudden behavior changes or any signs of neurological problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j1fl?context=5)|Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.
[The dicksense is strong with this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kuu7?context=5)|Yea this one was hiding from me for a while. Well played sir, well played.
[So does your dad see the John Carpenter film ""They Live"" as a documentary instead of science fiction?  (Highly recommended movie BTW\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jlgg?context=5)|Never seen it but after doing some investigative research (wikipedia) it seems right up his alley. I'll definitely have to check it out though, it looks pretty cool. 
[How old is your dad?  We're his parents old fashion?  Does his family have any history with paranoia?  Along with getting spiritual guidance has he or is he on any medication or other ""drugs""?  Does he think Obama is a reptile?  Has he ever came face to face with one?  Also, I do not mean to offend you in any way. I am just trying to understand the whole situation. I have an open mind about most conspiracies.  Do you believe him?  How has the situation changed your life?  Are you upset about the whole thing?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j6af?context=5)|My dad is in his 50's. His parents were very old fashioned, my grandpa was the typical hard working american of the 50s and 60s who worked on telephone lines his whole life and my grandma was the typical stay at home mom. No history with paranoia as far as i know. As far as drugs go I always thought he at least smoked weed but as it turns out he is very much against drugs of any kind really. Hes never come out and blatantly said Obama is a reptile but i think he thinks so, he says that basically most presidents and politicians are. Do i believe him? if you mean do i believe he genuinely believes in this stuff, I do. The situation greatly changed my life. The whole thing started when we were really actually beginning to get close and hang out more. He was never around much when i was little because he always traveled for work. What upset me the most was when he decided to up and leave and move permanently to his other house with no explanation when i was 14 years old. 
[OP what would your dad think if you got a government job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwwk?context=5)|He would either A. Shun me forever or B. Ask me to uncover some secret information. I wish i was joking about that answer hahah. 
[I would use it as an opportunity to troll him. I would start acting secretive and talk in a monotone voice around him. Especially if it was like a really low level govt. job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jz1m?context=5)|Brilliant plan. Yea like even if i worked in some non exciting gov. job like Sanitation, i would wear one those ear buds and pretend to talk into it very quietly. Plus sanitation gets all the hot interns. 
[Where is the proof about the lizard beings?  What is your dad's ultimate goal? To expose the lizards? Does he have a plan of action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k906?context=5)|As far as I know , and anyone can correct me if im wrong, they really dont have proof aside from stupid youtube videos. Its basically a religion where its a belief and there defense is that you cant disprove it. As far as my dads ultimate goal, its basically to make as many people aware of it as possible and to expose the lizard people and i guess somehow that will give them less power. 
[How do you detect a lizard person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jdkp?context=5)|Well, from my understanding you can tell by the eyes hahah. Apparently there are videos on youtube that prove that people like George H W Bush are reptilians but they way there eyes look. 
[What was it like inside the house?  What did your dad do while staying there?  Does he still do this currently?  Do you still talk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j3xc?context=5)|It was actually a really cool house, but i mean pretty normal. It was kind of weird being there because my dad would be like normal and we would just hang out and watch movies or play golf but then he would go into weirdo mode and start forcing these beliefs on me by showing me these insanely long and boring videos about all this. He is still a firm believer. We rarely talk anymore and if we do only by email, it really hurts because i love him to death but i just cant get on board with this. 
[My friend has recently leapt into this theory as well. Letting it consume, most of his entire day-to-day happenin's.  It also coincides with some pretty significant life changes, his sister had an injury ending her dancing career, his parents lost their home, and he's always had a good deal of paranoia.  Do you have any advice as to how I can approach this change? Or, if it's simply a lost cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jo8z?context=5)|Im very sorry to hear that, its always tough seeing someone close to you do something bizarre. My advice to you is to be there for him / her and try and get them to talk about those life changes. My feeling, atleast in this case is that your friend is closing himself off to the problems and it is manifesting in this belief. Your friend is basically burying their head in the sand to perhaps avoid these problems. So as hard as it may be to see your friend like this, stick with them and try and get them to talk it out. Hope that this helps in any way.
[That is certainly helpful.  That's for the most part what I've been doing. It just, becomes, a major point of contention when it seems to be all he wants to talk about.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68js4x?context=5)|Yea it really does consume their lives. But stick with it and i wish you the best. 
[Does your father have any plans for these reptilian humanoids? Is his group planning some kind of resistance against the creatures? Does he believe that average people can also be a reptile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwlz?context=5)|As far as i know there arent really any plans of a resistance or any such thing. He believes that being a reptile means you are going to be either famous or powerful, so no, its apparently very exclusive. 
[Is ""Reptile"" a euphamism for something else? Like the British monarchy? Or Jews? or is it actually that he believes in freaking REPTILES?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kphc?context=5)|No the actual belief is the people are reptilian humanoids from another dimension. No bullshit, that is what they actually believe. 
[I'm presuming you mean the Annunaki when you say reptilians?  Does he also believe in Nibiru?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k0ce?context=5)|Yes, Annunaki is what i speak of. As far as Nibiru yes he does believe that although he never got to much into detail about it so im not 100% sure exactly what thats all about. 
[Does it have a negative impact on his personal life?  Does he stay closed up in his house? does he work? does he socialize with friends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jojb?context=5)|The thing about his situation is he doesn't fit the typical conspiracy theorist, hes not always holed up in house plastering thousands of pictures on a wall and connecting them with strings. He lives a fairly normal life i would say. Hes a business consultant and he travels alot still. That being said he does have a lot of down time when not traveling and does usually spend it at home with his SO (yea just realized i didnt explain this fully but he still lives with Maria the spiritual healer). 
[Reptiles... what a fruitcake! They are crab people.  Craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jf5g?context=5)|There have an upvote, i literally laughed out loud at this. 
[Does he ever get angry with you if you disagree, or refuse to believe him ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j8h8?context=5)|He would get testy sometimes when I would say basically that hes in a cult and I couldnt be a part of it. I remember one time when he was trying to get me to watch some whacko video he had, i refused and he started yelling basically saying that if i choose not to watch then i would be making my life harder by becoming a slave to them. The few times he did get mad though it genuinely seemed like he wanted to help me and in his mind the way to help me was to get me to believe like he does. 
[Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j43j?context=5)|Also I consider myself a bit of a conspiracy theorist as well but I simply could not even begin to wrap my mind around this theory. 
[I gather it's more believable because Icke can talk for three days solid on the topic. No facts mind you, but for three days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68llip?context=5)|Seriously, he travels to a lot of schools and such to put on presentations and they last upwards of ten hours in some cases. 
[Hey man, I have a brother who believes in that stuff too, last 8 years now actually, it's tearing my family apart too, just thanks for reminding me there's people out there who are going through this shit too. I hope you and your family work things out man. Love from Dublin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kndw?context=5)|Thanks man, appreciate the kind words and I wish you and your family the best.
[Mid life crisis my friend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j575?context=5)|Hahaha, funny you say that because this all started when my dad was having his mid life crisis. It started as the normal crisis where he bought a sports car and all that crap and then went to this. But i think hes beyond the crisis point and is still a firm believer in this conspiracy.

I had struggled with porn and faping since I was 12 and the longest I ever went before was a week and that was because I was at a youth camp. Porn had destroyed so many opportunities. I constantly struggled with social anxiety. I was never in control of my emotions and would direct my outbursts at those that I love the most. So I took up the challenge and I lasted 21 days! I could think better, I was in control, I was the man I always wanted to be.

Then I came home. Lasted about a week before I went back to my old habits. And now I'am back where I was before the summer. My motivation is gone even worse than before. I can't talk to people. The only good thing is that I have been able to keep my workout regiment. 

I'am back where I was. I will rise and damn it this time I will not fall. And if I do fall I will not lay in my misery of self pity. I will rise a new with my teeth and claws covered in the blood of the old me."
zyaid,35,2012-09-15,My mom (45F) is sleeping with her friend's son (22M) and it's bothering me. Why am I (22M) bothered and how do I deal with this?,upsetson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zyaid/my_mom_45f_is_sleeping_with_her_friends_son_22m/,"First of all, please don't think there is ANY incestual thing going on here with what I'm thinking and how I feel. But I still don't know the reason for how I feel and was hoping I can get some input on how to deal with it.

I just got back from a 6-month internship in Chicago for work about 2 weeks ago and will be living with my mom for a while until I save up enough money to move out. Last night, I get home earlier than expected from a friend's house and decide to go to my room upstairs and watch some tv for a bit. As I walked by my mom's room, I heard her talking to someone whose voice sounded really familiar. I have no freaking clue why but my dumbass decided to look through the crack in the door. When I did, I saw my mom and her friend's son fully naked walking into her bedroom shower together.  I know, stupid move on my part but I wasn't thinking when I decided to look.

Right there, I felt sick to my stomach. I went into my room where I began to hear faint sex noises coming from my mom's bathroom. I felt like shit, was upset, and a little bit jealous in an over-protective way. Again, I have no weird feelings like that for my  mom whatsoever but I don't know why I was feeling the way I was. Anyway, I hid in my room until he left, I began to feel sick about what I just found out. 

My mom's friend's son and I went to the same high school and were in the same grade. But we were never friends (not in the same social circle) but we weren't enemies either. But finding out that he is screwing my mom pissed me off and makes me dislike him. As childish as this sounds, it makes me want to screw his mom as payback. I only told my really close female friend about this and she said that my ""jealousy"" and anger might stem from the same over-protective feeling any guy has when someone says a ""your mama"" joke to him. Like I feel like the guy is using or ""defiling"" my mom's body for his pleasure. I know, sounds stupid but she may have had a point.

Should I confront my mom about me knowing? Should I confront the guy without getting into any physical altercations? Do I have a right to feel upset about this? How do I deal with this? If anyone has an idea, let me know. Feel free to PM me too if you're afraid you'll get downvoted to oblivion I guess. I just need some input. Thanks.

TL;DR - Mom is sleeping with her friend's son (an old high school classmate) and it's bothering me. How do I deal?"
zy9p8,81,2012-09-15,A thank you to nurses (VERY long but I want to thank you for changing our lives.),giraffeplusahalf,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/zy9p8/a_thank_you_to_nurses_very_long_but_i_want_to/,"Two years ago on September 11th, I was called at 4:30 am by my boyfriend's roommate, he told me that my boyfriend was drunk and he needed help.  I got out of bed and drove to my boyfriends house to find him on the floor having a fit of seizures, throwing up, and basically emptying every possible bodily fluid on the floor of his room- and immediately called an ambulance (I was furious at his drunk idiot roommate for not calling an ambulance before calling me, and for somehow mistaking this for 'drunk').  There was blood in his ears and nose.  I was terrified.  I had no idea what was going on, seeing as at this point in my life I was finishing my last semester as an art student and preparing to head out to California for an internship at an animation studio.  My boyfriend was passing in an out of death, and becoming increasing more unresponsive as time went on.  I did what I could remember of CPR from when I was forced into CPR certification classes when I Was in girl scouts as a child.  It felt like an eternity went by while waiting for the ambulance.  The paramedics came in, took him and left into the ambulance.  Four more ambulances showed up over the next ten minutes, and each pair of people piled into the one ambulance, every time the door opened I could see him being defibrillated, intibated, and fussed over.

He was life flighted immediately to a bigger hospital, and one again to an even bigger one, and yet another, eventually ending him in Pittsburgh's UPMC presby.  I followed him in my car across Pennsylvania, crying and completely unaware of what was going on. I heard everything from doctors claiming that he must have been using heavy drugs (I would tell them he wouldn't touch drugs, but no one believed me), to a stroke, to an aneurism- but no one knew.  When he arrived at UPMC I was informed quickly that my boyfriend had been born with an AVM, and had never suffered any symptoms, so when it ruptured it came out of nowhere. 

Over the next week I lived out of the waiting room, and eventually a hotel room waiting to hear what would happen.  My boyfriend couldn't talk clearly, and was experiencing living memories in his room from our previous trips to Pittsburgh, such as giraffes and elephants. (Before all this) He was very confused, and only slept when I was there with him holding his hands.  He lived in UPMC's ICU for a full week waiting to have a massive soft ball sized blood clot removed from his skull so he could beginning attempting to heal.  No one attempted to even pretend he would make it, some of the nurses couldn't even look me in the eye while I sat for hours next to his bed (he wouldn't let them place, or remove IV's without me there, insisting that he would die if I were to leave).  His vital signs faded in and out, as he was pumped full of drugs all day, every day.  After a week he had become as stable as anyone could have hoped, so they took him in for surgery.  I was so scared that the last time I would ever see him was now, him with tubes in his skull, tubes in his throat, tubes in his nose, and me with my head on his lap trying not to cry, while I told him I loved him and would be there the whole time.  He told me he loved me, and they rolled his bed down the hall.

There were no complications, and he came out of surgery, and was returned to his room in a drug induced coma.  The nurses told me he was sleeping and he would be for a while, so I sat quietly at his bed side and talked to him.  He woke up saying my name, and his nurses came rushing in to help him and do their inspections of him.  His blood clot was removed, the trouble zones cauterized, and his skull stapled and stitched.  

Over the next three days, my boyfriend's nurses tried to teach him how to do simple movements again.  He was left with full paralysis on his left side, to the extent that he couldn't move his face, see out of his left eye, or even release his arm from a clenched fist.  He could talk, and he remembered everyone, but was still fully confused about where he was.  All of his nurses were more than either of us cold have ever asked for.  They talked to him, they laughed with him, they talked to me even.  I remember one time I got so upset I went out and sat in the hallway on the floor by the bathroom and cried.  One of his nurses came out and sat next to me, put her arm around me and told me how much he needed me, and told me how important it was for me to be strong for him, so he could be strong for me sometime when I needed him.  I dried my eyes and re entered my boyfriend's room to find him laughing and joking with one of his male nurses, as the nurse was using a mirror to show my boyfriend his stitches and staples on his head and asking if he knew what they came from.  My boyfriend told the nurse that it was from a helicopter blade that sliced his head open in 'Nam.  (my boyfriend was 25 at the time- and was not in any wars- he works as a cook.) The male nurse laughed, as the two of them made up fake stories about the war, and talked as if they were best buds.  This nurse was so amazing with my boyfriend, laughing and talking, asking about life, sharing dog stories and pictures (they both had dogs), he asked my boyfriend every time he entered the room if he remembered what happened, and why he was there (probably close to fifty times a day for three days straight) until he finally could remember why he was there.  Another one of his nurses had a fabulous sense of humor, she understood how embarrassing it was for my boyfriend to be incapable of helping himself do anything, and went out of her way to make sure he felt comfortable.  I remember one time she came into his room and asked him if she could get him anything and he replied by touching my face with his functioning arm and saying no.  He then proceeded to get a full on erection, and then turned red and apologized- she laughed and said cheerfully to us ""well at least we know that still works!!"" Her fabulous sense of humor for things that otherwise would have been hugely embarrassing for someone made it possible for my boyfriend to feel okay about the things happening to him.

 There were four nurses specifically that went WAY out of their way to be great to my boyfriend, not only by providing amazing medical help, but also by being his friend- they didn't treat him like a problem they wanted to get away from, but instead they treated him like a person, with family, friends, thoughts, and emotions.  After about a week and a half (it seemed like months) my boyfriend was moved to a physical therapy rehab hospital in our home town.  When he left we was carted out on a bed, unable to move his left side still. (not even a finger wiggle.)  

The paramedics saved my boyfriend's life, and the nurses kept him alive and through their care, and hard work made it possible for him to be who he is today.  He since, has regained full movement, is finishing his final year at college, working at his job full time again, and is now acting strong for me while I go through nursing school (that nurse was right).  These nurses (at UPMC and Health South, his rehab facility) not only helped my boyfriend but they made me realize that I had made the wrong career path choice when I initially went to college.  I am now enrolled in nursing school and am on my way to becoming an RN.  I have hopes of one day being able to provide even HALF of the support, knowledge, kindness, and expertise of these nurses who changed both my life, and life of my boyfriend.  

On the off chance that even one of his nurses is not only on this website, but is able to identify with, and remembers this situation and my boyfriend and I, from both of us we would like to say Thank you.  He is unable to remember you, or any of his stay at UPMC, but I will remember you for the rest of my life.  You changed two lives for the better, and I want you to know how grateful and appreciative of you, and your hard work we both are.  We recently made a visit to the hospital, hoping that we might find some of you to say thank you in person, but we failed.  

If you are by some chance one of his nurses, I wanted to write this to say thank you, and to let you know that all of your hard work helped my boyfriend to regain movement, and he is living a normal life two years and four days later.  All of you nurses are some of the most amazing people on Earth, and even if you didn't have anything to do with my boyfriend's brush with death and recovery, I want to thank you too for every little thing you do at work every day- even if you think it goes unnoticed, just remember-  there may be someone like me who notices it, and appreciates it more than you may ever know.

For the bottom of my heart, Thank you."
101rzv,1,2012-09-17,Can anybody help me keep my gap year from feeling like a trapped year?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/101rzv/can_anybody_help_me_keep_my_gap_year_from_feeling/,"This is gonna be long, but I'm really in need of advice.

I'm 18 and recently graduated. Rather than going on to college, I ended up taking a gap year. This was mainly because my parents were going through a divorce right around the time I should have been applying for college and scholarships, and that along with certain other consequent events hit me harder than I could have anticipated. By the time I was able to focus on moving my own life forward again, I had missed my chance for any kind of full ride scholarship and a lot of other financial aid. I scored the highest on the ACT out of my graduating class and had a  very good GPA, and I didn't want to be reliant on student loans to get to college. So I decided to take this year off and apply next year when I could hopefully take advantage of scholarships.

I wanted to find better ways to spend my year off than sitting around at home and working a minimum wage job. I wanted to use this time to explore my interests and decide for sure what I want to major in (I have a pretty good idea that I want to go into biochemistry or biotechnology or neuroscience). I also wanted to get a good job and start saving money, and to just start doing more things that I enjoy, which meant traveling a bit. I know how it sounds to say this, but there isn't much here at all in the small town where I grew up. One of my main goals was to find a research internship or volunteer lab position, but I haven't found anything that isn't aimed at undergraduate students or higher. I really have no one I know that can help. I have no mentor here, no one in my family and no one that I know, who has done anything remotely like this. The mindset here is to stay local, find any job or find a trade. 

My plan as it stands right now is to find professors and researchers who are working on things that I would be interested in, and email several of them to see if any would consider allowing me an internship or volunteer position. The research of Dr. Miguel Nicolelis at Duke on brain-computer interfacing is particularly interesting. He is at the top of my list. Anyway, if anyone would offer me an opportunity I would need to move to the area, which would mean finding out what the place was like, finding a job and apartment or other housing there, saving enough money to move... And then to apply to university with plenty of time to spare next year, since I'm not currently enrolled anywhere. 

So to be concise, I guess my questions are:
How do I find an internship or... travel... or something that would make this gap year worth while? How likely is my current 'plan' to work?
How do I find out about a city before I move, if I don't have very much money to visit it? 
How do I find a job and housing in a new city?

Any general advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated, and my plan is not set in stone. I would also be interested in hearing from anyone who maybe took a similar route. And maybe some forums that I could post this question on would be helpful, too.

Thanks for the read"
101rxz,4,2012-09-17,My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] were long distance this summer and I made some stupid decisions involving another guy - how should I deal with this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/101rxz/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_20f_were_long_distance/,"Let me preface this by saying that I can be extremely naïve and I trust people more than I probably should. I am also exceptionally verbose.

I [20F] have been with my boyfriend [20M] for almost two years. He is beyond wonderful and we love each other very much. We spent this past summer on opposite sides of the country (US) due to our respective internships. 

I met someone at my workplace this summer, we’ll call him John [25M], who I hit it off with right away. And when I say hit it off, I just mean that it was easy for us to talk and we became friends. Eventually John asked if I wanted to hang out outside of work. He had been getting a little flirtier and, upon some reflection, some of the things I said could have been taken as flirty as well. That night I went home and called my boyfriend and told him about John asking to hang out. My boyfriend said he was fine with it as long as I promised to be careful.

The next night John and I ended up at the beach after work. We swam for a long time and then sat on the beach talking until it got dark. I was planning to head home but John asked if I wanted to grab dinner first. I saw no harm in it since all we had done was talk and agreed. We had a great conversation at dinner but at the end he asked if I wanted to go back to his place. I was taken aback but managed to get out that no, it was time for me to head home. I told my boyfriend about the whole evening and he said that John saw all of it as a date and that he was trying to get me into bed. Understandable conclusion.

I went to the beach by myself the next night and got a text from John asking where I was. I told him the same spot and a little while later he showed up with two friends (a guy and a girl) who were staying with him. They brought alcohol and offered me some but I said no. Note that it was about a half hour drive back to my place. I hit it off with his friends and they ended up asking if I wanted to head back to John’s place. We were having a lot of fun so I went.
When we got there, they convinced me to drink and around midnight/one everyone was getting sleepy. By this point I was a relatively drunk and knew I couldn’t drive home that night so I had to stay at John’s. His friends had already taken up the couch and blow-up mattress so I offered to sleep on the floor. John said he had somewhere else and led me upstairs. Thinking there was a guest room, I followed. He took me to his room, pointed to his bed and said I could have half. Here’s where I’m completely at fault.
I told John I’d be fine with the floor but he said “No, c’mon this is easier.” Naïve me said okay. I climbed into bed staying as far to one side as I could, thinking I’d actually get half the bed. He climbed in after me but got really close to me so we were on the same side. After a minute he said “You’re really timid aren’t you?” At this point I was drunk and sleepy and didn’t bother making sense of that. Then he slid his hands up my skirt and started groping me. I kept saying no but I’m pretty sure it came out a pretty weak, sleepy, “noooooo” instead of “NO!” He stopped but ended up trying again a couple more times. He ultimately got the message and didn’t touch me again. The next morning we both got up and I said thanks for letting me stay over and then left.

My boyfriend had called multiple times the night before and left me a bunch of texts. I felt awful. He assumed I’d gone to bed early and was asleep. I called him, planning to tell him everything but he was so worried and upset that I’d put myself in that situation that I couldn’t bring myself to tell him the worst part. He knows everything up to me being in the same bed with John but I couldn’t bear to tell him that over the phone. 

My boyfriend and I finally got to see one another yesterday for the first time in three months and we had a beautiful day together. I had been planning to tell him the rest of what happened that night but couldn’t get it out. I’ve been sick about this since it happened a month ago and I don’t know what to do. John and I stayed friends at work but we’re not keeping in touch or anything now that my internship is over. I wasn’t upset with John because, to be fair, he didn’t know I had a boyfriend. I’m, again, at massive fault for never telling him. It just never came up naturally though that’s a horrible excuse. I should have told John I was in a relationship. 

I’ve told a couple people really close to me what happened and all of them have said not to tell my boyfriend because it would just make things complicated. I feel like I cheated even though I never kissed John or responded to his advances, but my friends said that I didn’t cheat. I’m not sure what to do. Should I tell him? I see him again tomorrow but I don’t know if I should bring it up. At one point this summer he told me not to tell him anything that happened between me and other guys (he was jealous that I spent a long time on the phone with one of my best friends, who is a guy), but this is different.

I’m so sorry for the bloody novel I’ve written you and I applaud all of you who made it through. Actually, I applaud anyone who made it past the first couple sentences. Any advice would be very much appreciated. And I won’t be offended if you just came here to tell me I’m an idiot. I truly deserve it.

TL;DR  My boyfriend and I spent the summer on opposite sides of the country because of our internships. I hung out with a guy I worked with and ultimately got drunk at his house and spent the night in the same bed (though I didn’t let anything happen). Should I tell my boyfriend?

Prior to writing in college, I had started out as a mass communication major, a film major and then an audio major before my parents, in an effort to get me to graduate, told me I had only two more years to graduate. My junior year, I was on staff for the Columbia Chronical, Columbia College Chicago's school newspaper. 

After graduating, I sent out my resume all over the US in hopes of getting a position and finally received an offer as a paid internship at a small daily in Amsterdam, NY. They offered me $12 an hour and I basically got fill out my own time card and was paid for mileage. It was a good job, but I realized after a while the nothing my teachers taught me really applied to the position. They didn't teach me about covering board meetings. I never really learned how to use a camera and I never realized how my stories would be chopped and up and rearranged by the editor without my consent. 

After about a year, my job was cut and I was left with a decision of whether to stay in New York and work a low paying job or look once more for a job. I found a promising position at another small newspaper in Sutton Nebraska. I went expediting a young staff and a great paper and found a place where people were trying to get out as soon as possible. I found out why after many empty promises to pay me for milage and a paycheck that bounced. From there, I was just about ready to give up. I moved back home in effort to get my life back together and eventually found a position at a newspaper in Clinton, IL. The manager was great, the pay was generous and I was covering sports. He eventually left the paper during my first year and I was promoted to managing editor only to have it snatched away from me and my sports position eliminated by a scumbag publisher. I then moved out to Pontiac, IL where I have been working for a year and a few months. Already, there are talks about positions getting cut. 

So, what you can take out of this is what you want. I am not a bad worker, I always worked what I was given and was willing to learn. I think what I have learned is that print journalism is more of a lifestyle and less of a job. You have to be able to work hours outside of the 9-5 schedule. You have to be willing to go above and beyond the call of duty. You have to be willing to stick with it, no matter what the outcome. You have to be able to learn and absolutely have no fear of talking to people. 

There is good stuff too. I can't even tell you how many times people have thanked me for what I wrote. How many people have told me they got calls from friends they hadn't heard from in years. How many people I have talked with about serious loss or about serious hope with me. How many people I have inspired and that's only the ones who have contacted me. 

The love this job is to love constant change. To be able to take the good with the bad and to be happy and upbeat through it all. :-) 

I wish for each of you to have at least one good editor who pushes you to do better and who believes in you. I love this job and can't imagine doing anything else. Even after all that. "

I was diagnosed with Tourette's when I was about 8 or 9. I'm 20 now. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD. I've always had trouble focusing and remembering things, I'm pretty much constantly in motion. I have to make a conscious effort to stay still. Anyway, I've had these symptoms pretty much my whole life, but I never really thought about it too much. After losing my financial aide at school, I realized I need to do something about it.
I've only been smoking about 2 years, the first year of which I probably smoked less than 10 times. This year I pretty much smoke everyday. It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep and have even a little focus on anything. Anyway I recently switched doctors and during the initial interview I said that I have smoked before. I said that I started 2 years ago and smoked very little last year, and a little more this year. It was an intern or something filling out a paper and she didn't seem to care much, but I don't know how my doctor would react. My doctor referred me to a neurologist and I was wondering if I should tell her that I smoke. I'm really worried that it will affect my diagnosis even though I've had these symptoms my whole life and started smoking recently. I could really use some help"

* When I was 15, in 9th grade, I went through an Emo Angst phase and grew out my hair (it had always been cropped short). Lame. And it got me pulling from the top of my head, I don't know why or how it started.

* Grew out of the emo phase by the start of 10th grade, but I kept pulling my hair a bit. It's a long time ago, so I forget.

* Eventually, I transitioned to eyelashes. For the remainder of high school, my notebooks would be full of them when you'd flip through the pages.

* Then, I went to the pubic hair. After some close calls getting caught with my hands down my pants, I stopped. 

* University started, and that's when the eyebrows got bad. When studying, reading, etc, it's just such a natural position to rest my right arm close to my right eyebrow, and pluck. It's not too bad, though, some of my friends see me do it and mention it but I don't do it hardcore, so my eyebrows aren't that thin.

* 3rd year university, HUGELY stressful exam, it gets bad. Studying for almost a day straight, the lateral half of my right eyebrow was just a few hairs. It was bad enough for people to notice. My brother's friends asked me: ""Dude, wtf is up with your eyebrow?"" and that was embarassing.

* 4th year university, I had internships and a research thesis - very, very little stress and barely didn't pull, but I still get the urge when I'm reading and my hand defaults to that position.

* Grad school, today, I'm not that bad. I really, really try to keep my hands busy and my girlfriend always reminds me when I'm doing it, but my eyebrows are still much thinner than I'd like them to be. Often, when I'm alone and can't control it, I ""pet"" my eyebrows, rubbing the hairs, and really try to resist pulling. I often end up with a lot less pulled hairs than before.

**So, /r/Trichsters:**

* Do the eyebrows grow back, in your experience? Will 100% of the hairs grow back or did I likely kill a few roots and my eyebrows will be thinner than normal forever?

* Does stress commonly affect pulling?"

2) What is the contract situation like? Their current contract is set to expire in October, from what they have said on-air. At this point, it seems fairly obvious that they are going to renew, am I correct?

3) If they were NOT to renew, would the trio continue working together? And would it be in Anthony's Compound?

4) Is there any interaction between O&amp;A and HooHoo behind the scenes? The tension seems to have subsided a bit over the last couple years but there are still a few jabs every now and then (mainly from Opie).

5) How much of the tension with Management is real and how much is just for the show?

Long time fan, these are just some of the things I've always wondered.

100j1d,1,2012-09-17,"Life past high school, I may have grown apart[18m][18f]",Ak5nowman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/100j1d/life_past_high_school_i_may_have_grown_apart18m18f/,"Good evening. I have been thinking about this for a few months now and have come here for advice. My gf and I have been dating for roughly 5 years. For the past year, senior year of high school, she was living with me and my family because she was kicked out. She really have no communication with her mother or father, but has a great relationship with her grandma. I always thought living with her would be amazing and we would have the greatest time. Man, does living with someone show who they are. It's not that anything big was a red flag but the littlest things would really bug me. Like not picking up dropped stuff in the shower(soap, razor, etc) to leaving her stuff all of my desk.

Anyway, this last summer I did a program to help me transition to college life, took a few classes, did an internship at the largest oil producing company in my home state, etc. During those 2 months I had the chance to meet some really great people, non of which are dating material. Regardless It still opened my eyes to the people out there. I have been dating the same girl since 8th grade, I haven't seen what else is out there. Did i mention that she is my first girlfriend. This summer program made me realize that we really don't enjoy many of the same things. I mean sure, we may like a couple things but she doesn't enjoy the thing I live for. I Live to ride a snowmachine(snowmobile for you southern folk). She never wants to go and she hates the snow, while i love it.

I was able to drive home 50 miles to see my family. When I would get there she wouldn't say hi, she would expect me to. When I felt it appropriate for her to welcome me I wouldn't say anything to her. She would then proceed to go back to her room and pout about it. I find it annoying as hell, she expects me to initiate everything, and pouts if I don't. It got to the point that I didn't want to talk to her, it was always because she was upset. On some of the longer weekends we would get through that and all we would do is have sex. We would never go out, or hang out with her friends, or mine. I'm not to fond of her friends. Also, I feel like she has being like dependent on my family. Like she doesn't have a life outside of me and that makes it hard on my.

I've finally grown to the age where sex isn't everything. I don't want a relationship where all that holds us together is sex and I feel that is what I have. I feel that it will never be the same even if we tried to ""restart."" Restarting wouldn't change her perspective on riding a sled. I feel obligated to stay home and not go to my buddys house.

As big of a douche bag as I would have been I was going to break it off while she was down in college. This is where it gets tricky. My family has invested so much into her, shes really dependent on them. Shes the way that she got to college, the reason shes in the one she is. My sister drives over from her school on long weekend and takes her around the states. I feel as if I would be dropping her on the street if I were to break it off. Actually I feel like my mom would be disappointed in me. I feel like I should talk to my mom but I am actually scared to. It doesn't help that my gf is down in a college where shes got nobody but her roommates whom she just met.

I'm really in need of some advice here. Would I be an asshole if I broke up with her while shes down in college with nobody?

tl;dr Gf of 5 years is going to college in a different state. My family is invested in her and is the only thing she has. We don't have much in common, my eyes opened to life outside of high school.

I can expect people to be asking each other how their summers went and stuff.

I am anxious as to how to respond. I couldn't find an internship or work, like most people at my school do.

What's more is that I took time off last school year. If I bring that up in conversations I know people will ask what I did.

I took time off because I was really stressed out and needed some time off. I squirm at the thought of saying I basically was at home and just researching cool computer science related things the entire time. It certainly was a very transformative time for me, but it's just so hard to have a conversation like that when people are expecting more simple mainstream things like ""I had an internship at company XYZ.""

I want to just say that I was at home enjoying my summer and working on some software projects/learning on my own. But I am anxious to say that because I don't want someone's first impression of me to be a lazy person.

So how do you guys deal with relating to someone how you spent an extended period of time doing something that's not mainstream, and is hard to talk about without getting embarrassed?"
100i5z,1,2012-09-17,If only the past could be changed and not be a waste,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/100i5z/if_only_the_past_could_be_changed_and_not_be_a/,"I feel like I failed.  I got a useless undergrad degree and then got a useless graduate degree with no future in the places I want to work in the most.  I have tried and tried to get good jobs, but it has failed too many times.  yes, I know people are dealing with unemployment, but this almost feels worse.

I originally thought I wanted to study medicine in college, but found out I wasn't cut out for it soon after taking the undergrad courses.  I was lost then and went into a major that didn't completely lose all the class credits I took.  I also was in a long distance relationship that probably should not have happened as it shifted things for me a bit too.  Studying an interdisciplinary major for the environment was a bad idea.  Later, I went into a masters program in urban planning.  A year after I was in there, at least I ended the relationship that was a mistake outside of the lessons learned.  I found out I was bipolar during this time.  Overall, now I see I should have gone into something better and applied myself.

My current boyfriend is in medical school after growing up in extreme poverty.  He was motivated to change his life after finding out a life in bad choices and poverty was not a way to live.  He enrolled in community college, worked full time, and went out of his way for perfection.  He studied all night after only two hours of sleep each night to get perfect grades.  He eventually got a fantastic degree and used it to get to medical school, where he is almost finished and doing fantastically there.  He is a top candidate for what he wants to specialize in.  The point of all this is, I feel like a useless asshole after looking at him.  I love him, but his success is a reminder of what I am not.

I now am working in a job that is with people who only got about a high school education at the state in a place that has no future and is not in my field.  I got it after over a year of unemployment which was depressing already on its own.  My co-workers resent my being there even though they have no idea how much I am a loser from my choices in the past.  I cannot get into the EPA or any place that I want to work because I chose useless fields and obviously therefore did not apply myself.  It feels like I lack the intelligence and drive to get anywhere.  I feel no passion enough to get up and get going into something.

I cannot feel anything but useless.  After seeing my boyfriend and what he has done.  I love him so much, but it hurts to see how hard he works while I was so lazy.  I wanted to try and fix things to help my career by talking to the person who was over my internship who now lives in another state with a great job.  They recommended getting an International Code Council zoning inspector certification.  I had hope then and bought the books to study for the test.  Now I cannot focus on studying them because it just feels dead.  The only thing that was good out of my past was that somehow things led me to adopt my dog and meet my boyfriend who I have been with for three years who is the love of my life.  My family, friends, and boyfriend know how awful I feel and keep telling me it will get better but I disagree.  I am 27 now and have too much student debt to go to school and start over as well as just am too old.  

The only things that hold me back from trying to die are that I don't want my dog to be alone, my debts I don't want someone else to pay after death, and my boyfriend not having someone to help feed him and finally the knowledge that if I mess up, I will probably have brain damage which is the only thing worse than my current circumstances. I just feel so useless and down with no future in my career.  I keep trying to tell myself that people have survived worse things, but it still doesn't seem to change how I feel.  

I want to call the person who counseled me in the past but I don't want to bother them since they are dealing with their own major health issues.   Plus, what will it honestly do?

I feel so lost and hopeless in my purpose in life.  I don't want to live through another person or in their shadow.  I want to be my own success but it feels so hopeless.  Is this going to be the rest of my life?  If so, then I just feel that once my debts are paid, it may be time to finish my brief existence.  I know ending one's own life is considered shameful, but what else is there when you pine the past that should have been different."
100g9b,60,2012-09-17,[FR]iend showed [ME] something in his attic.,xiggolthorp,Thetruthishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/100g9b/friend_showed_me_something_in_his_attic/,"Just found this subreddit and love the concept, I have a few encounters that I had considered sharing with nosleep but never did because I want to share them with 
people who might believe me. This particular post will involve my best friend Jeff, I will let him read over everything before posting these encounters just to make 
sure he is comfortable with the content. This isn't the first time I've encountered strange, unexplainable things in my life and I plan to post more on that at a 
later time.

The most interesting paranormal event concerning Jeff occured during the summer of 2011 while I was out of town. The majority of this even I heard about from Jeff and
had I not participated in two crucial parts I would not believe him. During that summer I was at an internship 1,000 miles away but since we were good friends we talked
on the phone quite often. He started telling me about hearing strange noises in his crawlspace above his garage, (he sat in the garage while on the phone and they keep
their refrigerator in there.) After weeks of hearing these noises he took it upon himself to climb up there and see what sort of animal had made said noises. He was on
the phone with me while he climbed up there. He told me at first that he didn't see anything, he then told me he saw something moving in the corner, then all I heard
was a shout, a crash, and a lot of cursing. Jeff told me he fell out of the crawlspace because something up there ran at him. He said it was too big and sounded more
curious than scared. 

This is his description of what he saw ""It was not quite human and not quite animal in shaped. This thing crawled on all fours like a human but was way too fast. It
was on the smaller side. Only about four feet tall if it were to stand up.""

I thought at first that he was pulling my leg but he kept assuring me that he was telling me the truth, he suddenly said that he thought he wanted to get out of the
garage for a bit and would call back the following evening. During the following weeks Jeff's past time of our conversations was sitting in the garage and staring up at
the crawlspace trying to get a reaction out of whatever was up there. He told me that it was still scratching around occassionally and made some strange gutteral noise
that sounded somewhere between a goat and a cow. He did eventually climb back up there but didn't see the thing though he did find some evidence of something being up
there. This is his description of what he found "" I found where something had been moving some things like boxes and insulation. Slightly into the crawspace I found a 
burnt old scrap of paper with a symbol on it. I had never seen the symbol before and the paper would later disappear without a trace. For along time before and after a wierd sulfer
smell would be coming from there. I checked there was no gas leak and nothing I could connect it to. It seem to just be in the same spot I found the paper.""

He also told me he would hear what sounded like something scratching inside the walls. He heard these noises when sitting in the living room which shared a wall
with the garage and went on to say that he heard the scratching come from the connecting wall. A couple months after this all started up, it stopped completely and has
not reoccurred since.

I only had two personal encounters with this thing, one of which was over the phone. One night as we were on the phone he told me it was making that noise again. This
night he was in his room but could hear it from the garage. So while we were on the phone he walked into the garage, put the phone on speaker, and stood under the crawl
space. I know Jeff did not make this noise because he was in mid-sentence when it cried out. He did it justice by saying it sounded like a combination of a goat and a
cow and something about the noise made my skin crawl even though it was over the phone. The other encounter occured while I was visiting home in the middle of my
internship, I was over at Jeff's and as we were watching a movie in the living room late at night we heard the scratching coming from the garage. I was terrified but
Jeff and I went in there to see what it was. Jeff was about to climb up when I grabbed a broom handle and pushed up against the panel of the crawl space. I pushed it up
2 or 3 inches before I felt pressure on the other side slam it down. Jeff tested the panel himself and couldn't budge it. We left it alone for the rest of the night.

We don't know what it was or what made it go away or what even made it appear in the first place. I understand that the way I presented this might be a bit dry but I just
wanted to state the bare facts without any embellishment. Jeff and I will answer any questions you have and I will tell you more of my experiences with and without Jeff
if this goes well."

This was few years ago now, but I think I remember him saying something along the lines that- they were really looking for ""pretty young girls"" to work at the place because the business was new. 

Well I mean from a business perspective I guess this makes sense- I would guess that hiring attractive young female workers might bring in more business. However, how is this not sex-based hiring discrimination? There are so many places that obviously do this- like so many of the stores in the mall- why don't they get called out on this? 

Now that I am working on my engineering degree- I think I am going through something simmilar again. One of my girl friends in my major got this really good internship with Nav-Air this past summer. We both applied to this- and we have very similar GPAs and everything. However she was the only one out of the 50 (of which there are only 5 females) in my major and my year that got this. I'd hate to say it- but I really think it had to do a lot to do with her being a woman. Ok so I understand that engineering is a mainly a male dominated field- and employers try to attract more females. But still- it somehow feels unfair to me."

This is a general overview with some key specifics to give you a general idea of the situation.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl.

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia.

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things.

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though.

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations.

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that.

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned.

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not.

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag.

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession.

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her.

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what.

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it?

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself.

As for seeing each other often, its more chance that that happened. We don't plan to see each other in the near future. It just worked out like that.

Dates:

7/11 : Met her last year in July

1/12: Went back in January; where all the shit went down

6/12: Went abroad with her

9/12: the current month

103lza,2,2012-09-18,"Low GPA and extracurricular activities, lots of work experience. Looking to join public accounting.",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/103lza/low_gpa_and_extracurricular_activities_lots_of/,"Hello r/accounting!

First of all, awesome sub. Lots of valuable information here.

As stated in my title, I wish to join the public accounting industry as an auditor. Like most people here, I am VERY interested in joining one of the Big Four and due to its highly competitive nature, I have a few question to ask you informed individuals &lt;3. Background:

I am currently a senior at a UC (University of California). The campus does not have a very good reputation, but the Big Fours do come to recruit from the campus yearly. My overall GPA is 2.9 and major (Business Admin/Accounting) is 3.1. I am also a member of Accounting Society. Unfortunately, we do not have a chapter for BAP. I also do not have any sort of leadership role in any organization. I, however, was a peer adviser for the international students along with 20 other people for a year. Now, before you jump the gun and think, ""Holy shit this guy is a fail LOL,"" all of these are because of my work obligation. 

I have been working since 8th grade in my mom's business. It's a franchise retail business of a F500. The company is a leader in the industry. As mentioned, I have been running the business alongside my mom practically for 10 years. Whenever I'm not at school, I'm working. Mind you, the work also has pretty terrible hours. During school time, i would be putting in ~20-25 hours/wk and during break time ~70 hours/wk. I am compensated by my mom for working ~180 days/a year and I finance 100% of my college-related expenses. 

So, thanks to this job, my times are pretty limited and makes it especially hard to focus on internship and school activities. As much as I hate it, work comes first, no work = no money = no school :(. Plus, graveyard hours are holy crap terrible for working students.

Now, this work has to somehow have a positive impact on my life to make up for all these limitations imposed by it. The work is very client-oriented. Like auditors, we are practically always on client site. In my case, my clients are major grocery stores (Walmart, Ralph's, Albertson's, etc.). When my mom first bought the business, it was bringing in ~200k in revenue. 11 years later, it's averaging ~600k/year. Since it is our business, we are naturally hard workers. Working 12 hours/day is the norm. Luckily for me, this job had given me a lot of positive qualities that can be leveraged for other jobs. 

* **Clients relation**: because my mom does not speak English, I am the main communicator (even when I was a cute little 12 year old boy with 3 years of English experience). The work involves me communicating to the store managers and my district managers and working out a plan to increase sales. Driving sales is a win-win for both the clients and us because we are on a 100% commission deal. So, as the only one that can speak English, I grew up learning how to maintain a positive relationship with the clients and any other beneficial entities.

* **Details, details, details** - Due to the nature of retailing business, we have to constantly keep track of the accuracy of our inventory count, and thanks to my awesome young vision, that is also my role. On a daily basis, I am responsible for keeping track of the products coming in/out and what is in the truck and make sure that all the physical counts match with what's on the paper/invoices. It sounds pretty easy, and believe me, it is pretty easy. However, it becomes pretty challenging when it involves thousands of individual item on a daily basis. Like the balance sheet, at the end of the day, we want the physical count to match with what is on the paper and any missing items = $$ loss :'(. 

* **Accounting experience** - It is also our responsibility that we keep make sure that the invoices on our end matches with what the corporate has. On a weekly basis, we would be given a weekly settlement and my job is to make sure that everything adds up. This was my first accounting experience prior to college and it was pretty natural for me to scan through stack of papers for mistakes. 

* **Customer Service** - Customer service is probably my biggest strength when it comes to this job. We are there at the client site providing service 363 days a year (stores are closed on Christmas/Thanksgiving :/ ), whereas our competitors take 2 days off per week. Thanks to this, we are seen as reliable in contrast to our competitors. For example, this past Labor Day, my products are supposed to sell really awesome and I planned out # of displays and their locations with the managers at Walmart to make sure there are no missed opportunity. Well, the following day my competitor came in and was amazed with how many displays we had up and went to ask the manager for some. He was responded with: ""We can't give you any."" Naturally he was furious and asked why he cannot have any when I had so many up. The managers literally told him: ""Well, you are not here 7 days a week like *my name* and you're going to be off on Labor Day, so how can I trust that you can keep up with the demands?"" 

Now mind you, this competitor also carries Walmart private label brands and for the manager to told him off in favor of me/my mom is a huge recognition on our service.

So, this is becoming extremely long and I just got back from work (I start at 2 AM) and about to take a nap. My question is: am I in the position to leverage my work experience enough so that recruiters would look past my low GPA, no leadership role, and lack of networking with them? 

Thank you r/Accounting for reading my long, uninteresting concerns :) I will now take a nap. Thanks again guys!"
103lur,5,2012-09-18,"So I'm Thinking of Breaking Up With Evangelicalism... Need Your Advice/Prayers, /r/Christianity",KingCrimson250,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/103lur/so_im_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_evangelicalism/,"So here's the deal. Been evangelical for most of my Christian life. That's the tradition that I encountered Christ through, and the tradition that nurtured me through my early Christian years.

The problem is, though, is that I've gone off and gotten my undergrad in theology, and that's opened up a whole new world of Christianity to me. I've begun reading more and more broadly, and its begun opening up a new thirst to learn more about who God is.

Why is this a problem? Because in my experience, evangelicals really don't like the idea of people being well-read. I know that's a harsh thing to say, but it's true. Every evangelical church I've been to has kind of got it's pet list of authours and pastors that you are expected to agree with, and if you don't agree with them, or if you question them, you're treated differently, like you're obviously not quite at the level of spiritual maturity they want you to be at.

The evangelical churches near me are huge on guys like John Piper and D.A. Carson, authors who, while good men serving the Lord, aren't people who I have a great deal of respect for on a theological level. 

But here's where the problem comes in: I find that within the framework of these churches, I can't honestly pursue God, because I'm expected to kind of fit into this New-Calvinist mould, and if I don't, I'm given these disapproving looks and suggested a Piper book that I would ""really benefit from reading.""

And so it's all kind of come to the point where I feel as though evangelicalism is attempting to interfere with my pursuit of God, because they're so wrapped up in ensuring that everyone adheres to their personal approach to Christianity they end up demonizing anyone who disagrees.

Telling people that I'm an egalitarian who doesn't believe in YEC was like the evangelical version of ""coming out."" And the big problem is, I'm not just a church-goer. I'm a wannabe pastor. I've been doing training and internships for church ministry. And if you're a member of the leadership team in one of these churches and you start asking these questions, then you're REALLY in trouble. Which to me makes no sense at all. Your faith journey doesn't just become cryogenically frozen because you've started getting paid full-time for your ministry.

I actually had an entire denomination of evangelicals shut me down and refuse to work with me just because I wanted to do my M.Div (or MTS, not sure yet) at a seminary that leans towards egalitarianism!


And so I'm really coming closer and closer to breaking up with the evangelical church. I call it breaking up because that's really what it feels like. I've got an emotional attachment to this church, and they're great people and they do great things, but there are too many problems in our relationship and I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with them. 

But I don't know if things get any better outside of evangelicalism. I've reached a sort of theological moderateness, which means liberal Christians don't like me because I'm too conservative, and conservative Christians don't like me because I'm too liberal, so I don't really feel as though I fit in anywhere.

All I want is a church where I can honour what I perceive to be a calling from God to enter into full-time ministry in a church (because I've tried other things, other methods and ideologies of ministry. They're good, but there's something about working in the church itself that just feels ""right,"" almost as though it's where I'm meant to be) while still being faithful to my pursuit of relationship with God.

Any advice?"

103922,14,2012-09-18,I might be at a turning point in my life...,japko,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/103922/i_might_be_at_a_turning_point_in_my_life/,"I want to tell the world something. Nobody might read it, I know, but I feel it has to be said.

I was never keen to hard work, I was pedaling along, finishing assignments, rarely doing anything extra. I was a fairly good student in school, mut nothing marvelous. I was second-to-last on the list of students accepted to my high school, and in the last 10% of students accepted to my major - psychology. I can't say it was bad though, because my high school was the 3rd best in my 600 000-inhabitants city, and there were 18 candidates per 1 place at my major. But that doesn't matter. 

All that time I was merely a guy who just wanted not to fail the class/test/whatever. No scientific circles in college, no conferences (well, actually I went to one during these 5 years, just one), no scholarships, no extra internships, the average from my grades was 3,6 (on 2-5 scale). One of the reasons for choosing this particular major was that I heard it was easy. Also, I had almost no friends from my faculty. I was a procrastination lord and master and I hated myself so much for it. ALL my attempts at self improvement, getting better grades/whatever were a perpetual streak of failure after failure. Now I have a master's degree in a science that, I admit - is very interesting for me, but nevertheless, the small amount of studying and extracurricular activities I have taken make me feel incompetent. 

At some point things started to stirr up. I had a nasty, nasty breakup with my girfriend, and it took me a year to free myself from being depressed. As a consequence I took part in two student exchange programmes, so I spent two semesters out of my city, and, what's more important - I started to think a lot. About myself, about what I want, about who I am and who I'd like to be, and about where I'm going and why. But I couldn't change the way I behaved, no matter what, and it left me being as ambiguous about my major as I always were (so strongly ambiguous). This has led me to start therapy and I have been going to a therapist for 6 months, that was as much as I could afford. What I did in therapy and in my own, private ""search"" made me understand more, and with time, I began slowly improving. I can do more of the stuff that I want to do, I procrastinate less. It's my first steps, I'd say I'm at 10% of the change I want to achieve, but I think something finally moved - I've started noticing this since a couple of weeks.

Anyway, because I felt I didn't really get the most of my studies, and because I don't really see myself working in my field right now for a number of reasons, I decided that I'd prefer to do something else in life, at least for now. This whole time studying psychology, I was thinking about engineering, but I was always afraid that it'd be too hard for me. I always found this field to be very interesting, though. On my 4th year in college I tried to enroll to a technical university and I failed. Next year, which is 2012, so now, (5 years after high school) I retook my post-high-school math test and tried to enroll again, but failed to get myself accepted to a public engineering programme that I wanted most (in my country public, free of charge higher education is considered better that paid education). So I said, fuck that, Imma apply to paid studies. Same college, same major, but I pay for classes. 

So here I am. I started classes today. I'm on a brink of the most difficult thing I have ever tried to do. Even though I do have a plan B (which is a career in psychotherapy or HR), I'm scared shitless. I don't want to make resolutions about how I will now change my ways forever, because I did that a million times with little result (at least until recently). 

I just want to try to do stuff right this time. It's going to be fucking hard, and motivation and self-organisation is what I need. That's why I posted this here. I don't have a lot of support in my friends or family, and I just wanted to get all this out of my system.

**TL;DR I had a passive life with lots and lots of procrastination and hating myself for it. Things that happened in my life in the last 3 years might have helped me move a bit towards a positive change. Now I'm going back to college to try to get an engineering degree. Wish me luck.**

PS - if you know some sites about math, that have explanations and lessons for idiots, it'd be great if you'd share."

I work 20-30 hours a week at a non-accounting job, so I haven't been active and didn't join any accounting clubs.

My overall GPA is a 3.0 (accounting GPA is lower than that) and I know I don't have a snowballs chance in hell in ever getting hired by Big4. I'm doing my best to try and network, but I guess I'm just terrible at it. I went to the ""Meet the Firms"" event last year and didn't land a single internship. I'll be going to the golf outing this year to try and network as well.

Anyways, on to my question...there is pretty limited time and hundreds of students at this event, so I may not be able to get to every single firm...should I just visit the smaller firms and cross my fingers, and then get to the Big4 later on if I have time?"
102zvl,1,2012-09-18,Fiance's younger brother accidentally knocked a girl up.,[deleted],childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/102zvl/fiances_younger_brother_accidentally_knocked_a/,"Backstory:

My fiance M26 and I F23 have been engaged for two years. We are set to marry next October. He and I are CF, and I am finishing school while he is working (he already finished his master's).

His younger brother, 23, spent the summer working at a casino as an internship for cooking school. He does not have a degree, but has left about two degrees halfway, and his parents are left to shoulder the costs. We are hoping he finishes cooking school. 

My fiance got a call from his mother this past weekend, and she shared some news. 

The brother knocked up a summer fling. They waited four months to tell his parents, and it was obvious he didn't want to do so, and was scared to share the news. His parents had somewhat already heard, since the girl was dumb enough to put it on FB before he told his family. 

Oh, and he decided to move across the country to be with her. They've known each other for like two months.

She is in school as well, and it is our assumption that she will not finish. Thus, the brother will be left to be the breadwinner, and probably not finish his degree as well.  

My fiance's dilemma is this:

His parents always bail his younger brother out, and he is concerned that this ""accident"" will prevent his folks from retiring and finishing the payments on their house. (They are almost done paying for it.)

He does not get along well with his brother, as he is angry at all of the mooching he does on his parents. (My fiance has been financially independent for years, and sees all this mooching as irresponsible).

My fiance wants to send his brother a message pretty much telling him that he'd better not ask to be bailed out, blah blah blah.

I seem to think that since they don't have a good relationship, the brother will take any aggressive message as bad, and ignore it completely. My idea is to reach out to him, but more in a manner of advice. 

Any ideas on how to best communicate to the brother that he'd better not expect to be saved once again by his folks?"
102w43,2,2012-09-18,wanted: health advice for chronic pain (47 days of constant pelvic pain now).,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102w43/wanted_health_advice_for_chronic_pain_47_days_of/,"**So for all those that don't like to read long things: Should I wait another week to go to my obgyn or should I just go to the hospital today? Ive already been to my PCP twice and my OBGYN once. I also had a pelvic sonogram when the pain first started.**

More information for those that don't mind reading:
On July 31 I went to my PCP for pelvic pain (and another issue that they were able to figure out and it has since resolved itself--fibrocystic breasts). At that time, the pelvic pain was NOT constant, but sharp pain that felt like a pulled muscle when you move ""wrong."" I only had the doctor look at it because when poking around my hips it felt like there was a lump. The doctor said it might be an ovarian cyst and that we would wait and watch. I did not want to ""wait and see,"" so I was able to get an OBGYN appt for the next day. I went there, she did a pelvic exam, felt ""fullness,"" and sent me for a pelvic sonogram (This was on 8.1). 

On 8.3, the pelvic pain became constant and I guess dull and achy (but I don't like calling it dull because it definitely hurts and I feel like I am minimizing my pain when I call it such--it is not sharp stabbing pain like it had been). I received the sonogram on 8.7. The tech got over my left ovary and said is this where the pain is? (I said: Yes it is. Do you see something?) She said she saw a cyst and went on with the sonogram. Then told me I'd here something from the doctor soon. I heard from my OBGYN about 2 weeks later saying that the sonogram was clean. I brought up what happened with the tech. They said it was a follicle and that I was ovulating. I was on my period during the sonogram. If I was ovulating like they said, I would've been on my period two weeks after the sonogram (I was not-cycle lasted 28 days like usual). I waited for my period so that I could rule out ovulation (painful ovulation last hours to a max of a couple days). Nothing helps the pain. At some point between now and 8.7, the pain went from being localized to the left to being on both sides (Kind of like a mirror: Same place but other side too). This brings us to 9.13, my next dr appt. The appt was with my PCP because I was not able to get an appt with my OBGYN until Sept 24th. 

My symptoms (I do not know if they are all related): pelvic pain that is constant, dull and achy(ish). Low back pain (I have had back pain for ages, but it has been everyday for a couple weeks, and is much more painful than normal. Frequent urination. Fatigue (probably because the pain makes it hard to sleep, and just because being in pain everyday takes a lot out of you.)

What the PCP did: Had me leave a pee sample (they did a pregnancy test and it was negative), They called the imaging center to see the sonogram and said that yes, it did look normal. They felt my my abdominal area and listened to it with a stethoscope. After that she told me she had no idea what was causing my pain, but that she thinks it is gynecological and that I should still see my OBGYN on the 24th. They also drew blood, but I don't really know what they are looking for. She wants me to call her after I go to the OBGYN because she wants to make sure that someone is dealing with my pain. She didnt want to step on their toes, but if they do not seemed concerned, she will discuss what to do next.

This whole time, I contemplate going to the hospital. I think that maybe if I do, I will be able to find out what it wrong. I do not want any pain meds. I want it fixed. I'm sitting here in pain as I type this. Part of me thinks I should wait because I've already waited this long. It interferes with my job (I am a teaching internship, and standing all day leaves every inch of me aching and I want to burst into tears while I am teaching--which is very unprofessional). 

**SO the big question is: Should I keep waiting OR should I go to the hospital?**"

What I am here for is not help or advice with social work.  But I came here to vent and ask advice on my own life.

The reason I came here is because you guys are fellow social workers and here in Chicago fall is starting which makes me more depressed.  During the darker seasons (fall/winter) I feel much worse.

I do have moments of happiness when I am with my friends on Saturday but that happiness is fake as it only lasts so long.  The rest of the week I put on a fake smile and people actually think I'm one of the happiest and funny people they know.  But in reality I am lonely and want to kill myself majority of the time.  I know I wont go through with any of my thoughts but the thoughts I do have are starting to bother me and get old.

102npl,5,2012-09-18,I am considering killing myself and having myself cryogenically frozen.,ddds98,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/102npl/i_am_considering_killing_myself_and_having_myself/,"Hello, I am an 18 year old male. I am going to college in a week. I am considering committing suicide. It is not an urgent issue, but I have been seriously thinking about this for quite some time. I still have hope because I would like to wake up in the distant future.

There are a few reasons for this. First of all, my family life is complete shit. Everyone, and I mean everyone in my family has died save my father. My mom died when I was 2 and all of my grandparents are dead. My only living relative is my father.

Naturally, he is depressed too. He has no hobbies, no real friends, nor a girlfriend. So he constantly tries to get approval from me, constantly saying ""I love you"" (literally) every 15 minutes or so. There is no substance to our relationship other than the fact that I am his entire world to him. We don't talk about anything else. It is suffocating.

Secondly, I believe that I may be transgendered. Obviously, people would tell me the solution would be to go to therapy and try to transition, but it's not that simple. If I am indeed transgendered (I'm not even sure if I am, I just might have a fucked up fetish), I would not be a real woman. I would have to ""unlearn"" 18 years of being male, adapt to being female and have to cope with having a lot of masculine features (including a deep voice, masculine face, narrow hips, etc).  I would also not be able to get pregnant and have kids. I would also have to deal with all of the transgender phobia that is circulating around. You have no idea how many people lost their jobs, friends, and sometimes lives because of this.

Thirdly, the line of work I'm getting into is not what I want to do and it robbed me of my childhood. Computer science. Instead of learning how to play basketball or skateboard I learned computer programming in middle school and neglected social interaction. I continued to do so thoughout high school, I was proud of the fact that I would become a software engineer when I grew up. However, I ha an internship at a silicon valley startup this summer and I realized I absolutely hate programming now. I would never want to do it as a job. I'm already in an engineering school and I don't know how to get out of it. I am also trying to be more social, I realize the more social and gregarious I am, my skill in computer programming diminishes. I prefer socializing over programming. 

Now, the reason for killing myself and cryogenically freezing myself is mainly because of the transgender thing. I believe in the future people will be able to get sex changes much easier than you can today (because of stem cell technology). I can just take these stem cells that will allow my penis to turn into a REAL vagina without any surgery and I would be able to have those feminine features that I would not be able to have if I transitioned today. There would also be no transphobia or discrimination because people would learn that it is a condition similar to being homosexual. This would cure most of my depression. Also, my mom is currently cryogenically frozen right now and my dad is planning on doing it as well, so in this future I will also have the family I always wanted. The computer science problem will also be solved because I will have a lot of money saved in the bank that will have accrewed interest.

Now, I have been fantasizing about this for a while. I know this is very risky but I honestly don't care anymore. I either want to be happy or be dead (at least when I'm dead there are the infinite possibilities of the afterlife I have to look forward to).

I know I am not thinking rationally right now, so I would like a rational persons input. Thank you."
102lpj,1,2012-09-18,No sleep,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/102lpj/no_sleep/,"There's so much going on I don't even know where to begin. I've gotten in this overly optimistic mode and I feel like the reality of everything that's happening to me is slowly setting in and I'm trying to block it out.

First of all due to being behind in schoolwork and house upkeep, this is the second night in a row that I have stayed up all night. Yes I know it's unhealthy but this is one of those rare times where I just NEED to catch up.

Speaking of which I have concerns for graduation. Due to a late start to the major, a high unit count (17-19) for the past year (including the summer), I haven't really had time to look into jobs yet. All the other Accounting majors already have internships now or jobs lined up for later. A online community I enjoy for accounting research is making it clear that I am nothing more than sub-par in terms of qualifications. It's making me very cynical. I am a positive person but lately I've been saying/thinking some really negative stuff. I feel irrelevant...like I'm ready to do something important but no one is noticing me. There was a meeting on campus today that didn't go well and some people were not very encouraging.

My dad had a PET scan today because there is a tumor in his kidney and suspicious fluid in his stomach. I am taking it well. I think. I don't know. Ignoring it. Telling myself it will be alright to the extent that I don't think anything is wrong with him. After all, they can just go in and remove everything. He's 55 and I'm just 22, nothing is going to be wrong. But I feel weird about it.

They put my childhood dog to sleep yesterday so that's a part of home that I will never get back.

I am working on the side of school writing papers for a good wage in order to help support myself. That's why I pulled the first all nighter.

I have the rough draft of a big project due in 8 hours and I have barely started.

I'm doing this weird thing where my free time is intersparsed between my work so I never really sit down to just relax for a few hours. I'll just browse reddit for like a half hour then go right back to work then sleep then repeat.

I have a wonderful living area near a beach and an amazing girlfriend so I hadn't really been hit with reality until tonight when I stayed up again.

It's starting to affect me all the fatigue and everything. For like the past four hours I haven't done anything really. You can probably even tell by the randomness of this post

So my question: I have class in the morning, 3 hour break, then class in the afternoon. I MUST be in these classes, I was gone a week due to bacterial bronchitis and used up absences. How do I space everything...like how should I spend the 3 hour break?

I was blissfully happy until tonight. It's one of those ""I feel it all"" days. Up to now I was just incredibly happy.

What do I do?",Numboman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102k13/reddit_im_18_years_old_my_grades_are_horrid_i_am/,"The grades I just received from my final examinations were abhorrent. I haven't been a good student, yet my parents are forcing me to go to college. I know I'm just going to be wasting my father's money. That's what I've been doing in school, wasting money. I keep trying to tell them to stop trying, I can't do any better in school, I wish I could, but I can't, but they won't listen. My dad's financial situation has gotten worse in this economy and I can't bear to burden him by having him drag my pathetic ass through college unwillingly. They think I'll never get a job unless I have a degree, and it looks like they're right. Everywhere I've looked, jobs ask for people with at least an undergraduate degree and years of experience. The one and only thing I've found myself good at is creative copywriting and every job I look for, even the most entry level of entry level positions, tell me to send in my résumé and I have 1 month of experience at a low grade ad agency where the dick Creative Director rejected everything I pitched in, because the office worked on a commission system (the less people on the credits, the bigger each person's cut) so I have no portfolio, and even when I applied for an internship at BBDO, they asked me to send in a portfolio. Nobody's going to hire an 18 year old dropout, that much is apparent.

I don't know what to do and where to go. There's no place in Chicago where I want to work and can work. If I work at McDonalds or something, I'll be paid minimum wage and I want to move out of my parents' swanky ass apartment, because I don't deserve to be there and I don't want to face my parents every day. I've disappointed them enough. However, again, nobody's going to let an 18 year old with a net worth of about 800 bucks and a few electronics sign a lease and there's no way I can expect to pay rent and utilities in Chicago at minimum wage, the taxes are nearly 10% now. To top it off, my older brother and sister are the very opposite of the spectrum for me; they've shaped my parents expectations. My brother graduated as a business major and is now working at a company and recently raked in about sixty thousand dollars in pure commission and bought himself a Saab on a whim. He's set and on his way to becoming exactly what my dad wanted for us. He also despises me for what I am, and rightfully so. My sister is in college, but she's well on her way to finishing her media and journalism double major and has already produced a major media event and moved out. There's no way I can live up to my parents' expectations and I've already contemplated suicide many times. I've never done it, because I know nobody's going to take care of my cat when I die and I really don't want to end the one shot I have at life and I know that there is a way to make it better. I just don't know it yet. Anybody know what course of action I can take from here on out?"

As of right now, I'm a 2nd year Mathematics major at UT Austin, 3.04 GPA, I have a little experience with Java, Python, and Excel, I have a leadership position in my fraternity, my only job experience is high school math tutoring and possibly working for the office of admissions at my university (will hopefully hear back soon), and I'm currently in Probability, planning on taking P/1 in the Spring.  I'm willing to go anywhere in the US for a summer internship.

The reason I ask is because if I didn't get an internship, I would just take summer classes and end up graduating a semester early.  I really don't see a point in doing so, especially considering how much I love college and college life.  I'm already relatively young for most people my grade (won't turn 21 until the summer before my 4th year) and want to enjoy my nonworking years for as long as I have left.  My parents have no problem paying for me to do an unpaid internship, as long as I'm doing something."

However, I'm not really digging my CS classes: They are very theoretical so far, and I haven't learned to program so much as I have learned to do programming exercises. I'm one class away from a CS Minor, so if I decide to major in Math, then I would definitely do that if not a few more classes. 

On the other hand, I have thoroughly enjoyed my Calc I-III sequence and I'm currently taking a proofs class and Linear Algebra I. I feel that Math is more difficult to teach yourself than programming is. Also, it seems my school's Math department has much better professors. 

I probably want a job programming though. Do Math majors have luck finding these jobs? Could I still get internships that CS majors normally take?

I could live with myself if I don't find a programming job. What other techy/mathy jobs should a Math major look for?"

I am most experienced in software development (have a summer internship under my belt) and I will be looking for jobs in that field! 

I am looking to get hired in Europe for the unique experience, and desire to travel, and I will plan to stay for a while (possibly years if the job requires it.) 

Does anyone have any tips/ experience doing something like this? Ideally I will get a job in Software Dev. or something similar, but I am not opposed to something less ""professional"" for the experience and fun!

Thanks! 
Just found this subreddit, so I hope I am doing this right."

",Kelso22340,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/102256/introduction_and_an_explanation_of_my_current/,"I wanted to start by saying that I've been lurking here for quite some time and I have been inspired and amazed at some of all of your awesome progress. Seriously, as someone who has struggled with weight issues ( a lot being psychological ) I am brought to tears some times with how great some of you have improved your lives. 


I have dealt with feeling over weight for most of my life. Not seriously over weight.. but enough to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I guess that all started around 4th grade. But, it took me until middle school to have an absolute melt down. I remember getting back my school pictures in the beginning of 6th grade and literally running to my moms car crying. I also hadn't grown into my adult teeth yet and I was convinced I looked like a fat bever. I begged my Mom to help me lose weight. She gave me tips and I joined every sports team that was offered to me. This is what I consider my eating disorder phase of my life. I became so obsessed with what I ate, I even got mad at others for eating things I couldn't around me. Thinking back on it now, it's sad to think that 12 year old me was that unhappy and obsessed. But, I lost all my chubby adolescent weight and grew out of my obsessive food issues by high school (no I was never actually diagnosed or taken to doctors, but now when this part of my life comes up my mother has said that she thinks she probably should have taken me to see someone). I went through the rest of high school as a normal teenager... not over weight but not skinny...[this](http://i.imgur.com/h2WgC.jpg) is probably the thinnest I was in HS ...around 16...looking back on the pictures now I can see how I gradually gained weight up till my [senior year](http://i.imgur.com/4NcxQ.jpg) Throughout high school I was a consistant 145-150lb ( I am 5'4)  ... I played varsity lacrosse and ice hockey... and RUINED my ankle. My senior year of high school, I went through physical therapy hoping that would fix my  ankle... but alas I was told I needed constructive surgery. 


My freshman year of college, I started out on the lacrosse team....but over christmas vacation [This](http://i.imgur.com/0ZSBa.jpg) happened. I didn't realize how little I would be able to do after surgery. I had to get rides to class... became very lazy... started smoking..quit working out...but continued to eat like an athlete.. and before I knew it I hated myself. I wouldn't look at myself in the mirror after getting out of the shower and I would never consider weighing myself. I talked myself into thinking that clothing stores had changed their sizes and that their cloths didn't fit real people anymore. I couldn't wrap my head around that I didn't fit into any of my cloths anymore... I seriously just couldn't grasp it. It took till the end of my sophomore year of college,[picture](http://i.imgur.com/6Q81J.jpg) and another [picture](http://i.imgur.com/3gI5O.jpg),when my lacrosse coach told me that I either needed to drop 30+ pounds or just not bother coming back to the team. Well... most people would say screw you and walk off the team... but after realization that I needed to weigh myself and that I really did want to play on the team and get back in shape.... I cried a lot and then decided to get on the scale. Mind you the last time I had weighed myself I was 145...and in my head.. thats what I still was. But I got on to find I weighed 170lb... and on my 5'4 frame....thats a lot to have gained. Especially considering I thought in my head I was still in shape.... So I joined the TEAM weight loss group at my local life time fitness and the whole summer of 09' I spent working out at 5am and watching everything that went in my mouth. In august before I went back to school. I had [lost 25lb](http://i.imgur.com/PyAlB.jpg)and was hoping that my friends at college would know how much effort I had made. Well, my team mates... and my room mates definitely noticed. I'll never forget how awesome it felt when I showed up at my apartment and my room mate opened the door and yelled... WOAH WHERE IS THE REST OF YOU. Unfortunately my coach didn't acknowledge my weight loss... but he didn't kick me off the team either...it felt great when all of my team was congratulating me in front of him. I don't think he really expected me to man up and do it. I played lax for the last two years of college and we had our own problems butting heads over other issues... I was always the team emotional punching bag for my coach. 

My weight fluctuated a little bit my last two years of college.. but not a bit to really make a difference... but now that I've been off living in different states for my internships... and not on a sports team... I am having a very hard time maintaining and losing the extra weight I put on after college. I moved to atlanta last fall and made a ton of friends... went out all the time... drank and started smoking again.. so of course I gained weight. I moved to connecticut last winter.... had no friends... became depressed... worked out constantly but I didn't eat enough... So I didn't lose weight then either.. I went up from 147 to 157 this past summer and am devastated... I am now living in savannah GA... and I joined a gym and havent smoked since last year... but I am again having a hard time losing weight... I have tried cutting calories... and that will work for an extent... but I am unable to get under 150. I have been working on a lot of heart rate training lately... getting my heart up to my max HR... letting it come down and getting it back up again.  I am sick of just feeling alright about my weight and I want to get the extra 15lbs off that I was unable to get off when I lost weight in college... I figure that if I post my situation here that I will hold myself accountable some how that other people know what I am trying to do. I joined a soccer team here as well trying to get some more exercise in ( Ive NEVER played soccer before in my life!)... but if anyone has any help with plateaus I am more then open to it. 

This is me [now](http://i.imgur.com/pibqf.jpg)
5'4 153lb 22 years old
and I am stuck. 
I know I don't have any huge loss to brag about and I feel like I look whiney in this post. But I figured if anyone knows about how to lose that last 15... its ya'll. 

Thank you for all your inspiration and positive encouragement loseit!

1021zp,6,2012-09-17,Best course of action when she is too busy to date?,kingofturtles,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1021zp/best_course_of_action_when_she_is_too_busy_to_date/,"I (20) met this  girl (20) a few weeks back and we hit it off rather well, spent the first week of school hanging out with each other.  Neither one of us brought up the word date, but they felt like one.  I asked her if she was dating anyone, and she replied that she was ""taking the year to focus on me, since I'll be so busy between internships, working, and school"".

After a week of being booked solid, she asked me to hang out on Saturday.  I agreed, and we had a lot of fun. Same deal the Saturday after that.  I'm just not sure what is exactly going on with us.  Am I a potential boyfriend?  A friend?  I would love to be in a relationship with her, and I feel like she is waiting for something to happen, but she pretty much explicitly stated that she wasn't looking for anything serious right now.  Should I just keep doing what I have been doing and see if anything comes of it? Or should I actively try something else?  Is there some way of finding out what ""we"" are?"
101zov,1,2012-09-17,"[22/M] led on by [21/F] for weeks, now it turns out there's a long distance BF. Is it worth trying to win her over? Or just forget about it?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/101zov/22m_led_on_by_21f_for_weeks_now_it_turns_out/,"The story starts when I met this girl through an online dating website in the spring. We had an unbelievable amount of commonalities; love to exercise, biology majors, identical fall schedules at the same school, similar interests, we even both live with our grandparents while in school! The list goes on. We went on a few dates but I didn't detect interest on her end, so I dropped contact and forgot about it. 

She texted me a couple weeks later, and a couple weeks after that, and I started thinking that maybe I was wrong and that she was actually interested. But then she left for the summer on an internship, only to contact me as soon as she was back in town, and a few more times in the days leading into the fall semester. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later, we spend almost all day, every day together in our classes, I've been in a cast so she gives me rides to school and to the gym, where we workout together. And when we aren't together we are texting each other. I'd had a girlfriend that I'd been dating almost 4 months, but broke up with her a couple weeks ago because I realized I felt so much more strongly about this girl. She is not that big of a flirt (she's acts a bit like one of the guys) but the signals were impossible to miss, even for my socially inept ass. 

So I finally ask her on a date, and she says yes, only to contact me the day of the date to say:

*""So I've been, for lack of a better term, in a long distance relationship with this guy that's in the navy for a while. It's a really weird situation, but I wanted to establish where you and I stand I guess. I have so much fun with you, and I think you're really attractive and you're smart which makes you even more attractive, but I'm worried that if I start spending more time with you I'm gonna end up in a position that I don't want to be in. If you would still like to go to dinner tonight, I will pay for myself. If not, I totally understand. I have been struggling with this since you asked me because I hate hurting people's feelings, but I don't want to lead you on/end up giving myself a reason to stay in [city] when I really don't want to be here after next semester""*

And after my reply, another:

*""I'm sorry. I really do feel awful, but I can't put myself in a position where there's a possibility of me liking you more than I do now, and it's more than I should anyway. Thank you for being cool about this. I'm sorry I didn't say something earlier.""*

I should mention, that I actually am exceptionally good looking (I know lots of people think this, but trust me), and a pretty good catch overall (if I do say so myself) and I've become quite used to winning over any girl I choose. But although I have dated my share of women, I don't date as often as people assume I would. I'm pretty picky to be honest. I'm either not attracted to the women that I share interests with, or find the attractive girls dull or too interested in partying. So to find such a match was astounding.

Suffice it to say, this rejection pretty much crushed me. I'm not a very emotional person and typically handle rejection easily, but I've never cared this much before. And to make things more difficult, I still receive rides from her each day, and we're still lab partners in class, and she seems content to be friends and continue on as normal.

But I dont know that I can do that, I feel more strongly about her than I have towards any of my long relationships even, and it kills me to be around her now. If you've read this far, I simply want advice as whether it seems worth pursuing her, as I believe she may have really been torn about this decision herself, or whether I should forget it and move on, like I usually would when finding out about a girl's relationship.

105wfg,3,2012-09-19,"[22/m] Temporarily moved back in with emotionally negligent parents, feelings of past resentment resurfacing. How do I make the best of things before I leave again?",file13bin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/105wfg/22m_temporarily_moved_back_in_with_emotionally/,"Hello Reddit, using a throwaway for this one because it’s pretty personal for me.  This will probably be a little long &amp; read like I’m on a therapist’s couch, so I apologize in advance. :(

I am 22 year old male that will be graduating in December &amp; has plans to move to the other side of the United States to start fresh with my life.  For the last 4 years, I have lived on an urban college campus, attending university. I just moved in with my parents (to save up money for the move) for my final semester &amp; am currently running into issues that I’m afraid will escalate if I don’t figure out how to manage them. 

Let me elaborate. 

I grew up an only child &amp; a latch key kid in a small town– my parents were always working and I would spend hours upon hours alone at my home. On the upside, this molded my into a very independent person. I later grew to realize my parents are very superficial people who hide their personal or emotional issues from others (even each other).  My father is emotionally negligent &amp; controlling (I think he may have some sort of OCD) while my mother grew up very sheltered &amp; is superficial/unable to accept that she's capable of any wrongdoing  (think similar to ‘sheltered suburban housewife’ meme - yeah).  This made for a very lonely upbringing where my emotional problems were rarely consoled by my parents.  I harbored resentment towards my father, as he always made me feel like I wasn’t good enough.  My mother seemed so submissive &amp; self-centered that she didn’t do much to help the situation &amp; I didn’t know what to do besides just swallow my emotions.  I never acted out, never revolted against my parents - I harnessed my resentment through the arts and became a relatively successful musician in the closest metro music scene. I did very well in high school, graduated with honors, &amp; coped with the loneliness… until I fell into depression in college.

My band that I had dedicated my teenage life towards broke up, I lost a lot of friends, got involved in a toxic two-year relationship, &amp; found myself popping in &amp; out of therapists/psychologists offices for a whole year.  I was diagnosed with chronic depression, severe social anxiety, ADHD – got put on &amp; off medications, lost interest in almost everything in my life, college GPA plummeted, confusion &amp; anxiety happened on almost a daily basis. I was going to drop out.

Then I got a surprise scholarship to study abroad &amp; spent a good portion of this last summer overseas in many foreign countries.  It was a breath of fresh air &amp; the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got back in touch with who I really am, stopped taking my meds, made new friends, and did well in my classes. I felt like my life had somehow escaped a car crash &amp; I had a whole newfound appreciation for everything.  I felt free to live my life, rather than be haunted &amp; held down by past experiences.

Now here I am, Reddit, in my final semester in college – staying healthy, working out, working a job &amp; internship, &amp; trying to stay focused on my studies.  But I feel like I’m starting to become undone again. It’s difficult with this living situation, I find myself slipping back into the person that I was before I left overseas – depressed, anxious, easily irritated, overwhelmed.  I’ve talked about my previous issues with my parents (Finally addressing the loneliness of growing up) &amp; I can tell they somehow, in someway, empathize with me – but I can’t help but feel they transformed my bad situation into OUR bad situation &amp; now they feel bad for themselves for not being “good parents” so it turned into a pity party.  And I don’t want them to feel that way.  But it does makes me angry that I feel lonely again in a situation where I reached out to them &amp; didn’t get anything of substance in return.  They just don’t know how to address my issues, which I don’t expect them to – but they also don’t really TRY to address them either.

I’m tired of feeling lonely but I don’t want this to escalate into something more – that’s the last thing I want before I move away.  Despite the resentment, I want to leave on good terms – I regret when I act out due to suppressed anger.  I don’t attempt to try and make them understand much anymore because I think we may never see eye to eye, and that’s probably my fault for staying silent so many years – they just don’t understand how much of an emotional toll it took on me. 

I feel like maybe I haven’t thought about the right way to go about things &amp; there is a way I can get through to my parents that I haven’t though of…? Am I doing something wrong? Or are my parents really just negligent towards emotional issues? If I can’t get through to them, should I just avoid being at the house as much as possible to avoid any issues? 

I need you’re advice, Reddit!  It’s only a 4 months or so until I’m out of this, but it’s a big turning point in my life &amp; I don’t want to regret anything before I leave them! 



**TLDR: Grew up with emotionally negligent parents, went to college &amp; became a sadass w/ depression, went overseas &amp; perked my happyass back up.  Now temporarily living at home again &amp; my happyass is starting to droop into a sadass again. Don't want to blast ass all over my parents before I leave. What do?**



Edit: Wow. That was really long. So I gave it a TLDR. Sorry.

I've been to two weeks several times in the last year and have always found the 2 week mark to be a turning point when some brain fog would start to dissipate.  I have to say, this time, not happening.  I just feel like I'm in this weird head space.  I feel very cut off from myself.  Could be about starting school and my internship (social work grad student).  So definitely a really stressful time.  

I'm hoping that no PMO along with giving up my internet connection at home (still can access internet on my phone for emergencies) will make a difference.  In the past, with every abstinence attempt, general internet browsing would be OUT OF CONTROL!!!  And eventually, the scattered mind from internet browsing would lead me to PMO.

- How important are grades versus all the rest?  Have any of you been accepted while having a strong application but lacking outstanding grades?

- Do you have any advice when reaching out (through e-mail) to a professor who has research interests that line up with mine?  Just how important is this?


Lastly, any other words of wisdom?  I sort of feel like I don't know what I'm doing, I'm not sure if I'll ever be accepted anywhere, and I actually don't know a single peer who is applying for graduate school even though we are graduating this year.

The only network I've ever worked with is my home network which is made up of a few computers, a printer, a router, and the modem. So aside from basic commands like ipconfig, ping, tracert, and turning stuff off and on again, I have no actual idea how to troubleshoot problems on a larger network. So can you help?

What are common problems you see with larger networks? What are some common commands I should know how to use? Are there any online resources to learn a few things quickly before the interview? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

While in college I have used a wide variety of other languages though, which I created a few small to medium academic projects in. These languages were C#, Python and Java. Now this was a few months to a year ago. So I have used these languages before, and could easily read their syntax. However, I would not feel comfortable writing code in them by memory or answering specific language interview questions. Is it wrong to list these languages as a skill? Should my resume only contain the languages I know strongly or all the ones I've technically worked with before?

As someone newer to the industry I guess I feel like with just C and a few other things listed in my skills section it would seem pretty empty. But on the other hand I would hate to list all the languages I've worked with but am not up to date with and get grilled in an interview. 

Ideally it would be nice to find a job in C, and I will be applying to these jobs. But, would I be perceived as having a narrow skill set with only C listed as a programming language skill?

This affects all aspects of my life...fml

It's empowering to know, but when I first realized this I felt like I got bricked in the face and trying to break the cycle I decided not to be hard on myself...

Anyways, the specific situation is that I joined a start up in February (I was jobless at the time) to learn and build my portfolio and started working a very demanding job a few months in.

At first, I was supposed to write content but now my boss has marketing and I'm not sure with the stress of my new job that I can continue..

I need to have 'the talk' to tell her how much I can handle. She's trying to grow her business and I don't want to just walk away but she's also become a friend and I feel bad that I can't handle both my day gig and this.

Also, at the start she said I'd have the freedom to do what I want with no mention of deadlines or specific goals so it seemed easy to handle given other commitments. Now I have other folks she's hired assigning me laundry lists of 'action items' for this unpaid gig.

How do you quit a job or internship without feeling bad about it? Especially if it's a friend? How do you determine it's just too much for you? The hardest part was realizing I'm just spreading myself too thin.."
104x37,1,2012-09-19,Is college worth it?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/104x37/is_college_worth_it/,"I am a freshmen who entered college not five weeks ago, declared in computer science.  My college experience so far has really disillusioned me towards an institution that, growing up was just assumed as the next logical step in any well-off teenager's life after high-school.  And I am well off.  My parents have always placed education highly, putting money into a state plan to allow me to enroll wherever I choose (in state, of course). On top of the other state-awarded scholarships, my decision to go to the college I'm currently at was heavily influenced by a full tuition paid scholarship, that came with a subsequent internship in my field.  The only point I'm trying to make here is money shouldn't really be an issue I'm worried about, in the sense of student loans or running my parents bankrupt.  But money is one of the primary reasons I'm considering quitting.

I think everyone agrees, to an extent, college is a bit of a rip-off.  We generally go along with it due to it being a pre-requisite to most higher paying jobs, etc, etc (you're all pretty smart, I don't need to tell you what you already know). But if I don't want those higher paying jobs, as my experience with my internship suggests, why bother? Throughout my entire high school career I did intern at the local university, developing software in a very relaxed environment, and enjoyed it greatly, but this cynical fast-paced ""enterprise""-ridden job I currently hold is ruining my love of computers. That's not how I want it to be. And to be clear, I understand not all companies are like that, but just by my nature I'd rather learn and grow in the subject on my own time, at my own pace.

So, barring you haven't stopped reading after deciding this is just ""another stuffy college student complaining about nothing"" (and I wouldn't blame you), this is the plan I see for myself:

* Probably call my parents today, and tell them that I am at least having some doubt about college.  I'll fill them in on any quick worries they might have, but mainly just so it's not a full shock when they come down in two weeks when we can discuss it more.  Such worries might include:
	* Will I finish the semester? Yes.
	* Depending on how much we've already put down on housing deposits on the next semester, will I stay for that one too if needed? Yes.
	* Am I depressed? No.
	* Is it because I'm having trouble with my classes? No.
	* Is it because I'm not meeting enough new people? No.
	* Is it because my dog just died? No.
	
* Continue to mull this over and give it a lot of thought. 
* Discuss it more with my parents at length when they come for parents weekend.  Most likely I'll suggest (to hopefully ease their worries) that I'll just take a semester off as a trial run, something to that effect, not to completely rule out returning.
* Move back home at the end of the semester, and quickly find a job.  I want to be independent, so I'll do lots of extra chores around the house until I can pay some form of rent, and slowly ween my self off their dependence (phone bill, car insurance, health insurance) and eventually find a place of my own.

Basically that's it. That's my plan.  And while I have a few other things to clarify, it's probably a good time to ask my actual questions: how much of this sounds like bullshit?  Does this seem like a bad idea? Should I just ""man up"" and deal with the stresses of collegiate life like everyone else? Also, as financial security is always a concern, should I just bite the bullet for that reason alone? Give me your wisdom, Reddit (anything else about the situation I've left out or you think would be helpful, just ask).

And finally some other things that could factor in to your answer(s):

* I generally have a good deal of anxiety over things, whether it be tests, work, or something else unless I have 100% confidence in myself I know what I am doing.  This is another reason I think ""college-level"" jobs my not be for me, at least for the time being.  I'd rather work at something I can do very very well (food services, for instance) and be happy.
* I'm a very frugal person, and already live very minimally (yes, I know this is easy to say as a college student, so feel free to call me on this if you think it's an important point to emphasize), so the wages of the jobs I'm looking for should suffice my lifestyle needs.
* Adding onto the last point, I've always saved half of of what I've earned (at my father's behest), so I have about $6000 in the bank.  While I may not be able to add a full half my salary at the wages I'd be making, I'd say that's a pretty strong security net for a nineteen year old.  

**TLDR:** Not happy with college, would rather be happy.

[If you had only primitive weapons, and had to fight a dinosaur to the death in a ""Dinosaur Death Match"", what is the biggest dinosaur you think you could defeat? You don't have to give a specific dinosaur, just give us a general size. Also you can't set traps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4uxt?context=5)|I would find a way to blind the dinosaur first thing... i would construct primitive dust and sand bombs.  If all I have is primitive weapons after he is blind I can let him flop about until tired.  Once tired I would sling baseball sized rocks at its head from a distance until knocked out.  Then I would stick it with a sharp stick through its blinded eyes into its brain and win.

[Have you ever worked with Kanye? How much of your work is influenced by his contributions to the art?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3k3r?context=5)|Never worked with Kanye. He is damn talented at what he does but Im not too fond of his personality. I can't say I am really influenced by what he does.  No denying he is extremely talented.  On a side note:  [i really enjoy this version of this song by him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P3_8ifqZlM)
[Do the artists you've worked with act like they're better than everyone else?  Have you ever smoked with Rick Ross?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3gyf?context=5)|Yknow I never really had issues with artists and ego problems.  I'm not much of a toker so no I did not blaze with rick ross.

[How do you go about making your beats?  Specifically, do you have a specific technique that you use when you start out with a track to make you able to finish it? I usually have problems finishing a started project when I produce.    Was it hard breaking into the music industry? How did you go by making it to the top?    Any rapper you've worked with who was nothing like the person they try to portray themselves in their songs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3k6b?context=5)|Far as making the beats: i usually start off with melody, then do the drums, layout, hook, start a mix. and then leave it alone till the next day and work on the mix again, and minor tweaks untill im satisfied with it.  I was fortunate enough to be invited into the Anno Domini collective a while back.  Lots of super talented producers with varying styles that compliment each other.  From here I was able to help produce for many different artists.  Then I joined Shadowville and things really took off.  . Its not a piece of cake, but if you work hard, stay focused -  time just passes by, one thing happens after the next and all the sudden u look around and you're in there with the majors...  As far as artists who are not true to their rhymes... :)  theres many... but personality wise I found almost all the artists Ive worked with to be pretty grounded.
[Do you feel hip hop has changed drastically since the days of Tupac and Biggie. And if so, for the better or worse? I know many people who feel its gotten worse.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3i9b?context=5)|Great question.  I wont say that the current state of hiphop sucks.  Its evolving.  I do sometimes feel as though you have to dig slightly deeper to find the gems.  I miss Pac and Big a lot - On a sideways thought, I recently remixed a 2PAC song but because of copy-write laws here in Germany i cant seem to get it uploaded.  Bummin'
[What track did you produce that you feel the most prideful about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a49jp?context=5)|I have one unreleased track that I want to do a video for and am probably most proud of.  The track features Method Man and is amazing.  Hopefully I can get a video for in the next couple of months. As far as stuff that I have released I really like the new Choo Biggz stuff.  Ive given him some good beats and he has put that NY sound over them really well.  So probably ""Pay Homage"" by Choo.
[How much money did you make selling platinum on the streets?  And what prompted the career change into hiphop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5m56?context=5)|I c what u did there.
[How did you get started in producing? And how did you get noticed enough to do songs for the bigger names? A buddy of mine does phenomenal work, producing his own beats as well as for local hip hop and R&amp;B artists. But despite his talent nothing serious has materialized. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5nvv?context=5)|Started one day not giving a shit about failing. Kept trying to make moves, and trying to myself in THAT position. So many people quit after the first time they get shot down.  Its probably 20 to 30 rejections before the first bit of recognition or appreciation.  Thats not even a big bit.  Then snowballs slowly into something bigger.  Sure, things will happen on their own, but you have to set up the scenario for that shit to happen. if that makes sense?. Being good at what you do is important of course, but what you do with your talent is even more important.  Lots of unrefined talent in this world. Sure a slight bit of luck plays a role but you have to work to give yourself something to start with.  My big break was really getting hooked up with the guys at Anno Domini and we started building together.  Also Shadowville has helped lots of aspiring rappers discover my beats.  I didnt do it all myself.  Tell your friend who makes beats to keep doing that...  maybe someday he'll look down and see a lil golden nugget in his pan.  Thanks for the question.
[What hip-hop artists are you currently listening to, and what artists would you like to produce for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4j0v?context=5)|I still listen to a LOT of wu tang - redman.  Artists I would love to work with:  The legendary R.A The Rugged Man... 50cent... Brother Ali.
[Do you like Ali's new album? Favorite tracks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6j3l?context=5)|I haven't listened to Brother Ali's newest album but am aware it was released.  Ill be picking it up soon though for sure.  What are your favorite tracks on the album?
[I loved ""Letter to My Countrymen"" when he first played it at soundest two years ago. Such a great rhythm with the delivery. ""My Beloved"" is another one I love.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6mzv?context=5)|Right on.  Ill pay sure to listen close.  Brother Ali is an amazing combination of soul/talent.  Truly a wonderful person.
[*truly a wonderful person.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6pgm?context=5)|Sorry no.  Just by what I read about him and have watched of him through the many years that I have been a fan.  My bad.  I recently read a good article he wrote on Homophobia in Hiphop.  The guy is a clear thinker.  I respect him greatly.
[How do you feel about the multitude of fake gangstas like Rick Ross who are making music?Who are some good up and comers to watch for in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3tac?context=5)|Interesting question... I understand about C/O Rick Ross and that controversy - and the taking of the name of Freeway Ricky Ross etc. I dont think he was unoriginal as much as paying homage when he picked that name.   However, Rick Ross can still put out good music in my ears. His lyrics are ehhh quite often but his beats are bangin'.  I try to avoid being a hater.  Also a lot of the thug stuff you mention is rooted in the fact that music is an ENTERTAINMENT industry... A lot of stuff is fake. I dont know ross personaly, i dont know how real or fake he is. I enjoy working most with people that are real with their rhymes (hard to find though). i dont want to bash rick ross or anybody for that matter. Still i do prefer people who put truth into rhymes.  Thanks for the question.
 |Edit up and comers -  Choo Biggz, Cryptic Wisdom, Jokerr.  I just did the beat and edited the footage for [Choo's new video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wb6vTXNfqs)  He has a rugged voice and raw NY sound that really like.
[What specifically have you worked on that went platinum? Also what do you do with your platinum records? Hang them on the wall, eat off them, cover them in drugs, or sell them on eBay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3m3e?context=5)|The platinum album was with a french group called Sexion D'assaut - they are one of the biggest [french hiphop groups](http://youtu.be/4MzYca2HbRs)
[Who was you favorite artist to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3eh6?context=5)|Shyheim... aka the rugged child... he is the youngest member of Wu-Tang.  The guy is like a brother to me.  Also a New York artist named Choo Biggz.  Both of those guys are like family to me.
[""Gunshots, they travel throught my projects quickly...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6rfd?context=5)|Haha. one of the greatest in my eyes! :)
[When it comes to making music, how much of the creativity is from the artist, and how much is from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ia4?context=5)|My creativity really comes out when I am alone and working on the beat.  Its kind of something I build until I am happy with it.  From there it is up to the artist to continue to build.  Sometimes I have to accomidate X number of bars that an artist wants - or mix something up but usually when an artist gets a beat from me my work is 90% done.  
[When you send a beat to a producer is it structured for verses/choruses? Does the artist specify this? I'm interested in producing  and I've never thought of how this works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ag7?context=5)|Seems online the standard popular beat seems to be 2 or 3 verses of 16 bars with a chorus.  Artists request this to be mixed up sometimes if what they have written needs accommodating. So yah the artist can specify.  I suggest you give producing a try... it turned from a hobby into work for me.
[What are your thoughts on Lil Wayne and his whole posse (drake, that one annoying chick, etc\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5951?context=5)|I dont really like to diss people... Lil Wayne and his group of friends are successful at what they do. I dont have room to speak on him as I dont listen to his stuff if I can manage.  Still he found a demographic that pays his bills and covers his teeth in diamonds.  So its whatever. Still I could easily think of 10 other talented artists that deserve the money he is making.   
[Do you wipe your tears with hundreds because of piracy?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a87e5?context=5)|10s and 20s.
[Awesome. Great AMA btw. To be honest I kind of miss the 90s stuff. Who is the most exciting person you've worked with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3mtc?context=5)|:)  I miss the 90s stuff too.  Shyheim... he had some of the best music back in the day also he belonged to my favorite hip hop group ever. Thanks for taking the time to ask. :)
[What is your opinion of Kreayshawn, V-Nasty and Lil' Debbie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6c00?context=5)|Hmmm... I actually like Kreayshawn.  That V-nasty/Gucci man album was...   - Lil Debbie is alright.  Kreayshawn is talented.
[When you create and write a beat/song/whateverthefuckyouwannacallit, can you take us through the process that goes on inside your head? What instruments and tools do you use? Thanks for this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4jea?context=5)|Hey, I always take a different approach to things. But i just GO! I don't really think much about what I am doing. I just start creating something. I know this is probably a weird answer, but its the best I can give ya :) Thanks!
[How many blowjobs do you think you've received? Like 4000? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ai2i7?context=5)|Over 9000.
[Could you tell us your daily schedule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5qb3?context=5)|Try not to sleep in if I can help it - usually around 7... check emails/facebook stuff -  make a cup or two of coffee, make beats, workout, elaborate on beats - take an hour or 2 chill time, and work on the beats some more. Of course random meals in there.  Thats typically my life at home. When I am on the road its much much diffrerent.
[If you could work with any artist and/or producer, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ycg?context=5)|Rza.
[What midi controller(s\) do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Midi is a CME UF60 right now.
[Is sampling ""copyright infringement""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Of course sampling is a part of hiphop.  It can be infringement though for sure.  Getting clearance for a sample can be expensive and difficult and I can see sampling something for a mixtape or something - but to just jack entire parts of tracks ie Vanilla Ice on David Bowie  - I think theres a line there thats actually pretty clear when you look at it.
[What about when it's fantastic, like Frank Ocean using the whole instrumental from Hotel California for his song American Wedding? I'd think more people would fight for Vanilla Ice if he was actually good like FO.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7lou?context=5)|You might be right.  I think Frank Ocean ripped almost the entire song though without the lyrics if Im not mistaken.  that's cool if you're not going to sell it on itunes or make any money on it.  If its for the love of the art then no problem but making money on others people work without them being compensated I think is where the problem was with FO.
[Whole song, no lyrics. On a mixtape (Nostalgia/Ultra\), no money made, yet The Eagles are trying to sue the shit out of FO. I can almost guarantee it was just for the love of the art, and it's ridiculous to sue over what could be considered an homage to a legendary band.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7qzl?context=5)|Yah we let people use our beats for mixtapes for free as long as they dont make money on it.  As soon as they are making money on it we would like to be compensated for our contribution just like any other business.  If its for the love of the art and not for sale on itunes I dont see the issue.
[What are your thoughts on rappers like Childish Gambino? and what do you think of the way he cooperates with the guy who makes his beats wirh him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xw5?context=5)|Donald Glover is super talented.  Acts well, raps well... my only slight criticism would be his sometimes shallow content. Too many references to his dick I think it was that bothered me.  His videos are good too... he has a lot of resources to work with.  
[Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3f78?context=5)|I watched the video.  It was decent.  Reminds me of Pitbull for some reason.
[Do you think rap is better or worse now compared to the '90s?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ybc?context=5)|There is something about the 90s hiphop that was real and raw... it was new.  Fresh off the shelf.  It was original.  There seems to be slightly more rehashed product out there.  I try not to hate... I try not to say ""hiphop these days.""  But yes I think maybe because a lot of what went on with hiphop in the 90s was happening for the first time and it felt really alive and sometimes I do feel current day music in general is flooded with redundant mediocre stuff.  There was lots of mediocre stuff in the 90s too.  :)  Its a toss up.
[I tend to stay away from mainstream rap because, its generally shit. Whats your favorite song of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5yix?context=5)|In The Mood by Glenn Miller.

Nice find!  Thanks for diggin' that up.  Back in 1998 i was listening to a ton of DMX.  SMH at his lyrics. ""Kind of like a bitch with an erection"" - def would have rather heard something similar to slippin' over that beat.

[Have you heard of Flosstradamus or baauer?  What do you think about the cross over of electronic music and trap? (personally, i think its awesome\)  With the explosion of electronic music in nearly every genre, would you ever try to incorporate electronic music into your own sound?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88tu?context=5)|Nope just looked up Flosstradaumus.  Interesting stuff.  I love when people push boundaries and electronic music as a whole is doing just that.  A couple producers over here at Anno Domini have messed a little with the electronic vibe.  I personally have not... who knows in the future though :)  I might give it a try someday.

[Hi, i have a freind named austin who wants to be a rapper, i was wondering if you could check out some of his stuff and i could pass on anything you have to say, here is his youtube link.  (Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ai5zv?context=5)|Whattup.  I checked that stuff.  He's a youngster still and will grow.  He sounds like he trying to emulate wayne.  You should get him to listen to some Brother Ali or something with more emotion in it.  His rhymes are decent but lacking emotion.  Sometimes switchin up the content to something a little more heartfelt can bring that out.  Im not saying to rap like a pussy but Im saying suggest to him to think about widening his range.  The best part about this kid is he is decent and so young - so as he gets older his flow gunna tighten up and his experiences going to color his rhymes a little more.  I respect the effort it takes to do what hes doing.  Send him my regards.  Take care.

First RIP Eyedea.  Saw him perform his song Now! live and he didnt miss a beat. That guy was so damn talented.  I literally cried the day he passed away.
 |Watching the Sayers grow has been amazing.  From back when slug was rapping on Dynospectrum to being a ceo of a multimillion dollar label.  Pretty damn impressive.  Plus they have stayed a family through it all as well.  Thats sick. My favorite Atmosphere track is Guarentees and that video is sick.  Brother Ali's track Forrest Whitiker is a classic already in my opinion.  They do good stuff.  RIP Eyedea.

[Do you have a discography? i'm having trouble finding one online ... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4lde?context=5)|Here is a list of Anno producers - as well as som of the stuff that we have worked on.  Thanks for taking the time to look me up :)  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini_Beats)
[Thoughts on J Cole?  Great AMA, real down to earth guy. Keep grindin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aauez?context=5)|Sick, thanks bonersoup for the read.  J Cole writes incredibly well.  I mean next level expressing himself.  A+ lyricist.  Thanks again for the comment.
[Would you ever work with Shaquille O'neal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6qju?context=5)|On a song.  LoooL - I would try for sure...  Have to make a slow temp west coast beat for him.
[How was Ghostface Killah is he really a scary dude as everyone says he is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aaqvg?context=5)|Yes!  Do Not Stare Ghostface Killah in the face.  It will not end well!
[I am freaking out MAN!! Which songs did you produce in particular for him and Method, also did you work with any one in Wu Tang?  Edit: Other than Method for the second question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aazxt?context=5)|Haha. yup, also, along side Meth and ghost, got Inspectah Deck, and prodigal sunn.
[Hey :D.  Firstly, which DAW do you use to make your beats? (I'd imagine FL Studio\). Also, do you have a favorite VST for sounds, or for effects? Finally, where do you get your drum samples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5t9t?context=5)|Much in FL - East West plugins are great! As far as drum samples no specific place. where ever i find them/come across them.
[Yo.. Did you buy fl when you started using it? Because its a great tool to learn on and I've recently started my own journey in producing, but I couldn't buy fl if I wished right now. I mean as soon as I ever think about selling a beat made with it I'll buy it, but until then, no dice. How about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6abznx?context=5)|Yes, FL studio is great! One of the best programs out.
[I noticed you've worked with both Shyheim and other Wu-members/affiliates.  I won't ask specifics about them, but does beef between artists ever effect your business or who you can, will, or won't work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a8xus?context=5)|It has not affected my business that much.  Its interesting though because a certain artist that will remain nameless used one of my beats to diss 50cent without my permission - and Im tight with a few of the NY guys and respect the hell out of 50.  So I can see where it can cause some problems.  It hasn't for me.  I try to keep things professional and not let personal suff bother production.  Thanks for the question.
[This is awesome I really enjoy the Anno Domini Beats. I am also a producer but having such a hard time finding people who wanna use my beats. I am interested how did you do it. When was your big break? Any tips for a young producer like myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a77wp?context=5)|Thanks for the support man... not just from me but from the rest of the Anno Domini family.  It is a big struggle at first man but persistence will pay its dividends. I would say my big defining moment or big break was when I got method man to record over one of my beats.  Really proud then.
[Ever work with Nas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a75ed?context=5)|Na never worked with Nas.  One Mic and all the stuff he did with Damien Marley is awesome stuff though.
[Are you upset with Kool Keith's exit from hip hop?  Also, are you friends with KutMasta Kurt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6e0m?context=5)|I think he said he was only considering retiring.  Still he has had massive influence so his contribution was apparent a long time ago.  I just looked it up - he performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos recently :) 
[Top 5 hip hop/rap artists? favorite RA track? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xbb?context=5)|R.A's verse on Uncommon Valor is unparalleled. Also the track he did with vinnie paz ""Nosebleed"" is sick.
 |Top 5 so hard to say... 5 of my favorites besides already mentioned: 50, wu tang, dmx, redman, choo biggz 
[Who's your favourite rapper right now?  Ever produced for Curren$y?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a65yx?context=5)|Ive never produced for Curren$y and as far as I know no one else from the Anno Domini collective has either. Favorite rapper right now is a toss up.  I like a lot of the guys from New York:  Shyheim, Choo, 50 etc.
[I'm wise of you man, you produce on Shadowville as well if I'm right?  I've recorded a few tracks over your beats, you're a great producer, I am unable to afford your exclusives though, latest beats are so amazing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adx0b?context=5)|Hey, yea. thank you very much! Its ok to use the beats for non-profit as long as credit is given.
[No mention of illimatic???!!!,??!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7vj5?context=5)|Illmatic was revolutionary for sure. Beats/Rhymes - agreed deserve a mention.
[What are your thoughts on immortal technique and lowkey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a750f?context=5)|Its hard with Tech because I love 84% of what he does and 100% of how he does it.  I think my issue with Tech is the same as my issue with Vinnie Paz.  They are saying some real shit and its easy to get into. Then sadly... bam... vinnies talking about skeletons on the moon and Im lost.  Still Immortal Technique is wonderfully talented and from what I have seen of Lowkey he is as well.  I haven't seen much of him though.  What is you favorite lowkey song that I should check out?
[The last song I recorded over one of your beats was 2 years back: Link to www.hotnewhiphop.com.  My latest: www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvJUnWaIcSA.  You're really talented man, love from the UK! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adzbl?context=5)|Damn dude you are talented for sure.  Very talented.  Stay writing brother.  You are already good at what you do with room to grow.  You could be making some big moves with your rhymes.  I appreciate their honesty a lot.  Sick.  Respect.
[I'd say long live palestine, something wonderful, and just shine, to name a few. Very talented. Have you heard hopsin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7tm8?context=5)|Thanks for the suggestions.  Yes I have heard of Hopsin'...  I think he has blown up almost as much as anyone over the last year.  His content is refreshing and his delivery is on point.  He's a talented guy.
[How much do you get paid to make beats? Also, if a song blows up, do you get more in return?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a78ev?context=5)|How much Im paid varies on the project.  Specifics Im contractually not allowed to disclose but yes... if the song is a hit that number skyrockets for sure.
[Have you heard of Jay Park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a57yw?context=5)|I have actually.  He blew up on youtube a couple years ago.
[Who's handling your publishing/admin?  I hate to mix business with Reddit, but it sounds like you should be making some serious mechanical income.  Regardless, keep up the grind and the great placements!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7czu?context=5)|Thanks for taking the time to ask a question.  Out here the royalty company is called the GEMA.  They handle the royalty stuff.
[How rich are you? Do you have porsche? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aca68?context=5)|Not rich... no porsche.  Older Benz :)
[Do you think Vinnie Paz should have used Anno Domini's version of ""Same Story"" for his album?  I LOVE the Scott Stallone version though (been trying to get that instrumental + Domini's for a while now!\). Was just wondering about your thoughts. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a9q0l?context=5)|Naw, I think Vinnie did whats best for his music.  The dude is a beast on the mic and he typically makes good decisions regarding beats.  I support his decision.  Its kind of a blessing anytime someone of his caliber is willing to even get on your beat.  He's does excellent work and he has long ago established himself as an underground legend.
[I'll have to check your stuff out, you come across as an intelligent reasonable person.  What are your thoughts on the electronic scene with artists like Deadmouse, Skrillix and Flying Lotus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88s2?context=5)|Thanks a lot.  I have listened to some Skrillix.  There is some good stuff there but for the most part I am not really into electronic music for I think the same reason some people arent into hiphop.  the repetitive noises do get to me a bit more in electronic stuff not exactly sure why because I know the same exists in hiphop to some degree.
[Do you get paid at all by all the basketball highlight clips on YouTube that use your beats? see comments all the time saying, ""the beat's way better than the video!"" that's how i'd heard of you fwiw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a62mw?context=5)|There is actually a contract in place for some of the baskeyball highlight videos and of course others are fan made.  I dont know much about contract specifics but yes our music was licensed for those videos.
[Sick beats you got there...  When you say platinum selling, what platinum hits have you provided beats for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab6p0?context=5)|Thanks a lot man.  The only platinum track I was a part of was with the beat I made for a french group called Sexion D'assaut.  [Here is the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzYca2HbRs&amp;feature=youtu.be)
[Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're rockin' this AMA as well btw! My favorite beat artist is Dave Tipper. If you want to hear creative beats and sounds in a studio, he's a true pioneer with noise! This is one of his latest EP's. Peace!  Bubble Control.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab1x2?context=5)|Wow.  thats strange stuff.  the beginning was almost like theme music for a swimming level in a mario game   Enjoyed the share again.  thanks :)
[My friend said he's still recording it this week (He's in college\) would it be cool with you that I send you the link after he finishes the recording? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a91rp?context=5)|Of course man.  I login to reddit once a week or much more so just shoot me a link here when you get it.  Take care.
[How did you get with French rappers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6jnn?context=5)|Their manager contacted me after they had heard my beats.  That was the start of it.
[Do you speak French? How was the communication with foreign artists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6o57?context=5)|Nope. I dont speak french and it was nearly impossible to commuicate correctly with them.  Hahaha :)  But damn something clicked between us.
[Why are you selling Platinum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aa2cs?context=5)|Four and one eighth to the left.
[I think your beats are amazing and I've been writing a promo halloween track to one for a few weeks now. Cheers dude!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ahrkq?context=5)|Thanks a lot man.  Hit me up on here when the track is finished so I can give it a listen.  Thanks for checking out my ama :)
[Anno Domini! Wow, I remember when I first started writing scouring through soundclick and the first pages I would check would be Anno Domini, actually until this day I still do, so major props to you. Was going to add a question for the fuck of it, but fuck it. Keep doing your thing.

**3.450** sleeping in fighters for **8 months!** 

Imagine yourself in your pyjamas, or like jaxspider in your birthday suit, on a random night, before the day you have an important appointment early in the morning. Before you are ready to enter the [magical dream world](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/) you quickly set your alarm before you forget it. You fall asleep, your head being cuddled by the soft pillow, not realising what tomorrow will actually bring you.     
The next morning your alarm goes off. It's one of your favorite songs which you decided to use as an alarm, because then you would wake up happy. You hate it now. And because you are getting irritated as hell, you turn the alarm quickly off.      
You turn your head, now looking in the shadows instead of the light coming behind of the curtains, taking a deep breath.     
*""I can rest for another 5 minutes""* you think, followed by a gape.       
Your eyes close slowly.       
You open them again but there is something wrong.      
You feel awake. *too awake*. You look quickly at your clock and realise that in the what seemed like 5 seconds time, an hour has gone by. And the three feared words rush through your mind resulting in feeling a cold shiver down your spine: *I'm too late*. 

Now imagine the fact that there exists a subreddit, capable of making that scene never happen in your life (again). Sounds good right? What if i told you it exists? ""Get Out""! You will yell.      

Well, I'm glad i had found this subreddit because i've had multiple encounters with the sleeping in experience. With some big impact as result. Let's not get into details, i will just say it had something to do with the following words: Friends, weekend, job, no job. So i am more than happy to feature this subreddit, for you.

/r/GetOutOfBed gives you the best tips and tricks to get out of bed or to improve your sleep. For every person whose brain [decideded](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/yytsm/august_28_2012_rmyevilplan_my_evil_plan_is_to/) to get him/her almost every morning, this could be the antidote. But waking up by using an [irish waking song](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=KgoczbY99OA) isn't enough. You need to get out of bed immediately.

So, are you getting excited to learn more about /r/GetOutOfBed? I had an informative talk with the friendly /u/ashrewdmint, moderator and creator of /r/GetOutOfBed, who will give you an idea of how /r/GetOutOfBed looks like.


&gt;##1.How did you come up with the idea to make /r/GetOutOfBed? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** At the start of this year, i really wanted to start getting out of bed regularly. I was inspired by other self-help subreddits and decided to start my own, just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, i have fallen off the bandwagon myself, but i'm glad to know that it's still a resource that helps others. 

&gt;##2.What sort of posts does one find here? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** Anything about sleep or sleep hacking is welcome, including tricks to get yourself out of bed. Sometimes people will post a nightly thread to announce they will get out of bed at a certain time in the morning or not to sleep in. 

&gt;##3.What is the best tip/trick you have seen posted? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** a popular trick is to practice getting up in the morning by using this: http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/ 

&gt;##4.Can    you    tell    me    in     a    few    sentences    why    i    should    /r/GetOutOfBed?     A    reason    to    improve    my    sleep?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Well,    it    seems    that    sleep    is    really    a    challenge    for    people    in    developed    countries    and    we    never    seem       to    get     enough    of    it.    I    think    the    fact    that    most    people    have    a    hard    time    getting     out     of    bed    in     the    morning,    or    wake    up    uncomfortably    to    a    blaring    alarmclock,    is    a    sign    that    something    is    wrong.    Besides    just    the    quality    of    life    issue,    there’s    also    a    personal    motivation    issue    involved    with    sleeping    in.    I    want    to    wake    up    motivated    and    energized,    not    lazy    or    depressed.    And    I    think     that    you    can’t    really     isolate    the    selfcontrol    aspect    from    the    sleep    quality    or    health    quality    aspect.    I    find    that    if    I    get    bad     sleep,    forcing     myself    to    get    up    at    a    regular    hour    isn't    sustainable.    Ultimately    it    comes    down    to    what    you    want    from    your    life.    Do    you    want     to    feel    refreshed    and    energized    and    motivated     instead     of    lazy    and    complacent    when    you    first    wakeup?    Do     you    want    to    optimize    your    sleep    and    feel    great?    If    so,    then     I    think    those    ideals    naturally    lead    to    /r/GetOutOfBed.


&gt;##5.I   wake    in    the    middle    of     the     night     out     of     nowhere     multiple     times.     How     can    i    prevent     this    from    happening    again?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Sleep    is    pretty    complicated,    and    I'm    not    too    qualified    to    Shell    out    advice.    But    I    can    list    things    that    have    helped    for    me    or     things    that    I'm    pretty    sure     will    affect    overall    sleep    quality.        

&gt;&gt;    1.Change     up     your     diet    if     you      have     any     digestion     issues.     I     eat     mostly     Paleo     and     that     helped     my      overall     health     and     sleep     quality.    Eeriment     with     cutting     out     certain     kinds     of     food     and      see      how     you     feel     afterwards.     Test     various     things     and     reflect     on     the     outcomes.            

&gt;&gt;    2.Limit     artificial      light     exposure.     This     is     probably      one     of      the     huge     things     that     has     changed     sleeping      habits     in     post-industrial     cultures.     Circadian     rhythms     are     ingrained      in     biological      structures     and     humans     are     no    exception.     Light     is     one      of     the     big      things     that    will     influence     your     clock,     and      blue      wavelengths     of     light      are     interpreted     by     your     brain     as     daytime.    If     you     are     in     front     of     a     computer     screen     or     a     TV     a     lot     at     night,     that     is     actually     going     to     decrease     your      brain's    production      of      melatonin      (a      hormone      that      makes      you      sleepy).      I     use      [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)      to      change      the       color      of      my      laptop      screen      at      night.      It      makes      it      warmer      and     more     yellow-y,     which     reduces    the      amount     of     blue     light     that     would     be     in     a     completely     white     screen.     I      also     will     wear    red-tintend     glasses     or     goggles     to     help     mitigate     the     effects     of     regular     indoor     lighting.     In     the     future    I     want     to    get    prescription     sunglasses     or     something     so    I    can     do     things     at     night     and     still     see,     but     also     reduce     the     effects     of     bright     or     white     light.     I     also     want    to    see     what     happens     if     the    sunglasses     are     darker     and     if     having      dim     light     is     more     important     than     just     having     red/yellow-tinted     light.           

&gt;&gt;    3.Take     lots     of     Vitamin     D     in     the     morning—like 5,000-10,000     IU.     [More     about     that    here](http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/).                 

&gt;&gt;    4.Calm     down.     This     is     something     that     I     recently      figured     out.     Although     diet      and     light     exposure     do    have     effects,     it     doesn't     matter     how     great     everything     else     is     in     your     life,     if      your      mind     is    stressed     and     racing     and     you     can't     calm     down,     you     will     get     really    crappy    sleep    if     you     sleep     at    all.     At     least,     that's     what     I     discovered       for     
myself.     Here's       what     helps     me     a     lot:       

&gt;&gt;    * Have     a     regular     evening     routine,    and    stick    to    it.     Make    it    an    iron    law.      

&gt;&gt;    * Experiment      with     binaural     beats.     I     use     the     iPhone's     SleepStream     app     and     choose    the     ""Deep     sleep"" wavelength,     but     there     are     also     lots     of     binaural     beat     videos     on     YouTube.    I     haven't     fully     researched     real     studies     done     on     beats,     and     although     it     may     be     a   placebo,     it's      a     placebo      that    works      for     me.     And     if     it     works,      I      don't     really     care     how     it     works.     

&gt;&gt;    * Sit     without     a     chair     and     count.     I      like     the     [seiza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza)     position,     but     I     use     pillows     to     make     it      more comfortable     for     me.     I'm     not     used      to     it     enough     to     be      comfortable     without     it,     and     my     legs     still     fall     asleep,     but       I'm      getting      better.          
I    count     to     100     and     start     over,     counting     on     inhalation     and     exhalation,     but     only     going     to     the next     number      on      the     next     inhalation.     This     seems     to     help     focus     my     mind     and     it     helps     me     wind     down.     If     you     attempt        this     and      feel     restless,      anxious,     bored     or     frustrated,     it     means     you    really     need     to     do     it     and     you     should     keep     going.     The     more     you     feel     like     avoiding     calming    down,     the     more     you     need     to     calm     down.     At     least,     that     is     what     I     have     found     for     myself.         
   
&gt;&gt;    Anyway,     there's     a     lot     more     you     can     find     out     about     this     subject     and     I     encourage      you     to     have fun     researching     and     finding     things     out     for     yourself.     Unfortunately     I     don't     have     the     time     to     back    up     a     lot     of     what     I     am        saying    here    with     links,    but    it    is     generally        easy     to     find     where     I     am     getting     this     stuff     with     Google.

* My favorite series? Probably Psych, Scrubs and all the shows like Deathnote. So if you make a reference to one of those shows, which is related to the srotd, you will win an upvote! *yay!*

Things i have in common with rya:

* I moderate other subreddits

* im also a new intern

I looked into it and I am confident that it is not a scam, however I am concerned that I will lack the apptitude to succeed in coding.

Is it worth the money?  Considering you do get a TIGA Diploma and you can get an internship with legitimate development companies aswell as the involvement of video game royalty like Moloneux and Blazinski, I still have my doubts.

I originaly went and applied to just receive the training to be a games tester, but because I tinkered around with C++ and was making a pokemon rom hack and knew my shit, well, some of my shit, they suggested I go for development instead.

After digging around it bacame aparant that they were just polishing my marble as it were, making me feel a bit special, a bit more competant than I am at game development and programming

I'm having second thoughts, can someone tell me more about the course and what happened to them after they finished it?

Would I be better off teaching myself and going to a games studio after making a mod or somthing? "

16? You added the search mod? Ok - yeah… gotta add the 4 there. 20! **

Before you stands a male with a history in graphic and web design along with writing, cooking, retail and production. A Bardic Knowledge bonus to the check reveals his comic writing got him a write up in Wizard Magazine as one of 5 writers to look for in the next 5 years. 

**You want to learn more - Gather Info. Nat 20? And a synergy with Knowledge local? Whoooooooo!**

Luke studied **Graphic Design** as a votech student during high school. In addition he was also a **Boy Scout**, was a star player on the Academic Quiz Team, brought his **Skills USA** Quiz Team to state for Bronze, was a member of the Skills USA Section Parliament and started on building connections to various people
.
When he went to college at the **Art Institute of Pittsburgh** he ended up changing his focus from Graphic Design to **Web Design and Interactive Media**, hoping to have a wider range of knowledge. While there he ended up assisting web musician superstar **Akira the Don** who commented **""For the past few years Luke Herr has been in regular contact with me, offering his ideas, many of them excellent. His insight, persistence, and unwavering enthusiasm would be a valuable asset to any organization.""**

He ended up working **McDonald's** for a while where he had customers thank the manager for his upbeat attitude, followed by a stint at a now closed comic shop which he enjoyed a lot more, before leaving to focus on his portfolio and internship and everywhere he went he brought the same positivity. 

The internship with **Let's Be Friends Again and Adam WarRock** was mutually beneficial one where Luke learned a lot about content management, concert booking, forum creation and problem solving.  Curt Franklin, writer of Let's Be Friends Again, commented **""Not to be too hyperbolic, but Luke was an excellent intern. He regularly updated us as to where he was on the various projects assigned to him, he was extremely proficient in the various software we asked him to use. If he wasn't familiar with something he took it upon himself to research and learn it as quickly as possible. He worked more hours than we asked him to and also showed lots of initiative when it came to working on our web forums and our site.""**

Two weeks before graduation, disaster struck when his computer and his backup were destroyed in a freak desk-with-a-swinging-arm accident but he didn't give up. Faced with 3 freelance projects, 5 finals, his own portfolio, the Small Press Expo and his own portfolio display he beat finished all of his projects. He finished the three websites before his own work, received A's on his finals, which included a presentation on Jack Kirby's The Eternals and another on Let's Be Friends Again Inc, had good enough sales at SPX all with time to spare. Unfortunately, the portfolio show was poorly attended due to random chance and a really crappy day to hold it so he didn't get a job then and there. Also he slay an orc.

So after that he returned home for free rent and board to work on freelance but now he desires something more steady, social, continuous and creative in between writing web comics, working on his graphic novel and operating [Nerdcenaries, a fake comic news site](nerdcenaries.com). After a very recent incident with factory labor to make some extra cash, he decided he might take to Reddit and approach the situation from another angle.
His site, which is currently being revamped [is located here](http://www.lukeherr.com/).

He is willing to move just about anywhere, take any job and he will work through the pain including that which might cause him lose his big toe nails. Also side bonus - he is totally willing to DM some campaigns and is familiar with rules.

At the time I was in a bad financial situation and I jumped on the opportunity. It's a ""good job"". Big company, benefits, whatever.

I've learned a lot in this job, but I plateaued about 2 years in. Now I'm in a rut. 

* I maintain the same systems I did when I started. 
* It is a bureaucracy heavy job with lots of unnecessary paperwork and little programming. 
* Management is from a different era and doesn't understand the Internet and don't value what I do. 
* The policies are draconian and prevent me from getting work done. No open source software, IE only (!!), can't use source control... and on and on. The people who set/enforce the rules don't understand them, and it's a letter-of-the-law rather than spirit-of-the-law kind of place. 
* Much of the little technical work I had to do is now being handed to offshore workers, which I am expected to hire, train and supervise.
* We are using severely outdated technology and my skills are slipping.

This makes me miserable day in and day out. I no longer do programming in my spare time because my spirit has been crushed. I think to myself ""I'll never be able to use this in my job, so why bother?""

I really, really want to leave but I'm too afraid to do anything. This is the only job I've ever had and I didn't finish school. If I leave, will anyone ever hire me again? Shouldn't I be happy to have a job at all? 

Another thing that worries me - if I go looking now I will need references and then people will find out I'm looking, and *nobody* I've seen has ever left this place."

Its time to hire my first technician.  Today I am interviewing my first candidate.  I've hired people part time and even interns for 40hrs/per week in the past, but this is different.  I'm actually going to interview a few candidates and choose between them. 

My goal is not to stump this guy, or intimidate him, I just want to find out as best I can if he's going to be a good match for the business and for us working together.  His technical background is actually very strong and its likely he'll fit that part of the spot without a problem.  

What questions have you faced in an interview that you felt really allowed you to demonstrate your personality or strengths, that you wish you were asked more often?

My most memorable is when the final interviewer of a large national bank asked me for 3 weaknesses that would be relevant and a challenge to the position I was applying for.  I gave a softball answer at first, something about organization and how I overcome it - his response was ""sounds like you already solved that one, now tell me about a few that exist that you'll need to solve after you begin this position.""  It was a tough question it was intimidating but I felt my answer and how I handled the second response was actually the reason I got that job. (this isn't really the type of question I'm going to ask because I left thinking that guy was a jerk.  I also never worked directly with him, but its my most memorable interview question)

I'm a college student, and I'll be graduating in December of 2013.  I have a great job already from an internship, and I want a companion.  I want to get my bully now so that I can spend the first 2 years training and spending a lot of time with him before I work my 9-5.

That being said. This ""breeder"" I found.  The puppies are NKC registered, and I'm told they have no health problems, and the parents are healthy as well.  The grandpa is supposedly Bishop of Naptown Bullies. (google him he's gorgeous.)

However I've only been in text contact with the breeder, I've spoken for a puppy, and it all seems really great.  I'm just a bit concerned about a few things.

1.) The breeder doesn't know my name, living situation, or anything, seems only concerned with selling the pups.
2.) I'm not really familiar with American Bully's.  My mom breed AKC English, but she's super busy with life and doesn't have to help me shop for a puppy, nor does she know the breed.
3.) Naptown Bully pups go for 1500 (male) 2000 (female).  Why is the breeder selling them so cheaply if they have such a great bloodline?

Lastly, I just want a friend and companion, somebody I can workout with, take in the car, go camping, and I can still have the bully personality in a larger, more active dog than an english.  If this is a puppy mill, or not great breeder, I can still help the puppy out, what should I look for as warning signs.

** Edit** Realize my link didn't work. 
 I'm getting a male for $500 He comes with first shots and worming, papers, and I was given a chance to visit, haven't got to head over there just yet though.

**Edit 2**
Thanks for all the warnings guys! I really appreciate the feedback and it seems to be about how I feel on the issue.  What I think however, is that this lady isn't really a breeder, she's simply attempting to make some return on the female she bought for 2 grand.  At least that's what I'm hoping.

I'm going on Sunday to see the pup and living conditions.  I'll be looking at how feedings take place, how happy the puppies are, any kind of lethargy.  The mom should be there and I can look at her, and hopefully the case is I have a lady who doesn't really know what she's doing and had a litter of great pups....

On the other hand. if it's a crappy situation, then I have a serious decision to make =("

I met this girl, lets call her ""Lilly"", during high-school and soon after we started dating. This continued for 4 and a half years and I consider those 4 years as the best 4 years of my life. Once we moved up to college however things got harder to manage. The short version is that Lilly started to distance herself from me during the last 2 months of our relationship due to various reasons that would not be addressed until after the break up. She started spending all of her time with another guy, lets call him John, and began acting completely different than normal. So for 2 months she spent all her time with him, started to avoid me and even sent me a text one night saying that she and John were going to go to a town 5 hours away for a night.(This of course did not happen but the severity of the situation is not lost on me.) The thing is even after all of this I still could not leave her, in the end we broke up because I told a group of strangers what had been happening between us and I lied when she asked me if I had. Eventually John found out that I lied and told Lilly that I was doing so. We had a short fight and it was finally over. Fast forward a few months and I am a changed man now. The break up has made me completely different and it has also changed her. When she returned from her internship over the summer she admitted that she was cruel to me and has never stopped hating herself for what she did. She told me she loves me but she doesn't want this to happen again so she needs time to date other people. (It is important to note that I was her first boyfriend) She is now dating John, thankfully it is going terribly between them, but every time I see her it kills me. What should I do?

I moved from Canada to North Carolina this past January for a job at a large engineering firm.  I graduated with a masters degree a little over a year ago.  My job pays well and is secure.  I have no debt and am aggressively saving for a down payment.

The Plan:

My company runs an internship program where new university grads complete three work terms at different locations around the county; each is six months in length.  They all say it is a huge headache to find an apartment and move their stuff each rotation.  I want to buy a large house, live in one room, and rent the remaining rooms to interns as they rotate through my location.

The Problem:

Since I have only been in the US for about eight months, I have a very short credit history.  I contacted a few mortgage loan officers (only large banks so far) and they explained that without a two-year record of employment, housing, and credit history, they are unwilling to work with me.

The Question:

What options are available to me?  Try to find a smaller lender that can work exceptions to these types of rules?  Try to get a mortgage through a Canadian bank?"

So what he did was put cameras outside the house to make sure that no one tries to break in.

But recently it has gotten out of hand. Just last month I noticed a camera set up looking at the back door. This upset me, but since my family goes to Florida monthly and leaves me to house sit, I was fine with it. It unsettled me, but I decided to just hang out in the basement most of the time anyway.

Today I was in the basement which I have transformed into a mini ""man cave"" and I look up and see a camera pointed right at my favorite couch that I sit in most of the time I'm down there.

This was extremely unsettling to me. It just feels like it is really over stepping the line. I have thought of bringing it up to him but he is a violent man and gets excited really easy so it makes it difficult to have a peaceful debate about something he is doing that can be considered ""wrong"".

Right now I am staying at my grandpa's house and my family doesn't know why.

So, what should I do? Should I grow some balls and talk to them or just deal with it?

tl;Dr: my dad has a camera pointed strait at my spot I sit in most of the day. Should I tell him it is wrong?

Edit: my family is moving out in three years ( when my brother graduates high school) and said they would give me the house and all I would have to do is pay rent and utilitiesuntil I can by it from my dad.

I put a lot of work into that house, it just doesn't feel right to leave.

Also, I work minimum wage for two days and intern in I.T. for three, I don't have the money to move out"
109c63,16,2012-09-21,"X-Post from /r/noFap, regarding ""Nice Guy Syndrome""...",boissonneault,relationship_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/109c63/xpost_from_rnofap_regarding_nice_guy_syndrome/,"It applied to me and how I view basically my entire life. Thought others who struggle through certain relationship issues might find out somemore about themselves. 

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/108jzz/nice_guy_symdrome_very_important_issue_for_fappers/

I'm currently reading a book about Nice Guy Symdrome. The author lists many characteristics of ""Nice Guys"" that i'd like to share with you. I used to be a ""Nice Guy"" before my NoFap challenge - i'm changing now. I think that you guys will identify yourself with many of those characteristics. One detail that the author doesn't know: ""Nice Guy Syndrom"" is TOTALLY related to fapping. I thank God and NoFap for saving me of this shit. Here we go:

Nice Guys are givers. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them.

Nice Guys fix and caretake. If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

Nice Guys seek approval from others. A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women.

Nice Guys avoid conflict. Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.

Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.

Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys repress their feelings. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. Due to their childhood conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, angry, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.

Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own.

Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships.

What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?

We might be tempted to minimize the problem of the Nice Guy Syndrome. After all, how can being nice be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.

Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs and behaviors. When I begin working with these passively pleasing men, almost without exception, they all ask, ""What is wrong with being a Nice Guy?"" Having picked up this book and puzzled over the title, you may be wondering the same thing.

By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest . Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: l Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. l Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. l It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential. ""

109aob,4,2012-09-21,Where to go after I graduate?,[deleted],AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/109aob/where_to_go_after_i_graduate/,"So I just started my senior year, and I am slated to graduate with my B.S. in CS next spring. There's been a thought burning in the back of my mind for quite some time now, and I thought I'd get some opinions from the community.

Is there more to CS? Obviously I know the answer is yes, as there are a huge number of problems that can be investigated and researched. But I have a nagging feeling that if I just settle for my Bachelor's, I'm relegating myself to a life as a software engineer. I currently work at a pretty good company as a co-op engineer, but the work isn't as fulfilling as I'd like.

I've started thinking that I should use my CS knowledge and thought processes to supplement my venture into another field. My dream job is to be an astronomer, and I feel like my CS background could do some good in that field, since it deals with such large quantities of data. As I thought about it more, it occurred to me that a CS background would be invaluable in almost any science related field.

In closing, what are your thoughts on how to get into a more research oriented position, rather than just writing corporate software? One drawback for me is that I'm 26 and I have a family to feed, so starting out as a research assistant or unpaid intern isn't really an option.

Thanks for reading."

At the moment, I work part-time as a webdeveloper for a company in the Netherlands and I'm a CE student. For the last 2 years, I've been working with a lot of national and international big clients at my current job. Which still amazes me everyday, people are always shocked when we tell them the age of our programmers, 20 years old. I've been doing mainly webdevelopment and a bit of C, C++, C# and Java at school.

Now, through this job, I got to know to know someone, who now works for Google. Thinking 'what the heck, trying never hurts', I decided to email him, asking if he could set me up with an internship at Google next year September. I was shocked when I got told the ""big news"". He is willing to set me up with other contacts at Google. And another thing: we(the company where I work), got pretty exclusive access to one of the Google APIs(due to privacy, I don't think I can tell which API). With access to this API I've got a headstart on competition, and I basically have a year to use it to my full extinct. 

I'm still shocked and amazed at this opportunity and I really want to make this happen. Getting that internship is my dream, and I will do anything to get it.

I don't even have any questions -yet-, I am simply looking for advice, tips, wise words, anything really. Even though I've been working with big clients, I'm still a rookie in the business game and probably even the programming game as well. You might even say, I'm just very lucky.

So, wise ones, please share your wisdom, it is greatly appreciated!

108xm1,1,2012-09-21,Did the Clinton's really have all of these people killed?,SeekingSuccess,politicalfactchecking,https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/108xm1/did_the_clintons_really_have_all_of_these_people/,"In the comment section of an article al.com, I read a commenter's summary of the people that have come to mysterious demises during the Clinton's rise to power.  I've heard this speculation before, but nothing to this specificity.
Here is the actual post:
The following is a list of dead people connected with Bill Clinton: 
 
-James McDougal Clinton's convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr's investigation.

-Ron Brown Secretary of Commerce and former DNC Chairman. Reported to have died by impact in a plane crash. A pathologist close to the investi-gation reported that there was a hole in the top of Brown's skull resembling a gunshot wound. At the time of his death Brown was being investigated, and spoke publicly of his willingness to cut a deal with prosecutors.  
-C. Victor Raiser II - &amp; - Montgomery Raiser Major players in the Clinton fund raising organization died in a private plane crash in July 1992.

-Jerry Parks Head of Clinton's gubernatorial security team in Little Rock. Gunned down in his car at a deserted intersection outside Little Rock. Park's son said his father was building a dossier on Clinton. He allegedly threatened to reveal this information. After he died the files were mysteriously removed from his house.  
-James Bunch Died from a gunshot suicide. It was reported that he had a ""Black Book"" of people containing names of influential people who visited prostitutes in Texas and Arkansas.  
-James Wilson Was found dead in May 1993 from an apparent hanging suicide. He was reported to have ties to Whitewater.  
-Kathy Ferguson Ex-wife of Arkansas Trooper Danny Ferguson died in May 1994 was found dead in her living room with a gunshot to her head. It was ruled a suicide even though there were several packed suitcases, as if she was going somewhere. Danny Ferguson was a co-defendant along with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Kathy Ferguson was a possible corroborating witness for Paula Jones.  
-Bill Shelton Arkansas State Trooper and fiancee of Kathy Ferguson. Critical of the suicide ruling of his fiancee, he was found dead in June, 1994 of a gunshot wound also ruled a suicide at the gravesite of his fiancee.

Can anybody shed some light on this?"

The most recent incident: I just moved into a new apartment building and I went to do laundry for the first time here. I ran two loads (putting the second in when the other moved to the dryer) because I was told that you're allowed a maximum of two machines. I moved the second load to the dryer about half an hour after the first one. I assumed the drying process would take about an hour since that's about how long all the previous dryers I've used have been. I lost track of time a bit and went to retrieve my clothes about 20 mins late (i.e. about 1 hour and 20 mins after I put the first load in the dryer), and found that my first load - panties, bras, and all - was strewn across the table. Okay, whatever, someone needed the machine. I push it all into my basket and head back upstairs since I can't grab both loads at once. The elevator arrives and a middle-aged guy steps out. He takes a look at my laundry basket and asks if my clothes were the ones he took out of the machine. I say yes. He asks me angrily if I could take them out myself so other people could use the machines. He claims he took them out of the machine 45 minutes ago. I apologize and say that I didn't realize they would take that long (that is, they would be done that soon - but I can't form words well on the spot). He continues to yell at me about how he's sick of taking other people's clothes out, and other people need to use the machines too, etc., etc. This goes on for a few minutes, I continue apologizing, he continues yelling. I finally get in the elevator and start tearing up. Worse: I have to go back for my second load, tears in my eyes, fumbling about trying to get my clothes out of there as quickly as possible (dropping them on the floor multiple times) as the guy just stands there and watches me silently. Then a lady casually asks me about my laundry basket in the elevator as tears are streaming down my face.

I hate being a crybaby. I hate taking everything so personally. I honestly wish I could just stop caring about everyone and everything. Sometimes people make mean-spirited comments *on the internet* (which I grew up with, so I should just be used to it now) and I start crying. Now I'm thinking of getting a rolling laundry cart and taking my clothes to the nearest laundromat (1.5km away, I don't drive) because I'm terrified of ending up in that situation again. I'm terrified of running into him in the elevator. I've been crying for an hour because one guy was angry at me for 3 minutes. I don't have any close friends I can talk to.

I'm away from home for school right now. ""Join a club! That's the best way to make friends!"" - I can hear you exclaiming it already. On that note, earlier this week I thought I'd join the archery club at school. Turns out there's really high demand and it was very busy. I've never done archery before. At one point in the night, I was preparing to shoot and my instructor walked off for a minute to grab a different bow for someone else. I have terrible posture and he had been adjusting it before all of my shots, I don't want to pick up any bad habits early so I lowered my bow and waited for him to return. This guy was standing behind me waiting to shoot and he told me I was ""swinging my bow around too much"" (I admit I swung it about half an inch right as I lowered it and turned partially to see where my instructor had gone... there were 5 targets and I was shooting on the leftmost one). I shrugged it off and said ""oh, sorry."" Then he went on, ""if you're not going to shoot, can you get off [the lane]?"" I was pissed. My instructor came back and I said ""I was waiting for my instructor to come back so he could check my posture and such."" Then he told my instructor about how I was dangerously bow-swinging. Super pissed. Even now, I'm *still* angry and upset about it, and it was such a small thing. I almost don't want to go back because I don't want to see that guy again.

Several months back, I received a mediocre final evaluation at the end of an internship and I started crying. It seems really inappropriate for a professional environment and I really want to avoid it happening again... I just want to stop feeling. I want to cut out my tear ducts and the part of my brain associated with emotion. Alternatively, I'd like to hear some more realistic approaches to woman the fuck up and stop being such a crybaby about everything."

10bdls,0,2012-09-22,"Mitt Romney and more.....the down votes begin. (this is NOT spam, but watch it get spam deleted)",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10bdls/mitt_romney_and_morethe_down_votes_begin_this_is/,"Subject: MITT ROMNEY
Just some facts about Mitt Romney that we will not hear about from the media.

Mitt Romney:

* After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney.

* As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people.

* Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.

* Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
* Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
* Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
* Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
* No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years.
* No salary as MA governor 4 years.

That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind of man Mitt Romney is!

* And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 15% of his income..
This is real character vs....well you bullshit liberal rhetoric.

Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know  that he won't desecrate the flag by continuing to bow down and apologize to foreign powers, or squander my money on multiple vacations and failed loans. 

I believe he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the ""Spending President"" has aided Clinton and Bush getting us into. We didn't know that when Obama said he'd give us change, he meant nickels and dimes, and he would get the big bucks publishing books about his life that contained made up material and material composed of multiple events rolled into one. 

We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background we have a better chance of doing it. Why did we hire a community organizer to fix our fiscal problems? Would you hire Pen and Teller to run the House and Senate? Would you hire Snoop~~Dogg~~Lion to run the DEA? Would you hire Keith Richards to head up pharmaceuticals? 

Romney never took drugs, did not associate with communists or convicted terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for an omniscient being to damn the United States. Granted I'm not crazy about magic underwear but it pales in comparison to a church that damns our country. 

Obama pledged a transparent government and pledge to place the discussion of every bill before he signed it on the White House website for Americans to vote on, he pledged that large bills would be on C-Span where we could see it. he lied. None of those things ever happened.

Obama pledged to shut down Gitmo, He lied. It's still open and fortunately so because the very detainment center and the very methods he campaigned against and swore to end, are the very same used to put an end to Osama Bin Laden. He even promoted general David Patreus to head of the CIA. Yes Obama made the man most of you labeled General Betray Us head of the CIA. Obama pledged to do away with many Bush policies and instead has lied continuing on most of those policies. 

Obama has become the very type of politician most of you bitch about , rail against and voted against to put him into office in the first place.

I am a fiscally conservative and socially liberal independent. I'm voting for Romney. He's paid his dues in taxes and more in charity than Obama(who also pays a tax rate lower than his secretary btw) and if it's the best complaint and argument you people can come up with as to why you want to vote for Obama other than team politics and you aren't able peel yourself away from being a Democrat (or a Republican in the case you refuse to vote for Obama) to vote for somebody else...you're voting for all the wrong reasons. 

I refuse to not vote for a man simply because of his political party of choice. I refuse to not vote for a man simply because he's wealthier than I am.  I refuse to demonize one rich man and defend another simply because of political party affiliation. I refuse to believe all the bullshit on tv, the campaign ads, and the ridiculous polls. I refuse to let left leaning /r/Politics force me to be quiet even if they keep deleting my submissions or claiming it to be ""spam"" (What a fucking joke...""liberals"" that rally against imperialism who imperialistically delete my non liberal leaning submissions) I will not go quietly. I will defend my choice.  Condemn me for it all you want but remember this....

This ain't fucking football and  even if it were....

We're all Americans first.

We're on the same team."

I have a wide experience in things ranging from kernel-level driver development and micro-controllers to front-end user-oriented projects (SaaS) and phone-app development. I have no industry experience, however, except for my internships at a Finnish mobile device manufacturer working on their then-upcoming Linux-based platform that was later abandoned (sadly), and at a large Swiss bank working on their BPM infrastructure and applications. I was also a network administrator at my college for two semesters.

I love learning languages (both human and computer languages, though I have much better luck with computer languages) so hopefully I should not have major problems adjusting to different languages. 

I do not have any criminal convictions. Perfectly clean record.

I am willing to consider alternative destinations as well. I'm not too choosy about the location, though I would prefer moving permanently (or for a long time, at least). I'm an Indian citizen living in India.

I would strongly prefer having a job first, however, as opposed to getting there and then looking for a job. I've tried applying for a few jobs online, but didn't receive any replies.

Could anyone please share any advice or suggestions on what I could do? Thank you!"

Typos?,Tronfi,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10c4xv/looking_for_first_resume_feedback_and_cover/,"Hi reddit. I'm a freshly graduated computer engineer working on my first resume and cover letter. It's the first time I write a resume, so I'd like to get some feedback.  [Resume](http://pabloreyes.es/resume.pdf)  
I'm not a native english speaker, so there might be some typos. Please let me know if you spot them!

I have also written a cover letter for a recruitment agency:

&gt;Dear Mr. X:
&gt;
&gt;If you have any client seeking a junior developer for any IT position, I would like to make a strong case for myself. 
&gt;
&gt;Although I'm a freshly graduated, I've been developing for years and learning things every day. Maybe it's not because of my professional experience that someone would hire me, but I'm very active and passionate about technology, I have initiative and I'm sure my potential will rapidly be noticed. On my internship at Y, I gained the confidence of my co-workers and manager in less than two months, when I was offered a job position. I'm also certified as a Java 6 Professional Programmer by Oracle with a score of 92%. 
&gt;
&gt;But it's not only technology what attracts me. I'm also interested in business and company culture: how relations works between people, how colaboration and implication benefits the whole group and in general how things can improve the work environment and the company itself. 
&gt;
&gt;Other thing I think I have on my side is my location. I live at less than 1 minute walking from Z. This would help making the relocation unnecessary, making my availability inmediate.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for considering my application. Please, accept my attached resume as an application for any position I could fit in. I look forward to discuss this further.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;NAME  
&gt;ADDRESS  
&gt;MAIL

I'm sure there are many things to improve.

Thanks!"

They threw rocks at me and I threw them back when my dad came outside with a shotgun and almost shot them, but they were able to get away. I was so embarrassed I began masturbating furiously with my stuffed dinosaur doll when my mom came in and told me it was time for dinner! I told her I was fapping but then she yelled at me and told me I couldn't spend my whole life sticking my penis inside a tiny dinosaur, then I told her I would become a dinosaur fetish porn star. She got really mad and told me I would be a failure like her uncle, but I didn't care. I left the house and went to my weed-smoking friends house, I got so high I flew into the moon and met the cheese elves who live there. They told me that the only way I could stop the Minotaur (the guy with the body of a bull and head of a man) was if I got an apple and shoved it up Katy Perry's ass. I accepted the quest, but later realized Katy Perry was actually a 50-year-old hobo version of me, come from the year 2180 to tell me that if I couldn't slap Pikachu I couldn't ride her mom. After spending years debating whether chickens could swim in gelatin I hooked up my gameboy color (it was the purplish-invisible colored one) to my friend's lava lamb, but it got really upset and started baahing at me like crazy, so I whipped out my chocolate- flavored kunai knife and stabbed it 37 times in the chest. My friend was all like ""bitch be trippin' balls"" and kicked me out of the house, where I then realized if you had 3 quarters,  4 dimes and 4 pennies you'd have $1.19. I got in to my white van looking to pick up some chicks at the park, but when I finally got over there I remembered that I was an octopus, and the third arm on my right was actually my penis, and was detatchable sort of like the way a midget with a beard looks kind of like Squidward if they were taller, had orange skin, didn't have a mustache but had a bigger nose.  Then I finally found the master sword (the one from the Legend of Zelda games) and asked Telephone if they needed to go to the bakery yet. He said no, but I could see in her eyes that it really wanted to be my unpaid intern. I ended up hiring them and now we're married with one kid named charlie, named after the kid I sit next to in science. He also sits next to me in science, but that doesn't matter considering I'm already a level 55 Dark Paladin with the Spear of the Dragonfucker on my side, I'll always be able to make sure kids get to school on time. Except for yesterday, when Gordon decided he would touch Alice's arm and she screamed ""RAPE!"" causing me to swerve the whole hot dog and I crashed into Pikachu. Remembering my side-quest I slapped that motherfucker, then was teleported to Led Zeppelin-land, where my bass started vibrating so hard the waffle cone told me to gtfo and then I asked for the power to fly, so everything exploded into Cinnamon Toast Crunch. That one annoying lady on the magic school bus gobbled everything up and said ""Science!"" before falling facefirst into two lesbians making out. I then picked up my backpack and walked back to mars, realizing that I may finally get to sleep in my own bed. My walk turned in to a run, then a sprint, before I ended up in a swarm of Zubat. I waited for the 3 minute title sequence to end, then whipped out my Mage Staff and zapped there asses, but I underestimated my abilities and blew up Planet Earth. Silent tears began pouring down my face, and I gobbled down my KFC. The a few hours later I went through my regular morning routine, brush my teeth, go poop, get in the car, shower, go to school, get home from school, teleport to Uranus, fap furiously, visit Bill Nye, beat Chrono Trigger again, catch all 756 pokemon then realize that it's already the year 2180, and I'm not Katy Perry, which means Bill Nye was lying. I went back to Uranus trekked through all 17 pounds of it's crazy-hot lava and slapped that Gengar, He used Mean Look and I shit my pants. And by shit my pants I mean turn into nyan cat and fly through the sky farting rainbows all over the fucking sushi-filled egg roll. The only real answer was, ""did he kill my father?"" I decided he must have, so I tracked him down and ripped his heart out. With her last dying breath she told me upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbaselectstarttwo player, giving me the giant mudkip of the apocalypse. Everyone who was able to escape from Planet Earth onto the 34-foot space shuttle was actually an alien, secretly disguised as Rainbow Dash. Luckily I was able to combine with Edward the Vampire to turn Super Saiyan 7, then we spent 12 episodes charging up my special bloodline technique which I learned from my father Brock while I was training in the Land of the Hidden Vagina. We fired the laser but destroyed the universe and that's why I'm annoyed, I never beat the Water Temple in Pokemon Gold."
10bp8h,3,2012-09-22,I need a drill to get her out of my head.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/10bp8h/i_need_a_drill_to_get_her_out_of_my_head/,"Hello all. Just discovered this sub, and I am in need of some serious help.
A couple of months ago, my now ex girlfriend [21] and I [also 21] split up from basically being fed up with each other. I had relocated for the summer for an internship, and our relationship was rocky in the first place.

She spent the majority of her summer with some co workers of hers, one of which she kissed 2 days after our almost 2 and a half year relationship ended, and started dating him the next day. Before we ended it, I was a wreck because I knew exactly what was happening, but being 6 hours away from her, I couldn't do anything about it.

She had moved into my house before I left, and still lives here now, although spends all of her time at her new boyfriends. Things between us were awful until I came back, and once we actually started talking in person, things got better. And better. And better. To the point of us fooling around behind her boyfriends back, which has now been put to rest by her.

The real problem was that I was really taking everything as mixed signals. The night/days we were together were the most passionate we'd ever had, but, then she would just kiss me goodbye and go to her boyfriend. I've been trying to get her back, but to no avail. I don't make her happy like I used to, and her new guy does. She wanted to be ""bad"" with me, but not ""good"" with me. She claims to care about me and wants me to be happy, but, the only thing I want is her, and she knows that and has done what she can to convince me otherwise. I know, in the long run, we'd never work. We want too many different things, and we have such different likes, dislikes, and opinions as it is, but, I can't help but still love her. I never stopped, and I don't know how to now.

I apologize for the massive wall of story, but, I have to get it all out. I have to get her out. She messed with my head, and now, wants seemingly nothing to do with me, mostly because I'm so upset about everything. I'm really at a loss for what to do, and I really do feel like I need a drill just to get her off my mind. 

So, strangers of reddit, please, help me. Help me move on. I need it more than anything.

I'm also one of the many silent mods here on /r/metahub (full disclaimer). I saw that you guys were [somewhere interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/yy8jj/r_subredditofday_finding_new_mods_submitters/) in the daily working of /r/SubredditOfTheDay and my recent announcement of hiring new writers from the community.

I wanted to give you guys the heads up directly myself. From the horses mouth as they say.... but first an origin story.

/r/SubredditOfTheDay was run by /u/SROTD himself. But due to being too awesome he had to resign. I have taken control... yodda yodda yodda, new leadership, new direction circlejerk. Anyway, I knew my writing skills were never up to par but I always wanted to contribute. So the next best thing I could do is hire those that could write.

Here is a list of gang... hopefully in cronological order of *hiring*. 

* /u/SROTD (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* /u/syncretic (Retired)
* /u/SidtheMagicLobster (MIA)
* /u/LGBTerffic 
* /u/UkuleleNoGood (Retired)
* /u/BauerUK (Retired)
* Few more that I do not know the name of...
* ---
* /u/jaxspider
* /u/MiraP
* /u/jmk4422 (Retired)
* ---
* /u/PotatoMusicBinge
* /u/RileyXRadio (Retired)
* /u/JMaboard (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* ---
* /u/hippiemachine
* /u/Soupyhands
* /u/SaltyChristian
* /u/Freakazette

Everyone below JMaboard was a recent intern. Hippie, Soupy &amp; Salty and Freakazette are the first batch of new full time writers. I'm so damn proud of them. They are fantastic. I just hope the rest of the interns shine as bright as they do.

##Intern Progression

Hopefully all these interns will flesh out to proper full time writers. My end goal, which I haven't mentioned to anyone yet... but they'll figure it out eventually is... to have enough writers that they are always fully prepared. And to become a guest writer myself.

So tell me, how else can I improver /r/SubredditOfTheDay?"

So I grew up in a very Christian household. When I was a kid, I was forbidden to play Pokemon cards, or read Harry Potter books, simply because the church deemed them ""Satanic."" So while my friends were off having fun with those, I got to do nothing but sit in a corner on the playground by myself. I was so forced into the church and convinced it was all true so strongly, that it even had an impact on the way I dressed. Ex: awkward-fitting jean shorts, ugly Nike shoes, shirts with cheesy religious stuff that wasn't even the correct size, and a huge ugly cross pendant. I met my best friend through this, but let's keep him in the background. The entire time, I had always suspected I had homosexual tendencies, but I would mentally punish myself each time I would even start to think about just considering that. I would call myself stupid, and evil, and pray for forgiveness because that's what I was raised to believe. However in about my junior year of high school, my best friend came out to his parents as gay. Every day he would get told he's going to Hell. No, ""Hi,son, how was school?"" Instead, he would get ""You know you're on the road to Hell, don't you?"" I'm there for my friend of course, and this is where my mind starts to doubt religion. Just so slightly. It really started snowballing in my biology class, thanks to our student teacher who was a blood dialysis intern at the local hospital. One day, during our discussion of evolution, someone brought up homosexuality and how it happens. The class immediately starts arguing with each other and she quiets the room. ""Class, the existence of homosexuality is not evil. It's not unnatural. There are several theories as to why it could, like such as a species' population control. However, there is one theory that a lot of us at the lab strongly support. During a woman's pregnancy, she releases the testosterone to her unborn baby to help the sexual development. But sometimes, they don't release the usual amount. When a mother puts off lower amounts of it to the baby, it's seen to influence a preference for males. When it's higher, a preference for females."" This changed my whole outlook. After that, I start going to church less, and less, and less, until I didn't even go on my own will at all, but was still forced to go occasionally. Pretty soon, I start seeing a guy (who was a total regret, but that's not important here) and soon I realize why none of my girlfriends were ever attractive to me. I also started questioning my belief in God as a whole. I went from agnostic, to agnostic-atheist, to where I am now as a total Atheist. I am now also a contributor to r/trees, thanks to my friend introducing me to the best antidepressant on the face of this earth, and he helped me come out. He's also a fellow redditor here on r/atheism, so I hope he sees this and knows I appreciate him. Now I actually dress like I have a style (which is pretty damn cool, btw) and even have my ears gauged out at 10g, which I never would have done 2 years ago, and I now live a renewed life free of fear, doubt, and self-hatred. I have never been so happy in my entire life. Oh, and that friend I was talking about who came out before me? Yeah, he hates me now, and still goes to his church three times a week. 

Thanks for reading, I had to get this story out to people who understand. Living in Oklahoma, I didn't have anyone like you guys until I joined my university's secular organization about a week ago. Thanks guys!

10e5og,1,2012-09-24,I want to leave my current career path and follow my dreams. Am I an idiot?,BrockThrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10e5og/i_want_to_leave_my_current_career_path_and_follow/,"Some details... I'm a 20-year old Software Engineering student currently at a 16-month internship with a software engineering company. The internship would end at the end of next summer and I'm looking to return to school and finish my degree after that, with only one year to go.  It would be completely pointless for me not to finish my degree, as I've already done 3 years of it. I'm just not positive what I want to do after that.

Partially relevant details: I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm gay, and started coming out to many of my family and friends. Back when I was in the closet, I hid a lot of my personality, dreams, and aspirations because I had deemed them too ""gay"", and I didn't want to have that stigma attached to me. I cut all of that out of my life and turned to engineering, which seemed like a viable option. In retrospect, I wish I had simply embraced who I was.

My true goal or passion in life is hard for me to pinpoint. Originally, I always wanted to be an actor in film and television. I loved the local productions that I was involved with when I was younger, but quit them in high school when I was trying to hide who I truly was. But I'm also very, very interested in the behind-the-scenes aspects of filmmaking and television shows, such as screenwriting and directing.

Lastly, my other true passion in life is music. I played piano from a young age and consider myself to be fairly talented. I love playing the guitar as well. This, though, I may consider to be more of a hobby than something I could make a career out of. If there was a career here, I wouldn't want it to be music education. I would want to be in a band or as a solo artist, touring and making new music. The style of music I make would definitely be in the ""indie/indie rock"" field.

My goals and aspirations seem so... unrealistic, compared to graduating with a software engineering, getting a stable job, and not worrying about income. But I know I won't be truly happy. I've considered several options, all which start with me finishing my degree. Then they branch out: Should I get more education focusing on tv and film production? Should I get a software job in L.A. (seems like San Francisco would definitely have some options) and see what I can do from there? However, a full-time job would probably be a huge obstacle in trying to break in to the entertainment industry. 

I'm also worried about the diminishing returns on my engineering degree. If nothing works out, I've assured myself ""at least I have a software degree I can fall back on."" But if I'm not working in that field after graduating (and the longer I wait), I feel that my chances of getting a job would be considerably slimmer, especially in the rapidly changing world of software and technology.

Is this crazy? Am I an idiot for thinking of abandoning a solid, well paying career, when so many people are desperate for one? Also, my dreams are a bit different from each other. If I do intend to do this, I have no idea which one to focus on. If I was successful with music, would I still have that itch to get into tv and film? How viable is this, anyways? Moving to California, without having a job, would definitely be expensive. Not to mention the fact that I'm actually Canadian. Should I move to Toronto instead? Or Vancouver?

I would just say that I'm very, very confused and lost about what to do with my life at this point. I feel like after coming out, I've kind of turned a new leaf, and I want to be this different person I had always wished I was.

**TL;DR:** After I get my software engineering degree, I want to completely switch paths and head into the entertainment industry (acting, writing, directing, or making music). It's always on my mind, and I feel like I would regret it if I don't. I feel like I won't be happy with a software job for the rest of my life, wondering what could have been. Am I an idiot?"

Uggos.,FredTrellis,MoreThan600,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoreThan600/comments/10e47y/20120924_659_uggos/,"Has it not struck you, as it has me, that every villain in every movie, theatre piece and musical stage adaption of the Manga classic - is ugly?  Even in radio plays and audiobooks - the voice of the villain is always creepy, evoking an ugly person.  
  
Moreover, when we make the regrettably necessary journey back to our real reality, we can see mugshots of detained subjects:  those unlucky enough to fall under the spell of meth, those unlucky enough to have circumstances where theft and it’s associated risks are preferable to starvation or invisibility, those pedophiles unluckily denied entry to the priesthood.  
  
These mugshots are not, for sure,  captured by  a top glamour photographer.  No-ones' diary reads “10am : Maxim at muscle beach : Lucy Liu lingeries shoot.  12:30 : Prostitutes and their needles (mugshot and evidence), Highgate Constabulary”.  What a giant of the illuminated black and white grainy world you would need to be to stand astride such a chasm in your day planner.  How many interns would you need to prevent mixups?  The restraints on Lucy Liu should be decorously  pink and fluffy hints of the dark fun that lurks in the souls of men, and those on the crack whore are necessitated by the darkness that has tired of lurking in the souls of men.  And one intern is insufficient prophylaxis where, potentially, Lucy Liu ends up wearing the wrong handcuffs.  Indeed, one intern would be insufficient prophylaxis Lucy Liu ends up wearing the right pink and fluffy handcuffs..  A photographer would need these details checked over and again.  
  
If s/he existed, such a photonic giant would be hard-pressed to make much of a mugshot, no matter how skilfully they deployed their outside-in white umbrellas.  They are simply not given the basic material to work with.   In short, like the fictional villains of the imaginations deliverables, the real villains are predominantly ugly.  
  
For sure, this represents prejudice.  Discrimination against those less beautiful.  Preference to the symmetrical, the fashionable thin but not skinny, with strawberried hair and blueberried eyes.  Through the medium of the internet, we have heard first-hand testimony of beautiful people who sailed through life, borne on the breeze of approval from all around them.  The invitations to the prom.  The constant reaffirmation of people ingratiating themselves in tiny ways.  The speeding ticket that is waved away.  The better seat in the cinema.  Opening a new carton of chocolate ice-cream - even though 32 flavours is nearly the same as the advertised 33, and that we actually closed 5 minutes ago, sure it’s no problem, I’ll just open a new one, scoop out a couple of balls of obsequiousness, and handle your cone with loving care.  Do you want a marshmallow with that?  
  
  
It is not so for the less aesthetically pleasing.  These people have realised that in the gene-replication contest that life is, they lost already.  The moment they were conceived.  With no chance for a bye into the quarter finals.  Through no fault of their own, their ugly face predicts an ugly future.  
  
The stress at being so comprehensively a loser in life is crushing.  Daily grinding it’s fear of rejection and loneliness into deeper asymmetries and cracks in an already-distressing visage.  No one can truly paint a brightening, cheery and welcoming smile on to a habitually scowling, frowning bitter ugly face.  
  
  
So it is, that those who genes have dis-favoured are stressed by merely existing.  They already feel a self-rejection in anticipation of a wider rejection.  They already feel the bitter pain of lost love - love for themselves.  
  
The beauties of this world glide, self-assured, self-loved and approved through this world.  The uglies struggle daily against their stress, pain, angst and rejection.  This is the real reason for the mugshots and the theatrical villains being ugly: these are the people who are likely to snap first, and reject and threaten a society that rejects and threatens them for their unchosen appearance.

I am thinking of getting a part-time job. Something that I do not have to commit to fully so I could focus on my Master's applications.

So, I am really leaning on a retail job (No managerial position just entry level), but I am worried about being too ""overqualified"" because of my Bachelor's Degree. 

Lol I know... I know... This sounds like a First World Problem but Redditors I would really love your advice: 

1. Should I lie about having a college degree?

2. What type of education should I put? High School? AA? (I transferred to my four year school from a community college)

3. I know this is a separate question but as far as background check goes: Does anyone know if it only checks for Criminal background? Or will it show that I graduated from a four year university?...

I know this is much to digest but if you can help a brother out that would be great!

I have A+ &amp; Network+. I'm reading The Practice of Network and System Administration and hope to get my CCNA at some point in the next two years. 

I currently work as an intern at a local company. The previous IT director left, leaving me and a computer science senior in charge. Since starting I have worked mostly on vmware and windows; I'm currently working on setting up a nagios server. 

Tuition is paid for, otherwise I would probably be at a two year technical college for networking. 


Anyways. My local University has a new program in Informatics, with a SysAdmin concentration:

Would it be better for me to change majors (business?) and work on certifications on my own so that I have real-world skills, or do you think that it would be worthwhile to continue in this program?

Thank you for your time.

While I do like programming, I am not interested in being strictly a programmer so I would rather not major in computer science. "

I'm a junior in college, and have recently started submitting my resume and looking for internships. I have tons of non-school related projects including: a facebook app, multiplayer games, websites, windows apps, etc. the problem is I believe I made all these happen through my passion in computers and creating programs in general. I'm not very good with algorithms and efficiency (my games weren't the most efficient in terms of FPS and latency, but they worked and were fun to play online with friends).


So long story short, I have tons of experience programming all sorts of things and a lot of motivation and passion for creating programs, **but** I suck at the typical interview questions about efficiency and generating a nice algorithm on the spot.


How to interviewers view this? I spoke with some people from several companies including Hulu and Yelp, and they all seemed interested in me and liked my experience. They asked me some algorithm questions and I straight up answered ""I don't know"" and they said ""I'm liking you"". I don't know if this is normal or if they were saying this to be nice.


I'm brushing up on my algorithms and riddle solving anyways.

She left in May and came back at the end of August. 

She grew up in a religious family and when she left home I was her first. Things went really well for about 6 months and then she began said she no long wanted to have sex which I was fine with. And we struggled with stopping for just over a year and we finally managed to stop. We also had other troubles with non communication but the sex was the main issue. 

While she was away at her internship we broke up because she said that she was no longer in love with me, and that she had not been happy for a long time. She began seeing a guy while she was there and she said that she felt like she was in a relationship with him for the last two weeks she was there. 

Since then we have spoken a lot about us and she says that she still loves me but can't get over our past discrepancies. She has been dating but says she isn't serious about any of them but just wants to get her mind off of me. 

I'm also dating around. (not serious either) and she gets upset if I mention anything about it. That coupled with the fact she says she still loves me but is no longer in love with me, leads me to believe that she wants us to work. She's even mentioned that. 

Now here's the question: I'm not sure if I should stick around or just move on. I've honestly felt like she was the one for a long time and I think we will get back together but I'm worried that it maybe pointless/doomed to fail.

10gkcm,8,2012-09-25,Anyone else get into skating when they were older? (Advice),YearOfTheRisingSun,skateboarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/skateboarding/comments/10gkcm/anyone_else_get_into_skating_when_they_were_older/,"Hey fellow Redditors.

I think a little background would be helpful.  I grew up in a rural area with a gravel driveway and no where anywhere near by to skate.  Growing up I always wanted to but just do to my area it wasn't really possible.  

Fast forward to the present and after a few years in college I decided to finally give skating a try (large cement covered campus is MUCH easier to skate than a gravel driveway).  I bought a board back in March and started just skating around campus.  None of my friends skate so I didn't really have anyone to offer suggestions, teach me, etc.  

This summer I got an internship out in Connecticut and found a great skatepark near New London and started going there.  The first couple times were REALLY nerve racking as even with just a few people there I was by FAR the worst skater and often it would be me (21) and a bunch of younger teenagers and they would all be ridiculously good.  I started just going later at night trying to catch times when no one would be around.  

Long story short I still absolutely suck at skating (can't devote too much time due to a full time job), I still haven't learned to Ollie, and I feel awkward when I try and go practice because I'm not just some terrible little kid whose obviously learning, I'm older than most of the people there and clearly the worst.  

Did anyone else learn to skate when they were older (out of high school)?  Learn to skate without other skaters?  





TLDR: I started skating late in life, none of my friends do, I suck and feel embarassed in front of younger skaters.  Advice please."
10fvqc,8,2012-09-25,I want to tell you all my story.,ChocolateMagic,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10fvqc/i_want_to_tell_you_all_my_story/,"You've all made me so happy.  I'm still dealing with all this damned anxiety, but I know now that it will get better.  I discovered this subreddit today and have since been poring over submission after submission. 

I don't feel nearly as alone. 

I have an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow thanks to my wonderful girlfriend.

Warning: VERY LONG RANT AHEAD. Anyway, on to my story:

I was home for winter break last year and everything was wonderful.  I played lots of games and watched lots of movies with my family, cooked lots of delicious food, and completed (grudgingly, yet with a certain satisfaction) a lot of yard work.  

It's always nice returning to the fresh winter atmosphere of my family's farm.  I had been away to college for two full years prior to this and had just finished my 5th semester with great grades in a Mathematics curriculum.  Honestly, everything was perfect to me.

But then I had my first panic attack.

On Christmas Eve night I lie down to sleep in my warm bed when I start feeling this strange feeling in my left arm and left pectoris region.  My arm is tingly and my chest feels twinges of pain.  And then the first thought crept into my mind:

*""What if I'm having a heart attack?""*

As many of you know, this let loose the floodgate of anxious thoughts:

*""Is this what a heart attack feel like?  Why isn't it going away?  What's wrong with me?  Could it be something else other than a heart attack?  Maybe it's diabetes or something.  Why is my face going numb?  Am I having a stroke?  Quick: read something.  I can still read, that must be a good sign.  The pain in my chest is getting worse and feels weirder even.""* 

MOM, PLEASE TAKE ME TO THE ER.

Tests were fine.  They sent me on my way with some Ativan and a ""Merry Christmas"" and I rested peacefully.

It was sometime later that I had my next panic attack.  Three months or so.  

I was sitting in class when I was wondering why my sternum cracked so much.  And then I began to worry that I broke my sternum and my bone marrow was seeping into my veins and would quickly kill me if I didn't go to the ER right away (caveat: I'm not the sharpest knife in the spoon drawer).  I felt lightheaded and I *thought* I was going to pass out.

I raised my hand and politely told my instructor that I may soon pass out.

Naturally, he stood there for a long moment, unsure exactly what I expected him to do, before rushing to bring me a glass of water.  

The more I thought, the closer I crept to the borderline of consciousness and oblivion.  Fortunately, I didn't pass out.  Someone recommended that I put my head between my knees and I was fine in about 10 minutes, albeit still shaken up.

That second incident became the catalyst and I was having panic attacks nearly every day until the end of the semester.  I'd have them when I tried to lie down to sleep, especially, and they were always triggered by thoughts of poor health.  My grades dropped, my relationships with others plummeted, and all the while I was adding unnecessary stress to my girlfriend's life.

This summer changed everything, however.

I spent this summer at an internship in Boulder, Colorado.  It changed my life in many ways, but in particular, it put a stopper on my anxiety.  My confidence was at an all time high and I felt like I could do anything I set my mind to.  I had no panic attacks while there bar one. 

I woke up one day with an irregular heartbeat.  From the time I woke up until the time I got to the ER, my heartbeat would beat fast and then slow and then fast again with no apparent pattern.  The irregular heartbeat woke me up so I didn't *consciously feel* anxious prior to this episode.  Hence, why I was legitimately worried this time.

Again, tests were fine again.  They gave me more Ativan and I went home.

Every time I visited the ER, they gave me Ativan and told me I was fine.  As an attentive reader, you may have assumed that at this point of the story, I am now fully aware of the fact that my physical health problems are non-existent and that I have an anxiety disorder.

Your assumption is wrong.

Some deep thing inside of me still believed that *something* is wrong, but the doctors didn't do the correct test or simply that the test was messed up in some way.  I still believed that I had a health issue that the doctors just haven't picked up on yet.  

Well it turns out that I did have one problem. 

Gluten.  

I had been having intense heartburn and incredibly bad gas for about two years and had no idea why.  The GI doctor told me it was irritable bowel syndrome which it was, but he didn't perform any further tests.

Anyway, 5 weeks ago I cut out all gluten from my diet.  I've been eating healthily, exercising and noticing the physical changes, and have been having the greatest bowel movements of my life.  It's been surreal.  I've felt for the first time what it's like to be healthy, young, confident, and strong and it was amazing.

Until this past Friday when I experienced the most intense nausea and the strangest bowel movements I've ever had accompanied by the same crippling anxious thoughts I had experienced prior to my summer internship.

It was like having diarrhea and constipation at the same time accompanied by incredible burning.  I had tried to lie down to sleep 5 hours earlier at midnight, but the nausea kept me awake.  And then I saw blood on the paper when I wiped and really began to freak out.  I woke my girlfriend from sleep and asked her to take me to the ER and she reluctantly, yet happily agreed.

Test after invasive test, they told me to eat more fiber and drink more fluids.  Oh, and they said to keep taking Ativan.

Now, this is where your brilliant narrator finally picked up on his dilemma.  Regardless, he spends 2 days suffering from chronic nausea and indigestion, loses 3 pounds, and shows up at the doctor's office on monday frustrated and on the verge of tears.

The doctor was great.  He listened to my rambling patiently.  He then suggested I have a little more blood work done and a stool sample analyzed to check for more possible problems.  But he also has a hunch.  He prescribed me Prilosec and told me to by an OTC liquid antacid.  He thinks I may have Gastritis.

It's been 12 hours since I first took the Prilosec and the first few swigs of the antacid, but already my nausea has nearly gone.  I took some Ativan and my stress has subsided for the moment.

I have an Anxiety Disorder.  I don't know which one, but it's mine and I do not expect it to go away anytime soon.  It makes me irritable to the point where I snap at people I love.  It makes me angry at myself and my shortcomings.  But with a little effort from me and a lot of help from drugs, a psychologist, friends, my loving family, and my awesome girlfriend, I know I'll be able to get better.

I hope you all can find solace in your lives and I wish you the best of luck.

10fgcs,22,2012-09-24,NewGrad (21yo) here; 3rd time failing the Amazon Interview...Need tips because I want to go to Seattle so much.,ButRickSaid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10fgcs/newgrad_21yo_here_3rd_time_failing_the_amazon/,"To note: I have read and done most questions in: ""Programming Interviews Exposed"" and ""Cracking the Coding Interview"".

So I graduated this year from a pretty good public university and had been trying to interview with plenty of big name companies (Goog, Msft, Amzn, FB, Salesforce) currently and in the past (for internships) and I've always come up short on the last interview before they make a decision.

Granted that, I've improved a significant amount each year so I know that I've made some mistakes in the past during my interviews.

This year however, I focused intensely on doing all these interview questions, practicing to think recursively, thinking before I code. I spend hours at a time just thinking about **how to think about a problem correctly**.

So I figured I had learned from all my mistakes...in the past, I just jumped to a half-decent answer and started coding it; giving some leisurely explanation for my code and then missing some corner cases. But now I learned that's the wrong way to do it. I need to show them my thought process, my carefulness, my skills. THIS TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I came up with a method and I practiced this process in my head that seemed perfect to what the interviewers want (in this order):

1) Get clarity!! Don't solve the wrong problem and get rid of any ambiguity!!

2) Write test cases; positive scenarios, error scenarios, corner case scenarios.

3) Make the appropriate sanity checks; **N.E.S.S.** (nulls, erroneous input, same-ness, size/length check).

4) Will a data structure help? Try a: HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue, List, array[], Tree, Recursion.

5) Write out the pseudo-code in comments first and then code it. BUT make sure to tell them that you will write code after!!

I took an incredibly cautious and careful approach to my interview, I made sure to minimize bugs in the code and try for the most optimal-time solution. Amazon seems to love HashMaps so the first thought that came to mind in any question was to try to use it. Today I found out that I didn't get the offer yet again, only this time it was for full-time.

I've tried to just jump to AN answer and that didn't work. I've tried to take it step by step, very slowly because ""the thought process is what matters, not getting the right solution"". Yet neither has given me an offer. I want to go to Seattle and I'm interviewing with other big names in the area but I'm limited by the number of people who can refer me and posting my resume online to places has not yet helped me.

I am leaving the US for 6 months to do an internship in Germany, and I was hoping to use the collective financial wizardry of this subreddit to figure out a place to park roughly $40k in cash. Right now it's just sitting in my bank account in my credit union, which isn't *so* bad most of the time, because if I use my debit card 12 times a month I get 1% interest (wooo....). However, when I'm in Germany I'll be relying mostly on cash, both that I'll convert into Euros and that I'll make from my internship, so those 12 transactions won't be happening, and I'll be getting 0.05% interest.

My credit union offers 182-day CDs at .25% for that amount of money. Do you all know of any better possibilities? If it matters, I am already a Vanguard customer (with some stocks/bonds and a target fund IRA - that money is not included in the $40k).

I'm hoping to use the money as a large down payment on a house in the nearish future (say, within a year or two). So, wherever I put it should be pretty darn safe. On the other hand, that $40k doesn't include about $10k that I want to keep in cash for emergencies, so it's okay if it's locked away.

They werent generating revenue so i wasnt getting paid, it's now 5 months later and still no money.  So i think of this as a giant internship and resume builder.  However, the problem still stands, no money.

I feel as if the job market is hopeless, i get no replies from prospective employers, i'm 27 years old, living with my parents and i have $54.00 to my name.

Any advice?"

10iljd,2,2012-09-26,A great week slowly turning into a sour one.,Chinksta,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10iljd/a_great_week_slowly_turning_into_a_sour_one/,"I thought this would be a great week but I was wrong. Still getting used to college life.... 

Monday - Girlfriend told me that she needs some ""alone"" time, that usually means that a break up will soon be happening. I freaked out, started apologizing and beg her to not leave me. I was in tears... started drinking.. I called her while I was crying, told her to not leave me and begged her to come back. I was wrong, I told her that her ""busyness"" is turning this relationship bad. It was just me who wanted more out of it. I was begging so hard, I yelled at the sky asking why is this shit happening to me? People started to freak out, I passed out in my bed, I believed someone checked up on me. 

Tuesday - Felt like shit, send more message to my girlfriend telling how much I missed her, I really wanted to make this relationship work. Went through day walking sadly... after seeing people holding hands together, having fun and kissing. I thought of my girlfriend... how much I wanted to kiss her and I was crying in the middle of the streets. At night, my girlfriend replied saying that she will have lunch on Thursday. I told her that I was sorry again. I called her several times, but she was ignoring it. She told me to leave her alone but I kept calling. More drinking... then later, one final call. She didn't pick up, but I decided to leave a voice message. I was crying... told her that I was sorry that I'm a greedy asshole and I really want this relationship to work. She later replied saying that ""we should be friends"" but I don't want that. I still want to remain as her ""boyfriend"". Passed out on my bed.

Wednesday - I decided to do some college homework, but couldn't think at all. I'm so sad that I was thinking about her... Something told me to send a picture of a cute cat with text saying ""I'm sorry, please give me a chance"", I send it. I checked on her facebook, she has an event that she really wanted to go, so I left a comment saying to ""sign me up!"". Lunch was painful, I was sitting alone but there was a couple sitting in front of me. They were talking and having so much fun together...laughing and touching each other... I thought of the fun which I used to have with my girlfriend. I feel like tears are coming out. I quickly finish and literally cried while I was walking back to my place. My uncle called me to invite me for dinner, at first I told him I didn't want to go and explain my situation. Somehow, I told him that I'll go. 

So far, my girlfriend is going to Toronto this weekend but I really wanted to spend time ""healing"" this relationship. I had a plan where she and I would go to a park and have a picnic there but she's going to fucking Toronto. She will be more busy soon... she's starting her internship and that might leave less free time. I'm just wanted to go to Toronto with her but there aren't anymore spots left... I tried asking everywhere if anyone wanted to sell their tickets...but no luck. Things are slowly getting bad... I feel like I'm slowly losing my girlfriend...although she told me that it's HER fault... Somehow I felt like it's just me...who wanted more from her... I'm sitting in my room and outside looks like it's going to rain...the day is gloomy. I prayed that tommrow my girlfriend and I will work this out together, I don't want to lose her... I send her a text saying ""Hi, how are you?"" but no reply... It's like she's ignoring me. Something inside me told me that she felt the same way as I am... sad...wanted to work this relationship out but I may be crazy... 

I really hate it though, she's leaving on Friday 7:00 AM sharp... I mean I have the whole fucking weekend planned out. The trip cost fucking $200, I can't believe that my girlfriend would rather spend a lot to go spend her time without me. She will be back on Sunday too... I bet she will say that she's too tired from the trip. I fucking hate this life. FUCKING SHIT.    "

10ie6u,5,2012-09-26,There is a feeling of dread taking over me.,throwaway261985,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10ie6u/there_is_a_feeling_of_dread_taking_over_me/,"Hi SW,

It has been a ground for me to not only vent but begin to confront my problems. But somehow I am not able to pick myself up and and carry on. I have tried to sort out a lot of the past problems but I am still unable to cope. I am not even able to just go up to my academic advisor and tell her that everyday I am dying a little inside.

About 2 months back I confided in a friend. She really helped me a lot and took me in. But I have to find somewhere to live next week. I have been sending out my CV and applying for internships but have not even had an email back. I received an mail from school asking me why I have not registered my internship with them. How do I tell them that I am a failure!!

I failed the 3 courses but my advisor said that I could repeat them next year as I still have potential. But I need to have a 4 month internship, and since it is already end september it is no longer possible. I need just a document saying that I have an internship with something in the domain of International Affairs (human rights).

The internships that are available are with UN agencies or other NGOs that offer unpaid positions. I am homeless, I have  no phone, how can I contribute 40 hrs a week to work and dress a certain way. 

I feel like such a failure and think that I am regressing to that place of comfort that an end could provide. I feel worthless and that years of studying are useless in my case. I feel truly at a loss. I hoped that doing an internship and working in an area of human rights would remind me of the gift of life. But the very path to finding that is pushing me closer to the cliff. 

I am too poor to even afford to go to the therapist who asks for 50 euros a session. Ah, it is difficult. I can feel all the motivation being sucked down and along with it my hopes and dreams for the future, down in the chasm of failure and fatigue.

Sorry for rambling on but I needed to tell someone."

Fun part is the changes I make never seem to get applied, I add in a shortcut to be created on a users desktop, save it, exit out go over to the computer do the usual gupdate /force annnd nothing.

I look at the gpresult and it lists it as one of the policies being applied.. and yet the elements in it just never get acted on... It's giving me a headache of monstrous size. "
10hzc5,5,2012-09-26,"I can no longer ""mother"" my mother. Entire relationship has changed. ",Mrsteddyruxpin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10hzc5/i_can_no_longer_mother_my_mother_entire/,"My mom has always been needy and lacked common sense from as far back as i can remember. I always thought of myself as ""the good daughter"" who helped and guided her through all of her bad decisions. Everything has changed since I have become a mother. I have to mother my son now, and I'm in the midst of my internship, I have a husband..a mortgage...and a lot on my mind and I just can't adopt my mothers problems any longer. 

Now all we do is fight. 

I wish she was an adult. I wish she was reliable. I wish she didn't live like a slob. I wish she would keep her promises. I wish she cared about her health. I wish she would stop seeing people for what they can give her. I wish I had a wise, calm, uplifting mother. 
My drug addict brother has moved into her house, and all I get to hear about is how great he is for ""helping her"". I like to call it ""enabling her"". He does everything she asks, and accepts all of her behaviors...of course his 32 year old butt is getting free rent, food, utilities, and extra cash..so why would he create conflict with her? 

I helped her quit smoking. She was 7 months quit and when she broke up with her crazy lesbian girlfriend (hopefully for the last time) and kicked her out of her house (again) my brother went and bought her 4 packs. If she's going to ruin all her progress my brother could have at least made her go get them herself. She has had two heart attacks. The doctor said she has to stop smoking and drinking insane amounts of caffeine. My brother keeps feeding her both. She's going to die if she doesn't start taking care of herself. But I can't keep begging and fighting with her about it. Either she wants to live, or she doesn't...

She has no furniture...her house is in disarray and reeks like ciggs and is filthy, so my sons first birthday will be at my dad's house. She spent our entire time on the phone tonight being bitter and angry with me about this. She kept saying ""I know this isn't your fault, and this is the only option but I don't have to like it"". I feel like she's trying to ruin this experience for me because she isn't getting to do what she financially and physically is incapable of doing. 

I am so insanely dissapointed in my mom's effort at living that i cant bring myself to congratulate her for shampooing her carpets. That's what normal people do. Set the bar a little higher. 

I can't run to her rescue, fix her problems, or condone her destructive behavior anymore...so she doesn't call..and she doesn't text...and if we do talk. It's always about her. Never me. And we fight. 

I don't know what to do reddit..I feel like I'm losing my mom...

The week had been insanely busy, and the day this happened we had a town blackout.

HIM: ""Hi I'm here to pick up my computer""

ME:  ""Did we call you?""

HIM: ""No, but the guy said it'd be done today""

Now, anyone in auto, comp repair, or anything that gives an estimate on the date knows that those estimates are under good conditions (and with a lot of luck.) So I go and search all over and find out that every computer station is full, and his computer hasn't even been worked on yet. 

me: ""Sorry, but it looks like it's not ready""

him: ""but... the guy said today""

me: ""I'm sorry, but we operate on a first in first out basis, and we've been busy. Plus with the blackout I couldn't ring you up""

him: ""I understand that, but that's no reason not to have my computer done"" *proceeds to walk out and slam the door*

in my head: ""No, that's a perfect reason you dick."""
10htoh,2,2012-09-26,My life feels so meaningless,i_ate_carrots_today,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10htoh/my_life_feels_so_meaningless/,"I'm not really sure how to begin, but I just have had this completely overwhelming feeling that I've led such a pointless, terrible life, that I can't really look at myself or my life and respect anything about it. I've felt this way for as long I can remember my own emotional state; to put it another way, I can't remember ever being actually happy for more than a moment at a time, and I can never remember ever actually recognizing that I am happy while it happens. 

I feel like I have become trapped in my own pointless cycle, doing the same things and acting the same way over and over just to get through the day. I feel completely alone, despite having a fair amount of acquaintances and people I do things with; I have a pretty active social life and I can meet new people pretty easily. I can make people laugh pretty easily, regardless of whether I've known them a long time or a brief time, so I usually end up hiding behind that and never really forming meaningful friendships. At the same time though, I have no idea how to stop being just a clown, and I'm not even sure it would make anything better if I did. I feel like it wouldn't add to my character, only take away the only quality people like about me. I'm completely skeptical about all of my relationships, and never really feel that people actually like me, rather they're just tolerating me (I have had weirdly dramatic friendship endings with other guys where they have told me that they only tolerated me, and basically reaffirmed my fears). I'm greatly unsatisfied with having shallow friendships and relationships, and I often find myself bored with the people around me, but dependent on spending time with them because I feel uncomfortable without having active social interactions (I both fear the social stigma, and actually dislike constant solitude past a certain length of time). I am also incredibly nostalgic, against all logical reasoning (my childhood was not particularly good or bad, but I definitely remember it too fondly), and become hung up on the past very easily. 

I used to have incredible anger, and I could only hold it back for so long before I would end up overreacting and breaking ties with my close personal friends and partners over petty, small incidents. I have been able to ""repair"" some of these relationships, but I do not talk to any of them anymore except for rare circumstances, and never for very long. I have deep regret for these lost relationships, not particularly because I want to be around/with them anymore, but mainly because I really wish I had handled it better and managed to keep being friends while maybe not being together or best friends or what have you. I have no idea if it is actually feasible to ever try to recover these lost relationships, or if it would be much healthier to just let them go and let go of the past. I imagine that the answer is the latter, but I feel that knowing something is bad for you isn't enough to fix the problem. I wish I could be more assertive and upfront with my real feelings, but I feel like I can't risk losing all of my friendships/relationships, which is what I envision happening when I think about it. ""Nobody wants to be your friend/date you, they just want you to make them laugh/entertain you/use you"" is what I have in the back of my head at all times.

However, I sometimes have moments of great confidence in which I really cut through the cross talk in my own head and really focus on what I want, and I go for it. These feelings typically apply to school and work; I'm in junior year studying engineering and doing very well academically, and I have internship experience that I enjoyed a lot, and have recently had interviews for next summer's internships that I thought went really well. I'll still be interviewing throughout the semester too, which is helping to drive my interest in the field. I don't really know how I managed to convince myself to take school seriously despite feeling unimportant as a person, but I really am thankful that I have that trait. My situation could be so much more worse that I typically feel that I should just suck it up and focus on doing the right things, but all too often I break and can't minimize my problem successfully. I wish I could throw myself even more into school, but I've realized that I can't really control my interest level in something by sheer will. I lift weights 3 times a week and have made mediocre progress; I still have the body image issues I had when I used to be fat (I lost 60 lbs my freshman year of college; I was 6'2"" 165 then, and I spent the next year or so building up to 6'2"" 195, I don't really know why I went into detail), and never really feel comfortable with the way I look. Outside of lifting I can't really bring myself to do any other active things, so I usually end up doing pull-ups on my doorhang pull up bar. Again, I'm not sure why I went into so much detail. Maybe it's helping me to detail everything. I have an unusually high desire to know things, particularly things about people, even people I don't know or have ever met. It actually does aggravate me to not know something, and I have to try and convince myself it's alright if I can't learn it (I honestly wanted to know personal things about somebody's friend in Boy Scouts, not really because I cared about the person a whole lot, but really just because I try to learn everything I can) and I have a feeling that that quality is off-putting to some people, people who are more private and don't feel comfortable about me knowing their personal life. But at the same time, I never let anyone around me know anything *very* personal about myself. I don't think anyone who knows me really actually thinks much about me or knows much about me. 


Oh my god I can't really fathom how much I've just ranted here. I think I just needed to say something about it, for maybe somebody, even just myself, to be able to see my problems written out. I really would appreciate any kind of input, but definitely I would appreciate as much thought as you could give me; I really will take this to heart, I need to hear somebody else's thoughts.

Thank you for your time and your consideration"

My grades didn't come out too well and medical school isn't an option anymore. Although I could try again, I don't have a drive for it anymore. I'm getting kicked out because of my failure so I need advice.

I am a 22 year old male living in Dallas, Texas. 
I have about $12,000 saved up. I have 0 credit (no cred history), no car, NO debt (not even loans), no job. I have a desktop pc and 2 laptops. I'm going back to college to pursue a Computer Science degree (I have a path that offers bachelors+masters fast with internship and ultimately a job right after graduation). This time I will be taking a loan.

I have found a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment for $520 a month including water that's close to my university with fantastic reviews. I also know how to cook, and I'm usually on a diet so I don't eat as much.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated on where to look and what to look for. I'm looking at used Honda Accords on craigslist that won't break the bank. Should I pay monthly or all in one? Also, should I get any job or one that relates to computer science? What should I do about furniture? What electricity and internet company should I look at?

About 4 years of laziness go by where I played in a few bands, got kicked out, bounced between places to stay or slept in my car. Could never land a technical job anywhere, local repair shops, big retail chains, it was hard to find a place to get a real paying computer gig. I had a sales job in mom&amp;pop retail where they found out I was good with computers so they let me help with their issues. Some more time goes by, end up leaving there, hours were scarce. Ended up landing a 1099 gig doing in-home PC repair for a small local biz using the previous retail experience. There was a lot of travel with my own car, eventually I didn't make enough to cover my fuel expenses, my car was in disrepair and I couldn't afford it. I had to quit after a year. Soon after, I got lucky landing a gig at another place through a temp agency as a labor worker, temp to hire kind of thing. I put in my temp time, noticed all kinds of computer related things happening all around me (manufacturing). My number came up to be hired in, I worked hard and learned fast. Before the interview I beefed up my resume and brought that with, right off the bat I whipped that out and gave my self sales pitch and if they had any type of technical or mechanical position etc that I would be interested. Few days later I got a call that they had an entry level IT position for me. I about shit my pants, I was so excited. The guy that hired me was the coolest dude, he was about twice my age and played guitar in a metal band. I think he liked me right away because of that common interest. 

I threw myself into the deep end on this one. I had never even touched a real server, let alone racks upon racks full of them, or enterprise class networking gear, or anything we would expect to find in a large business environment. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I was fortunate enough to spend a week with the guy I was replacing to get on track. They started me out doing just end user stuff, but also some junior sysadmin type stuff. I eventually worked my way into just about every facet of IT at that location. I worked with 1 other local IT guy and often worked with corporate IT on projects. They always wanted me on projects and not other dude, he was a bad team player, I think he felt threatened by ""corporate"". I learned a lot working with him though, super talented and knowledgeable dude, but a lot of times he was a dick to me because I didn't do things the exact way he wanted them done. Very often he was passive aggressive in his communication, the kind of dude that sat 5 feet away from me and would never say a word to me. He'd email me. From 5 feet away. That's not how you treat someone you're supposed to be mentoring. I think that deep down he just did not like me.   

Fast forward a few months, the cool guy IT manager left, we began reporting to someone in corporate IT. A year goes by, no local IT manager. My counterpart's attitude toward me worsened. My hours got cut. My access was then limited. Couldn't do my job. Couldn't get admin access to ANYTHING. Not even workstations. It was justified because I was an intern. I had been there 3 years doing everything a sysadmin would do. Had to go get other dude every time I needed an admin login to anything. One day poking around I found some login script where corporate thought it would be a good idea to store service account credentials in plaintext, account had domain admin rights. Password was set to never expire. I used that account to continue doing my job for the next few months without having to bow down to my counterpart every time I needed access to something tied to AD.  

One day I get email from cool guy IT manager that had left, says he has a position open, send my resume in. Got interviewed a few times. Got the job.  

Get this: the same day I got the new offer, I had a meeting with my corporate IT boss, he says that I will now report to other IT guy. I replied with my two week notice. It was fucking fantastic! The looks on their faces was priceless. I came to work two more days before my newly appointed boss told me to clear out my desk and hand in company property before going on a permanent lunch break. At least they paid me for the two weeks.

I've been at this new place for the last few years as a sole sysadmin developing all sorts of new skills with virtualization, storage, backup and DR, automating absolutely everything I can, documenting all the things... I work with some great people (in my department that is). Once again I dove right into the deep end on this one but it's been great. I love learning new things, I love to problem solve, and I can't wait for the next big challenge. 

Wow it took me forever to write this.

I'm going to warn you guys that I'm probably going to write an incomprehensible life story before getting to the point because I'm just getting stuff off  my chest and I actually don't mind if anyone has anything to say because it's therapeutic writing this out. There will probably be a TL;DR because this is a huge fucking wall of text. You may skip to certain parts of my rant/blog or whatever as you please (probably the -PAST- part haha). The ""straight-to-the-point"" will probably be in the TL;DR and after it.

I just want to let you guys know that I do not want to be referred over to /r/suicidewatch as I do not plan on taking my own life as I understand the devastating wake one can leave if they were to take their own life. I also am going to try to be as anonymous as possible because I have friends and family that browse reddit often. Also, I apologize if I'm all over the place because I've had something that had severely bothered me recently that made me recede back into my previous ways.

**-MY PAST-**

About myself, I'm an 2x year old guy who has probably been depressed since the beginning of high school. My parents are well off and are immigrants who left their home country due to heavy military conflicts who are living the dream in the US, so anything I do is minuscule compared to them and my problems are nothing compared to theirs. Back in highschool I was socially withdrawn, a loner, was bullied, and probably considered a loser among my former friends. I didn't really know I was depressed until I got into my first year of college. 

My parents wanted me to go into medicine as it's the best thing in the world, so I felt like I had a lot of weight on my shoulders. On the second semester of college, I started to lose motivation, started to do horribly on exams, and my grades dropped drastically. I had actually developed some sort of chest pain every time I felt down that felt like it was sinking deeper into my chest. Luckily by the end of that semester I didn't fail the classes, but it was still a D which doesn't look good for me at all and lost all hope in getting into the medical field. 

During the summer I contemplated suicide. Before actually planning it, I decided I should try to seek psychological help via the student psychology counselor. I want to let you guys know that my family doesn't really believe that mental health is a ""real"" disease/disorder and getting help is for it is ridiculous.  After getting asked several questions by some intern and being transferred over to the actual counselor, I found that this did not help me at all, as they didn't give me a real answer and probably didn't really understand what I was trying to say. The intern was surveying me and jotted down any particular notes that would be of interest for the counselor. I did not mention I was suicidal so they just labeled me as depressed with ""morbid thoughts"". During the talk with the counselor, she told me that there was a mobile psych unit and that she would call them if I wanted to seek help. I agreed to try it. As she was making the call to them, I overheard ""Does he need to be restrained?"" and I immediately refused as I didn't want any part of that and did not want to be labeled as a loony bin. This was detrimental to me as it really made me feel like absolutely no one understood me at all. So for most of the summer, I just sat around my house locked up in my room watching shows and played video games all day and night while planning how to do it. 

When I finally got towards the date, I broke down and told my parents and my brother. They seemed to take it well and was supportive of me by telling me to take a few months off to get myself back together. I've never seen my brother cry in a long time when I talked to him about it when we were driving around a few days after. I understood that if I were to take my own life, I would leave my family in the state I am in. But for some reason, they still didn't recognize that I still had those feelings and that I should seek help (well I personally believed I needed help but didn't know where to get it). Atleast the thought of suicide was gone even though I still had the ""morbid thoughts"".

**-RECENTLY-**

I've recently completed a program offered by the local community college that was a healthcare provider program that lasted roughly 2-2.5 year (I stumbled upon this program on a flyer after the ""past"" thing). During the program, I had the false sense that I had a purpose in life and that this was it. Coming out of this program with no real experience in working or with people, my self confidence dropped to an all-time low as I was expected more of myself and that anything I do could get me sued, terminated, and worse, hurt someone. I was supposed to be in charge and I'm the most responsible for my actions in what I do. 

The first real job (first job in my life) I got was rough as I was so green and didn't understand the simple tasks that weren't really talked about during the program. I just couldn't handle it. I worked part time for a few days and I felt I hadn't gotten better at what I was trained to do. I dreaded coming to work every time and slowly became more and started to develop some sort of anxiety every time I received a patient. One day, the company went out of business all of a sudden when I came to work one day and nothing was at the office. I've only been there for a month and only worked 2 days a week (long hours) and was still in their new hire training period. I was absolutely relieved when I realized I didn't have to work there anymore. So the only thing I thought to do at the time was to take some classes to complete an associates program for about 6-9 months.

**-CURRENTLY-**

After that, a friend told me I should join the company he works at as they were far more stable and more friendly to the inexperienced (same job title). It would probably be a very ideal job for many who are in the field and want to make great money while going to school. I would get paid more and had an opportunity to have them schedule work time in a way it wouldn't affect school time (I didn't want to stay in this field forever). So I built up some sort of temporary self-confidence at the time and applied for it. I got the job and was beaming with happiness. I didn't have a hard time going through the classroom training until I got into the actual on-the-job training. I did fine the first day, but it went downhill the second day. I couldn't do as I was expected and my mind went completely blank when I was supposed to be able to handle my own job (simple tasks). I managed to go through the day but I absolutely hated every moment of it. My friend saw me and shot me a text about it and told me I should just go balls deep, balls to the wall, and be cocky/confident as hell. I can't very well do that, because I just did not have that in me.

The next day, which was yesterday, I had the worst mental breakdown I've had in my entire life. When I was doing my job, I just without warning started sweating profusely, my arms and legs shaking uncontrollably, my heart rate probably increased 2x, and my hearing was going away. I knew what I was having was an anxiety/panic attack and I couldn't continue doing my job. I basically pissed a lot of people off and made a complete fool of myself. I was utterly embarrassed. I talked to the person I was working with and asked for his suggestions. He suggested I go see a doctor to see about treating my anxiety problem. When I got home after work, my parents obviously knew that I didn't have an awesome day and I told them what happened. Basically what they said in our native language, ""Suck it up and grow some balls. You're not a woman, etc. I've had a gun pointed to my head and had several instances where my life and others were at stake, etc."" My dad literally said ""deal with it"". It made me fucking feel pathetic. When I asked if I could see a doctor about this, they said straight up told me no (I'm currently under their health insurance so I have no say whatsoever). 

I have not quit my job yet, but I may be called into a meeting after this mishap.

**TL;DR**
I just can't seem to do anything right in my life. Anything I do, I would fail hard and make a fool out of myself. I'm terribly indecisive It's so frustrating because I can't even do anything in my current state. I'm always down and when I'm down, I'm REALLY depressed. I can hide my emotions very easily, but when it's at its worst, people can see it. I let people down and it really gets deep under my skin. I have a very low confidence level and I don't really know how to raise it. As seen in the ""-CURRENTLY-"" section, I've recently discovered that my mental statuses are debilitating in everyday life and I can't seem to grasp living anymore. I honestly feel like it would be better if I disappeared off the face of the earth. I have also realized that I really dislike the job I have trained and studied for 2 years (I have a deep respect for the people who do this job), but if I stop people would think I'm just a cowardly bitch and a quitter. It just seems like everyone around me tells me to suck it up and deal with it. I'm pretty sure the people who saw me that day (explained in the last paragraph of ""-Currenty-"") definitely feel that way. Maybe even my own parents would feel this way, since they don't believe that I have a serious underlying issue.

My question now is what the fuck am I supposed to do? I haven't the slightest clue what to do next because I can't even think straight.
I don't mind if any of you guys think less of me, but I feel like I'm at the lowest point in my life right now and I can't seem to get out of it. I've tried really hard to turn my life around, but failed miserably.

If reddit can help me, great. If not, that's fine too. It made me feel a little better because I'm able to express myself how I feel right now than to listen to someone tell me to suck it up.

10kmdh,20,2012-09-27,Got my first big boy job - now to tackle the touch decisions...,deathsythe,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10kmdh/got_my_first_big_boy_job_now_to_tackle_the_touch/,"So lets just say for argument's sake that I have my first real job after undergrad. (Yay!)

Now lets also say that I have a mortgage worth of student loan debt (well over $100k)

I need a serious plan.

So I hit excel and started crunching the numbers. (this is the best my ECON courses at an engineering school can do for me basically)

I am fortunate enough that I have a job where it is possible to live home with my folks - which I don't mind about. I am also fortunate enough to have them take care of my cell phone (family plan) and basic living expenses (meals at home, laundry, heat, electric, yada yada). I am however responsible for my car (which I own) so gas and maintenance is on me (Which I wouldn't have any other way.

I have since begun making frugal lifestyle choices; not going out as much with my girlfriend, brewing my coffee at home instead of stopping out on the way, switching my little remaining credit card balance to a interest free promo deal (wish a plan in place to have it **all** gone well before the period ends), switched to a no-fee credit union, etc...

I also am retaining my part time job at a local deli on weekends.


So here are some of my questions:

* My employer provides company matching up to a certain percentage of my annual salary in a Simple IRA. I am currently budgeting to meet that percentage. Smart- Yes/No?

* I am currently enrolled in grad school as well. I finished damn near all of it during undergrad, but still have like 3 courses to take. I was fortunate enough to get into a program where I receive the same amount (%) of grants/scholarships as I did during undergrad. This puts my tuition at like $2k per semester I take a class at night. Should I continue this? Should I pay for this in cash? Should I take out a loan (good credit score btw) to pay for it and add it to the model I have? Also - I haven't discussed it (regarding numbers) with my employer as to what finishing grad school will afford me on the job, or even if they have tuition reimbursement - but last I checked they don't. I really don't want to put it off though, especially since I am so close yanno?

* Currently putting anything/everything extra I have into paying off the loans, starting with the highest rate first. I don't really want to consolidate, deffer, or any of that because from what I can tell it isn't very good for your credit.

* In my current model, I have allocated to make not only the company matching % contribution to my Simple IRA, but also my maximum contribution to my RothIRA (because I am afraid that the government is going to get tired of not being able to have their hands in it and is going to do away with the provision for it.) Thoughts on that? (FWIW I have a pretty sizable investment in it currently because I made the max contribution every year I was on internships.

* I have halted most of my hobbies that aren't frugal - Silver coin collecting and firearms primarily. I do occasionally buy and flip things on the side though - should I continue to do that?

* I have to commute by car to work, there is really no opportunity for mass transit or bicycling. I do want to eventually get myself another motorcycle (I don't have one anymore) to save on gas. (in b4 - deadly, gunna crash and die, etc...) My car does get decent MPG (~28 or so) for an older car.


All in all - based on my current model I am able to save around $1000 net a month (after expenses, taxes, etc...) to put towards my loan repayment on top of the minimum. As I stated before - current strategy is minimum on everything that isn't the highest rate at the moment, wash rinse repeat. My model does not take into account raises or anything, so it is just stock as of right now. Based on it - I will be paid down to nothing in just over 6 years. (in which I will update ya'll - OP will deliver!)



Am I on my way? Anyone see any egregious errors or flaws that I'm missing?




Thanks to everyone here for all the information, knowledge, and help that everyone's posted to get myself, and plenty of others like me, into this mindset.

Edit - it appears I made a typo on the title - I will live forever with the shame... :P

It's a great company, great position it is just that it is a contract role and depending on how I do here I can get a full time role later on. I'm familiar with the company and think I can do a great job here.

HOWEVER, I also applied to a different company. The problem is I THINK I'll get an interview but there is no guarantee. I went to a recruitment session and I had a great time there, I think I absolutely impressed many of the important people there. My friend who I applied to the same role, got rejected already and I have not heard back. My guess is that because the application deadline for this job is September 29, they are going to wait until they have all the applications before deciding when to interview everyone. While I am confident (but not sure) I will get an interview, there is no guarantee at all I will get the job. The job is very similar, except it is a full time role and is in the downtown area of my city a place in which I'd love to live one day. It really is the ideal role (my next ideal role would be a full time offer from the company I got the offer from).

What should I do Reddit, and how should I proceed?

**TL;DR** Have one job offer on the table that needs to be responded to by today; and waiting to even just interview(not even sure if I'll get that) for another role I REALLY want. What do I do?

[Hitbox team: Are you guys actually capable of SSing the insane ""difficult"" levels you build?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|Hahahahahaha.
[For those not in the know, have a look: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|^^^no ^^^:(
[This is for everyone. If you could have any 5 indie games in a Humble Indie Bundle what would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtaez?context=5)|Hey, I am a huge fan of your channel!  I subscribed ever since the Overgrowth video, which has made a huge difference for Wolfire, by the way.
 |It is hard to pick five games, without revealing Humble Indie Bundle 7. :)  
 |Cave Story.
 |Braid.
 |Dear Esther.
 |Minecraft.
 |Half-life 3.
[Wait, you guys have future bundles scheduled already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvbpu?context=5)|Not exactly scheduled, but in the works.  It can take a long time to bring games to Linux.
[What are the profits of the Humble Bundle compared to actually selling the games individually at their regular prices? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtahy?context=5)|For Rochard, it's volume &amp; visibility. Our game is not very well known and those who know think it's PSN-only game. We had a bad start last year due to PSN breach and bad market timing. Also, bringing the game to the Linux platform has been very exciting.
 |It's a good boost of cash to game sales, though obviously the unit price is a lot lower than we might get via other channels.
 |Funnily enough, our Shatter sales are currently up on Steam too, so the increased fan base and visibility on the game is already starting to have a ""downstream"" effect.
[I've heard about Rochard for the first time with this bundle and I just can't stop playing! Thank you guys for an amazing game and a flawless Linux port!  If you ever release Rochard 2 (I saw the video, there are some nice new mechanics there\) you'll have my preorder from day one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvgt6?context=5)|Thanks for the Linux port belong to the awesome Linux team from Unity!
[HIB games have linux ports and Steam codes. Steam is coming to Linux. Do any of you have plans to bring your Linux ports to Steam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtann?context=5)|Yes indeed we do :)
 |We will also use the Steamplay option if available, so like with the Mac/PC version, one key to rule them all.
 |Definitely. With a Linux build and Steam on Linux, it would be insane not to do it :)
 |Yes, we are hassling Valve already.
[Are any of you worried about profit lost in HIB as far as those that pay &lt;$1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Those who pay $1 for the bundle probably wouldn't pay $1 (at 90% off) for a single game on Steam.  Well, at least something is still going to charity right.  The Bundle isn't all about profit.  Disappointing if people pay less than $1 but that is the nature of the beast, and we wouldn't have the high volume of sales and higher payers without the word of mouth the opportunity to pay what you want generates.
[Is there any significant impact, and what is the percentage of people who purchase just a dollar or less?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Since adding the $1 minimum for Steam keys, penny purchases have stopped being a problem.  The real issue was people hoarding Steam keys for resale, just to give out for fun, or to use for getting extra coal, like in Valve's Christmas promotion.  At a $1 floor, that issue almost completely disappears.
[Would you rather fight 50 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt8y5?context=5)|Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?  Horses and ducks are both by nature herbivores and non aggressive to meat, which I am made of.  So either one should be ok because I don't think they would want to fight me, and I don't want to fight them.
[Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du5iv?context=5)|The 50 duck-sized horses are taped together to form a horse-sized horse made of duck-sized horses.
[Is that even legal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dwfkd?context=5)|It's fine, the duck-sized horses are actually comprised of millions of ant-sized ducks, and the ant-sized ducks are just made of carbon.
[If I had a game I created and would like to put it for Humble Bundle, what should I do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ju?context=5)|We used Unity3D engine (which I have a strong love-hate relationship with), and they did all the dirty work for us. What we did is make the actual builds using the editor provided by Unity Linux team, test it out and report back to them.
[Thanks for your answer, another question for programmers. There is a lot of young game developers/graduates who are looking for experience. Would it be possible to get internship at Humble Bundle? Do you look for people like this? What type of skills are expected by developers like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dti6g?context=5)|You need experience and connections, but also burning desire to be in the business. Unfortunately I haven't heard any school that could actually provide you that.
 |Start small. Best thing you can do to yourself is actually finish a game. There's much more work in it that you might think of.
[How did you get your games involved with HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ij?context=5)|The founder of our company met with the Humble Bundle team at Game Connection Lyon some years ago, probably in 2009. They contacted us after PSN release in October 2011. We were supposed to be in the bundle earlier, but we didn't have proper Linux build until 22nd of September.
[Hey, they only gave me a coffee!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtx5a?context=5)|You should have held out.
[Any news about the Mac / Linux versions of Vessel ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9pg?context=5)|We currently have three Linux game developers working on the Mac and Linux builds, but it is still experiencing some pretty big issues and unfortunately is still not ready to go.  We were totally sure that it was going to be ready last week, but unexpected issues keep popping up, so it is really hard to get an updated ETA other than ""hopefully very soon"".
[With Steam for Linux imminent, will the Linux versions of current Humble Bundle games be available on Steam? Will future bundles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|We plan to support Steam for Linux.  We've been hassling Valve about it.  Keen to be in the first wave.
[Do you think more indie developers will begin to focus on Linux because of Steam and these bundles? What about the larger developers? (I asked a similar question a few years ago, but I think it's worth revisiting.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|Unity3D on Linux is going to be big. We'll definitely put the Linux version on Steam asap.
[When is the Mac version of Torchlight II coming out? Do do you see TLII being in a Humble Bundle anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtckv?context=5)|That's next on the agenda, but it will take a couple months at least.
[Hi, thanks for doing this. My question is, to nobody in particular, What is the part of your game that you are most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt97e?context=5)|I made most of the physics based gameplay code in Rochard, and I have to say that's the part I'm most proud of. Originally we had quite little physics gameplay in the game, but it ended up being the most important aspect of the game in the end!
 |For me all the systems we made were cool for a limited time and them sort of just become part of the background, and I don't think about them much once they work.  This may be why we kept adding stuff to SPAZ.  We wanted to recapture that cool ""shiny new stuff"" feeling for a while.
 |In the end, for me when we get a piece of fan mail from someone who has sunk 50+ hours into SPAZ and then provides suggestions for SPAZ, desire for SPAZ2, that is really cool.  To know you touched another gamer with your crazy ideas.
 |The soundtrack of Shatter is obviously a great success and highlight.
 |But I like the fact we took the challenge of a ""broken"" genre head on, something that had known flaws, and were able to overcome them with thoughtful design and usability, bringing ""control"" to a genre that has none.  We purposely set out to do that and happy we succeeded.
 |I'm most proud that we actually managed to finish Dustforce and that people got to play it (and that some of them enjoyed it)!
 |Un-humble answer: I made the tech that let us throw about 11,000 (I think) high res sprites at the game (e.g, [here's dustwraith's generated sprite sheet](http://i.imgur.com/HH9yo.png) (scaled down)) and use any of them wherever we liked without having to budget x sprites per area, or compress them all ugly, or make them lower res.
 |Also you can make levels *REALLY* big, like hundreds of millions of pixels across, but we never used that tech.
 |^^^:(
 |I'm most proud that we were able to make a game that connected with the heritage of ARPGs, do it with a small, dedicated team, and basically provide a stable foundation for our company. Oh, and only charge $20 for it at release.
[I just wanted to say that the physics in Rochard are amazing! Did you come up with any of the puzzles or did you have to make the physics first so that puzzles could be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtdox?context=5)|Creating the levels for Rochard was quite liquid and organic process. Originally the character could not affect the world (he was just an observer in point of physics -- engine/PhysX restriction), and level designers were creating puzzle that did not require player interaction, like the fuses, lasers, forcefields and such.
 |Later on, when I was able to redo the whole character physics system, we we're able to do puzzles with player interacting with the elements in the world. So the designers would go back, tweak the levels and the puzzles and come up with something cool.
 |We don't have much traditional physics puzzles in the game (such as see-saws and such). There is a lot more that can be done!
[My only question at the moment is ""When will my Torchlight characters get faces?"" I love that you guys fixed the game crashing portal bug on Linux so fast. I can live with the missing heads, but it is quite disconcerting when viewing my character up close.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtemg?context=5)|That's a known issue that should hopefully be fixed soon. Sorry about that one!
[Dustforce is one of the most exhilaratingly fun games I have ever played. Although I kind of sometimes hate you guys for making a game that is so singularly, unbelievably frustrating that I sometimes want to launch my gamepad down the hallway :P.  On a technical note, though, I'll admit I'm really, really impressed with the tech (and I'm one of those snobby systems-programmer types\); it's pretty, fluid, and well-animated, and yet doesn't kill my system. How do you go about generating the sprites, and how do you manage to keep the game's framerate smooth with that much to render?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dus9z?context=5)|Thanks, that's very kind of you! I don't get many compliments on the tech, only complaints when it doesn't work! But that's just the nature of the work.  Finally sprites are drawn by using pages from the buffer texture. We don't use an indirection texture (though we did for a while), instead I just draw multiple quads for sprites that take up more than one page.
 |The sprites are packed in to groups (i.e the dustwraith ""sprite set"" above)[(another example\\)](http://snag.gy/B6MfO.jpg) using some basic binary tree bin packing, then those groups are packed in to a single ""Virtual Texture"" space. Each of those little pink(?) squares represents a page, which are stored compressed (losslessly) in ram. When a sprite needs to be drawn and it isn't already in video memory, its page/s are decompressed and loaded in to free slot/s in the page buffer texture.
[This right here is awesome. I'm a nerd for this kind of stuff and would LOVE to hear more of it. You should do another AMA some time, or some kind explanation of development (assuming it wouldn't give away any trade secrets you may have\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e32ex?context=5)|Thanks! I've been saying since Dustforce was released that I'd do a blog post about the tech, but I'm not really sure how to approach it so I never got around to it. Maybe one day...
 |Secrets bad!
[This is awesome, thank you for this comment.  I'm out of my element with graphics programming, is this the kind of thing you're referring to when you say ""virtual texture""? Or is Dustforce doing something different?  Amazing job, the game runs beautifully.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e2hmx?context=5)|Yep, very similar to that. The main difference is we're not using an indirection texture (which the pixel shader would use to look up the correct page according to the UV co-ordinates), instead I cut up the sprites in to multiple pages (if necessary) and draw from the page buffer directly.
[@maxschaefer: how did the Torchlight 2 launch go?? @Lifeformed: This isn't a question but I really love your music, your soundtrack has been on repeat since I got the bundle. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtak5?context=5)|The launch went great! Of course there were some issues, there always are in a big multiplayer game launch, but I think overall it went really well, and people are loving it. Thanks for the compliment on the music! We are really lucky to have Matt Uelmen as a sound guy.
[Hello, apparently, porting games on Linux made ​​specifically for the humble bundle. Will you continue to offer your future games under Linux?  (I understand if Baddie22 not responding :\)\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrif?context=5)|We've had a good response from Linux users, so we'd consider doing it again for future titles.  Once Steam for Linux is up and running that will make it an even better proposition.
[Never heard of Rochard when I bought the bundle, then played it, and loved it! Best game in the bundle, imho.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Here's a Rochard 2 demo/preview we made last year (it uses mostly Rochard assets): [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7K8bUD_CSs)
[Please tell me you're working on a sequel!  Edit: also, thanks for the linux version \^_^](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Unfortunately, we don't have the funding for the sequel. There's lot of debt to pay before we can continue work on it.
[Aw man, that looks awesome.  Very sorry to hear about the debt/lack of funding, I hope you guys figure something out eventually. Crowdfunding perhaps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dug7e?context=5)|Definitely, crowd funding is an option.
[Question to any, has having your game ported to Linux increased the chance of further ports to that platform in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du0eg?context=5)|Probably. Rochard has been a test bench for Unity3D Linux team, who have done awesome job!
[If i've to ask one question, it would be : How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Started in 1997(eek!) by getting together with a couple of friends and ordering a Net Yaroze from Sony (the home programmable PlayStation).  Kind of grew from there.
[*This question is for everyone, feel free to answer it if you want. And yes i mean your beginning in creation of indie games.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Messing around in Flash MX in high school, tried ActionScript, found it was fun to make stuff.
[What according to you is the future of distribution for indie developers? Steam or Humble Bundle type sales? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtnla?context=5)|Both. I think both are wonderful for indie developers - the Humble Bundle gets a lot of eyes on games people might never have heard about, and the unique pay model makes it accessible for almost anyone, and Steam provides the year-round sales platform and indie needs for stability.
 |While sales and bundles are great for cash boosts, I don't think developers can rely on them alone for profitability, and they are ""training"" consumers to expect higher and higher value for every dollar.
 |Digital distribution is key, but how games are monetized is going to have to continue to evolve.
 |Why not both? :)
[Will there ever be a visual novel or racing game in a Humble Bundle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtapi?context=5)|Hmmm not a racing game per se, but we'd be interested to port GripShift to PC/Mac/Linux and have in a bundle.
[To everyone: If you could only play one more game for the rest of your life, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcj3?context=5)|Probably Civilization IV.. it's frustrating, but I boot it up at least once a year.
 |Deus Ex (the original)  7 times and counting.
 |Eyetoy Groove.  Seriously.
[This is for HIB. In most bundles, you add some games after a few days of sale. What's the reasoning behind this? Do you experience a surge in sales after doing this? Also, do those new games now get equal share from future sales or those developers don't get as much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtgo1?context=5)|I'm guessing it both adds more value and gives HIB a chance to reach out again midway through to keep the momentum going.  There definitely seems to be a surge, so whatever the reasoning, that is a positive outcome.
 |It's a way to help rekindle excitement about the promotion.  The games are typically from previous bundles that we have run, so it is a good way for people who missed bundle X to catch up.
 |The new games typically get an equal share going starting when they are added (you can always tweak or see the splits by clicking the triangle next to the developers slider).
[This is about the Linux version of Torchlight, I'm sorry, but I keep wondering about this. Please note that I'm eternally grateful for porting Torchlight to Linux, and I love the game and have played it in wine until now.  Did seriously nobody notice the missing heads (nobody even ran it once before release?\) or did you decide that nobody will play it on Linux anyways, and those who do are used to being treated bad? Would you make the same decision of releasing a broken game if it was Windows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtjtg?context=5)|That was a pretty unfortunate bug.  It is known and should hopefully be fixed soon.
[I bought this Humble Bundle for one dollar so I can redeem the games on Steam. I'm flat broke this month, so that's why I couldn't spend more. I feel guilty for doing this. Do you get a lot of people paying a buck or less for great selections such as this one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrvy?context=5)|Sounds like it's a buck more than otherwise have gone to the Bundle so thank you!
 |Thanks! Send me a PM if you feel like your bundle is missing some Dustforce!
[Really enjoyed playing through Rochard.  I caught a really obscure Ghostbusters quote part way in; ""Listen..  you smell something?"" and was wondering what other little easter-eggs I might have missed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfke?context=5)|I haven't noticed that one! There are a lot of references to popular culture in the game. It's not a secret, but I love the fact that the voice of John Rochard is mr. Jon St John, the voice of Duke Nukem. These characters are quite the opposite as protagonists.
 |I'm not sure where that was?... I can't remember that sentence :O.
[As an aspiring musician, at what point of development do you normally include musicians for score and specifically, at what point did they get involved with your game in HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtl70?context=5)|For Shatter, we had Module involved from very early in development.  It was important to create the score as something that informed the visuals and gameplay and wasn't just bolted on.  You don't always have that luxury, but in this case it worked out great.
 |Tough to get a gig though.  With so many other musicians trying to break into games you have to be both good and persistent.  Give it a shot and see what happens. Good luck with your efforts! 
[How do you honestly feel about the people who only donates $0.1 ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dw11h?context=5)|I know the transaction costs, servers and bandwidth cost more, so it doesn't feel very good.
[Do you have any plans on adding your games to Desura? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dugjf?context=5)|Work in progress.

I graduated this may and began working my first job in June as an intern then hired on full time in august due to excellent performance. I want to start looking for a better job and have already proven that I am a great engineer here by getting my hands in a lot of different, multi-disciplinary projects, and designing/creating a lot of various new products. Enough to where I think I have a very strong portfolio and resume to get a few interviews at bigger companies through my network (also as another random question, even though I signed an NDA at the place I work, am I allowed to use CAD models I created/worked on in my portfolio that I am showing future employers or no?).

I was just wondering when I start interviewing, what should I tell them the reason for wanting to switch jobs so early on. I dont want them to think that I would flake at the first chance of a better job because honestly I am looking for a stable career I can stay at for at least 5 years, I just expect to be compensated at the fair market value for it and it doesnt look like it is going to happen here so I just want to cut my losses and leave. I don't feel like this would be too professional to bring up at an interview though should the question arise, but I could be wrong?



Thanks for any advice.

Sigh.

I have always had a fear of flying, but I recently had taken control of it. I have family in Greece, so I have flown there back and forth 3 times previously, once alone. I've also flown on about 12-14 other flights in my life, so you would think I would finally get over my fear.

But this time, I'm leaving my girlfriend, who I live with, and my own cat. It just has seemed to make my fear of flying 1000 times worse, seeing now it's mashed up with my anxiety of having to spend almost 3 months away from my girlfriend and the majority of my family.

It's gotten so bad that I have been having panic attacks all day today and have been having random bouts of crying. I don't really know how to deal with this, it's like I've taken all of my anxiety involved with this and focused it into my fear of flying. :(

Is there anything I can do? Can anyone talk me down? I'm NOT going to let my fear of flying control me, but I can barely stomach this feeling of fear that I have for tomorrow.

I'm sorry if this seems like a rant, it's just I'm so worried I can barely think straight. My fear of flying.... The thought of sleeping in an empty bed for the next few months.... It's really making my anxiety go crazy."

10mmle,11,2012-09-28,"[24m] dating a longtime friend [24f] and need a little advice Re: grad school, stress related libido issues, and emotional withdrawal.",888throwaway8888,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10mmle/24m_dating_a_longtime_friend_24f_and_need_a/,"/r/relationships,

I am in a rather unique situation, and don't have many people that I can talk to about it, so here goes. Throwaway account because she's also a redditor.


I have been dating one of my closest friends since high school for roughly 3 months. She had just gotten out of a long term relationship a few months prior. In a drunken moment back in July, I told her I'd had a crush on her since I was 14, and she admitted she felt the same. We intended to wait a while before jumping into anything, but as we began hanging out as potential lovers, that plan went out the window in a matter of weeks. Things during the summer were fantastic, but as the semester has progressed, they've gotten less fantastic. We've always had good chemistry and been able to communicate well, but lately she's been kind of emotionally withdrawn. I attribute this to the fact that she's in her last year before graduate school, stressed as hell about the application process, etc... It hasn't been until the past month or so that things have really become confusing.


There are three main things I need advice about:



1)She's emotionally withdrawn: She's always been slightly guarded about her emotions- I came into the relationship knowing and accepting that. Since the start of the semester, though, I feel like she's not communicating to me what she wants/needs from the relationship. I've been torn between being the supportive, present boyfriend, and giving her her time and space to tackle the grad school admissions process. I want to know what's going on in her head, and I've talked to her about it, but she keeps saying she needs time to process the semester &amp; to be patient.  I have no problem with the patience part- I waited ten years for the right opportunity to date her. I just want to know what I need to do.



2)Stress/body image issues manifesting as low libido : When we first started dating, our sex life was fantastic. The chemistry was great, our sex drives matched, all was well. We haven't had sex in almost a month. I stayed over at her house last night, and it seemed like the mood was right. When I went to fooling around, she said she wasn't feeling it. This has happened the past few times. I'm not looking for the physical pleasure sex brings. Rather, I'm looking for the emotional connection that I feel has been slipping away. We talked about it last night, and she was genuinely unhappy that it hadn't happened- to the point of crying. I told her not to worry about it, and I can be patient. She's considering seeing a therapist about her body image issues and her predilection to let stress dominate her. Should I encourage this, or should I leave it be for now and let her decide? ALSO: She's on birth control- I've heard that can often kill the female libido.



3)Graduate school (AKA the elephant in the room): This is the biggie. She just finished her graduate school applications to 5 schools (She's an animal sciences major, applying to vet school.) The closest is 5 hours away. I realize that it won't be for another 8 months, and a lot can happen between now and then, but I'm still concerned about it. I love this woman, and I have since I was a young kid. Without a shadow of a doubt, I want her to remain a part of my life for a long time. She thinks she won't get accepted, but she's graduating with honors, has internship and professional experience, and letters of recommendation from doctors in her field. I think she stands a damn good shot at it. If/when she gets accepted to graduate school, should I let her go (and most likely break up in the process) or should I talk to her about moving with her?


TL;DR: Friends forever, couple for 3 months. Need advice on how to work through issues relating to stress from higher education."

Okay here's the deal.  I am going back to SE Asia in Thailand to meet up a friend for two weeks from December 14-28 then be on my own or possibly meet another friend for maybe a week or two.  Then yes actually being a solo...for the first time ever until February 11, I am going to meet my friend again from her own journey and travel to India with her.  So anyone who had experienced traveling from Thailand to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.  Please let me know what was the best thing you saw there.  How to get there, train, bus, etc.  I am planning to do my own research but I always appreciate hearing from people who had actually went there and their stories.  

When I go back to Thailand, I will be visiting my ""family"" from the school.  And then not sure where as I have not heard my friend's plans.  But ever since I got back from Thailand, Chiang Rai was the only thing in my mind that I wished I went there.  

I am DYING to go to Indonesia.  So it seems not everyone always take this route. So anybody who had.  Please do share your experience with me.

10lu16,2,2012-09-28,21 &amp; forced to take a gap year. Having a hard time planning out my near future. Assistance?,Gooeybanana,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10lu16/21_forced_to_take_a_gap_year_having_a_hard_time/,"Okay, so I originally had planned to transfer to a university this year to continue my course in dietetics(junior). Unfortunately, I somehow was left oblivious to the loan world and what credit exactly was, coupled with my parents being bankrupt = no cosigner, so I could not take out a sizable loan to pay off the remaining amount of tuition needed for this year. Since finding this out, I've gotten a credit card and I'm beginning to make diligent payments to build up a satisfactory credit score. I'm left with some decisions to make over the course of this next year until I'm ready to get back into college again.

I went through a shit storm of a summer and came to the realization that I would be FAR better off in my studies if I was moved out during the time I was in school. I love my parents' house that I've been raised in all of my life, but the noise issue(little bro w/ a disability; loves having everything loud, among all the other loud noises echoing throughout the house) is becoming an unbearable distraction that ultimately ends up with me fuming out of the house without getting much done. Obviously, money becomes an issue though if I move out. It becomes even a bigger issue after I graduate if I want to move.

If I were to move out, working 40 hours a week would be required. When I informed my adviser that I'd be working this much and doing 12 credit hours a semester(doing 12 already makes it 3 more years instead of 2 to graduate), she almost literally shat bricks...which honestly confused me. Doesn't every student do this now? Regardless, I firmly believe that the convenience of silence &amp; less traveling(would be moving closer to work &amp; with a friend I commonly hang with) would make studying much more of a breeze.

What stumps me, though, is how I'll participate in extracurricular activities for my dietetics course. With all this time spent working and studying, I just don't see free time to do anything else that might help get my name out in the field, or on a comparable experience-level as my classmates. For anyone in this profession already, I'd greatly appreciate hearing your input if you had a comparably stressful schedule yet were still able to do extracurricular activities :)

I have a local hospital that has a dietary aide position available that only offers part time, weekend hours which would be awesome for experience...but my full time job has a rather strict schedule that wouldn't really allow me to take weekends off as I'm absolutely needed on those days. The only thing really keeping me at this job is the nice pay which would greatly help with rent and bills. The Carpal Tunnel Syndrome that's developing from it, however, is beginning to make me reconsider if I should change my current path and pursue this hospital position, and perhaps find another job to get back up to 40 hours.

Everything I've mentioned seems to have linked itself in some way with one another, and it's left me confused on what I should do next. I really need to succeed these next few years when I go to college as internship acceptance appears to be pretty competitive, but I also need to find a way to make it through it all while still having money to my name. It would help me immensely if others could provide advice on what to do based off of personal experience or what have you :D

tl;dr: Forced gap year. Building credit. Want to move out because it = calmer me and more productive studying. Moving out also = money problems. Trying to find the best solution to having peaceful study sessions in order to get good grades while still maintaining money to accommodate daily needs. Questioning current job &amp; wondering about extracurricular possibilities.

Ask me questions to help me decide which is the better choice for me?,Carcats,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10ltx7/next_year_i_would_love_to_move_i_have_been_living/,"I simply need a bit of help with reflection and decision-making.

I am trying to decide between Austin, Texas, and Hamburg, Germany. I am a 19 year old female human, and I am/have been incredibly interested in film/cinema (for as long as I can remember). I recently began dating a guy here, who, incredibly, completely separately from me, decided to move to Austin next year with his friends.

I have been going to the university in my college town for a year and a half. I grew up here, and my parents still live in town as well. My first year was incredibly difficult for social/personal reasons, and I ended up incredibly depressed at the end of the school year but still managed to end the year with a respectable gpa. I decided to change my outlook and learn to be happy by myself (I ended my year-long relationship so I could rely on myself more) and went on a month-long solo trip to Europe. I visited my German family in Hamburg, where I would stay next year if I decided to move there, and travelled down through Switzerland and Italy. I speak fluent German.

Prior to anything in my life going awry, about a year and a half ago, I began thinking about moving to Austin to continue my studies at University of Texas, Austin. Because I am poor I plan on moving there and working for a year to save money and so I can become a Texas citizen and receive in-state tuition the next year.

So either place I would attempt to continue my education about film and cinema, although in Austin it would be more university oriented, whereas in Hamburg I would attempt to get an internship with a smaller film production company where my father is friends with the owners (so I believe I have a reasonable chance at an internship there).

Please please ask me questions. I sincerely hope that I posted this in the correct subreddit! Also sorry if I included too much back-story. Opinions are welcome as well.

We still Skype on a regular basis but we haven't seen each other in the flesh in over three years. I miss him a lot, he was a best friend to me and my girlfriend and practically lived on our couch (usually playing Tetris on my DS) during the day.
[I'm coming at your base with two rockvees and an ambo - you've got a jarmen, two scorps and a quad. What do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8go8?context=5)|Snipe the ambo with Jarmen and target both Scorps on the first rockvee, their missiles will insta-gib it. Kite back with all units while Jarmen picks off the MDs and the Quad adds some DPS. As soon as the Scorp missiles are re-loaded, turn around, engage the second rockvee and clean up the remainder with an a-move. EZPZ.
[What has Doug been up to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8epr?context=5)|Doug moved back west, about 4000km away from me. He's also a dad now to an unbelievably cute little girl and works full-time. I don't get to see him enough, but at least I still do (looking at you, Dave...). You should check out his podcast - [Link to sitmos.net](http://sitmos.net)
[What was the primary motivation for bring back Pure Pwnage?  Were you surprised by the fan support after all these years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x92?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OADJl-CVDo0)
 |But seriously, I've never for a moment felt comfortable leaving the web series as we did. I didn't want to regret that for the rest of my life, which is the path I was on. The movie is an opportunity to once again do something new and different to keep our creative process fun and exciting, while leaving our characters and universe in a much nicer place should we decide this is the end.
[Oh man am I pumped you're doing this. -What was your favorite experience from PP?  Did you expect the Internet show to become as big as it did?  How do you type with boxing gloves on your hands??? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yud?context=5)|The very first theatrical premiere we held at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto. We were eating at a restaurant down the street, discussing our expectations. I thought somewhere between 12 and 25 people would show up and it would be pretty awkward. Geoff left first to go to the theatre because no one would recognize him and I'll never forget the frantic phone call we received a few minutes later. The line-up was down and around the block. Nearly 800 people showed up. It's one thing to see numbers on a website and another entirely to see all those people in real life. We ended up having to run through the crowd with hoodies pulled down, panicking as we heard shouts of ""There they are!!"". Afterwards I tried to escape via the back door but it didn't work. We started getting swarmed from all around and my flight instinct kicked in and I just started running. I got stopped and swarmed in the middle of the street and luckily one of the larger fans recognized I was terrified and screamed at everyone to give me room. I spent three hours signing every last autograph and, for one moment in my life, felt like Brad Pitt. Afterwards we went to eat at an all-night diner and everything was back to normal; no one knew who the fuck I was. I didn't slept for two days. (also, man I wish I knew how to carriage-return on Reddit...)
[Why is Dave so pro at cooking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e85eq?context=5)|Because he's the pickiest eater I've ever met. Not picky in the sense that he only eats a specific variety of foods, but in the sense that quality is everything and almost nothing meets his standards, forcing him to cook for himself.
[Were you happy the way the TV series turned out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xvg?context=5)|Yes, I am happy with how it turned out, especially given the obstacles involved in making a real 'TV' show. Constant network revisions, writers/directors forced onto the project, 14 hour days with no downtime, etc. If you compare it to other TV comedies (and not our previous web series), I think it stands up. But then again, I think most modern TV comedies are pure crap, with rare exceptions like 'Louie' on FX or 'Limmy's Show' on BBC Scotland. I think a big problem for our existing fan base is that they had a strong expectation of what it would be, and when the structure and tone was changed...  well, people don't like changes to the things they love. In a perfect world, they'd have given us full creative control and I think we would have knocked it out of the park for old fans and new.
[Which episodes of PP (web series\) were the most fun or memorable to film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x3i?context=5)|Episode 2 was a blast to film because it involved drinking a few pitchers of beer and randomly interacting in-character with people on the street. Those were the days.
 |Episode 10 is my most memorable because I took the writing more seriously than the other episodes and felt that we really, really needed a solid episode (and return to our 'roots') after experimenting with 'micro balls' in episode 9. The opening scene is a personal favourite - sitting alone in my underwear and doing 57 takes until I felt I nailed it. That is actually me typing... 
[How many famous people do you know of that liked Pure Pwnage a lot, and how did you find out? (Like Artosis from the SC-scene\)  PP Teh Movie has been an idea you and Geoff have thrown around for many years now, but when was it decided ""Fuck it, let's crowdfund it!""? Was it a spontaneous decision just recently after you started being more public, or have it been in the works for quite some time already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|Not sure how many in total, but I've been surprised how many big figures in eSports have reached out to me, especially after the IEM event and/or the movie announcement.  A lot of casters (Tasteless, Artosis, Day9 and more) and players (Sheth, Destiny, HuK and more), of which I will certainly forget some if I try to list them.  I've known dApollo since the days when EA would fly us out to balance-test the Alpha versions of new C&amp;C games. The actor Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films) is a fan and in fact one of the first people to buy an 'i pwn n00bs' shirt from us back in the day. Apparently he used to wear it to set. I met him in Calgary and we mutually freaked out (I'm a big Harry Potter fan).  I love my family life. In all honesty, I was terrified I might be a bad dad, given my predisposition to obsess about work or games, but as it turns out I was born to be one. It's funny how our instincts work. I am completely obsessed with my son and it kills me to spend any time away (the IEM Germany trip was my first time away from him and quite an emotional trial, so sorry to those sharing beer with me on that last night, lol...) Of everything I've done in my life, I'm most proud of my family. We're all very healthy and happy. As cliche as it may be and incomprehensible to many - it's all that really matters in this short life.
[Will you ever feel too old to play Jeremy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|I do both at the same time... from home ;)  Although I don't consider myself a star of any kind these days.  Just a dude who once did some stuff people dug and hopefully does some more stuff people dig in the future.  The IEM really liked it.  It was a great experience for me personally. I'd never done any real hosting before, so it was very experimental.  On the first day I went with a dry, sarcastic tone and learned a couple things: the lack of energy is not a good hosting technique, and people under a certain age have no idea what dry comedy is and mistake it for 'awkward'.  By day 3 I found a groove and was having so much fun. I really hope I get more opportunities in the future, I can only get better.
 |Nah. If I start getting too too old, we could always cast a 'padawan' and make jeremy the Yoda ;)
[Thanks for all the answers, but you missed the second one about Teh Movie. I understand if you want to avoid talking about if for now, I'm just curious. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6ec6qn?context=5)|Oh shit, that was an honest miss!
 |Real #2. I just recently decided to come back to work 'full time'.  I've been working on a few projects on and off the past couple years, but nothing that required my complete devotion like teh movie.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to stop being a full-time dad.  Recently my son started school and suddenly I felt it was time to go back to taking n00bs to school myself.  I wrote up a proposal and a little over a month later our campaign launched.
[Remember that time we met at comic-con and I made you pose for an awkward picture? No? Oh, good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8bl9?context=5)|LOL.
[Will the game Vasectomy be in the movie? Ever since it was talked about in the last web series episode, I've been waiting to see what becomes of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x6w?context=5)|I can neither confirm nor deny that Vasectomy will be in the Pure Pwnage movie. ;)
[What is your favorite game of all time?  Have you ever used ""You remind me of ghey."" in a real argument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7zoa?context=5)|Too hard to answer, but I'll give a list, in no particular order, of some of my favourites of all time: F-Zero (SNES, N64 and GC), Zelda: Ocarina of Time (best single-player game of all time IMO, I actually feel sorry when I meet people who haven't played it), SC: Brood War and C&amp;C: Generals (best RTSs ever), Tetris, Ultima Online (I could do a whole AMA talking about this masterpiece of a 'game'), Dragon Warrior (NES), Super Mario World (SNES), B.R.E. (BBS Door Game)...  and seeing as you didn't specify *video* game: Tennis and Chess. I know I've probably forgotten another dozen and will regret later...
[You recently hosted IEM (which was amazing!\), any plans to get more involved with SC2 and which race do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7zoa?context=5)|Oh, forgot 2-4...  #2 I answered already, #3: I really hope I have more opportunities to work in eSports in the future. It's been a childhood dream of mine. I play Protoss and regret every second of it :) #4: No, although I'm prepared to bust it out in case all else fails.

[Whats your opinion on what Call of Duty has done to the games industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xu7?context=5)|I think the 'annualization' of franchises was a tragic turn for any non-sports franchise. I think we're in the middle of a transition, I expect most games to move to a F2P or subscription model over the next decade. I haven't played Call of Duty since the fourth instalment and am generally not a fan of the franchise. Also, Bobby Kotick sucks balls.
[Would you rather fight one hundred duck-sized horses, or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e861s?context=5)|One horse-sized duck. That motherfucker would be scary. The little horses would be too cute and I wouldn't have the heart to hurt them.
[Is it alright if I be you for halloween?  EDIT: I'm glad that you answered, I love you and had to make the question really quick at lunch today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7waa?context=5)|More than alright, it's pure awesome.
[Why did you decide not to go with Kickstarter for your movie? It is more well known and better in the sense that the charge doesn't happen right away, so I can donate and be able to handle it when the charge goes through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e83zw?context=5)|Kickstarter requires a US social security number, bank account and resident address, AKA it's only for Americans. As Canadians we didn't have much choice. Indiegogo also takes less fees than Kickstarter, which is a plus.
[Who's idea was it to have those horrible clips of teh masterer and the ninja powers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x8w?context=5)|It was a mutual decision. We were watching a lot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the time (great series, check it out) and decided to have some action-combat fun in our own sandbox. A lot of Pure Pwnage was made that way - us simply wanting to experiment as writers/directors to keep the creative process fun. In hindsight, we know now why TV shows don't suddenly change their formula mid-series...  ;) 
[What are you goals for the Movie with all the extra money you've received on Indiegogo.com? FYI: I'm really psyched about the whole project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xbq?context=5)|I really just want to make the best movie we can.  We don't plan on paying ourselves a penny from the money we raise; everything is going into more locations, more and better actors, more opportunities for promotion, etc.
[If I remember correctly... Did someone actually buy some of your hair? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7y93?context=5)|Yeah, I think it ended up being over $3000. We spent the money on a trip to Holland to surprise some of our favourite fans. We even shot some of the show there. One of the best experiences of my life.
[Why didn't you just sell some more hair/ball hair to raise the movie money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7y2j?context=5)|In a perfect world...
[Can you comment on the performance of the TV series and what benchmarks the network wanted / expected you to hit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yfz?context=5)|In terms of 'ratings', the TV show did well for the channel it was on. Much better than, say, the first seasons of Trailer Park Boys (same channel). I think the network might've had higher than usual expectations because of our huge web traffic, when in truth, most people watching TV shows on the web don't watch TV shows on television. I know I hadn't had cable for years prior to getting a TV show.
[What is your opinion of trailer park boys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6egzb3?context=5)|I really enjoyed the first few seasons but it started to lose me after that.  Oddly, the opposite of what their ratings suggest most others thought.
[Do you have dog?  Who is Dog?  Please respond.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xf2?context=5)|Growing up I had a dog named Maxwell.  When I moved in with my girlfriend 15 years ago we had a dog named Kemo. Both have since passed away and I'm not sure my heart can take losing another family member, so I'm dogless atm and make do by visiting the local park and being the creepy dog guy.
[Correct me if I am wrong, but Kemo was the dog you used in one episode, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8997?context=5)|Yes, we immortalized him as 'Dick'. Man I miss that little guy :(

Occasionally I'll get approached or notice someone noticing me (there's a certain look I can now spot a mile away...), but it mostly only happens at or around events with fellow nerds, like comic-cons.
[How do you feel about the feed me song ""headshot""?  Did he have to license the FPS Doug sound clips from you and did you know about the song pre-release?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8qnf?context=5)|They didn't have a license and we had no idea. We found out after the fact through Twitter thanks to fans. It was an honest error on their part, they had no idea about the show and thought the FPS Doug clip was a stand-alone one-time thing whose producer they couldn't find. I've since talked to them and they are super cool dudes and it's all good. I'm happy that people enjoy the tune, although I'm not into dubstep myself. Assuming that's what it is, I know people can get a little crazy sub-dividing techno music genres...

Between those two, I probably had more fun playing Generals, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's a better game.

We now say an actor is ""Miranda'ing"" if they: always show up early, are always smiling and pleasant, and always give it their all. We're good friends off-screen.
[Hey Jarett! Long time fan, started watching PP back in the days when you guys started out, freaking love it man.   Did you expect the series to be such a big hit when you started?

Will you be rubbing your balls on the scripts you'll be sending to the donators?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8d63?context=5)|No, we had no idea what we were getting into.  If you told us then what was to become of Pure Pwnage, I would've thought you were legitimately crazy.  Being a competitive C&amp;C player, I was forced to interact with an uncountable number of douchebags.  They were amazing at playing the game, but completely failed at being decent human beings.  I just wanted their replays.  The original Pure Pwnage was a way for me to vent by taking the piss out of them.  Little did I know...

[Did you ever actually get addicted to WoW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8eto?context=5)|I was never actually 'addicted' to WoW, although I did play a lot starting on launch day.  I was an Everquest *addict* for a year and a half during university (quad-boxing 10+ hours a day and almost failing out of school as a result), so I was familiar with the genre and its pitfalls.  Honestly, after EQ, WoW just felt like a children's game and I was immune to the addictive elements.  My power guild had moved from EQ to WoW, we were the first ones in Molten Core, I was one of the first priests to 50, blah blah blah, and after I got all the knowledge I needed to write the WoW content in Pure Pwnage I quit and never looked back. (well, except for an ill-fated attempt at a 'Pure Pwnage Guild')
 |I think MMOs are evil, frankly.  I have what can be described as an 'addictive personality type' and it's just not safe for me to play them.  I haven't played any more since WoW and the only game that even tempts me to go back is the upcoming Dragon Quest X, and *only* because I was a huge Dragon Quest fan growing up and it also looks childish enough that I couldn't possibly get addicted.  Always a risk, though...
[Was your power guild by chance the guild Zephyros? We had a similar history, though a lot of our older members from the EQ days have started disappearing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6edx4z?context=5)|Negative.  We played on Rallos Zek.  The best time of my EQ life was when Sullon Zek launched.  Everyone on an equal playing field, mostly carebears from the blue servers giving PvP a shot, and me and my roomies having so much PvP experience...  We just dominated.  Some of the most fun I've ever had actually, often brought to tears from laughing so hard.

[Pure Pwnage (web series\) will forever be one of the closest pieces of gaming culture to my heart, and I'm really excited for the movie.  I had trouble getting into the TV series, partly because of the changes and that I don't have cable or anything:P But I still would like to finish it.  How do you feel about the way people compare the web series and the TV series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e86ih?context=5)|It bums me out a bit, but I totally expected it.  It's impossible to approach the TV show objectively if you've been a big fan of the web series beforehand.  Also, I share many of the criticisms myself, so it's easy reading them.  I do think that the TV show is better than most people give it credit for, though. C'est la vie.
[Which do you feel is your preferred medium: stand up or scripted comedy? Which did you prefer shooting: the web series or the television show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yzc?context=5)|I have an insane amount of respect for stand-up comedy and hope to one day get back on stage myself. It's such a pure art-form, just you and a microphone and no second chances. By comparison, scripted comedy is much, much easier, and consequently not quite as rewarding personally (although far more rewarding financially unless you're in the top 0.01% of comics). I preferred the web series because we had the time and atmosphere to just let me go and do my thing, improvising a large portion of the show's dialogue. In TV, you're counting the minutes and have limited takes of each scene, and often times you know you could do better with another take, but you're moving on. It can be a bummer.
[Hey Jarrett! I was wondering if you would ever continue the web series? My friends and I have been waiting to see what would happen with Chris for years now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e87e9?context=5)|I would definitely consider doing something more on the web.  This is something we'll discuss after the movie is complete.  It's a different landscape now though, so a return to the original formula of one piece of ~25 min content every 3-4 months probably won't cut it.
[ off, if there are people in this world capable of making the ultimate Gamer movie i truly believe that You, Geoff and Joel are the ones.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8hvs?context=5)|I've known Geoff since grade 5, or about 10 years old.  I met Joel when I was about 18, in the basement of a mutual friends house, playing 007 on the N64.  I met Dave shortly after I moved to Toronto.  I was living in some shitty student housing (even though I was no longer a student) and he moved into the room across from me.  We hit it off instantly, probably a faster personal connection than I've ever made in my life.

[Where do you find your inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8iyt?context=5)|I look up at the sky and then think about how we're all just a bunch of silly apes, barely out of the trees, hanging out on this one planet in this one solar system in this one galaxy and there's so little time to enjoy it all.  All the unimportant shit just fades away and I'm left with this overwhelming desire to LIVE my dreams. Then I try to.

I used to keep around 3-4 extra in my closet, just in case of a losing streak in Clan Wars.  Of course, having those extras around just gave me even more excuses to Hulk Smash that shit...

It's a big exaggeration of how I thought others perceived the Canadian accent.  The mannerisms are mostly just improvised, but the spanking was directly influenced by my good friend John during the days of our Big Buck Hunter addiction.

Once I'm more educated on movie-writing and confident in structure, I need to just trust my comedic instincts and see what the result is.  Then reiterate.

Will you rely on old fans or try to find a new audience as well?  I had the privilege of meeting you and Geoff when you came to Australia for Episode 15, so maybe some local screenings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8k9r?context=5)|So far our plan is similar to that of the web series - rely on making a quality product that people *want* to talk about.  We won't have a budget to do traditional promotion.  We need word of mouth.  Once we have a finished movie, we'll submit it to festivals and hopefully the energetic throngs of fans that (hopefully) show up will speak loud and clear for us.  After that we can host our own tours, write the local and web 'presses' and hope it snowballs from there. At the end of the day, we're banking on the merit of the film, not the merit of a marketing campaign.

That's the beauty of free-to-play.  If the game sucks, I'm gone...  so they have to make it good.  When EA has your money up front, you can almost bet you'll be feeling stolen from.

10lltq,2,2012-09-27,Now what? Help me pick my way in life.,[deleted],education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/10lltq/now_what_help_me_pick_my_way_in_life/,"I'm not sure this is the right reddit for it, but here it goes:

I'm 23 and currently in my 2nd year of masters.
I finished my undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science in Communication Science - mainly marketing, advertising and a bit of economics.

I then moved in Sweden and took a Masters of Science also in Media and Communication Science.

Basically I'd like to work in marketing, but I'm not entirely sure about that.
I've always been interested in technical knowledge, engineering, mainly software engineering but not only. However, for some reason or another, I didn't choose to go to college that way. I somewhat regret that now, but again, not really, because marketing attracts me too.

So now I'm at a stand-still, and I don't really know what to do.
My options are:

Hope to get an internship that eventually leads to a job and then in get a CIM certificate (Chartered Institute of Marketing). Later on, five years or so, I'm planning on taking the GMAT and going to a part-time MBA while working.

On the other hand, I could start a PhD just right out of college. I'm thinking either Business and Management for a PhD - but I don't really think that's a good choice, because I would rather work and then get an MBA instead of that PhD.

I'm rather inclining towards a HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) PhD. That would allow me to tie together my passions for both social sciences and technical sciences. However, I'm not really sure that's a smart career choice. I do want to have a career, but I also love knowledge.

I'm a bit lost. I don't even know what I want to learn, because I want to learn everything, but don't know which would prove to also be a good career path.

It's too late for me to get into astrophysics, and even if it wouldn't, I would have the same problems, wanting to get into what I'm currently doing.

I notice people have either an inclination towards humanities or towards technical. I'm stuck in between the two worlds. I want to combine them. I don't know how to do that.

What do you think?

10ljma,3,2012-09-27,Will the pain ever end? I'm getting tired of this...,kiwicupcake,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10ljma/will_the_pain_ever_end_im_getting_tired_of_this/,"I don't know where to begin... 
I'm a relatively successful 25 year old female. I've dabbled with thoughts of suicide/self harm my whole life (overdose when I was 11, cutting at 12, suicide note at 13, in the ER with overdose at 15) with things getting way worse there past few years. But I'm not some brooding, sad person. I've always been a sweet, cheery, happy, loving, caring person- but who cries on the inside and in her room alone at night, tormented by voices in her head. 

My problems really got bad when I went to grad school. In undergrad I was so happy and successful. I devoted my life to trying to make the world a better place, inspire others. And I did. I was constantly organizing volunteering events, fundraisers. I inspired lots of people, not that I am trying to be vain, but it was the truth. I won the top award a student can at my school. As my mom says, 'People there thought you could walk on water"". All that and I graduated with a 3.8 GPA in the hardest major my school had. 

Fast forward to grad school. I moved to a new city, Atlanta. I was in a grueling program with people I really didn't fit in with. I've always been shy, but I just couldn't make friends no matter how hard I tried. And school was so hard. I really struggled just to pass. With all of my school demands, I had no time to pursue those things I once loved and it killed me. When I tried to make a difference again, I failed miserably. I lost my self esteem; my self identity. 
One bright spot of that time was my boyfriend- my first ever. He was so wonderful. He would always make me smile and laugh, believed in me. We had so much fun together. He moved for a job, but we talked for hours every night and saw each other every other weekend. It was magic. 
School got even harder, I would cry in class, had panic attacks. Only get out of bed for class, fall asleep there and then go home and sleep. I had a horrible internship with an abusive woman, and she failed me. Which meant I wouldn't graduate. When I found this out, well, I ended up in the ER thanks to a friend I told my plan to kill myself.

But I got on meds, got a good counselor and things looked up. Now that I was done with school (I had a make-up internship) I could finally move to be with my wonderful boyfriend in Austin, so I thought.

Once I moved to Austin, out relationship began to fall apart. He would make fun of my looks all the time, stopped being the person I fell in love with. He became a mean, cheap, heartless person. But I kept trying and trying so hard to please him, which probably just made it worse. We had no live outside of each other and work pretty much. I got a new job and really struggled. My depression came back bad, I would have trouble doing anything beside staying in bed on the internet. My work was piling up and I got so behind. Suicidal thoughts have been always there throughout my life, but they got to be constant. 

I've spent countless hours researching suicide methods. I chose to buy a gun. Multiple times I went to the store and looked at them. Thankfully I called a hotline, and well, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. That was about a month ago.

While there, I read a great book on depression, got on new meds and came out feeling like a new person. But then it was my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend. I got feeling so depressed about us, he rejected my gifts I bought him and I threw him out, saying we were broken up.

The breakup was so hard, my progress from being in the hospital all went away. I begged God for help. I told my mom about everything and she flew down on a plane the same day. She came, helped me a lot, cleaned my place. We had a lot of fun together. I felt like I could do this, get over my depression. But it didn't last, when she left I was bad and didnt take my meds and nearly jumped off a highway overpass.

I got back on my meds and am really trying to go out and do things, pamper myself. And it helped. But now I just feel like its all a joke. Those thoughts of suicide just won't go away. I'll never be the person I want to be. I'm only getting older and like is getting worse. My boyfriend said the reason he started treating me so bad was because I gained weight, got dark circles under my eyes and he didn't want to deal with my depression.

Now, I'm just listening to all 126 songs on wikipedia about suicide. I don't want to die, but I just don't feel like my life is going to get better. I'll always have these demons tormenting me. Every time I try, I get brought back down. It's just too hard to fight. I just don't want to fight anymore..."
10lcas,1,2012-09-27,What's the best way to integrate an intern into a Rails project?,dogweather,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/10lcas/whats_the_best_way_to_integrate_an_intern_into_a/,"We're setting up our first intern (a high school student), who'll be doing web design at first.  So he'll need to modify and create ERB templates and SCSS files.  

He has an older Mac laptop and so I'm thinking that the best way to set him would be to create a new Linode with the app running in development mode. Give him sftp access. Check out the code in a new branch. Configure github so he can only push to his branch. Currently I just have a normal Github developer account with our project in a private repo. But this might push me to get an organizational account instead.

He's working remotely (lives out of state). But he's doing this for a class, which is imposing structure. I've met him in person in the past, and we've started weekly Skype meetings. And so I'm mostly focussed on the logistics of enabling him to edit templates and see the results.

10nwzd,5,2012-09-29,Girlfriend left me after three years after I changed my life to accommodate hers.,FRizKo,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/10nwzd/girlfriend_left_me_after_three_years_after_i/,"We met in Sweden while she was having an summer internship at IKEA world HQ (she's American (22) I'm Swedish (25). 

I lived next door to where she was staying and we spent the entire summer together. That fall I went to visit her in the US. After that it got shaky as we didn't know how to continue our relationship. Skype was a big factor in our lives at this point. I had a current life situation where it was no problem for me with 6 hour time difference. 

Eventually she folded and hooked up with her ex. This was painful as I could see more and more pictures of her on facebook with this guy. Eventually she told me over skype about him and her hooking up. I so wish I left all this at this point.

A few weeks later her ex decided that he didn't really want her and dumped her. She came crying to me. And seeing how I also felt the stress of not knowing any future together I forgave her. 

Shortly after we came up with a plan to be together. She would apply to go to grad school her in Sweden. Grad School was at the time free here. And there are several programs that are purely international. Including one that she was passionate about. Environmental studies. 

She applied but didn't get in. We found out that this was because it was the last year that non EU students would study for free after the government had changed the laws and a record amount of applicants applied. 

Somehow we managed to keep going. We decided she would apply for a resident permit that you can get here in Sweden if you are in love with a swede. That worked and she went over to Sweden to visit me for a week. Next year she got in to the school. Keep in mind I did most of the work. 

We had a vacation in Italy together and shortly after she moved in with me in Sweden to start school. This was august. Everything went on and seeing as she didn't know any Swedish and she was swamped with school work. She never got to hang out with my friends in a meaningful way. (eventually politeness wears down and people start speaking their own language at party's and stuff). 

So I changed everything to accommodate her. To make her happy. 
I started alienating my friends and my family. Eventually she started making friends in Her class. Most of her classmate lived in another city so it was hard for her to attend any social events. It was an 1 hour commute. And when she started sleeping over at her new friends places I was happy about it because she got to have some social things happening to her that wasn't solely based on my sacrifice. 

January she tells me she has lost most of her feeling towards me. I got a real wake up call and start doing the social events at her school with her ( I even bought her a 800$ air ticket for this upcoming summer so me and her could go visit her family shes been missing). 

This being me working 9-11hour days then commuting to her Schools city to be completely exhausted at the end of every night. Eventually I arranged a Sauna party here in my town, I even arranged our apartment to hold over as many as 7 of her classmates to stay over if needed. Everyone invited showed up, but only one took the bait to sleep over. That was what I learned later the guy she spent most nights sleeping over with because he had a foldable couch. The morning after the sauna party everyone decided to take a trip to Copenhagen. I made my GF and this guy breakfast. I made blueberry pancakes. it took me some time since I hadn't tried doing that before. My GF and him left for a trip Copenhagen with the rest of her class, I was invited with but I had more work to do early next day and really needed some rest.

A few weeks go by when I think I started to make her feel more for me. A national holiday was coming up that is a big going out day. I asked time of from work to go with her. I got a denied and ended up working that day. When she got home the day after she tells right away that she slept with him that night. (the guy I made breakfast for)
Well things turned to shit here. It is now 5 months after and I'm still depressed. I started hanging out with my old friends again but it is really strained as how I alienated them before. I have no problems picking up new girls but it leaves me with feeling like someone who is full of shame.
The only just desert she ending up getting was the she lost her resident permit when she left me. She ending up having to pay 26K$ to finish her last school year. (not to mention that she now has to pay full rent and other costs that I covered for here since she was studying and I was working)

I'm not a hundred percent sure why I'm posting this. I just needed someone to read my story. Input would be nice. I'm feeling incredibly depressed about this and need to find a way to get over it all.

10nwgd,2,2012-09-29,"Reddit, help me land my dream job by reviewing my cover letter so I can quickly submit my application!",LaunchRapidFire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10nwgd/reddit_help_me_land_my_dream_job_by_reviewing_my/,"Here is the link to the description: http://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ce1dd714ca3b5b09&amp;q=clerical&amp;l=Chicago,+IL&amp;tk=1788a5u7t06ag24g&amp;from=ja&amp;alid=931816749eb30c53&amp;utm_source=jobseeker_emails&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=job_alerts. 

Based on the tone of the job ad and the company website, I decided to take a chance and break out of the nice, but dull, tone that cover letters often acquire. Let me know if you find it a little too risky or if you find even the slightest error (my inner Grammar Nazi can only do so much at 6 am). Here is my cover letter pasted in all of its glory (and yes, it's only one page):

Dear Hiring Manager:

If you are like me, you must take these three steps (in this exact order) when a company such as ByteManages perfectly describes you in their job description for a Data Production Clerk: 

1.	You must squeal with delight in your heart (or brain, depending upon how technical you want to get).
2.	You must research this amazing company and discover how it has proud Data Geeks, a blog, and even a “datavangelist”.
3.	You must resist the urge to modify your resume so that it only talks about your dream to one day copy edit self-published e-books and online content (too many are heavy on ideas and short on editing), the extent to which you Google everything and use Google products, and how you never gave up on your hope of finding a place where a logic puzzle lover would be welcomed because of their hobby.

Once all of those steps have been completed, only then can you proceed to state the following:

•	Between years spent on logic puzzles and your experience as an Auditing Intern, you notice the tiniest details and believe in checking your work thoroughly.
•	Being a bookworm has given you superhuman focusing abilities, turned you into a silent Grammar Nazi (see #3), improved your written communication skills, and made you a great organizer (because once you organize your books, you might as well create an organizational system for the contents of your closet, computer, and refrigerator).
•	Your time as a Customer Service Representative Intern vouches for your verbal communication skills and gave you the chance to occasionally organize your co-workers’ records.
•	Due to your interest in tracking your jogging speed and endurance, you were motivated to learn Excel and became moderately proficient in it.
•	You love the Internet and while you have never considered how other people buy products online, you are interested in a company that has a role in making online shopping better for everyone (including you). 

If I could, I would go on talking forever about how the requirements for a Data Production Clerk are perfectly aligned with my skills and experiences but, in the interest of actually finishing this cover letter, I will stop. Instead, I will conclude by saying that if you are interested in learning more about what I have to offer ByteManagers, please contact me at LaunchRapidFire@gmail.com or (777) 777-777.  

Thank you,

LaunchRapidFire

Edit: I have been sick these past two days so I couldn't immediately respond to your awesome feedback, but thank you so much for responding and I am currently working to revise my cover letter.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So, what WAS your offer for Dwight Howard?  And how pissed were you with David Stern blocking the original Chris Paul trade that would have landed Pau Gasol in Houston?  Of those two moves, which trade would you rather have had go through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esk77?context=5)|We would have been thrilled for either of these moves to go through which should hopefully make sense in the context of my other answers that we want to obtain a top player. I guess this will have to be AMAA as I hope you can understand I would never reveal the private trade conversations we have had with other teams. We thought we made a very good offer in both circumstances and in both circumstances the team decided to do something else.
[I've heard Royce White, a current player of yours, has a major fear of flying. How have you handled this situation, and what will you do in the future when traveling far for away games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjz5?context=5)|Royce White has an issue with anxiety that is more common than people talk about and he has done a good job to bring awareness. It did not affect his ability to fly for games last year and we don't expect it to this year. It certainly did not affect him last year where he was unquestionably one of the top players in the country and the best player on the floor in the Kentucky-Iowa State NCAA tournament game.
[What about the '04 Pistons as a counter example? You could argue Billups and Hamilton, but they would be on the very low end of top 10-20 players. Or Rasheed? Maybe, but that is an example that stands out clearly for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et6c1?context=5)|Billups and Ben Wallace clearly were playing at an all-star level in my opinion at that time. Also, 4(!) of them made the all-star team either that year or the next. For those wondering on Ben Wallace, they had the #1 defense in the league and Ben Wallace was for sure the primary reason for it. Omer Asik has the potential to play at an all-star level on defense. We will see if he does.
[Are Asik and Lin all-star superstars? or even trade-able assets to acquire one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esws6?context=5)|Lin played at an all-star level last year. Even if he does not maintain that level (likely), both he and Asik increase our flexibility and get us closer to our goals. I also like that Lin has already played for a small yet not insignificant stretch at an all-star level. This increases his odds -- up and down the roster that is the primary thing we are trying to do -- increase our odds of developing or acquiring an all-star level player.
[I am 6ft 10 and only slightly uncoordinated with low mileage on my knees. what is your best offer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6estiu?context=5)|Can I just buy your knees?
[Thanks for doing to AMA. I have many questions, so feel free to skip any question that you are unable to discuss here, but please try to answer any that you can.   Can you tell us anything about psychological characteristics that you use to evaluate players?   Can you give us some insight as to how you choose Kevin McHale as head coach (e.g., any analytics that you can discuss\)? This article gives some hint about your desire to select a good ""leader"", but what about factors such as which lineups to run?   How much influence do you have on playing time and lineup decisions? Coach McHale sometimes puts out interesting lineups. (e.g., K-mart at the 4, or Camby and Dalembert playing 4 and 5 together\). Who comes up with these unique substitution patterns? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl68?context=5)|He is very talented. I think he may still have a productive career. Many factors for it not working but Chandler Parsons emerging was a big one.  there are some analytics you can use to analyze coaching but you primarily want a leader who can help you win games and is aligned with the organization. It is early in Kevin's coaching career but over time I believe people will see how good he is.
 |Coach McHale is in charge of playing time. If he asks for ideas/input then we give suggestions.
[Do you believe that our current roster has playoff potential? Are there any meaningful moves to be made before the start of the season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|We definitely have a chance at the playoffs. It is a stretch goal but it is a realistic goal and would be great for the franchise as it would likely mean  that 1+ of our players have developed into all-star level players.
[How angry does it make you when big market teams (like the Lakers\) constantly have A+ talent falling into their laps with seemingly little effort on their part? What needs to happen for Houston to become a desirable destination for big names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|Does not make me angry. just part of the landscape of competition.
[Can you dunk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This is embarrassing to admit but I am 6'4"" and unlike reddit fave Woody Harrelson, I cannot dunk. In my youth I could get a tennis ball through.
[When can we expect Moneyball 2: Moreyball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This would be a terrible movie. that said, we did have a 22 game winning streak and apparently a long winning streak is all you need for a movie.
[I had no idea you were into eSports! What do you currently follow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|I am a big fan of MLG and SC2. I like to think I can macro with the best of 'em. Micro skills not as good. I got into it because of my 10-year-old son and I was heavily into gaming when I was younger.
[When Dikembe Mutumbo would speak to you, would you sometimes just nod and say yes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esrc2?context=5)|Yes. And then I would ask him to follow up with a txt of what he wants on one of the 4 cell phones he always carried.
[(this might be too personal, if so, sorry\) It has been reported you have donated quite a bit of money to Mitt Romneys campaign. What are the a few of the reasons you support him over Obama or other candidates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskrz?context=5)|[I was asked about this recently\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney))
 |Sorry reddit, I know my opinion on this will not be popular! Hopefully you can [check out\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney) the article (it is short) if you care about politics vs reflexively being negative.
 |One thing left out of the article I told them is that many of Mitt Romney's partners are good friends and owners of the Boston Celtics (where I worked for 4 years) so I do have near first hand knowledge of my opinions in that article and my belief that Mitt would make a great leader for the country.
[How frequent of a visitor are you of /r/nba?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm6x?context=5)|Yes.
[Would Bill Simmons actually make a good NBA GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eso74?context=5)|I think he would make a good GM. He really knows the game. He obviously is a friend so take my opinion for what you will but I have found his knowledge of the game to be very high over the many years we have known each other. The only time I think he would struggle is handling owner input as he is very independent minded (which has made him successful in everything he has done).
[When Lowry was traded away and Dragic signed with the Suns you guys went from two starting quality point guards to none. From an outside perspective it looked like fairly inept managing, what was going on internally during this time. Were you confident you could get Jeremy Lin? Were you rolling the dice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjyl?context=5)|First, I would refer to my #2 answer [here\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))  Each move makes sense under this lens. The guaranteed lottery pick we received from Toronto for Lowry is more valuable in acquiring an all-star level player. Dragic wanted a player option (that Phoenix gave him) which greatly harms a players value and will almost always lead us away from [#2\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl)) A player option essentially guarantees that a team ends up with either a free agent (not valuable) or a player who the league thinks is not valuable and blocks your salary cap flexibility.
 |We were rolling the dice on getting Jeremy Lin but taking smart risks is what we have to do up and down the roster on every move. As only 1 team out of 30 gets to win, you cannot play it safe. A fund manager who beats more than half his peers and beats the S+P 500 is considered pretty good. We have won more games than we lost the past few years (beaten our peers) despite losing our franchise player Yao Ming and it has been appropriately considered disappointing despite the fact that most teams win around one-third of their games after losing their franchise player. We need to keep taking on more smart risk.
[Disregarding stats and from a purely aesthetic point of view, which player plays the game with the most heart and ""beauty""? Who's the most fun to watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxg?context=5)|Scola.
[ off, thanks for taking the time to do this (and on my birthday too!\), I am a huge fan of you and the Rockets. My question is about the rise of analytics in the league. More and more teams are incorporating analytics into their front office, and as one of the pioneers of this in the NBA how do you feel about losing this 'advantage' and what kinds of things do you do to keep analytics moving forward while still holding a edge on the competition? Clearly events like the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference fosters sharing of information, but the nature of sports is to hold on to any advantage you can for as long as possible. How do you reconcile these two aspects of your position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjrb?context=5)|[I wrote an article for HBR on this\] (\[Link to blogs.hbr.org](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/success_comes_from_better_data.html))
[If Jeremy Lin asked to sleep on your couch, would you let him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espej?context=5)|Yes. Unfortunately I have to run, thank you for all the questions! I will check in and try to answer a few more when I have time. Best, Daryl.
[I was wondering what your view is on the actual returns to analytics in the NBA. It seems to me that because of the way player movement is regulated and because the league is so superstar driven, analytics can be rendered fairly useless if the only goal of the organization is to win a championship. You can collect an amazing group of undervalued players, but unless you have lucked into a superstar or two, your ceiling is likely a Conference Finals appearance.  Is analytics something that really only becomes valuable once you have found a franchise player (i.e. surrounding him with the right talent to win\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esldy?context=5)|I think analytics can help improve the quality of nearly all decisions to some extent but as you mention the potential efficacy will vary. The utility of analytics on a decision will also vary but I will just discuss efficacy since you brought it up.  Yes, I agree, what I am stating about acquiring an all-star level player every NBA GM in 1965 could have also stated with confidence. It is just a fact that the structure of our sport requires this. No other major professional team sport comes remotely close to having a player like Lebron James who can single handedly shift a team from winning 3 out of 4 games (09-10 Cavs) to 1 out of 4 games (10-11 Cavs).  The reason for this is numerous with two off the top of my head being fewer players on the court and a near asymptotic distribution function of high end talent. One way I describe it is imagine in baseball when Barry Bonds was at the height of his powers he could have kept calling himself to the plate over and over, ignoring the lineup card. This is essentially what the top players in basketball can do each time down the floor -- they can ""call their own number"" and make sure the team gets a great possession each time.  I do think analytics can improve the process to getting a top player but as you state, it has not created a new path to winning like has opened up in baseball with analytics where numerous small smart decisions and great roster management on player 2-25 can lead to a championship. No amount of work and good decisions on our players 2-15 could overcome not having an all-star level player. 
[What do you think of the trend of ""small ball""? There's a handful of teams that have moved their 3's down to the 4 (Durant, Carmelo, LeBron\), and speed and athleticism seem to be favored more so than a big man that can slow the game down and beat a team with his size. Do you think this trend will continue, and is there still a place in the league for the traditional dominant big man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esxec?context=5)|For sure in the regular season, the general rule of thumb to help you win is put your 5 best players on the floor as much as possible. Because of scarcity, the smalls are generally better than the bigs and also more numerous. This is why ""small ball"" works. 
[This is awesome that you're here. In my opinion you are one of the greatest modern basketball minds and the Rockets have always overachieved given their roster/limitations/injuries.  Lot of questions I'd like to ask, but here's one that I thought of on the way to class.  Of all the trades, signings, draft picks, which one has been your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl5l?context=5)|[private message] your money is in account CYMN271828182846.
[What do you feel has been the biggest hindrance to signing a star to Houston?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjoh?context=5)|Nothing. Houston is a huge asset in helping us in free agency (weather, income tax, large city, etc...). We are not the top destination city in the NBA but we are near the top. The reality is only a extremely small number of the top 10-20 players change each off-season (sometimes zero) and they also rarely change via free agency (vs trade) so the number of chances is extremely small and when those chances come up the number of potential destinations is very numerous. Long way of saying that the odds are stacked against every team and we just have not overcome those long odds. Has nothing to do with Houston.
[Hey Mr. Morey, thanks for the AMA! Actually a rivalrous Spurs fan here, but I've got some questions for you...  I know this one will be difficult to answer, but here it goes. You've stock-piled a lot of awesome, young talent the past few years, but were you disappointed to not get Pau or Dwight this summer?  Are there any other GMs/Owners you look up to, look to for advice, or just admire in the league?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|No shock but I think RC Buford might be the best in the business. Pat Riley has done an amazing job and only league jealousy prevented him from winning GM of the year recently in my opinion (I obviously voted for him).
[ finally, what do you feel has been your best decision as Rockets GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|Best decision as GM was likely Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry as it was a hard one to pull off -- we traded our starter in the middle of a playoff race for a Kyle who was barely playing. I think Kyle will do amazing in Toronto.
[Mr. Morey.  1\) Do you give any input to the coaches on minute allocation based on the analyis you do? (ala billy beane\) Do you have any thoughts regarding the folks at The Wages of Wins?  Link: Link to wagesofwins.com.  2\) I own 3 of  your players in a dynasty fantasy basketball league. Can you PLEASE play Asik, Motie, and Chandler more? Thanks.  3\) I've worked in finance my entire career. Is there a transitional role for me into the front office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eslic?context=5)|The Wages of Wins folks have contributed important new ideas to NBA analysis. I expect they will do more in the future. 2) that is up to coach McHale 3) there is but it is very tough to obtain.
[How much will you utilize omer asik in the upcoming season? How do you think he will benefit your team? I love him as a player, i hope he starts every game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmkr?context=5)|We don't spend $8 million per year on someone we don't plan to help us! He will anchor our defense and we think his offense will improve through his hard work with Kevin McHale and Carroll Dawson.
[Please settle a Twitter argument.  Better nickname for Donatas Motiejunas, ""Donuts"" or ""The Don""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esltr?context=5)|We have settled on DMo just for simplicity.
[What position do you see Terrence Jones and Royce White playing? Both the 3 and the 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esogz?context=5)|Terrence can play 3-5. Royce 4-5 although he is like a PG offensively. He is hard to pigeon hole.
[How difficult is it to deal with other GMs who are keen on using advanced metrics to evaluate players? Do you ever get the impression that any of the other GMs are reluctant to work with you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|Every team pretty much deals well with every team in the league. It is a small group so relationship are generally very positive all around. No one is reluctant to work with us.
[With the benefit of hindsight, are there any trades you would not have made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|If we knew Yao Ming was never going to really recover from his injury in the Lakers series in 2009 then we could have shifted into our current strategic mode faster and there are many transactions we would not have done.
[Conditional only on information available at the time, who would you have drafted first overall in 2001? What about 1996? 1984? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|2001 draft : that was a hard draft to get right, I have empathy for the GMs. I am not sure who we would have taken. I was not in the league at the time so hard for me to answer. 1996 draft: I think we would have taken Iverson. 1984 draft: that is easy. Olajuwon.
[What is your clutchfans user name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm8w?context=5)|I don't have one but I do read the site.
[Why did the Rockets decide to let go of Lee for nothing?  A lot of Bulls fans had predicted over the past season that Lee would end up in Chicago in a deal for Asik. Was there any possibility of this happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eswcr?context=5)|We obtained a pick in the 31-35 range for Courtney Lee. This is as valuable or more valuable than a first round pick which directly squares with our [goals\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))
[I think you mean more valuable than a late (20-30\) first round pick. Certainly not a lottery pick, correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6euhqj?context=5)|Right, 31-35 is arguably as valuable as a late 1st round pick.
[What kind of role do you see Chandler Parsons playing this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn8b?context=5)|Likely starter and if he improves on his rookie year then he has as real chance to surprise the league. He has the mind and physical tools to be very good.
[Also, as a basketball stat junkie, I would love to go to the MIT Sloan conference. Is the conference open to the public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm9z?context=5)|Yes. jump on the mailing list on the [home page\] (\[Link to www.sloansportsconference.com](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/))
[What do you think is the best publicly available defensive metric? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn3l?context=5)|None really.
[How good is your basketball game?  Could I take you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etgiu?context=5)|I am pretty decent. I would win but it might be just because I would insist on having control of the venue and rules so it is to my advantage.
[Were you the team to hire Haralabos as a consultant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmhk?context=5)|No, but he has an incredibly good basketball mind.
[Do you have a favorite memory in your time with the Rockets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esohm?context=5)|22 game winning streak. Tougher to do than win the title. That is what I tell myself when I get depressed at all the work we still have to do to get back to being championship contenders.
[How do you justify a basketball player making more than someone who actually gives a service to the community (surgeon, doctor, an honest cop\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etg1t?context=5)|Supply and demand has no morality. sort of like evolution.
[If you had to pick a starting five of all retired players in their prime, who would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6essiv?context=5)|I am going to include current players. My five would be CP3, Jordan, Lebron, Duncan, and Olajuwon.
[Where do you rank Hakeem Olajuwon in the greatest centers of all-time conversation?  Why do you rank him in the said position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etfwt?context=5)|Best center.
[If Mark Cuban and Jeff Van Gundy got in a fight.  Who would win?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et1dl?context=5)|Jeff. He would [get hold of his leg\] (\[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoTTCeLhLDA) and take him down.
[Where would you rank Mitch Kupchak as a GM? Were you shocked/surprised when he pulled off the Dwight Howard trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjqa?context=5)|I was not surprised Mitch pulled this off. Not only is he a great GM, I was in contact with them throughout the process and I knew they were trying to obtain him.
[Who was better in their prime, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et2qj?context=5)|McGrady.
[Hey Daryl! Can we get new uniforms, please? Ketchup and Mustard or go home. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espyb?context=5)|Not my area. I don't know of any plans for new uniforms. I like our current uniforms and the classic uniforms that we still sometimes wear.
[Can i get an internship with you guys? Im a junior majoring in stats at duke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etmyx?context=5)|[Yes you can!\] (\[Link to www.houstontoyotacenter.com](http://www.houstontoyotacenter.com/jobs/job_529.php))
[Hows yao ming in person ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiei?context=5)|A great person which people always say but actually true in this case. I think the quality he has as a person that many don't know about is that he is extremely funny. He was by far the funniest person in the locker room. Most jokes I cannot print there is one time I remember I can talk about. During the pre-season required drug testing, all the players were lined up to pee in a cup and Yao Ming looking to all of them and said, ""why am I the only one not nervous""?
[SEA/OKC was dreadful for three years which allowed them to acquire Durant, Westbrook, and Harden in the Lottery.  How will Houston compete with this by consistently being just ...OK.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl1g?context=5)|Being an extremely crappy team is definitely a well worn path to success in the NBA. Each year, the NBA hands the most valuable asset in the game (a scale wage top 5 pick) and hands it to the most mismanaged teams.
 |We could go with this approach (in fact the Rockets invented it long ago) but we think our approach can succeed as well and can succeed faster even though it is more difficult.

I've looked through the database my school provides to help people find jobs and the only engineering jobs there are for computer engineers.
Can anyone help figure out how I should approach locating companies that are looking for interns?"
10nnmm,1,2012-09-29,How to find a computer science internship in West LA/Santa Monica?,[deleted],LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/10nnmm/how_to_find_a_computer_science_internship_in_west/,I've completed an intro course in C language and am currently taking C++ and Java. I don't have too much experience but will this be enough to be considered for an intern somewhere?
10nlhq,2,2012-09-29,Complicated roommate situation,beytwice,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10nlhq/complicated_roommate_situation/,"I am rooming with a random roommate (met through a school specific classifieds site) who I have known for only a week now.

We hung out a couple times at first and he was pretty easy to talk to since we both like video games and manga/anime. He started referring to me as his ""closest friend"" at school which was kind of weird since we literally only knew each other for three days at that point but I just shrugged it off. 

A couple of days ago, he already started revealing EXTREMELY personal details of his life (ie: how his dad passed away, he was mercilessly bullied at his middle school, he was addicted to online gaming for years, he was in an emotionally abusive relationship and he was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the last ten years). I got really uncomfortable since it was very unprompted and again, I've known him for less than a week at this point but I have had quite a few experiences dealing with depressed friends and thought that inviting him out to do activities would make him feel better.

I invited him to a party that night and thought it would be a good idea because some of my friends there are really into video games as well and all of them are really nice and friendly. However, he stayed quiet for most of the night and after a few hours, he was alone in the corner and looked really miserable and asked if he could leave.  Apparently he had gone to campus (at like midnight) and just walked around because he was scared he was going to start crying at the party since he felt alone and sad that I wasn't talking to him a lot that night.

I would tell him about different organizations and activities on campus but he always says that they're too much work or that he's not interested. He doesn't do much day to day except go to class, come back to the apartment and try to hang out with his one other friend here but she also seems to be backing away from him since he constantly texts her and asks her to hang out. Whenever I stop by the apartment to drop something off, he seems irritated that I never hang out with him there. I'm really busy this year with an internship, classes, and other extracurriculars and when I DO get free time, I would prefer to hang out with my friends and boyfriend instead of staying cooped up in my apartment.

I am genuinely concerned for his well being as well as my living situation (since coming back to a semi-hostile roommate every day is getting to be a bit tiresome). I really don't know what to do since he seems to reject all of my ideas of joining new organizations or meeting new people and I'm hesitant to become a full-time shoulder to lean on. Moving out or kicking him out is out of the question since housing in my college town is extremely sparse and the options that are left are very expensive."
10ne5q,0,2012-09-28,my view on the interns,[deleted],greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/10ne5q/my_view_on_the_interns/,"so ive just recently started watching the show and am currently halfway through season 3. i feel that i need to throw in that im a guy and so my opinions may be mildly biased. but anyways these are my opinions on each character and what they represent. id love to hear some input and other opinions.

george omalley- i love george's character. i love what he represents and his continuous effort to be a good person. in my eyes george represents the struggle between being an honest doctor to their patient and the struggle between doing good for their patient and interfering with their coworkers. the way he speaks up for the patient when a coworker may be in the wrong and the way he supports his friends who are struggling with a patient.

izzie stevens- at first i really liked her character. the way she came from a trailer park and worked her ass off all the way to becoming a surgeon. but as she got tied up with denny she got progressively more annoying. i think that she represents the struggle doctors may have of becoming too attached to their patients. and i think her rash decisions cause more harm than any good that they may create and as of right now she is quite annoying being as stupid as she is.

christina yang- yang is one of my favorite characters. from being the hardworking intern that she is, to the way that she is straight to the point and (generally) thorough in her actions. but the way she represents the blank space between good doctors and worried patients, she has some of the worst bedside manner ive ever seen. and from what i can see her biggest struggle is balancing her work life and her social life. the two are far too interchangeable in the wrong spots (relationship with burke) and entirely absent where needed (speaking to and comforting patients)

alex karev- i dont have much about him, no idea what he represents or stands for. but ive recently started to like him. he just seems like a good guy for the most part

and lastly i have..

meredith grey- i absolutely full heartedly 100% hate meredith grey. i presume she is meant to represent the struggle of working with coworkers or something along those lines. but in the end she is a whore. a stupid, selfish, ignorant, arrogant whore. i cannot find an ounce of good in her. the way she feels entitled to date both derek and fin and then throws a fit when derek gives up and dumps fin (a great guy) because she loves to be hurt by derek. this. girl. sucks.

Genuinely curious, not trying to start an argument.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eqm0x?context=5)|I'd probaby ask them if they were alright, and if they were, I'd guide them out quietly. I hate getting people in trouble for that sort of stuff.
[I don't get it, at first you answer that you call the cops on people the smoke weed, and now you say you ""ask them if they're okay, and guide them out quietly."" So which is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6et42c?context=5)|I ask if they're okay only if it is one person by themselves and they seem lost.

[So, I'm curious as to how you handled this. Did you stop the tour and say there is a dead body? Obvously you must have called in, but how did you handle the potentially freaked out tourists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eszkn?context=5)|I just told the people in the boat that it stalled [i had killed the engine, so it was beleivible.] We called ""200 Protection"" on the radio and tell them that ""we stalled on [canal name] and we need a ride. bring the divers, I think we lost something"" then they callsed back, ""What'd you drop?"" and I said ""The front page of the paper"" [the story was on the front page, they understood. we transferred the tourists to another boat witout them noticing, and they got the rest of their tour, wth another ranger.

I feel like I get more connected to history every time i talk about it. there atre about 30 questions that every ranger has memorized due to being asked so many times, but most of us [me included] don't mind. it's kind of fun, actually, because sometimes a little kid will ask a question, then 5 minutes later his mom or dad will ask it, and I say, ""ask your son! he can tell you all about it!"" it's quite cute, and i love getting kisds involved in history.

Now that I've obtained a job my new goal is to get promoted early. More specifically, become a senior in a year in a half as opposed to two. 

I've seen people's LinkedIn where they say they got promoted to senior early at a Big 4 and it seems they are very technically savvy which improves the efficiency of their work. Also met someone at an AICPA event who got promoted early, she started in January as opposed to fall too. Before the promotion she had her CPA, Master's degree, and had a bunch of internships while in school, including a busy season one. 

I've heard promotions are based off busy seasons and I've already interned during one and since I'm graduating in September
l'll have from September to December to sit around and hopefully complete my CPA. I won't have a master's degree but I'll still have 150 credits and a few minors(I.T., econ, and 1 or 2 more). Have taken a couple computer science/programming classes so I could be good with VBA by the time I start (bringing it back to being technically savvy). I have also had a bunch of internships all at major companies and plan to add one more to the list summer 2013. I also help with recruiting on campus and plan to continue to do so.

I graduated this may and began working my first job in June as an intern then hired on full time in august due to excellent performance. I want to start looking for a better job and have already proven that I am a great engineer here by getting my hands in a lot of different, multi-disciplinary projects, and designing/creating a lot of various new products. Enough to where I think I have a very strong portfolio and resume to get a few interviews at bigger companies through my network (also as another random question, even though I signed an NDA at the place I work, am I allowed to use CAD models I created/worked on in my portfolio that I am showing future employers or no?).

I was just wondering when I start interviewing, what should I tell them the reason for wanting to switch jobs so early on. I dont want them to think that I would flake at the first chance of a better job because honestly I am looking for a stable career I can stay at for at least 5 years, I just expect to be compensated at the fair market value for it and it doesnt look like it is going to happen here so I just want to cut my losses and leave. I don't feel like this would be too professional to bring up at an interview though should the question arise, but I could be wrong?

Thanks for any advice.

10pb5k,33,2012-09-30,The white turd,Axelior,SRSPOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSPOC/comments/10pb5k/the_white_turd/,"Hello Ms.

I go to prestigious university on a combination of academic and need-based scholarships. I am a computer science major, and I love programming and computers. I have a girlfriend who I am secretly engaged to and I will make that engagement public next year. Unbeknownst to her I will save up and buy a ring and get down on bended knee, and then tell the world.

i am a large 18 year old Jamaican-American male of very dark complexion. I inherited my build from my father who was a bodybuilder in Jamaica before coming to the U.S. with my mom to build houses and a great home for a family and for me an only son. I nurtured that build with construction work with my father. My mother stopped working to take care of her mother who had Alzheimer's and to teach me advanced subjects while I was in elementary school.

Everyone else in my classes is white and asian. My school (or at least who I see) is 95% white, Asian, and Indian. Growing up in a black community, I was constantly called an oreo, called white. The same people made fun of my dark skin and said I looked like a turd,  and that I disappeared into the night.

Here, I don't get that. I get people using the n-word around me ironically, because they are so far past racism. The validity of my presence in many areas, a hacking club, a research internship I won, is questioned until I am able to demonstrate sufficient intelligence. When I wear a hoody in the winter, people I was laughing with earlier in the dining halls don't recognize me and cross the street to avoid me.

I wear university branded T-shirts and clothing as much as I can so people know I'm one of the good ones, that I'm not scary, and I'm not stupid.

I get complimented so often on how well I speak (I have a pretty neutral, midwestern accent. I never picked up any Jamaican Patois from my parents,  or African-American English from my peers. Looking back, I wonder if this was purposefully done by my subconscious.) It's so good that I'm college. It's so amazing that I'm in such a good one.

My fiancee's mother is constantly trying to set her up with other guys, guys who she thinks is good, all of them white, all of them Slovaks to ""keep the blood strong."" None of them are as 'good' as me according to American Success^TM . I work hard, study hard, I go to a good school, I have a job, I'm also skilled in construction, haven't I done what I'm supposed to? Why am I not good enough yet? We have been dating for three years. They've never let me further in the house than the doorway. Apparently her mother mocks my car, because it is a '96 Toyota. The same car my mother took me to preschool in, I can pick up my girlfriend with now. The sentiment makes my girlfriend and me happy now. But it is not good enough.

I struggle so much with my race and identity. So many mornings I look into the mirror and hate the color of my skin. I wish my parents, the parents that I am so proud of and grateful too and love so much, didn't have such obvious accents that prompted comments on weed and Bob Marley. So many times I wish I could just wake up white. But I won't

Sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to tell some people my experience in a safe place. Never shared them with others before. My whole environment thanks to my major, interests, and career path, is white and Asian middle to upper-middle class people. None of this means anything to them. Racism is over, we have a black president. Real problem is the huge (tiny) number of black kids in this college thanks to AA. Hopefully they don't think I am one. I didn't check my race on applications, so now I can claim to be free of that ""taint"". I am congratulated for it.

Thanks for listening."
10p9db,3,2012-09-30,I feel like its not gonna change,Kjanzen,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10p9db/i_feel_like_its_not_gonna_change/,"I am a 16 year old guy.

my whole story starts years ago when i was brought to my friends youth group, it was awesome i met a few really cool people and i decided to keep going there. a few years go by and i still attend this youth group. i became really close with who i consider the biggest role model of my whole life, the intern speaker. 

before i was 15 my life was great. me and all my friends were super close and it was great. then i made the stupidest decision of my life i changed schools. i became really anti social not having a familiar face in my school, i even skipped some of my classes which i have never done.

the intern speaker who i looked up to so much was getting married which was amazing news, then he said he got a full time job as a youth speaker... 6 hours away. 

thats when i realized all my friends and everyone i knew was moving forward in their lives and im still me from 2 years before. not even changed, i got in a fistfight with my bestfriend of 12 years cause i need to grow up.

i also saw that all my friends had a girl in there lives and i still had no one.

lets fastforward to now, ive had the best weekend me and my friends went up to the old intern speakers house and we all agree it was the bes tweekend of our lives. then i got home and now everything has hit me at once, everyone is moving forward with their lives and im still 14. everything in m life has changed but me, my dog has died and i still go about my day as if she were still here.

i cant even get my point across to you through words im just confused."
10p5vd,9,2012-09-30,Never thought I'd have to ask this [21M] but I cheated on my girlfriend while away [21F] What's the best way to handle it?,critisize_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10p5vd/never_thought_id_have_to_ask_this_21m_but_i/,"I saw a post a couple days ago that was similar to my situation and I figured I would ask for advice as well. I've been in a LDR for the last 6 months and during the summer I went to work at an internship overseas. For the most part it was a good learning experience but there was one night where we had the night off and I went out with two of the guys to go have fun and see an new country. I had talked with them beforehand and we were only supposed to go out for drinks and then come back after, so I figured no big deal. 

Ended up going out to a bar and they paid for all my drinks since I was the intern. It was a pretty good time and I ended up drinking more than my fair share. (Isn't that how every one of these stories goes) One of the guys I was working with had a lady friend and wanted to spend some alone time with her, which I didn't have a problem with. She had also brought a couple of friends though and he was very adamant that I spend time with one of them. I had told him many times before going out that I had a girlfriend and told him that night that I wasn't interested. He still pushed the idea though and had I been back home I would have just left but I was in another country, didn't know the language, didn't know exactly where I was, and had no form of communication. I figured it would be safer to stay with the group than wander off drunk and alone in the middle of the night. 

We left the bar and went to a hotel, told him again that I didn't want a room but he insisted. I then made one of the stupidest decisions in my life and instead of just saying no, in my drunk logic thought if I went in and gave him some bs story afterwards he would leave me alone. So I went in the room with another girl and told her that I wasn't interested and she was pretty confused by that. But we ended up watching TV for a bit and then she took a shower. I thought I had handled the situation well until she came back out in only a towel. At which point I screwed up royally, she felt me up a little I ended up feeling her up and kissing her once before the guilt and the realization of how much of an idiot I was set in and I left. Never took off my clothes, no sex, none of that but at the end of the day I still cheated and I feel like the biggest scumbag in the world. Got back to my room and pretty much died inside, I had done something I thought I was incapable of doing. 

I talked with the guy the next day told him that I felt like crap and he pretty much told me, ""Good, you're losing your morals and becoming a real man."" For the rest of the time I was there he would occasionally, for lack of a better term, brag about getting the intern to cheat on his girlfriend. Needless to say I never talked or went out with him again. The rest of the guys gave me that, what happens here stays here bs too. But I couldn't change what I had done. At the end of the day, I chose to go out with them, I chose to get way too drunk, I chose to go into that hotel room, and finally I chose to touch another girl.

I wanted to tell my girlfriend immediately but she was going abroad for a semester and the last thing I wanted to do was ruin her trip by letting her know that her boyfriends a cheating scumbag right at the start of it. I haven't seen her since the incident but I know I would have broken down if I had. I'm back at school now and it's a little over a month later, I'm talking with the school therapist but the guilt doesn't go away. I feel like I'm falling apart and I don't know what to do. Although he said he can't make a decision for me the therapist is asking me to hold off on telling. She is such an amazing girl and I love her. She doesn't deserve to live a lie though but I don't want to break her heart while she's on the other side of the world and supposed to be having an amazing time. Yes, I know I should have thought about that at the time. All I ever wanted was to make her happy and be happy with her but now I've selfishly thrown that away. 

I screwed up, it was my fault, my girlfriend did nothing to deserve this, I know I'm a cheating scumbag, a loser and all sorts of other names, if you want to call me them go ahead, it had never crossed my mind that I could screw up this badly. Also, for everyone who hasn't cheated, please learn from my poor decisions, just because you haven't doesn't mean you can't. Don't be an idiot like me and put yourself into situations where you could possibly screw up in the first place. But now I don't know what to do and am asking for help. Has anyone been in this situation or on the receiving end of this situation? How was it handled/what is the best way to handle it? 

**tl;dr I was overseas for an internship when I went out drinking with two guys. One of the guys went out of his way to get me to cheat and I ended up feeling up another girl. Girlfriend is abroad and I currently feel like the worlds biggest scumbag. I don't want to break her heart while she is supposed to be having an amazing time. It's been a month and I haven't told her yet. Therapist is implying no to tell yet. I don't know what to do.**"
10p1cx,10,2012-09-29,Non-stop for 6 months...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10p1cx/nonstop_for_6_months/,"In may, my Dad's spleen ruptured when he was on a cruise. He almost died, and I spent my entire savings to fly down to Ft.Lauderdale and see him through this tough time. This would be the first time I would see my step mom for 7 years, she has never liked me and has been less than kind. 
----she would call me a fag in front of my friends, belittle me, call me ""short with a big nose that no woman will ever want,"" has fucked up my self esteem, and nearly ruined my relationship with my father. She is a disgusting pig.
This was the most trying week of my life, or so I thought. My Dad would go on to spend months in hospitals. From May until July my Dad was in the hospital.

In July, I was squeezed out of my job, found a new one, was abused at that job, left, found a new job (unpaid internship), found a job to supplement it, interviewed for another job, and took the new job that would ultimately pay more money. As a result, I now have $150 to my name. I had to borrow Money from my parents to pay my bills. 

To top it off, my best friend was killed in Afghanistan in the beginning of August by a IED. 

Think it's over? Not even close...ever heard of Mollescum Contagiosum? Well I have developed that on my genitals, I went to a dermatologist and had an STD test to confirm this, and yes it is mollescum contagiosum, as my STD panel came back 100% clean on everything. 

Now, I am broke, despondent, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making it though school, I have mollescum contagiosum, my friend is dead, (my dad is better, which I am thankful for as our relationship has improved). However, I am sitting on piles of debt, and I just want it to be my time ya know?

Im not stupid, I have a Bachelors Degree, and I am getting additional schooling, I am competent and qualified, yet I cant find a job making more than $10 an hour. 

When is it going to be my time? When will I make money? When will I find a women who loves me and be happy? Why do good people get killed? 

Im so stressed...I just feel like I am going to break down. But I press on, like I always do. "
10p02w,1,2012-09-29,"I'm so tired. I just can't take any of this anymore, it's never going to get better.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10p02w/im_so_tired_i_just_cant_take_any_of_this_anymore/,"I don't know why I'm posting here. Everyone I've talked to about this has said that my reasons for wanting to kill myself are legitimate and that they would understand if I did. I've been sick for 10+ years now. For the first 5 years I had an undiagnosed lung disease which left me bedridden all through high school. When it was finally diagnosed I was tortured by an unsupervised neurological intern for an hour while she botched a spinal tap so horribly that it left me with permanent nerve damage, and fibromyalgia developed as a result of that neurological trauma, and major PTSD from that incident. I was literally screaming and sobbing on the table begging that bitch to stop as she stabbed me over and over in the spine while blood gushed everywhere and I while I was under zero anesthesia. It was the most traumatic and painful experience of my life and as a result I have horrifically violent dreams and night sweats. I can't sleep without a high dose of sleep meds, which I have been taking every night for the last several years. I'm also on narcotics for my pain, and it's becoming a problem. I've been told by pain management specialists and physical therapists that my pain will never get better. I have been classified as ""severely disabled,"" and I am just 23 years old. I have almost daily migraines since that incident. The medication I have to take for that is also very harsh on my stomach, so I have to drink this other shit to coat my stomach to protect the lining because I will otherwise have horrific stomach pain. In the last year I also had an inexplicably swollen gallbladder, and inflamed intestinal lymphnodes which got so big and painful that I had to go to the emergency room a few times. Long term effects of my lung disease include chronic costochondritis, which feels like I'm having a heart attack all the time, and there's also a good chance I will go blind. My vision is already deteriorating. I'm also losing my memory and my ability to focus. Sometimes when I'm driving my vision will shutter for a good 30 seconds and I just have to hope I'm on a road that I know. I hope sometimes that it will just go black so I have an excuse to drive straight into a barrier.

I can't tolerate anti-depressants. I have literally tried everyone on the market and each time after 1-2 doses I have a violent vomiting session lasting for about 12 hours. I felt like I was dying every time that happened, and I hoped that would be the case. I welcome death. I have tried to overdose while on ambien on a few times, especially when I'm drinking with ambien. I always wake up eventually, feeling sick as hell, and disappointed.  

All I want to do is buy a gun, and drive to that doctor's house four states over. I want to shoot her family while she watches. Then I want to get a knife and stab her in the back repeatedly until she dies. Better yet, find some way to torture her like she did to me and leave her alive. While I'm at it, there are a lot of people I wouldn't mind killing. People have been nothing but horrible to me. Every single friend I've ever had has abandoned me because no one actually gives a shit about other people. If you aren't fun 24/7 you're no good to them. I don't even have a supportive family. My parents have told me that I should kill myself. That it'd be great if they didn't have to pay my medical bills anymore. They don't love me. No one does. I can't do this anymore. I am so sick of waking up, unable to move until my painkillers kick in, then forcing myself to go about my day as if I don't want to murder everyone in sight for bitching about their ""problems,"" start to feel sick to my stomach, take more pain killers, start to get a migraine, take migraine meds, get bitched out by some housewife for parking in a disabled spot with my disabled permit because I ""don't look disabled,"" having to hold back tears when my pain flares up even more but I'm out of pain killers, drive to the pharmacist - get there without remembering the drive at all, act pleasant to the pharmacist so they will keep giving me drugs, drive home, sit around with heating pads all over my body, take more pain killers, wait and wait until it's late enough to take ambien, I love ambien, it makes me unconscious. That's the best part of my day."
10oyvn,3,2012-09-29,University career fair advice?,deuteros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10oyvn/university_career_fair_advice/,"A little background on myself:

I received my undergrad in Accounting in 2006. It took me about a year and a half to realize that my choice of a career was a huge mistake. The thought of being an accountant for the rest of my life made me miserable. Fortunately in 2009 I got a job that was low stress and flexible enough to allow me to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.

So I've been taking classes since 2009 and now I'm in my last semester before I graduate. I actually wasn't planning on graduating until next spring but I unexpectedly discovered that I could get exempt from the course I was planning to take. 

Anyway I feel totally unprepared. My only coding experience is what I've learned in school. I never did an internship because I'm 31 and I have a wife and two kids and I work full time. My university's career fair is next week and I plan on going but to be honest I really don't know what to expect or how to present myself. When you're an Accounting major everyone is expected to go into public accounting after graduation but there's not really a rigid career progression like that for Computer Science. The only thing I know I want is a job where I can write code. But beyond that I really have no clue.

Any advice? What sort of stuff should I put on my resume?"
