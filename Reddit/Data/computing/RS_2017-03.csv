FWIW, I've made it through a background check with another prestigious (but not top) tech company-- it did show up and I had to explain it, but they were fine after this. Am I worrying too much?"

However, I disagree completely that the public should be devoid of valuable information that could sway votes because he apparently (arguably) broke some stupid rule. Here is his platform/campaign. Have a read.",McLarenLT,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5wrt4r/hello_i_am_not_dario_g_and_i_have_never_spoken/,"Elect Dario Garousian as your next AMS Vice President External. Voting takes place March 6th - 10th! Visit my website for detailed information on my campaign and how to vote: www.Dario4VPX.com

My name is Dario Garousian, and I've been involved in politics for over three years and the AMS for two years! As Vice-Chair of UNECORN, AMS Academic Affairs Commissioner, and AUS Counicillor, I've organized and planned campaigns to engage students on important issues, such as #TextbookBrokeBC, as well as voting in federal and muncipal elections.

I have extensive experience as an affordable housing advocate for students. I was interviewed by various national news outlets such as CTV, CBC, and Global, sharing my story about what it is like to be a student in search of affordable housing.

Afterwards the Mayor of Vancouver wanted my input on what has become the first Vacancy Tax in Canada, a huge step forward for housing affordability for not only students but also those working hard to live in Vancouver. Not only did I get to provide a students perspective on this tax, but I also got to be part of this historic announcement sharing the story of affordability struggles alongside the Mayor of Vancouver.

It is my hope that as VP External, I can use the experience I have gained to reshape the VP External Office to put student voices first. I will do so by focusing on three main aspects of the office; Lobbying for You, A Fair and Open External Office, &amp; Fiscal Responsibility.

★ Lobbying for You ★

A strong campus culture starts with an easy commute and affordable living solutions for all students. My plan to lobby for you offers real help to UBC students and all those working hard to contribute to our campus. When our students have an easier time getting on campus, and contributing to campus culture, we all benefit.

★ Broadway line extension - As VP External I will partner with UBC's government relations office, and pursue increased pressure on Translink and the BC Government to extend the line to UBC. We will also look into presenting viable alternatives for the Broadway line that can be implemented now rather than 30 years down the road.

★ The 99 Special - With construction set to begin on the Broadway line, congestion along the Broadway corridor will reach an all time high. This corridor is vital to many UBC students commute to campus. It's time Translink reintroduced the #99 Special non-stop service to UBC during morning rush hours and to Broadway Station during evening rush hours.

★ Investment in residence - UBC must begin to invest in building more student residences to help provide affordable housing to students. As VP External I will lobby the BC Government to introduce feasible legislation and amendments to allow the University to borrow money in order to build more housing units for students. *(There may be impending financial restructuring of UBC in order to allow the University to borrow without affecting the governments credit rating, if that is to go though the VP External must work with the VP Academic and University Affairs to lobby the University)

★ Expanding accessibility - As VP External I will partner with other student unions through lobbying partnerships such as ADVOCAN, to lobby the federal government to increase student mental health investment. We will recommend an established funding mechanism to get the cost of psychological assessments covered through the Canada Student Loans Program. 

★ Open educational resources (OER) - Using my past experience working as Academic Affairs Commissioner, I will continue the AMS's campaign for open educational resource. I will work with the VP Academic to develop a lobbying strategy in order to get increased investment for OERs by the provincial government.

★ Student employment - Another proposal the VP External will bring to the federal government would be to increase investment in paid internships, and co-ops. This will help students manage to attain paying jobs after graduation.

★ Ride-sharing today - As VP External I will reopen the conversation between the AMS and ride-sharing companies. In the wake of the BC Governments announcement that they are reviewing whether to allow ride-sharing to operate in B.C., it is imperative that students have a voice in the conversation. Ride-sharing offers increased affordability for students versus the taxi alternative, but we must also be sure the B.C. regulatory framework is not risking the safety of our students.

★ Fair and Open External Office ★

It is time to shine more light on the VP External office and ensure that it remains focused on the students it serves. The AMS and each executives information should be open by default. Data paid for by students belongs to students. The VP External office will lead by example to restore trust in our student leadership, and that begins with trusting students with our information.

★ Access to information - Our offices data and information need to be available by default. I will work with the AMS archivist to expand the disclosure of ongoing and past VP External activities, including but not limited too lobbying schedules, ongoing expenditures, and data driven research reports.

★ Outreach AMS revamped - The VP External Office will revamp Outreach AMS, where we will deliver easy online access to volunteer opportunities, lobbying schedules, and every single expenditure of the office. This time OutreachAMS will be done right, no longer will it be a separate website, but it will be operated as a subpage of the current AMS website. *(the current AMS website is being redesigned, meaning I will be committed to working with the new design team in order to incorporate the OutreachAMS subpage under the new website)

★ Prioritizing what's right - Responsible VP Externals rely on sound data to make their decisions. The VP External office will continue to partner with student unions, and secure discounted contracts with opinion polling firms such as Insights West, and Angus Reid Institute. We will release to all students the information that informs the decisions we make.

★ A more effective office - For the AMS and VP External Office to work best, its staff must be free to do what they have been hired to do: work efficiently and effectively support our lobbying projects. The VP External Office will undergo an administrative reform to create more opportunities for student involvement and a more effective office. The new office will host an Associate VP External, External Outreach Commissioner, External Research Commissioner, and a Public Relations Commissioner. (See full platform appendix for details) 

★ Fiscal Plan and Costing ★

My plan makes more responsible choices with your student fees than past VP Externals. For example:

★ I will conduct an administrative review of all past expenditures to target budget loopholes that directly benefit the VP External rather than students and the AMS lobbying priorities

★ I will restructure the office to focus on effective and efficient advocacy by increasing our part-time student staff at no extra cost to students.

★ I will be honest about the VP Externals fiscal position, and publicly release all our ongoing expenditures.

★ I will ensure no student fees go towards unnecessary software expenditures for the VP External Office. In my plan to revitalize OutreachAMS, I will utilize our current communications team and AMS website to ensure we are responsibly allocating our budget. 

★ I will look towards increasing our partnerships to reduce the overall lobbying cost for UBC students. This will include partnering with other organizations and Student Unions.

These choices mean that this plan will bring meaningful and immediate change to the expenditures of the VP External Office, while positively impacting our lobbying success."

I'm a fan of puzzles and currently have a collection of around 50 Rubik's cube type puzzles (you can usually find me lurking around /r/Cubers) I've also done some expeirmantngin with budget electornics like Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's.

Lately i've also become intrested in pocket knives and ""EDC"" type things.

5ws9po,3,2017-02-28,"Cliff Notes on George Webb's Series, ""The Dyncorp Harvest"", Part 12",911bodysnatchers322,TruthLeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/TruthLeaks/comments/5ws9po/cliff_notes_on_george_webbs_series_the_dyncorp/,"**DynCorp Harvest**

**This series is rated R for Mature Adults.**

In the DynCorp Harvest series, George incrementally describes a luxury medical tourism resort in Northern Haiti, funded by USAID and built by the Clinton Foundation, whose revenue-earning underpinnings are purported to be a) an illegal organ harvesting market, b) human sex trafficking Dyncorp-Slim ratline and c) microlending loansharking debt slavery by DynCorp--the CIA's privatized, covert-services contractor.

The organs are proposed to be either transplanted in Haiti into rich elites skipping the lines with help from organ brokers he believes the Podestas and Braverman-the-doctor to be, or shipped to locations throughout the US to various aristocratic outlets; while women are forced into cellphone-based debt slavery and prostitution; and children are sex-trafficked to Colombia or stowed aboard a medical ship bound for a port in Norfolk Va to be (mkultra-best-use/sex/assassin/politician) trafficked in DC (and abroad).  Furthermore, and much like they were in Vietnam, the bodies would then be zipped in DynCorp bodybags, shipped abroad with organs removed and replaced with illegal drugs.

These activities, in addition to blackmailing police forces, politicians, and industry influencers into compliance and loyal servitude--the so-called *Brownstone Operations*--are the ""natural and necessary"" functions of the CIA, because--*the company* erroneously believes--these activities are needed to fund these selfsame covert operations!  Putting it more simply, *""We need to commit crimes so we can continue to commit crimes.""*

There.  Now you understand the CIA.

  * The question I posed is: Are they doing this within the US?  Is the CIA/Dyncorp doing this to their political opponents?
  * Trump hosts their annual convention in Florida for the last seven years.  So is HE a customer?  I dunno!
  * Film, *21 Grams*, same 2 actors Sean Penn and Naomi Watts as in other Lionsgate film, *Fair Game*, about a drug dealer who sells Sean Penn a heart.
  * It's kind of a 'hidden in plain sight' with the Clintons and Dyncorp.  Maybe Bush did it too.

  * If you want to challenge the facts on this I have [evidence for] Bosnia, Kosovo, Afganistan
  * JTTF in US: CIA has inserted itself into FBI via brownstown ops by planting a revenge motive to do something illegal and terrible like gangraping Jessa Dillow-Crisp.
  * [Christopher Reeve] -- lets say he did a protest movie about war, and the pentagon didn't like it.  They could shoot your horse with a pellet gun as you're going over a jump--to give you a warning.  I don't think they thought it would turn out the way it did.  If you keep on speaking out against war, all of a sudden your wife [Dana Reeve] does young.  I don't think she had ""old heart""
  * *James Elephantitis* -- has a pig farm.  Which I thought was interesting for one of the most powerful men in washington.    {{""le chomp"" ~~body disposal~~ restaurant leftovers disposal pig farm}}
  * Doug Coe: It's all intimidation along the way.
  * O.U.R. Operation uUnderground Railroad.  Using the revenge motive to get christian groups to attack guys like us.
  * OUR, everyone is saying it's a sham charity, a front organization for navy seal team that has no rules...to operate with impunity around the world.  No oversight, no paperwork, no followup.
  * Caracol park, I said this industrial park was going to get like a 1000 businesses, and they were all going to get loans from the World Bank and then they were going to fold over time after all the money was loaned out.  This is like the *Arkansas Development Fund*  I think this is done through the export/import bank run through the World Bank that has Congress oversight.  EXIM Bank.  They collapsed it last year in 2015.  They collapsed 10 yr insured loans, which Congress co-signed...Congress had to pay that out.  I think that's where Hillary got the extra 5B dollars.
  * George shows a spending ledger of USAID assistance money.  He points to Petits Freres et Soeurs, and says this was for moving kids around.  They all had different illnesses.  That's because--he believes--dyncorp was spraying the area with different things.
  * Cellphones help you track migration versus vectors and who died; micro versus macro longitudinal studies
  * Hospital ship comfort goes ashore in tents to do statistical studies and then do followup operations and biopsies on the ship.
  * You create traffic back and forth from shore to ship and then move in the bodies at night into the ship to do the organ extractions
  * People in the health field are going to start remembering interactions with the CIA and these details, now that the 'working theory' is out there.
  * If I'm CIA and I want to do a study, I put it through Dyncorp or through a foundation
  * CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] hasn't gone anywhere, they say it's shut down.  It's going to be funded by Rockefeller on the other coast through the Google Foundation
  * Bill Swing is Mr. Virus and Fred Eshelman is Mr. Vaccine.  And there's the body bags.  I believe they are going to atlanta to the CDC.
  * All these US foreign service officers, they're all from Johns Hopkins.  Is it like Cleveland Clinic...a big organ transplant center?  Yes it is! For overseas people?  Yes it is.  Who else graduated from there? Andrew Young.  Where else was he the mayor of? Atlanta: The Center for Disease Control.  I just connect the dots I'm not making any accusations.
  * I remember Wayne Williams [Atlanta Murders of 1979-81]^^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_murders_of_1979%E2%80%9381)[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Williams) and these ***33*** kids dying [23 actually, according to wikipedia], and this guy had this Dr. Spock grip.  He didn't kill the kids initially, he just seemed to incapacitate them.

  * CIA is like the fourth branch of government.
  * If the 3 branches are kids playing in the sandbox, CIA is kind like inviting Harambe [gorilla] into the sandbox.  You hope it will be nice but you start seeing Harambe dragging kids in circles. You wonder if it's safe
  * That's where we are at with Dyncorp in the United States.  It's been that way since 9/11. But it's getting worse and I'll show that.
  * There is nothing to say they can't do the same things they did the Libya, Syria topples in any country around the world {{ including the US }}
  * In order to combat this clandestine period since 1974 is an open operation, an open media research investigation.
  * I take in news stories, connect things and summarize it.
  * George calls himself a glorified stenographer in an open media investigation.  {{ Nope, that's me.  You're the Captain of video, steering this thing }}
  * Pfullendorf Germany ""Vile Revelations of 'Sadistic Naked Sex Rituals' at Elite German Military Base"" -- in a bigger picture view, it's part of a larger brownstone operation in the organ harvest chain -- compartmentalize and then compromise
  * Team Rubicon recap
  * Dana Braverman: It's almost like they took NY Jewish kids to Israel, retrained them and named the 'bravermans'
  * Update to Cleveland Clinic.  The gal who got sent home to Saudi is going to sue.  They are trying to make a big deal of this extreme vetting thing.  It's actually a cover.  The CLeveland Clinic has been hammered a couple of times.  They are called an 'organ-friendly hospital'.  I think I've figured out the link here:
  * Paul Farmer is teaching in Rwanda, in Haiti and these genocide countries.  He's teaching these interns--the same ones being turned away up here--to do organ extractions, and now then they are coming back to the US to do organ transplants.  You need semi-skilled people doing extractions, and then they go to Cleveland clinic to learn under an expert to do the transplants.  When you look at the money [behind organ / blood harvesting] it's just too [compelling of a profit motive drive] to ignore
  * Cord blood can be substituted for bone marrow, used to treat leukemia, and it's a lot easier to match -- university of denver and UCD medical is going to be a big cord blood bank.
  * Secret film by Project Veritas and Planned Parenthood and the cord blood.  Nucatola -- Senior Diretor of Clinical Services, aborted fetus heart harvesting/transplants
  * Emergent Biosciences Zsolt playing both sides viruses + vaccines
  * Hospital ship in Honduras right now called the Spearhead; I'm convinced it's a teaching hospital for doing transplants
  * There are 9 more ships being commissioned.  They are trying to speed up the ships / get faster ships to transport organs quicker.
  * Drug money is being laundered through Lionsgate films to create films of every operation they do {{""confessing""}} -- you find this in high tech also
  * There's also a film called *The Island* about CIA agents impregnating women so they'll have organs as they get older
  * Dr. Braverman's patient list is going to be the buyers. Sold by Podesta, by Paul Farmer, by office art, and by ritualistic practice with cake; Fleischaker email is the evidence and testimonial of an elite organ market.
  * New citation about a Turkish doctor that has done 23,000 kidney transplants in Bosnia, Kosovo and now doing transplants in Aleppo.
  * Glen Beck travels to Haiti with Operation Underground Railroad--his role is to add legitimacy
  * Tim Ballard, ex-DHS Ceo -- Operation Underground Railroad
  * Public-Private-Partnership?  No it's vigilante kidnap and extorting unit created for asset seizure; it's the farthest extention of a public-private-partnership you can get. In fact, there's no public piece to this.  They do stings with DHS.  They are extorting money.
  * Kids are being used, being kidnapped, and at least being bloodfarmed for cryogenics and for cord blood.
  * And their wives don't even know it, that's the sad part: they are all ex-special forces--guys trained to go in and kill everybody.
  * University of Denver will be a big transplanation center and blood banks
  * North of Boulder near RMNP, you're going to have your big underground complex.  With their current disposition matrix, they are deciding who is going to get to go into the tunnel into the complex if nuclear war happens.  Just like Kissinger's paper at Harvard.  And the movie ""Dr Strangelove""
  * With Palantir I can follow all my assets with the cellphones
  * Lots of recaps
  * Dick Gregory (activist) agrees with George about Wayne Williams Atlanta killings theory mentioned previously
  * ***The only way the open operations have a chance about the covert operations is by putting out the 650k emails, at least the metadata.  The public has no chance, there's no other way.  People say, ""oh Pompeo is coming in"".  No Intelligence directorate which intercepts everything going to the director and redirects it.  So that's not a solution. The only solution is sunshine.***

  * The difference between Vietnam's Phoenix operation and this operation is organ harvesting
  * Petraeus added more use of gassing and psychological operations -- turning villages against each other. ""gang-countergang"" {{Jesuit trick}}
  * Bone marrow cells can stay alive 17 days after death, so that kind of negates all the other stuff [given the price per gram], don't know if that many people have leukemia
  * Somebody mentioned that Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins both have hospitals in Dubai, UAE
  * Repo Men, Daybreakers, Matrix and the Island -- organ harvesting films; trying to normalize organ harvesting
  * Trying to find if Dan Braverman from Team Rubicon is related to Dr. Eric Braverman.  It could just be Mossad, kids go back [Israel] and come back as a ""braverman""
  * George wonders if Fleishaker's PAM email list is a ""social justice"" list, like oh we got a new heart for this person and it came from this bad guy over here; and [for example] Peter Kadzik made it happen through the DOJ through a domestic harassment campaign [targetted individuals of government gangstalking]  DHS has this terrorist watchlist that--like the Phoenix program--targetted [baddies] originally terrorists but then ultimately ends up targetting completely innocent people [political adversaries doing nothing more than exercising constitutionally-guaranteed right to free speech, expression and collaboration]
  * Prayer breakfast tomorrow
  * I saw a guy named Doug Valentine who wrote a thick book about the Phoenix program, and he talked about the white helmets being a fake organization
  * What he said about the Phoenix program was interesting--south Vietnam had 44 provinces and they put a terror-torture center in each province.  Then in the districts (counties) they put a JTTF type officer in each district.  Exactly like our fusion centers.  One in each state and then expand out to each police force you put a JTTF officer.
  * Exactly what I was saying: 10,000 dollars and you take over a whole country [by taking over the police force]
  * Regarding Glenn Beck.  I didn't mean to say all Mormons were are behind all this.  *There's a group of Mormons called* ***FLBS*** *that believe in the bigamy, and they also believe in these tunnels because the feds were always after them*.  What I'm saying is that the CIA, when they go to a group like this--they are anthropologists almost--they look and see to the habits and patterns that they will respond positively to, and they [steer the cults using their own culture--""it's your culture""--alephantis]
  * CIA is going to have a hand in every type of religion and cult and steer it
  * Vietnamese were afraid they wouldn't go to heaven if their liver was eaten, so [the CIA] would cut out the liver and make sure villagers see it.
  * The same reason Israelis have women soldiers, because Muslims believe they won't go to heaven if they are killed by a woman.  Automatic machine guns in the Paletinian areas, they'll make sure they are manned by women crews
  * Mormon cutouts, and exploiting hierarchies
  * Operation Underground Railroad, Tim Ballard, and the Super Bowl.  Young women targetted.
  * They are not going to be prosecuted, they will be put into an asset forfeiture program; to put a revenge motive in a group and take the whole family's assets
  * World Vision Vaccine ""Cothy O'Brien""  Cathy O'Brien talked about the world vision vaccine used [in Haiti], she said she trafficked drugs and was used as a sex slave in Haiti
  * Anyone who has information about the foreign officers around the hospital ships.  Those are the people going ashore and making deals about who is going to get transplants, they will be the salesman for hospital ship transplants.
  * You're not forgotten Monica Petersen.

  * News update: going to meet with an Oliver Stone person to make this into a motion picture
  * Jorge Puello from Haiti is trying to contact George
  * When the CIA/Dyncorp were created they had a kind of GOD complex  [Guns/Gold Oil/Opium/Orgies/Organs Drugs]
  * Dyncorp is the cutting up of the kill and using all the parts
  * Wild Bill Donovan was the cowboy that gave that spirit to these 'happy crew of pirates'
  * As you get closer to the reality, you see that it's ugly.  It gets into infecting populations with viruses and selling the vaccines, sex and drug trafficking ends up with a lot of ruined lives and prostitution killing themselves with drug overdoses ""that's just not a fun thing"" {Lol}
  * The profits are so big with organ biz that you end up throwing in guys-like-me in with the bad guys; we may as well throw in a few journalists in too.  They stand between us and overthowing the country.  So we got to get rid of them.  That's a very orwellian view of the world; but that's why Dyncorp was created.
  * George describes the slippery slope of using JTTF fixers to go after political enemies turning into going after business enemies
  * CIA and State Dept are kind of the same thing; it's just the State Dept is the political side of the Dept of Defense {{versus the Pentagon which is the military side of DoD}}
  * Is Monica Petersen alive and part of the witness protection?   I don't think so.  Too many upset family and friends
  * ""Political Military Officers Set Up Underground Railroads"" -- text
  * A lot of these kids are survivors of wars [wards of the cia] and become foreign officers, groomed, and selected by the Madam Allbrights of the world.  They are selected and groomed.  George mentions they could have been sired by the people in the CIA, again for potential organ harvesting; [and that would explain why Obama is related to George Bush and Dick Cheney within an otherwise statistically unlikely number of generations]
  * ""The CIA does not care about the people of Haiti"" They want to control 3 things: the military, the checkbook/budget and the President
  * ""I want to create a political bond with the elite in a country.  In order to keep a country you need the leaders and you need the elite--you don't need to worry about the people.  The elite need health services, so they are going to want to buy organs--hearts.  You are going in there [with the military] and farm it that way. The reason why this hospital ship is going all around to these 11 different places isn't to provide healthcare to the poor: it's to provide healthcare to the elite.""
  * CNN will have a cover story--always--about some poor person getting it so that the impression is given in your mind, but the healthcare is for the elites.
  * ""UAE Doctors"" -- UAE Cleveland Clinic in Dubai is a concentration point for all middle east muslim doctors in the muslim brotherhood
  * 454g / lb
  * If you don't have those public occult rituals then people won't know you're in that business
  * Petraeus Provides Flash Bang Moment
  * Rice study for Bill Clinton, probably several different viruses in it
  * USAID and UNICEF running that program and MercyCorp and World Vision will be the information collectors to see how the studies are going.
  * I'm not going to call Puello because I know it's a diversion, I know it's _____(unintelligble--sounds like saudis)___
  * If you don't publish the 650k emails, then you lose all credibility and you are fake news
  * Israel, China and Russia have this information!
  * Somebody said it's another 1M that the McCabes got. So that's 1.6M now (quid pro quo) for Mccabe's wifes run
  * Ok so let's see if we go to Hollywood or if we end up dead in the parking lot like Seth Rich.

  * Disrupt -- this is happening in Berkeley now with Soros' groups.  Soros is openly calling for the overthow of Trump. Will probably call for impeachment.
  * Instead of farming crops they farm people
  * That involves introducing viruses to weaken the immune system so that organ transplants will be easier, believe it or not.
  * People who donate to this endowment to Harvard, you're going to find that these donors through Larry Summers are going to be trading life plans and replacement organs for endowments
  * UAE Dr Israel just had his practice shut down for selling bone marrow has moved to Germany
  * Cleveland Clinic is one of the greatest medicial institutions of all time, and they've moved to UAE
  * We split off UAE from Saudi to militarily control the Strait of Hormuz to retain access to the Persian Gulf, like the Suez canal
  * UAE has changed their organ transplant laws so you can call someone dead before they are dead, which enables live transfer
  * All those missing 15,000 organs are within short flight to UAE
  * The CIA likes to do things by running around the Congress.  [They avoid all the laws of the US and get away with everything we don't want them doing around the world.]
  * ""Doc to Dock No inspection for Organs Leaving Flex Jets"" -- it smacks of this cover.  Passenger, executive jet that seats 20, not a cargo jet, 20 prisoners going back, boxes coming out.  What you don't see in the social justice films.  Homen square is then the holding pen for the 20
  * ""La Difference School"" -- George Washington Barbados kid, Alexander Hamilton was the son.  If you want to have genetic matches in you later years, you have organ kids stowed away [maybe they suceed you or maybe they're your liver donor]
  * Dyncorp is spraying El Salvador and Columbia.  George believes they are spraying viruses

  * Carl Shoffler was the first Tim Ballard-- Watergate Arresting Police Officer.  He had all the informants and all the setups for the brownstones.  This brownstone stuff goes back 40 yrs.  It's been privatized with Booze Allen Hamilton
  * Wikipedia rumor of more forthcoming releases
  * The future of journalism is data analysis -- doing what George is doing
  * People are saying Trump gave Chaffetz the go-ahead -- I don't think so. I think they are going to try to impeach him or militarily overthrow him.
  * Netinyahu is saying 'enough is enough', you've surrounded my country with muslim brotherhood terrorist topple activities.  I'm not going to let it go on.  I have these 650,000 emails. Even if I have to hang my foreign minister out to dry for your brownstones, I'll do, because I don't want loose stingers surrounding my country.

  * Jorge tell us who the operatives are.  Just publish it.  They always want to diffuse and have you go off in different directions
  * PPD Vaccines.  Who are the officers in El Salvador and Columbia, Jorge--you have a chance to be a real hero.  Let's talk about hospital shifts.  Prove me right, send the information to the reporters in this group.  This is a real chance for you to expose what the State Dept / CIA is doing.

  *  All of this activity is for elites to have eternal life
  * Knights of Malta.  When Clinton Foundation shut down the CGI, which is really going to be reformed by Rockefeller and Google foundation, I proposed the question: did they go to Malta?
  * Malta can issue diplomatic passports so you can bypass the security lines.  Here are all the countries they have diplomatic relationships with.  And Canada is one
  *  If you are jewish you know this.  The maltese falcon is a bird you could put in the window of an art shop, hospital or church and that person would accept MONEY to get out of Germany into Jewish-friendly countries.  It's to let everyone know you can get letters of transit if you could pay that extortion money to escape.
  * Reason I mention it is the Knights of the Grand Master of Malta resigned today.  The Pope is saying he's going to take control of the Order of Knights of Malta.  It's not actually part of the Catholic Church, but it's always been the military wing of the Catholic Church.  These guys were assassins.  They called them knights of Justice; popes were killing each other and so forth. It's been a spy ring for a long time {{Jesuits}} and in recent times, since war of 1812 it's been a way to spirit away rich people who are in trouble with the law.  It's been a ratline for trafficking for a long time.  SO when the CIA goes to find a network, the CIA doesn't go to the Church to pray--they go because they want letters of introduction, letters of transit
  * FBI dominates in the US, so CIA inserts itself into Canada.  All the MKULTRA experiments are done in Quebec.

  * Hospital ships are going to be used for organ transplant for the elite
  * VA hospital through OHS contracts is going to be responsible for logistics of scheduling.  VA scheduling problems are from prioritizing the elites [skipping the line]
  * Swiss SYNTEK vaccine testing
  * Once you compromise the police and military [and set up the organ system], then you can export this [turnkey] system to other governments with foreign officers, and saying 'hey we have this plan for eternal life'; and if he can use his own country's people's organs for the elite, then that's a key brokering leverage
  * I'm more sure than ever that USAID is the service setting up kids for vaccines and moving them to remote areas where they can be harvested
  * The ""us think"", the MIC, ""our people"", the CIA, we're going to create this waystation or retreat in case anything goes wrong.  We're going to have this plan for longer life, and we're going to have underground railroads to take it from somebody else at no charge to ourselves.  This 'co-opting' idea that runs through the CIA

  * They use the kids for sex stings and then have revenge groups to 'harvest them'.

5wsz91,1,2017-02-28,Is happiness too much to ask for?,ImHereYetAgain,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5wsz91/is_happiness_too_much_to_ask_for/,"Last summer, I was finishing up college. After a string of self destructive events, I decided I would go live with my parents in a shitty retirement community 1,400 miles away to seek a fresh start. (my brother lived an hour away in the city, so I figured I could find a job and crash at his place when I needed to). Ironically, it turned out to be the best summer I've ever had. I unexpectedly met my boyfriend, who was visiting his dad for the summer from another state. We both fell hard for each other and we decided that I would go home to just visit my parents, and then I would move 1,000 miles away into the apartment he lived in. I was completely and utterly exuberant. I was very much looking forward to living in a new area, with new opportunities, and living with the love of my life. I was on top of the WORLD. Things were just too good to be true!


And of course, they were.


After I completed the awesome cross-country road trip back home, things started to go completely downhill. My boyfriend returned to his home state, and wanted to 'get things in place' before I moved in with him. So I waited. And somehow, in under a month, he managed to lose EVERYTHING: his job, apartment, and car. He needed to get his registration for his car, so he couldn't drive to work. Then he wasn't able to pay for his apartment because he couldn't get to work. Then someone managed to drive into his parked car and totaled it.
On top of all this, I ended up failing my last class needed to complete my degree AND also found out it wouldn't have counted anyway! So now I owe the university for a class I didn't even pass, let alone EVEN NEED TO TAKE. On top of THAT, I don't even have my shitty graphic design degree I worked oh so hard for. 


My parents were nice enough to let my boyfriend come stay with us for a bit, to get things sorted out. So he came and stayed for two months.  Now he's back in the state that we met in, working. We thought it would be best if he went back there where we both had connections, so he could get his life back on track and we could find a place there.


It has been an extremely rough 8 months since everything has happened. My brother ended up getting a divorce and is back home with us, so getting a job in the city is more difficult. Guess it doesn't matter to much anyway because the city I live near has next to NO openings for internships, and very few in entry level positions. So I got a completely shitty job at a grocery store where I work 8 hours with no break. Still, it's better than sitting at home and doing nothing. As the plan goes right now, Im currently saving up money so I can move 1,400 miles BACK to my college town and live with my boyfriend. My boyfriend's part is finding a place for us to live.


I love my boyfriend with all of my heart. I've never had a connection with anyone like him. He is a kind, gentle, understanding and patient soul and we share a very special connection. While he was here we got along great. But my anxiety and depression tells me something is going to go COMPLETELY wrong like it did before and I'll be stuck here waiting again on him to do his part. I don't want to wait around for my boyfriend to get his shit together, but I don't want to break up with a wonderful partner either, who otherwise brings me happiness. I've decided that if something like what happened before happens again that it's not anything coincidental, which is extremely depressing to me.
 

I still don't understand why everything went completely down hill so fast and the way it did. I want to find some kind of reason why all of this happened but I can't. If I would of known my boyfriend was going to end up back in my college town I wouldn't have left in the first place. I hate that my friends are so far away from my family. I hate living in a small retirement community in the middle of the fucking desert. I hate that I STILL DON'T HAVE MY DEGREE DESPITE GOING THROUGH THE GRADUATION CEREMONY LAST MAY. I miss my boyfriend so, so much. I have dealt with chronic depression, but have never been this lonely and depressed in my life. I am completely homesick, even though I'm at home! I feel like I reversed the progress I made back in my home state. I cry almost daily thinking I made a huge mistake by moving home. People at work make comments on how I seem unhappy. Today, I weighed myself and discovered i've lost over 10lbs since moving here. I feel like a complete and utter pathetic failure.


Everyone tells me to cheer up, that it could be way worse. But what they don't understand is i'm living in my own personal hell. "

I am about to be done with CS 161 in about two weeks or so, but have been performing very poorly, to say the least. While I feel like I understand the concepts I read in the textbook, I have struggled to complete assignments to the point where I required tutor help for almost of all the work - a big burn in my wallet. I am currently on the brink of failing (borderline C and C-) and was wondering what classmates here think. Should I retake CS 161 or should I barely pass it and move on CS 162? 
   On the one hand, retaking the course would allow to strengthen my C++ skills, a necessity for CS 162, a class that is often called a lot more difficult than CS 161. On the other, retaking a class would mess up my current 2 year plan and make me even less competitive for Summer internships. Not to mention, I would need to spend an extra $1900. Has anyone experienced this? What would you recommend?"

I have a few questions:

1. I've read a lot about crime issues in Santa Cruz, which mystifies me a bit because the town seemed so laid back when I visited. Anyway, what areas should I avoid? I may also be bringing my car since I'm coming from the east coast (though ideally I'd avoid driving entirely, I'm not sure how doable that is, especially if I want to visit SF on the weekend or something) and am concerned about the high property crime rates, e.g. I read about hubcaps getting stolen. Any advice on how to minimize this risk?

2. How doable is finding a summer sublet near downtown? That's where I'll be interning, so ideally I'd live within walking distance of work, but I'm guessing most summer subletting options will be closer to UCSC?

3. Any good options for healthy food in downtown? 

4. Anything else I should know?"
5wtspp,2,2017-03-01,I'm really starting to resent my roommate.,calmdowntoughgirl,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5wtspp/im_really_starting_to_resent_my_roommate/,"My roommate and I have shared a lot of really negative experiences; we've both had eating disorders, been hospitalized, been raped. I was in a really bad place with my depression about a year ago and took a break from school to get my medication straight and get in some really serious therapy. Last semester, I was in a really good place, and my roommate was in a really bad one, coming to terms with her sexual assault. I was raped by a boyfriend a few years ago and have had all the time I've needed to process that, plus was coming off of nine months of serious therapy, so I was willing to support her until a professional could. 

It took a toll (these things always do). Every day when I came home from class, I needed to schedule in time to listen to her. I knew the feeling of needing a hand, so I tried my best, but really really pushed her towards seeing a therapist or a professional - she booked an appointment, but then found out the person was a social worker (LCSW) and not a psychologist and bailed. She then started seeing this awful boy and suddenly was better! Cured! No more depression! Taking 80mg of adderall a day, but no depression!

We had our winter break, and I stopped taking my antidepressants (it's going ok!). When I came back to school, she was seeing a new guy - he seemed great, I liked him, better than the last guy. He just broke up with her, after being official less than a month. They're still sleeping together and she's at his place every night. But tonight she texted me (from his place) that she was really sad that he wasn't noticing how sad she was that they're not official anymore. I told her it might help to take a day or two to refresh and chill out on her own before hanging out with him again. 

She told me that she can't feel refreshed, she's depressed, she's always been depressed and she was only not depressed when she was with this new boy (remember, they've been dating less than a month). I told her maybe she should try to get to a place where her depression doesn't depends on whether or not she has a boyfriend. She said that would be nice, but it won't happen. I suggested therapy. She said it didn't work. I asked if she'd try medication. She said no.

I cannot support this girl through another semester. I gave it my best last semester, when I was in a good place, but now I'm taking more classes, applying for internships, applying for study abroad programs, really trying to throw myself into school, and also a little shaky coming off antidepressants after two years on them!

I feel selfish and shitty because there were times when I really needed someone to support me, and thankfully I had someone; he's the one who suggested I take a semester off, which made all the difference. But he also made it very clear that he was only ever going to be a placeholder until I got professional help. 

My roommate will never get professional help. Abjectly refuses. I have done all the work for her - asking her what type of a person she's looking for, scouring our city's list of psychologists, calling and asking for availability. At this point, I'm done. I cannot do any more for her while also taking care of me. It's stressful as hell and makes me really resent her. It's like she likes being depressed - I honestly live every day in fear of things getting bad again, I'm in therapy even though I'm ok just as a safety net, I miss the security I felt on my antidepressants. I've definitely been in places where therapy was overwhelming, but so was getting out of bed, or brushing my teeth, and I honestly don't think that's where she's coming from. I'm fucking fed up.

But I'd also never forgive myself if she was in that place, and things were that bad, and something happened to her and I wasn't there. "
5wu9sd,2,2017-03-01,"[M, 20] USA -&gt; Thailand? Prague? Anywhere? (lots of info in post)",yaynewthrowawaytime,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/5wu9sd/m_20_usa_thailand_prague_anywhere_lots_of_info_in/,"A while back I stopped by to ask some questions about a potential move to Prague with my girlfriend to teach ESL. However, my situation has changed drastically. 


I will be travelling solo, now. I am graduating this April from a state university with a double-major in English and Communication (I know, I know, emigration wasn’t really on my to-do list when I picked), with Honors and a completed thesis, have three years experience as a resident assistant, limited desk job experience (~6 months total), and have worked as a PR intern for a political campaign. I am familiar with basic IT protocol including software and hardware, but have no formal training. I am male, 20 (21 in May), a tad short (5’ 8”), and average physically (a little overweight, but I’m working on it). I am white, with blonde hair and blue eyes, and not too ugly, definitely not a 10 though (I mention these things because from what I understand, they are important details in some locales). I know a bit of French (I’d say approaching conversational) and according to DuoLingo am 10% fluent in Spanish ;) I know those don’t mean much, but I’m willing to keep studying or start a new language. 


Financially, I haven’t done so badly. I don't have any debt, and when I graduate I’ll have around $9,500 in savings, and if I was to sell some stuff could probably come up with another $1-2,000 fairly quickly. My then-girlfriend was then most amiable to Prague. I still find Prague fascinating (even spoke briefly with a poster in this sub about a potential entry IT position), but want to keep all my options open. I don’t really have a profitable degree for foreign markets, that I understand. I understand that TEFL is probably my easiest bet for emigrating somewhere, for now. However, I understand TEFL is not very promising for long-term stability. Which is kind of what I’m looking for - I’ve really not got much in terms of things to stay here for, I’d like to make some sort of new life. I know that may sound like “grass is always greener,” but I’ve been thinking pretty strongly about this for around three months now, every day. I’ve heard a lot of good things about Chiang Mai in particular for freelance work. 


Now that I don’t have to compromise with her, I am free to go wherever. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I’d like to travel for a bit casually, but then I imagine looking for something more permanent (someday I’d like to settle somewhere, but I just can’t see myself doing that in the United States, petulant as it may seem). The pipe dream, of course, is to meet and fall madly in mutual love with a nice Irish, Kiwi, or Australian woman =) (joking, here... mostly). My tentative plan (still gotta research visa particulars, etc.) was to live in Thailand without working (or finding casual ESL work?) for as long as a visa lets me (unless there’s a conceivable way to stay semi-permanently), then going to Vietnam for the CELTA course. I’d then work for a year (either in HCMC or Da Nang), and simultaneously search for freelance/remote positions in writing professions while trying to learn some coding to build a portfolio. I’m also a fairly good writer, with some University level accolades, and would love to be able to freelance write but I know that’s a pretty difficult world to enter successfully.


Another option would be to take a live-in job opportunity here in the U.S. over the summer, where I could net another $1-2k, more if I got another part-time on the side. During this time I would work as hard as possible trying to find a permanent remote position based in the United States, and with some extreme luck, maybe find one that could fund my relocation to another country friendly to remote work (any thoughts? I've heard good things about South America). I’m looking for anything here. All help is appreciated!"

My dilemma is as follows. I've been working on a business plan for about 2 years now, it's a plan that's mostly based on creating a new financial product that would be very attractive to institutional investors (would increase their profit by literally millions a year). A few days ago I finally got the good news from my lawyers that the plan has been greenlit, after a 2 year process.

However, a few days ago I also got some more good news. One of the leading financial services providers in the country has offered me a thesis internship, where I write my thesis on a subject they came up with and pretty much work with them for 6 months, this usually leads to a job offer after the internship.

Just to clarify, I'm by no means complaining. It's a lot of good news in just a few days. However, my dilemma is whether to pursue the internship or to start up my company. If I decide to do the internship, that's 6 months during which others might come up with the idea or 6 months in which laws might be changed that would make my whole plan moot. If I reject the internship, it'll probably leave a bad taste in the company's mouths.

I'm really at a loss here. I'm leaning towards starting up the company and simply postponing my thesis by half a year or so, but there's a good chance I won't get such a good internship offer again. 

Some more background info, in case it's useful: I'm 23 years old, doing a master's in Finance (duh), the business plan could potentially make many millions (though of course everyone thinks that) and would require practically no start-up costs.

Any advice would be very very welcome, thanks a lot everyone.

Edit: If any other information would help in giving advice just let me know of course.

Another edit: I don't have a partner I could start this company with, no one really knows about it except my girlfriend and me, and the lawyers that looked into it. "

I don't think this is as incredible as the fact that I've been applying for basically all my college life (internships and failing) and i actually got a job like a real job. The best part is it's a tech company in SV; basically making a shit ton of money. like this is surreal. 

Not sure what the point of this post is but i feel like i finessed my way into a great job. Hoep i can keep up!"

More info in comments.",babababrandon,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5wuypl/i_have_three_almost_maxed_out_cards_and_1000_to/,"Hey y'all, so with my final student benefited tax return I'm going to be putting $1000 towards dept. I currently have 3 credit cards total, and all of them are pretty much maxed out. I've just graduated and have a big boy job (Just got an offer yesterday at my internship starting at $70k!) so I'm trying to be smarter with money (starting at the side bar). ""The best time I should start doing that was when I first started college but the second best time is now"" and all that jazz.
  
  
Card 1: $989.79/1000 w/ 10.4% APR  
Card 2: $990.09/1000 w/ 23.49% APR  
Card 3: $1,983.09/2000 w/ 25.74 APR  
  
  
So I planned on paying off card 1 regularly because it obviously has the lowest APR. What I'm trying to figure out is if I should just pay off card 2 in total and rip it up, or pay off half of card 3? Does it even matter in the long run? I think increasing my credit score is my biggest goal, if that's even possible with my options (though I guess that'll happen naturally over time as long as I keep paying off my debts). If I go with card 2, I've been told that it's better to leave the account open and rip up the card, rather than close the account, is this true?

To add some other potential options to send the money, in case it might be more valuable: I also have a personal bank loan w/ ~$1300 left at an 11.95% APR, a car loan w/ $6169 left at 9.25% APR, and a personal family loan w/ $1000 left that I'm paying back (0% interest) at $100/month (maybe more now that I'm going to start getting paid more). I think I want to focus on paying towards my credit cards but if y'all think it might be better put towards one of these I'd be open to feedback in that area as well.  
  
  
  
**edit:** Totally agree with the comments here. I'll go ahead and put $1000 towards card 3. I was mainly confused as to whether paying one card off completely would be better for my credit score more than putting the same amount towards another. After a little research it looks like it doesn't matter which card the money goes towards, it will have the same effect, but paying card 3 will lower my total APR payments the most."

5wve23,5,2017-03-01,Help determining if [21/f] is interested in me [22/m] or being a wingman for her friend.,plsnojcj,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5wve23/help_determining_if_21f_is_interested_in_me_22m/,"Context, im an intern in japan in my early twenties. Girl 1 (with somekind of volunteer org) helped me out a ton with getting the internship and then getting settled. We do have a good friendly relationship. For example every few days she askes me how im doing, how work was, wished me a happy valentine (no chocolates though, but she lives 40min away and i dont know if that would still be expected if shes into you, its a japanese thing). I still dont really have a bunch of friends here so i asked her if she wanted to do something on the weekend and that was fine. We got some food saw a temple  but since i hadnt really planned anything else to do after the temple and we didnt know what to do i took the train home. Earlier i had told her i was interested in seeing a landmark a few hours away and she asked me if i wanted to go there next weekend with friends of her from the volunteer organisation. Let me just say here that i do think she is romantically interested in me but i am not. I was up for the trip and it was great. 

This is were Girl 2 comes into play. The first part of the trip Girl 2 sat next to the driver and we all talked a bit. It seems Girl2 is studying the same thing in uni as me, she has the same sport hobby as me, and spent part of her childhood in my country since her father is a diplomat. After around 10 min driving we stopped at a service station so some people could go to the bathroom. When we get back to the car Girl 2 doesnt go to the seat next to the driver but comes and sits next to me instead of Girl 1.

We drive on for a pretty long time and we get out do some stuff and come back to the car. Since i didnt really mind were i sat i went and sat in the middle. The middle happend to have a finicky seatbelt that we noticed earlier. Girl 2 literally took my hand and guided it while i was closing the seatbelt. I thought that was odd at that moment but didnt think much of it. On to the next stop, only maybe two relevant things happend there. First we came to a place that obviously was meant to take fotos with 2 people. First Girl 1 and unmentioned Girl 3 take a picture togheter and after that Girl 2 told me to pose for a picture with Girl 2. This is were i thought she might be wingmanning (girling?) for Girl1. It could also be that she didnt ask to be on the picture with me since it would be awkard to ask someone else to take the picture since she was taking all of them. It could also be that she just didnt think much of it. If girl1 is into me it would make sense that Girl2 would help her since they are friends. The one other thing that happend was that Girl2 invited me to try a sample of some sake that they were handing out togheter seeing as the others dont drink it. We got to the car and Girl2 still came and sat next to me. We talked some more about what kind of foods i liked in japan, i said a certain type of tea and then she said she liked that too, i said the name of a certain food and she said that she liked that too and the same thing happend for a few other things that day. 

 Here i started to wonder if she was actually into me since everything i said seemed to be responded with by her with ""i also love that"" (but in japanese). Now, on the way back she seemed to diliberatly let Girl1 enter the car first so she could sit next to me and we went on our merry way. When we stopped at another service station for food the next thing happened wich could be seen as a bit strange. We were with an uneven number of people and there werent enough chairs. So i take another table to add it to our row of tables and sit down there. Because its an uneven number of people and i sat down at the new table i should have no one in front of me. Girl 1 sat next to me but then girl 2 sat down in front of me instead of filling up the table in the usuall fashion.

On the wayback not a lot of stuff happened i got home and checked line (chat app). There was a group chat of us i saw girl 2 type that it was fun today to everyone and that she would upload pictures when she got home. I responded by saying i also thought it was fun and told her to be carefull on the way back wich she thanked me for. The next morning we all talked a bit more about something that happend the day before and in the evening i made another post in the group chat explaining why i mixed up 2 words. The english translation of the japanese word on jisho.org seemed to not really be a great translation. I talked a bit with girl2 about it. She said that japanese people usually dont use that word. I told her that it might be a region thing and she responded with maybe. Since i thought she wasnt into me i thought it would end here but she kept the conversation going and told me how she thought it was maybe a metafor. Then i gave my guess and she told me she thought i was probably right. 

In the end it somehow got to a food recommendation at the end of that short chat in the group chat. The next day i got the recommended food and wanted to talk to her about it. I thought i should add her direcly on line since it wouldnt really fit to constantly type in group chat and i was a bit nervous since i thought she hadnt added me. It seems like she actually did add me but it shows up as friend recommendations instead of invites. Anyways we talked a bit more about it for a short while and she corrected a mistake i made in my japanese. She also told me to tell her if it bothered me when she corrected my japanese. Seemingly implying that we would talk more. Now here i thought we had a good thing going on. The conversation linked to something that would happen the next day and sure enough i sent her a message about it the next day but no answer. The messages still arent read and its been sent at noon and now its  evening yet still no answer. I know some of you might tell me that its normal for someone to not respond to a line message after 8 hours but she is a female university student. She is has vacation and the day we went out togheter she was frequently instagramming fotos of us all, playing music etc. No way she just didnt see it. Now i get a message from girl 1 that hints at the subject i had been talking about with girl 2. I  honestly answered her and in the same way that i woudve answered girl 2. Now its possible that she got the subject from an earlier group convo but i think girl2 might have tried to winggirl her again.

Now going off of this information i concluded that girl2 might A) really be into me but feel guilty about hurting her friend girl1 if she is into me or B) she might actually not be interested in me and could just be acting polite to me. If B is the case i do wonder about the excesive hand touching and the coincidence of her seemingly liking everything i said i liked. 

Now how i plan on dealing with this is to simply not send anything else to Girl 2 until she brings up a new subject. If she eventually answers the message i sent today i might respond but not actively try to keep the conversation alive longer than that myself. If after that she broaches a new subject with me i do believe she might be interested in me but this approach might be to passive. Thoughts?"

Breed: Border collie/shepherd
Age: approx 13 years old
Sex/Neutered: Male, Neutered. 
Weight: Approx. 65lb
History: A recent bad bladder infection, treated successfully with antibiotics about a month and a half ago. No other medical issues aside from arthritis
Clinical signs: head tilt, disorientation, dizzyness, loss of muscle control, weakness, confusion. 
Duration: approx. 2 weeks. 
General location: Ontario, Canada. 


My dog Deuce is a border collie/shepherd. He's approx. 13 years old, mostly deaf and partially blind, with moderate arthritis. He lives with my family, and I live in another country. 

My parents came to visit me at home, and unfortunately while they were gone Deuce suffered some sort of event, and now appears to have neurological damage. My brother and sister were both home, so he went to the vet immediately, but my brother, who took him, basically has no idea what the vet said and so I am missing some details. He was very sure that Deuce would have to be euthanized and was focusing on that, basically. What he told us was that the dog ""has his wires crossed,"" and that the vet said it ""could very well be a stroke, but can't confirm that.""

I flew back with my parents because I have experience in animal medical care, as I was an intern at a wildlife rehab hospital for about a year. I'm taking the dog to the vet today, but I would like to know if there is anything that anyone can recommend to make him more comfortable and help in his rehabilitation. 

Some extra details:
- He definitely has the loss of motor function on his left side, though he is able to walk (with an obvious tilt to his left.)  it's been about two weeks, and he has gotten better over time, but his balance and coordination are still very off. 

- He has the characteristic head tilt, it's quite pronounced. 

- He is circling whenever he gets up, and is obsessed with going outside. He does not always eliminate when he goes out. We figure he can't really tell when he has to go or not. 

- The floors are all tile and hardwood, and he doesn't want to walk on them. We have put down rugs, and will be getting more rugs today, because he is refusing to walk on them (and has trouble when he tries anyways.) 

- He's basically been living in the back hallway. 

My sister has suggested this may be Old Dog Vestibular disease, from googling his symptoms. 

Any additional help or recommendations for helping him through recovery are greatly appreciated.

5wwes2,7,2017-03-01,Returning for a second bachelors,VanDerVaart,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/5wwes2/returning_for_a_second_bachelors/,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone had experience with completing a second Bachelors at GAtech?

I finished my BS in AE in May of 2016 and graduated with a 3.34 overall GPA. Due to out-of-state tuition and having to take on loans, I rushed through school in order to complete it in 4 years and never changed my major even though I had some reservations about it. I was never super-passionate about aerospace engineering, and never got an internship in the field, so now I find myself working in the automotive industry and I don't make fantastic money nor am I enamored by the people that I work with. My pay isn't great, my loans aren't getting paid off anytime soon, the work is boring and slow. Honestly, I miss the rigor and pace of learning that GAtech offered, and even though I felt resentful about the amount of work before, I was younger, less mature, less driven, and felt forced by parents to take that route of rushing through school so my mindset was just off. The people that I met at tech were always crazy driven, very intelligent, and just a high quality of people that I miss interacting with.

I'd like to return to GAtech and complete a second BS in CS. All my credits will still be available, right? Since I don't need to take any labs or gen eds, the second degree could probably be completed in 1.5-2 years (of course there would have to be considerations for pre-reqs)? How do admissions work for a second bachelors? Are they easier on you since you already attended the school and what kind of overall GPA looks good to them (is 3.3 good enough for admission back into the school)?

Just looking for any thoughts from people that have done the same. I'd just love to be back in that environment."
5wwozq,15,2017-03-01,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) [Slasher/Fantasy],cdown13,HorrorReviewed,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorReviewed/comments/5wwozq/a_nightmare_on_elm_street_3_dream_warriors_1987/,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is Wes Craven's return to the series which was much needed after the very lackluster Freddy's Revenge. Even though the movie isn't directed by Craven himself it feels much more like one of his movies, especially his more 90s style. 

Heather Langenkamp is also back as Nancy but now she is a intern at a psychiatric hospital and specializing in dream therapy. She right away builds a connection with Kristen who is played by Patricia Arquette in her debuting role. Kristen has a special ability to pull others into her dreams and they use this to become the dream warriors with a few other patients and battle Freddy within their dreams. 

This movie is much better than the one prior but this is also the start of Freddy and his one liners which inevitably become more a focus and more funny as the series goes. This is also the era where they are switching from practical effects and more CG is being added in. While the practical effects are all still well done, most of the CG does not hold up. 

As I mentioned, this is Patricia Arquette's first movie. I find it kind of interesting that Craven is responsible for two of the Arquette's bigger first roles. Also in this movie is Laurence Fishburne as Max. I'm a huge fan of the TV show Hannibal so I grew to really like Fishburne in that so it was great seeing him in a much earlier role and I really liked his character. Also it's hard not to mention Ken Sagoes as Kincaid. He's ""80's black guy tough"" but today it just seems kind of flamboyant and funny. 

Now you can't talk about Dream Warriors without Dokken! I must have rented this one a few times back in the day because I remembered it much more than 1 and 2 and the main thing I was remembering was a Dokken video at the start. I remember hating it as a kid but for some reason I didn't just fast forward through it and I was kinda looking forward to seeing that video again (I'm sure I can find it on YouTube) but it was still funny to hear Dokken through-out on stereos etc. 

I noticed on IMDb they have this movie listed as Action, Fantasy, Horror. I was surprised that horror was listed last but after watching the movie it's far from scary at all and doesn't really seem to do more than just rely on Freddy's character being scary enough. I just find it interesting that one of the biggest horror icon's and his third movie barely feels like a horror movie, come to think of it, the second didn't really either. I expect more comedy as the series goes but I'm really looking forward to New Nightmare since I remember enjoying it more than the others when it was first released. 

One thing I did notice during this movie is during parts of it Freddy's knifes are coming out of his fingers where as in the first movie it was his glove. I did notice in the second movie he didn't have the glove on either but then part way through this movie he was wearing the glove again. I may have missed something but can anyone explain why he has the glove sometimes and not others? Also it seemed like his character was dumbed down more and he wasn't on screen as much and he basically just had one-liners for lines. 

Overall this is a much better movie than 2 but a very different and less dark movie than the original. Reading through some of the trivia on IMDb and it does mention that Craven originally provided a much darker and violent script but it was rejected. I have a feeling I would have personally enjoyed that version of the movie more and the Freddy that was born from it, instead of the one-liner/funny Freddy.

I'll be watching the 4th soon since it seems to be a continuation of the story with these characters except a different actress is playing Kristen. Should be interesting to see what carries over between the two and how noticeable it is that it's a different girl playing Kristen.

If anyone else has a plan to rewatch the series I'd say just skip two and go from 1 to 3 since they are connected much more and I don't recall anything from part 2 being mentioned in this one.

I'm currently a Junior in an upper-ranked Canadian school for CS.  I'm in a co-op program and want to try applying to internships in computer graphics in some future work term (at least 7 months away).  I see plenty of postings aimed at undergrads (that I've applied to) but I haven't gotten responses.

Obviously this is pretty broad (since it's a wide field), but what do I need to get in?

Things I can think of from stalking LinkedIn would be:  General SWE experience, Intermediate/Advanced C++ (like metaprogramming and memory optimization), paper implementations, research experience and advanced math courses / good grades (since a lot of these people have masters).  

So far I've implemented some basic rendering stuff (a basic raytracer and game engine) and a few recent papers (a SIGGRAPH paper on CFD and some NPR techniques).  However nothing really looks all that impressive since it's all sort of unfinished (like the CFD solver impements the whole paper but just renders the fluid particles as a bunch of spheres).

My C++ is pretty mediocre and my grades are slightly above average but nothing special.  I've taken multivariable Calc, Linear Algebra and numerical ODE solving but don't know these subjects at advanced levels.  I also have a bit of work experience but it's all in web development.

It's obvious that I need to improve a lot of areas if I want to do this.  Does anyone in the industry or with similar experience have any advice?"

Hello r/depression. Long time lurker here.

Background information: I am an international student majoring Computer Science in the States. I have been having depression since a semester after starting gender transition, which leads me to repeatedly failing classes. I was supposed to be graduating this year and it is not going to happen anytime soon.

My family knows I am trans. And they also have high regard about my academic performance (which I did well before the depression begins). Despite being ambitious on coding and front-end development for some self-projects, it is too hard for me to accept or even believe that I went from there, down to the bottom of barrel on the edge of academic probation.

Maybe because of depression, I skipped too many classes of my 8am class and today the professor of that course declared I failed the course because of that. I tried my best to explain my situation to him but he remains his decision unchanged. I am still in shock because I thought things would get better this semester but it does not seem to be. I do not know how to tell that to my parents.

At this point of my fourth year at college, I feel like I am the leech and the burden to my family as they have been basically pouring money on me to afford the tuition. But I deferred and not even sure the definite time when I graduate. I cannot face myself. I think neither can my family.

When I first landed on the States, I was full of ambitions and passions that I finally get to study at college and eventually possibly get an internship or something. Now this dream just seem being further away from me. I feel guilty. I feel like I destroyed my future and opportunity. So many companies requires a CS degree to even apply and I just completely blew my chance up. And I basically destroyed my chance of escaping my country for a better environment for me as both a trans person and a tech person.

I just want to live better. Do I not deserve it?

I also have to live with shames because my younger brother and other people of similar age I know back in high school are graduating this year or have already graduated. Look at me, I am still a mess. The worst thing is the peers of my parents have been asking when will I be graduating. I feel shameful and guilty.

What am I going to do at this point? Go back to my country and live with my parents being jobless and no degree? Should I suck it up and continue my attempt of finishing the rest of my college life?

Maybe if I stop living, it would probably be better for everyone... :("

Today for instance, the other two interns aren't here, so I not only have to finish my work but I have to edit there's and add to it since they aren't here to do it themselves. I also just got an assignment that requires a TON of research and all of this is due tomorrow afternoon (inevitably I'll be working when I get home tonight). 

I'm really exhausted by all of this. I leave home around 6:30AM and get back between 7:30-8:00PM depending on the traffic. I don't even eat dinner most nights because I'm too tired to prepare anything.

5wx4v5,10,2017-03-01,No guidance at internship: what can I do?,AnotherIntern12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5wx4v5/no_guidance_at_internship_what_can_i_do/,"In case you want the gist of it first and avoid that wall of text:

**TL;DR**: My mentor is not actually mentoring me, and doesn't seem to want to either. She also does not understand I have no experience with hardware even after I told her that explicitly. I already met with her several times and each time it was like pulling teeth to get any information out of her. What else can I do? The management system here is strangely isolated and my mentor is the ONLY person on the team and is the only person who knows what is going on. And, of course, account is a throwaway.

First some context:
I am a CS student, who got lucky and got an internship at a big company in the Silicon Valley that deals primarily in low level firmware and hardware about a month back. Unfortunately, my experience is in software and not hardware, BUT I was hired with the promise of coding firmware and learning how to make a micro-controller communicate with peripherals via ANSI C. The end project is testing the timing of the communication with a severely under documented peripheral. 

My mentor, let's call her May, told me that I will learn a lot and I can ask her any questions I may have. Unfortunately, the management system here is very strange and isolated; my mentor is the ONLY person who is working on the project and the only one familiar with the toolchain. It doesn't help that her manager quit the week I joined, so I have no real higher up as of now.

About two weeks ago, I learned that I actually need to do some wiring and soldering on a board, when I have no prior experience. This was a bit of a shock. Up to that point, I was learning synchronous communications and how they work and how to activate them with software, not how to connect anything to the hardware. 

I ask May how to go about doing this and pointed out that I have no experience with hardware or wiring, so I may accidentally break something. She says that it should be easy to do and that I need to connect the three wires. I ask her which three wires and she looks at me as if I grew an extra head. She told me that I need a GND, a SCL and SDA wire to make sure everything is communicating correctly. I ask her how she knew this, and she told me that she learned it after 4 years in college. I ask her who I can ask besides her if I need hands on help, and she tells me to ask a person who is not on our team. 

Now to be fair, since she is the only person on the project, this means she has to do all the organization, meetings and documentation on the entire process. I understand that means she is really busy. But that doesn't help me out in any way, since I did ask that person and he didn't even know where to begin and waved me off.

Since then, I have been asking her more questions and she answers some of them and ignore others. I did meet with May several times, emphasizing that I knew nothing and had a lot of questions; the last meeting, she grew extremely frustrated. I had to ask basic questions, since she kept explaining everything very abstractly (ex. ""use board A to talk to board B""). Every time I asked her a question, she would stop me and tell me to be more specific. It got to the point where I had to ask very specific questions by pulling up a picture of our micro-controller board and point to every component and ask what does what. She told me that I was supposed to do everything on my own and that she is only giving me suggestions. 

She also mentioned that she didn't actually care if I had no measurable output or productivity. I don't know what that means for me, but it felt like we were on different pages. I can't seem to make it any clearer that I have no idea what I'm doing and I can't be more specific unless we spend time to work on the project 1 on 1. It also doesn't help she changes what she says or blames me outright for giving her the wrong information. I do try to research before I ask, but since everything is new to me, I can't sift the chaff from the wheat.

I feel lost and frustrated at this lack of guidance. Especially since she seems to assume I can learn what took her 4 years in a month. Because she keeps treating me as if I should know better. So my question is: what can I do? I plan on talking with her again, but besides gritting my teeth and doing the best I can, what can I do? I debated to just say screw it and do whatever I want on the job but I really do want to learn the low-level firmware programming.

Feel free to ask any questions, since I skipped over some details to avoid a (bigger) wall of text.

**Backstory Summary:** I wasted my first year as an engineering student and switched to CS. It took me two more years to break out of the Intro to CS classes while knocking down other pre-reqs and dealing with some setbacks caused by my freshman year screwups. 

After my internship in Summer 2016 I learned more than I ever did in school. Before that point all I'd learned was some C++ and I had to go to the communications dept. to find a C# class. But at my internship I learned: HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Node.js, Angular.js, HTTP, SQLite3, and I got to work on debugging an app in VScode along with the Chrome Devtools.

Needless to say, that internship blew my mind. I'd never known how to work on a web page before, much less a full application. And I had to pick things up fast since I'd come in knowing nothing.

**Current Situation:** I'm now in year 4 and taking higher level courses and not faring well, partly due to the fact that roughly half of the 9 classes that I NEED to graduate deal theory/proof related things, and the rest is all just building small command line programs that never get used again and are pretty irrelevant.

I've come to the conclusion that I want to be a Web/WebApp Developer and maybe gain some Mobile Dev experience down the road, and my school honestly doesn't offer the classes or employer connections to get me to a place like that.

After this semester I will have 4 years and about $64k student debt under my belt with 1 real webdev internship and 1-2 more in the coming summer and fall (I've locked down at least a summer internship, looking for a fall one because I'd rather work and gain money/experience than come back here). 

Transferring seems a bit pointless at this point since I've already invested so much time here... I'm also really discouraged by the fact that I don't know if my grades are good enough to get into another school with good financial aid. I've had a lot of difficulty here academically that might exclude me from other schools.

But dropping out and not having a degree doesn't seem like a good course of action either, so I've been trying to stick it out here just to graduate.

**TL;DR:** Basically I've got a pretty bad college track record academically and the courses my college offers are not helping me practice for the job I want but rather are wasting my time and frustrating me further. I don't think I can transfer easily, I'm on thin ice with my GPA/dropped classes history, and leaving school entirely now doesn't seem to be an option either.

Are there any good options for me here? And if I do end up having to go the transfer route, are there any good programs out there that would accept a mid/lower-grade student while offering real webdev/appdev classes?

What would be the best thing for me to do?

5wy1ee,3,2017-03-01,Find my sweet spot as an engineer and moulding my career - Interested in your perspectives.,MountPatagonia,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/5wy1ee/find_my_sweet_spot_as_an_engineer_and_moulding_my/,"I am looking for some career guidance from fellow engineers. Virtual career mentorship,I guess you could say. As somebody three years out of my undergraduate Civil Engineering education at a top academic university on the East Coast, I find myself at a cross in the road, and need to make some serious decisions about the trajectory of my career. 

A bit of a background:



Thus far, my short three years of work experience has been in both wastewater design, and facility construction management. When I graduated college, the thought of going into a design consulting role was repulsive to me. I had enough of the analysis, reports, theory, and I wanted to get my hands dirty and make use of my interpersonal communication skills and appreciation for craftsmanship- so I jumped into construction management.




 




I spent 2 years with a general contractor and was very successful, but thought that I really should be giving design consulting a try and pursue my engineering license and be a little more academic, and also to close the loop with some internship experience I had in the wastewater industry. 










My thoughts were that being a design engineer for a large company would result in a more ""balanced"" life, good steady pay and interesting work - less hectic and stressful than construction. That might be true, but I am discovering that the long planning cycles for wastewater projects and the tedium of being on a public works infrastructure project doing analysis, report writing and data management is just completely mind blowing to me.  I went from having a LOT of responsibility to feeling like a cog in a regulated, government controlled machine. The position just feels less ""exciting"", and I can tell that my development as a manager, business person is being stifled. My exposure, and overall usefulness just seems totally stomped on - completely the opposite of how I felt with a general contractor -making decisions, making deals, getting shit done day after day. 












Did I just jump into a bad position in engineering? Has anyone experienced better days moving from larger public works type projects to less regulated industries?  Am I being unrealistic with my romantic expectations of being a design engineer, and the tedium is just simply the reality of being an engineer?  I enjoyed my academic experience - some of the theory bored me for sure, but nothing even close to how boring it feels to operate so closely with a government agency. 





I am really close to jumping right back into the fire of construction management, and wanted to bounce some ideas with other engineers before making another big career change. My people skills feel like are being wasted sitting in a cubicle, communicating with nearly NOBODY for days and days. If you guys have any ideas for engineering opportunities that are a bit more ""dynamic"", hands on - smaller interesting projects, I am all ears.  I have thought going to work for a design build firm, structural forensics, building envelope consultant - but those ""Niche"" engineering industries seem difficult to identify. 










Any and all comments welcomed and
 appreciated.  I am totally open to a design role that grabs my interest, but pretty sure I want to be ""close"" to the construction, and not stuck in a research/planning/analysis/AutoCad role. I just plain old don't think i have it in me to sit alone, churning out this type of work - unless I have a revolutionary shift in my mindset...I need a more social job!!!






I am well aware of the ""negatives"" of working as a project manager in commercial construction. Hence, looking for creative alternatives before I leap into that inferno. 

Thanks everyone!!
  

TLDR
-Social guy
-Not enjoying planning, research, analysis, Heads down type engineering work as much as I did in school
-Is Construction management my only real option
-Creative opportunities that could fulfill my needs to be closer to the work and in a dynamic environment
-Time to go back for a graduate degree and re-evaluate my passions as an engineer? Take a break??"

Feel free to suggest anything you like, too. I'll at least give you feedback, and I am singularly difficult to offend.

Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box.

I applied to FB and Amazon and got relatively far into their pipeline over the course of winter break. Before then I'd scatter-shot applied to a ton of the bigger names in tech and start-ups-wise. I was kinda shocked to not get an offer from Amazon as I many of my peers got an offer. But no sweat.

Now I'm looking at other internships and trying to apply and a lot of places seem to be closed for this coming summer. Kinda nearing panic mode: at first I was mildly worried I might not get a ""good"" internship and now I'm concerned I might not get placed into any internship at all.

Advice for how to proceed?

     I'm a 23 year old computer science student at Portland State University.  I'm a senior level student with only 2 terms left until I can graduate.
Here is my dilemma: I have never had any real industry experience or internships BUT I have just been offered a 6-month full time C++ gig making about 25/hr.  This job would be with a company that's quite small.  I would have no real interest in working with them upon graduation.  Obviously, I would be delaying my graduation by 6 months by taking this contract, but I think it might be worth it as I could head out into industry afterwards with some solid experience under my belt.  On the other hand, if I could graduate first, then get a more lucrative job with better prestige upon graduation it might be better for me to decline this offer.
     I'm really confused about weather this would be a good option or not and would appreciate any insight anyone could provide.
Thanks!"

I've been trying this challenge on-and-off for 3 years, and for the first time I have a little story I wanna share with you.

During these 3 years, I've gone through long periods of too much time to waste, and I very rarely reached a mere 15-day streak, my longest being 28 days.

Now I'm at the end of my studies, I have an internship that keeps me busy, and as a new-year resolution, I've been going to the gym 4 to 6 times a week since early January.

Today is March 1st. I haven't PMO'd in February at all.

I just smashed my previous record.

I feel unstoppable.

This is the year where I change. I completely stopped sugary drinks, I eat a little better, I restarted playing piano, drawing, and a lot of stuff I used to love doing years ago.

I even had a crush on someone lately and worked up the courage to tell them, but sadly the feelings weren't mutual. Tough time, but still an experience and a new thing I can say I at least tried, and now I feel my self-confidence boosting.

I don't know how long this feeling (or this streak) will last, but I wanted to share this achievement with y'all. Just restarting sport has improved so many things in my life yet, now I hardly even think about PMO. If you wanna succeed, changing habits is indeed key.

Thank you for reading, and **stay determined** !

I'm a business student and I interned at a company for a while - after the internship ended they asked me to stay as a part-time employee. What I didn't realize, once I started the new role, was that a lot of the new position involved packing and shipping boxes (about one third of my time is spent shipping).  I was pretty unhappy about it because that's not what I was told I'd be doing prior to me starting the new position and it's not anywhere related to my major. I originally thought about quitting for a while but it pays well and I need the money. BUT, I've accepted a full-time offer at another company starting in May, so I'm planning to quit this job in April. 

However, I've been having a lot of issues with my lower back lately. I'm not sure if it's related to this job or not (I don't think it is honestly because my back has hurt even on weeks that I haven't picked up heavy stuff at work). I've been prescribed medicine for the pain but I'm waiting for my test results on something and I'm getting X-rays done of my spine next week to find out what the issue is. But regardless of whether it's caused my job, it's certainly not helping. I've had to bend down a ton just today to put stuff in boxes and just bending down is very painful. 

I'm planning on going home early today and getting some rest. but I don't know if I can continue doing this job in general if I have this much pain. 

Is it worth it to talk to my bosses about this and see how we can adjust my position, even though I'm only planning on being here for another 5 weeks? Or should  I just give them my two weeks notice at the beginning of next week and attempt to live off of my savings until May?

Tl;dr: my job requires me to pack and ship boxes but I've developed pain in my lower back. I'm planning on quitting in April regardless. Do I talk to my bosses about my health issues and see if my job responsibilities can be adjusted? Or  should I just quit a few weeks earlier than I'd planned? The biggest issue is that this I would like to keep working here through April as I need the money to pay for rent/bills/life"

# [Dating With Daughter by MrDotsGames](https://www.patreon.com/mrdotsgames)

## **Incest Warning**

## **Incomplete Game Warning**, **$5+ Patreon Wall Warning**

Dating With Daughter is *another* Renpy visual novel, this time(like many others), with an incest theme! Dating With Daughter uses a wholly first person perspective and 3D rendered imagery within the game. 3D imagery is hit or miss and so are Renpy games. Does this one hold up to scrutiny? Find out below!

**Gameplay:** 4 stars. I know I know, what could this game possibly do different than any others? And the short answer is nothing. It does absolutely nothing other games haven’t done before. The game combines choice making, friendship, love and corruption based on your actions towards the titular character(the daughter). The actual choice making makes sense(you can’t be a pervert from the start, she *will* hate you and you will get a game over). You have to slowly(not too slowly in the current version) build up your relationship and encroach on boundaries. The game is a simple pick what you do but the choices have immediately quantifiable consequences which is great. It allows you to “save scum” if you so choose or you can simply go through a singular “route” if you will and start over. 

**Art:** 3.5 stars. 3D art is generally awful. We all know that. This game has completely made the daughter look like she’s been through the ringer of plastic surgery with her body type. What this 3D rendering does *right* is the faces. They don’t fall too far into uncanny valley territory and as such makes actually looking at the images a somewhat enjoyable experience. Otherwise the 3D models have the typical “look” you’ll find in the game in regards to texture, except slightly better. I will commend the rendering on the attention to detail with close up shots of faces. It’s refreshing not to see entirely smooth matte skin on a 3D rendered model.

**Story:** 3 stars. The story is fairly light but it is present and it gives good context to why the father/daughter start having an odd relationship. There are hints here and there to a larger story but as of this version it isn’t completely fleshed out and as such can’t really be addressed. But with the way the game is going I can see some fairly interesting tracks coming to a head later on. But as of now the actual story provides good context to the situation and lays the groundwork going forward.

**Accessibility:** 5 stars. It’s a Renpy game. Hard to fuck that up but the game goes to extra lengths to help you figure out the best way to approach the relationship as new tiers and days are achieved. You’ll quickly learn what’s acceptable and what is not with how long you’ve known your daughter. 

**H Opinion:** There isn’t much in regards to *blatant* sex scenes but there are a few masturbation scenes, groping and nudity and those are all well done and nice to look at. Though it does make you feel a little let down that there isn’t more but the slow build will make the actual release of sex scenes all the better.

**Overall:** 4 stars. This is a fun Renpy game that features a fairly popular theme(Incest) with decent 3D renders. It features a nice system of love, friendship and corruption that gives instant gratification to the choices you make. While not super long currently, you will have fun playing this game and “dating with daughter”.

# [Corrupting the Intern](https://www.patreon.com/posts/corrupting-0-7-7716817) by [LambdaDude](https://www.patreon.com/lambdadude)

And next up in this impromptu Renpy extravaganza is Corrupting the Intern. If you couldn’t tell by the name this is another trainer game, except it has 3D renders as opposed to drawn. Obviously you’re corrupting the new intern at your new job. What else do you need to know? Nothing. Nothing at all. Just roll with it.

**Gameplay:** 3 stars. This is simply the basic trainer game dynamic done well. There’s really no difference to any other trainer games in methodology. You’ve got favors and orders and training. All of these are done to make your corruption target sluttier and more willing to do things. Of course she earns the money for you as well. Overall it’s everything we’ve seen before but it doesn’t suck at what it’s doing. You can order money and interact with one other woman in game. You can also pick a few different wardrobe options(a few of which are “story” driven). This is a basic Trainer game and if you liked those you’ll like this one as long as you aren’t bored of that style. 

**Art:** 4 stars. Holy 3D renders Batman! These 3D renders are really really good, especially for a Renpy game. I guess it helps that there are only a few that the developer needed to make so there could be more focus on making them look good. There’s no uncanny valley feeling looking at these renders so it doesn’t take you out of the moment at all. If there’s one complaint I have it’s that the “cum” looks pretty meh. Odd complaint, I know but it threw me off. 

**Story:** HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WE DON’T NEED NO FUCKIN STORY. There’s a few lines of actual story but it’s not important at all so I won’t rate this category.


**Accessibility:** 5 stars. It’s a Renpy Trainer Game. You know what’s up. I know what’s up. There’s color coordination for the different favors you can ask. You know what you need to do and how you need to do it at all times. You’re gonna jump in clicking without a care.

**H opinion:** The sex scenes are partially animated and the models all look very well done. There’s no reason you won’t enjoy these sex scenes unless(like me) the cum throws you off a bit(it looks like white paint). In any event the scenes are fun and they progress to be more and more lewd so you’re treated to rewards for going through a click fest.

**Overall:** 3.75 stars. Hey, there’s good 3D models and you know the game. The downside is there’s no ambition to differentiate it from every other trainer game out there. But if you do enjoy trainer games as I do you’ll have a fun time with this game while it lasts.

# [Fairy Tale by Masquerade](https://www.patreon.com/Masquerade)

## **Incomplete Game Warning**

Fairy Tale is a game about….fairy tales. There’s lots of different Disney characters and original characters mixed together to tell a story that includes sex. It really, truly seems like the creator is trying to make a medieval intrigue story with the characters while making light reference to their actual stories and abilities. Does it work well? How’s the Rule34? Find out below!

**Gameplay:** 3 stars. The third Renpy game of the day. And it’s fairly uninspired as far as Renpy games go. Sure there’s stats and gold but it doesn’t feel well implemented. Mind you the game isn’t done yet but nothing seems to be truly important in the game and that makes the mechanics suffer. It seems the developer wants the story to have the main focus and for that the actual game part of the game suffers.

**Art:** 4.5 stars. The characters that do have art are simply a pleasure to look at. The Rule34 characters are easily recognizable with some changes to their proportions(the developers seem to really like big tits). Otherwise the characters are drawn very well and seem like they would fit into a Disney world. The original characters have a different feel to them but it’s not too drastic to where it would take you out of the game for more than a second as the difference is easily ignore-able.  

**Story:** 2 stars. I’ll come right out and say it. I really, really wanted to enjoy the story that was in this game but I simply could not get into it. There are a lot of interesting ideas but they don’t come together and mesh in such a way that it feels fun to read. The story threads are there and they do serve to move the plot forward but too many times does the game simply skip things that would be better served as fleshed out and it focuses on things that don’t particularly need focus. The game does away with characters and you’re not allowed much of any emotional investment to actually care about them when they do leave the story. It becomes a *meh* feeling. The tension is slightly there occasionally but for the most part it just kind of flops.

**Accessibility:** 5 stars. Every game in this review set has gotten 5 stars for this category because it’s a Renpy game and it’s kind of hard *not* to know what you’re doing or what’s going on. Some things you have to figure out on your own but nothing completely off the wall is coming your way with this game.

**H opinion:** Uninspired. That’s the best way to describe the sex scenes. They’re short and seem to be tacked on for no reason. The descriptions are *meh*, they’re few and far between and are only saved by the art. 

**Overall:** 3.6 stars. This game’s saving grace is the artwork but everything else withing the game needs a lot of work. The story is lacking and the gameplay is uninspired. The “adult” content in the game isn’t really there for the most part and is boring. The game is pretty to look at but that can’t drag this title up from mediocrity. "

The tension is slightly there occasionally but for the most part it just kind of flops.

**Accessibility:** 5 stars. Every game in this review set has gotten 5 stars for this category because it’s a Renpy game and it’s kind of hard *not* to know what you’re doing or what’s going on. Some things you have to figure out on your own but nothing completely off the wall is coming your way with this game.

**H opinion:** Uninspired. That’s the best way to describe the sex scenes. They’re short and seem to be tacked on for no reason. The descriptions are *meh*, they’re few and far between and are only saved by the art. 

**Overall:** 3.6 stars. This game’s saving grace is the artwork but everything else withing the game needs a lot of work. The story is lacking and the gameplay is uninspired. The “adult” content in the game isn’t really there for the most part and is boring. The game is pretty to look at but that can’t drag this title up from mediocrity. "

I shotgunned my application out to about &gt;10 positions at IBM. I was asked to do the IPAT and I did so about a week ago. Since then, 9 different positions that I applied to at IBM also asked for my IPAT results. 


I'm wondering if getting asked to do the IPAT and passing it guarantees you an interview? I'm only wondering since I just got another internship offer, albeit at a smaller company and in a role I'm not too keen on. Would be nice to know my chances of getting an interview/internship offer at IBM and how long it would take.


I tried reaching out to my recruiter, but couldn't find an email on the IBM website.


Thanks!"

5wzcu0,58,2017-03-01,(Spoilers Extended) Unkind Musings on the Meereenese Knot and Where We are Now,GideonWainright,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5wzcu0/spoilers_extended_unkind_musings_on_the/,"We have no real insight as to what is going on with GRRM's writing progress.   

Here's what we do know.  GRRM thought he was going to be able to finish up by October, 2015 in May, 2015.  

&gt;My publishers and I have been cognizant of these concerns, of course. We discussed some of them last spring, as the fifth season of the HBO series was winding down, and came up with a plan. We all wanted book six of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE to come out before season six of the HBO show aired. Assuming the show would return in early April, that meant THE WINDS OF WINTER had to be published before the end of March, at the latest. For that to happen, my publishers told me, they would need the completed manuscript before the end of October. That seemed very do-able to me... in May. So there was the first deadline: Halloween. 

(http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html)

We also know by July, 2015, however, that GRRM was feeling [""behind on everything""](http://grrm.livejournal.com/433476.html).  

Yet, it was not until August, 2015 that GRRM had decided to throw in the towel and tell his publishers, nope I'm not going to finish by October, 2015. 

&gt;Unfortunately, the writing did not go as fast or as well as I would have liked. You can blame my travels or my blog posts or the distractions of other projects and the Cocteau and whatever, but maybe all that had an impact... you can blame my age, and maybe that had an impact too...but if truth be told, sometimes the writing goes well and sometimes it doesn't, and that was true for me even when I was in my 20s. And as spring turned to summer, I was having more bad days than good ones. Around about August, I had to face facts: I was not going to be done by Halloween. I cannot tell you how deeply that realization depressed me. 

The publishers of course moved the goal posts, as publishing Book 6 before Season 6 (where both Season 5 and Book 5 had ended on a Jon-is-dead cliffhanger) while GOT was at peak popularity meant all involved would get massive piles of money.  If they needed to blood sacrifice a few interns to make favorable publishing winds, so be it.  So December 31, 2015 was given as the new deadline.  GRRM's thought process in August, 2015 was still pretty positive:

&gt;If I could deliver WINDS OF WINTER by the end of the year, they told me, they could still get it our before the end of March.

&gt;I was immensely relieved. I had two whole extra months! I could make that, certainly. August was an insane month, too much travel, too many other obligations... but I'd have September, October, and now November and December as well. Once again I was confident I could do it.

&gt;Here it is, the first of January. The book is not done, not delivered.

(http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html)

That was January 1, 2016.  Now, it's March, 2017.  From May, 2015 to March, 2017, we're about **1 year and 9 months.**  

To put this in context, the first known reference to the Meereenese Knot was [June 22, 2009](http://grrm.livejournal.com/92848.html) as analyzed by GRRM-whisperer (or is GRRM's handle?!?!? ;-D) /u/BryndenBFish [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2pp2m8/spoilers_all_an_analysis_exploration_of_grrms/).  Now, we don't know exactly when the Meereenese knot became a problem and /u/BryndenBFish makes an excellent argument that the Knot was a problem since aFfC publication.  But we know that it was **the** problem holding up completing the work in June 22, 2009 and he didn't feel like he made enough headway on the problem to express confidence until [February 26, 2010](http://grrm.livejournal.com/135972.html) and finally declare victory on [August 17, 2010](http://grrm.livejournal.com/171174.html).  

My best guess is that it took **around one year, 1 month** for GRRM to ""resolve"" the infamous Meereenese Knot once he brought it up, keeping in mind that during the interim was making frequent references to krakens and ""shoveling Snow"" (i.e. working on the Greyjoys and the Jon Snow chapters) during the interim, so it wasn't like he was just banging his head on the Meereenese Knot and nothing else.  Instead, it was just the hardest task on a perhaps lengthy ""to-do"" list.  

Work seemed to progress pretty rapidly after that, as GRRM was feeling very confident in [March 3, 2011](http://grrm.livejournal.com/198122.html) and bragged [""KONG"" in March 27, 2011](http://grrm.livejournal.com/204875.html) and declared that Kong was slayed in [April 27, 2011](http://grrm.livejournal.com/212603.html).  So about **six months** from dispatching the ""Meereenese Knot"" to dropping pretty clear hints that he was about done.  

So what does this tell us?  Three things.  We already knew from aSoS onwards that GRRM is atrocious at estimating how long it will take him to write anything.  Which is completely understandable, all writers can be overly optimistic whether they are writing a contribution to the American Cannon or a mid-term essay and find themselves rushing at 3am in the morning.   But we know from the above that GRRM is pretty good at knowing when he's just about to finish (say within a month).  Second, we know that the last time GRRM identified a specific roadblock in his writing process it took him approximately around one year, 1 month to resolve it and get back to writing productively.  Third, we know that it took him from identifying the roadblock to reaching the ""almost done, really, I'm almost done guys!"" of around **1 year and 9 months.**  

Unfortunately we're at that marker at around 1 year and 9 months.  And unlike the past delay, GRRM hasn't given us an infamous problem that is holding up the writing.  His original explanation was that [deadlines somehow screw up the process](http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html):

&gt;Look, I have always had problems with deadlines. For whatever reason, I don't respond well to them. Back in November, when I returned to Northwestern to accept my Alumni Award, I told the Medill students that was why I started writing fiction instead of getting a job on a newspaper. I knew even then that daily deadlines would kill me. That was a joke, of course... but there was truth in it too. I wrote my first novel, DYING OF THE LIGHT, without a contract and without a deadline. No one even knew I was writing a novel until I sent the completed book to Kirby to sell. I wrote FEVRE DREAM the same way. I wrote THE ARMAGEDDON RAG the same way. No contracts, no deadlines, no one waiting. Write at my own pace and deliver when I'm done. That's really how I am most comfortable, even now.

But that has not been an issue since January 1, 2016. He's been in his ""comfort"" zone for **1 year and 2 months.**  So I don't think it's deadlines that can be blamed for where we are now.  

Because of the lack of a major update since January 1, 2016, we're left to speculate what has been the reason for the delay in finishing.  The lack of another update is probably that GRRM decided to never again give an update until he hit that magical 1-month out period.  That's fine, but it doesn't really explain the *reason* for the delay.  So, in the absence of confirmation from the author, I present some scenarios that people won't want to read but may need to hear.  

First, it could be that he has another ""Meereenese Knot"" problem but it hasn't reached the point where he even feels comfortable posting about the issue.  That's not great news, since if as /u/BryndenBFish speculates the Meereenese knot was around since aFfC, then we are looking at potentially *years* to cut this mysterious knot.  But we can't really speculate much more than that, because it's as possible that he had a new knot, cut the knot, and is now back to productive writing too, but he's not going to tell us anything until he slays that Kong.

Second, it could be that this is the ""normal"".  The Meereenese Knot was not a one-off but just part of the writing process that got overblown by an overanalyzing community.  Instead, the real pattern is that each book takes longer and longer to write because GRRM is aging like all of us do and as we age past our peak, we get a little bit slower each day at what we're good at.  Being human sucks like that.  That could be better news, because if we say aFfC took 5 years to write and aDwD took 6 years to write, then that means tWoW will take 7 years to write and we'll get a book in 2018.  However, if we look at aFfC and aDwD as one big book (and remember that GRRM though he only needed around a year to write aDwD), and he's slowing down, we really should start preparing ourselves to wait until 2021-2022, or applying the time period when he thought he was almost being done with *FeastDance* to being done with *FeastDance* to the time period of when he thought he was almost done with tWoW.    

Finally, it could be that we're looking at something common with all writers.  GRRM could have been dealing with cases of [writer's block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block) ever since aSoS.  Despite the best of authors suffering from this illness, it's not something any professional author likes admitting.  When I read GRRM's January 1, 2016, it practically screams at me ""writer's block"" as you get a bad mixture of stress, depression, and self-blame.  Notably, any attempts by the community to ""prod"" GRRM faster only serves to add to GRRM's stress and may prolong said writer's block.  **Instead, the best thing to do is leave the guy fucking alone**.  If he needs to work on other stuff or rant and rave about the Jets or the Hugos, so be it.  A writer has to get to his happy place to become productive and no one can ""help"" or ""make"" him get there.  It's a psychological issue, and it basically randomizes writing pace expectations.  

Where I think some well-meaning members of our community, myself included, erred was believing that we could study the past to figure out a basis for providing optimistic estimates on publication of GRRM's future work.  This built up a level of expectation, and now, like with the past experiences of aFfC and aDwD, this expectation has led to bitterness.  Bitterness in turn leads to stress finding it's way to GRRM, which probably increases the delays.  I hope that this pessimistic post has helped to resolve the karmic balance.  

Because, honestly, history can be fudged around to really say whatever you want it to say.  It could predict GRRM finishing in 2015 (he's going back to his past writing speed and the Meereenese Knot was a one-off!), 2016 (he wants those fat stacks and that means he will beat Season 6!), and 2017 (my statistical analysis predicts based on my estimated page-count that GRRM will definitely hit this date, even though GRRM has not provided me said data).

Instead, the best thing for all involved is to find better outlets for our current Long Wait.  I recommend writing horribly long multi-part essays based on flimsy ""evidence"" and a ton of crazy connections, like say making up a magical system out of maester musings and applying it to predict the most unpredictable character, Euron.  Or playing Total War or Civ, which are legendary for devouring happy lives and marriages.  

I hope that by posting this bit of pessimism, I will have generated some positive karma and we'll get some one-month out style announcements.  If so, you're welcome.  But I also hope that the stock market will keep on going up, up, up.  Yet, I invite you to check out this [graph](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/).  "

His plan, rather than to disperse their books to surrounding agents, is to hire young professionals (such as myself possibly) to essentially train under them for 6-12 months and ultimately inherit their book of business upon retirement. To the inexperienced (me) this sounds like an incredible opportunity to jump start my career.

A little background, I am currently working in digital marketing for a small business. I had no intent of leaving this job prior to being approached about this opportunity. I am newly married, planning on starting a family soon. The earning potential sounds incredible (the average book for these retiring agents is valued around a quarter of a million dollars). I have a good deal of sales/marketing experience and some experience running a business with employees (college painting internship).

I've spoken with some existing agency owners and gotten their insights on the matter, but I want to throw it to you, r/sales, to tell me why I should or shouldn't go down this path.

My biggest reservation is that I don't know what I don't know. What should I be concerned about? 

What questions should I be asking to determine if this is the path I should go down? 

What advice can you give?

I'll cut it there, because I am starting to ramble, but any and all responses would be greatly appreciated!"

5wzg6p,1,2017-03-01,How to Navigate the First Few Months Out of Undergrad?,Ruple,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5wzg6p/how_to_navigate_the_first_few_months_out_of/,"**TL;DR** 

* Graduating senior.
* No offers [or even interviews] in the fields I want [yet], but plenty of people willing / trying to give me opportunities in fields I'm less interested in.
* Not sure how I should proceed with respect to these opportunities I'm not interested in. Do I nab a job I don't want to so I can pay the bills then bounce the minute something better comes along even if it's &lt;6 months after I start? Can I accept one offer then start interviewing for a different position 2 weeks later? Or even accept one offer from Company A, get my ~dream offer~ from Company B the next day, then call Company A back to say ""whoops, never mind all that!""

--------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! I'm going to be graduating from a local uni in the Midwestern US with an undergrad degree in Computer Engineering in May, and I don't have any offers yet - which is (most likely) due to the following:

* **I started applying during my last semester.** As in 2 or 3 weeks ago I started sending out applications. I'd been specifically advised not wait so long many times in the past, but I was trying to hold off until I'd fixed my second bullet...
* **My GPA is below a 3.0.** It's a 2.7ish at the moment. I'm currently retaking one of the courses that's dragging it down and doing pretty well, and I should be retroactively assigned a high B / an A in Senior Design I when I finish Senior Design II at the end of this semester (so I should be graduating just a smidgen past a 3.0). 
* **I've ruled-out moving to the major tech hubs in California like Santa Clara as an option.** The Rent is Too Damn High. 

That being said, I'm not worried about being jobless for ages on end after I graduate. I've got over 3 years of intern experience under my belt, a good number of related extracurricular activities and projects through IEEE at my school, and several friends in the area at a few different companies have come forward and told me they're willing to refer me to their employers. The problem? I'm not interested in the positions people want me to interview for (Software Engineering, PLCs, DevOps, a few Salesforce.com Admin / Developer gigs). Additionally, I don't want to stay in my city much longer.

What I'm really interested in is doing more work with stuff like embedded systems or firmware or ASICs  / FPGA prototyping, but there are very few of those types of positions in my area (practically none in firmware and ASICs) which is why I'd rather move somewhere like Atlanta, the Seattle area, the Portland area, or [god forbid] the Austin area. 

Now, if my friends' experiences are any indication of how things will / could go for me, it's entirely possible that I could get an interview and have an offer [or multiple offers] by the mid~late April. I'm thinking I might just cave and interview for one of the gigs they're trying to get me in on, but I don't want to accept an offer at Company A only to get a call from Company B that they're starting their interview process for my ~dream job~ in 2 weeks *(in a career orientation class I took years ago they stressed that going to a different gig after accepting an offer was a no-no and burned bridges)*.

How should I navigate these next few months? I hope this is enough info [and it's not too confusing], but, please, tell me if I need to expand on anything! 

I've gotta run to class for now, but I'll check the replies and clarify anything when I get back!"

I just finished most of my core upper div classes (ones all EE majors have to take) and am about to start on my depth classes (computer system and design). 

I am really scared that even if I graduate, I wouldn't find a job or have the necessary skills because right now my GPA is shit and I don't think I have any skills that will be useful in the workplace. I haven't made anything (idk where to start, everything costs money). I havent had any internships (they want high grades, i have low grades and low confidence that they will want me). I keep ending up getting these IT jobs that anyone can do imo. 

I would like to be a Computer Engineer, but I've beein in this spiral of depression since my grades are so shit and I have to take a 5th year, and I still don't have any skills that companies would want, even for internships. 

What do i do? Its too late to switch majors, and I think this is where I want to be. Im having a crisis due to my future looking so shitty. I heard the degree will get you the job and so many people say not to worry, but I am worrying. Everyone who talks to me has/had good grades.

5wzn0p,1,2017-03-01,I'm worried that history will repeat for me,maske0,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5wzn0p/im_worried_that_history_will_repeat_for_me/,"I was not accepted into the program of study I was initially going for at my first University. You had to apply to get accepted into the major, and as part of the application it was required that you had three references that each wrote you a letter of recommendation. I had three people who agreed to write letters for me, but only two of them gave me the letters by the deadline I set. I tried on multiple occasions to contact the person who didn’t write me one, but they never responded. By then, it was too late to get another person to write me a letter of recommendation. I submitted the application anyway in hopes that they still might consider me as a candidate, but I was rejected almost instantly due to “missing application materials.” While I was pissed at the one person who never wrote me the letter of recommendation that they agreed to write, I mostly blamed myself. 

That failure caused me to become severely depressed. I lost a lot of weight from not eating (which I eventually gained back and then some further down the line), I skipped classes because getting out of bed felt too difficult, I sat in bed browsing my computer all day, I couldn’t enjoy drawing or playing video games anymore, my personal hygiene declined because I didn’t care about myself anymore, I avoided speaking to any of my suitemates out of embarrassment (one was part of the same program and was accepted while the others knew about the process), and I considered taking my own life on a daily basis. I felt like a complete failure. I was so embarrassed about being rejected from the program and afraid of what my parents would think that I didn’t tell them about it for months. During that time, all the above just got worse and worse. 

When I did finally tell my parents about being rejected from the program and the depression I’d been going through, they were very supportive of me. They told me that it wasn’t my fault, and no matter what happened, they would always care for and support me. I thought I was all alone in my misery, but having my parents acknowledge my depression and show concern for my emotions was something that I hadn’t felt since when I was really young. It made me realize how much they care about me and how much I really love them. On that day, I promised myself that I would never take my own life since leaving my amazing family behind to deal with my problems would be the most selfish and inconsiderate thing I could do to them.  

Since then, I chose a new career path that was better suited for me (the one I had been going for required a lot of direct contact with patients, which I’ve come to realize isn’t really for me). I decided that I wouldn’t go back to the same University that I had been going to. Most of my memories there were not good. Other than the application fiasco, I didn’t really have anyone that I would call a close friend. I felt all alone and like I didn’t really belong there. So, I decided on a fresh start in a new major at a different University. 

Before starting at my current University, I attended a local college and took classes during the summer and fall that would transfer into my new major. I worked part-time at a crappy retail job to save up money. I visited my physician to talk about my depression and anxiety problems. Around mid-November, I realized my eating habits were shit and that I’ve been making excuses my whole life as to why I was overweight. I changed my entire eating habits and started working out 3-4 times a week at my local gym. I’ve made a lot of progress in my weight loss journey, going from 175 to 145 currently (135 is my goal but I’ve got a long way to go regarding building muscle definition). I’ve done all these things and made so much progress in bettering myself, but I’m afraid history is going to repeat itself for me. 

Today I had an interview to get accepted into my new major at the new University I transferred to. For the major that I’m applying for, the final year is an internship at an area hospital while still taking classes, which is similar to the program of study I had been going for at my old University. However, this the process is a little more complex. You apply for the major in the spring and must complete an interview in front of a panel of faculty from the University and workers from area hospitals. 

Well I’ve been very anxious and nervous about this interview for quite a while, but this last week was especially bad. I do have anti-anxiety medication that I take for severe situations, which I took at night in the days leading up to the interview so I could actually sleep. I took some this morning before the interview, but it didn’t seem to help much. 

Before starting the interview, they had me sit in the hall outside the room. My nerves got to me and I was tearing up already. A man came outside into the hall to get me and saw that I wasn’t looking so great, so he got me some water and gave me time to compose myself a little bit. I did alright and managed to hold myself together in the interview at first, but about midway through I just broke down. I explained to them that I was very anxious since the interview is so important for getting accepted into the major. The group of people consoled me and said that it was okay to be nervous, and then I did my best to continue the interview as normal. 

I feel embarrassed that my emotions got the better of me. I’m afraid that because of my lack of composure I will not be accepted into the program. I probably looked so unstable to those people, even though I manage my anxiety pretty well on most days. Even after all I’ve done to improve myself, I still feel like a failure. 

My biggest fear is that I won’t get accepted, just like last time, and then I’ll go through the same downfall and depression again. Only this time, I’m not sure I’ll be able make it out ok.

So, here is my situation: I’m currently a managing editor with a magazine company. I have several years of communications experience. However, as you can imagine, market conditions have caused low, stagnant wages. I make well for the industry, but I’m in Los Angeles, and while I could move elsewhere for lower living costs, that is a subsequent cut in pay too. With those considerations, I’m working toward a career shift to something else I enjoy: Information Technology

So, here is my background: IT-focused high school, help desk for two internships, as well as for CompUSA (RIP), and low-voltage wiring over a summer. Problem is that was almost 10 years ago, and my time since has been spent in the communications field. Any interaction with tech has basic enthusiast stuff. I’m currently enrolled for a second BS degree online and will finish middle of 2018. I’m planning to get my Sec+ cert next month, with A+, NET+, and CCNA in the months following.

My W-I-P resume: http://imgur.com/a/no7KT

Now, here is the kicker: My wife and I are expecting in September of this year. Now, it is still an option to stay with my current position. I do enjoy it, but if at all possible, I’m aiming to transition to something entry level in the IT field. I figure it is best to do now rather than with a newborn.

I have been lurking in this subreddit for a while, and I do feel it is possible -- yet daunting and steep -- goal to accomplish. What I am looking for is any qualified advice for my specific situation. Am I crazy? Am I even somewhat realistic? What positions would be best to look for? What can I do to compensate for my lack of recent professional experience? Journalists suck?

A few thoughts:

* I have thought about technical writing, but everything seems to be requiring 2-3 years of tech writing in that specific field. Am I looking at it wrong?
* For experience, I’m planning on (self-taught) setting up a virtual test network with MS Server 2016 to act as an active directory domain/DNS/DHCP server with a couple other virtual clients. I figure this would give me basic experience setting up and configuring an MS Server, as well as deployment.
* I am also planning on (self-taught) building a custom physical server running Server 2016 to run as an SMB NAS for cloud storage (with OwnCloud), Time Machine backups, and Windows backups. It would be using a RAID setup. I figure this would give me hardware and software server experience. (Budget ~$600)

Sorry for the long post. I am learning as I’m going here, so I apologize if I am completely off base."
5wzuxv,9,2017-03-01,"Is the lack of technical interview questions a ""red flag"" for a internship?",coopthrowaw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5wzuxv/is_the_lack_of_technical_interview_questions_a/,"I'm a first-year Software Engineering student applying to my first CS internship.  I've gotten interviews from a couple of small companies for fullstack/web dev jobs and am expecting an offer from at least one.  However, none of the job interviews have involved any technical questions; only questions about my side projects and experience with X technology/whatever.

The jobs themselves are in downtown Toronto/Waterloo in very small teams, which seems pretty great.  However, I'm worried that my lack of experience in technical interviews is going to be a problem later down the road and wonder what the lack of technical questions could signify about the quality of work I'd be doing in that position.

I know that the problem might seem a bit trivial but everyone I know who are applying to tech internships are getting heavily technical interviews and it feels a bit strange that I haven't encountered any.  Should I be worried?  I can still continue with the application cycle, but at this point it'll be a bit risky.

Thanks!"

The purpose of this conference is to introduce female high school students to the great diversity of post-secondary opportunities in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in order to support the developing passion of the students interested in these fields. 

This year, there is a very exciting agenda including an opening speech from the Dean of Science, chemistry experiments in their state-of-the-art first year labs, lunch with first year students, mock lectures given by Western’s very own professors, and an engaging talk from Dr. Brad Bass, Nobel peace Prize Winner. 

In addition, students will have the opportunity to learn about potential career paths in STEM fields, such as medicine and research, and learn more about the incredible opportunities that are available to Western Undergraduate Students such as exchanges and internships. 

STEM Camp along with the Women in Science organization believes this event would greatly enrich students’ future educational pursuits and provide an exciting opportunity to learn more about Western.

The conference will run from 9:00am to 4:30pm at Western University located at 1151 Richmond Street in London, Ontario.

Spaces are limited and the last day to register is March 17!

This is my first time posting on this reddit so bear with me. I am a Junior currently triple majoring in Computer Science, Math, and Data Analytics. I really want to be a Data Scientist because the filed is very fascinating and I have done some work in the space (I have done kaggle competitions, personal projects, and internships). However, I really enjoy Computer Science research (after researching with one of my professors) and I would love to contribute to the safety of computer systems. I am particularly torn because I don't necessarily know what I want to do. Should I work as a Data Scientist at first (provided I get a job) and then do my PhD? Should I get my masters in Data Science or Computer Science right after undergrad or should I work first and then go back to school. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I was offered one that I sought out, but there were a few weird feelings I got from them, and some misgivings that were shared with my academic advisory/professor. I have a limited amount of time to accept or deny it. I am also in application for an internship that would be very convenient (two blocks from an apartment my parents own) in my home state. However I won't be able to even schedule an interview until a week and a half from now, and I would competing with others, definitely two of my classmates. This one is at a renowned institution (sorry I don't feel comfortable giving too much away) that seems like an amazing experience. 

However, the other internship looks good too. They've had previous interns, seem like interesting, cool people from their website and social media, and have similar career interests that I do. But it's far away in a more expensive city, and I've had those misgivings that I don't know what to do with. 

If I tell them no, I'm putting all of my bets on the other internship that I haven't even interviewed for. If I say yes, I COULD be turning down a great opportunity that would also make sense financially. But I could also be picking up on something that would negatively affect the rest of my internship, and I would be stuck thousands of miles from my home state.

At this point I'm waiting for the far away internship to get back to me, when I asked for more time they said that was fine, but didn't give me a specific end date. I could ask for an end date to take into account the second internship, but then I feel bad for making them wait what could be a month for something that could be an inevitable no, and even then I still feel apprehension for say yes!!

Thinking ahead about next year, where I am looking to get a job at a large company, does it matter which stack I choose to use this summer? Since this is my first internship, I am guessing that I will be forced to become somewhat proficient at it, perhaps as proficient as I am at my best language (Java)."

I just want to ask what my health insurance options are. I'll be 26 in a few days and currently living with my abusive mom. I have no job but I'm a sophomore currently taking a 2nd degree in Computer Science. Today, while my mother was doing her taxes, she got angry and insulted me and she may be kicking me out of the house very soon because she doesn't want to pay for the uninsured penalty. My only source of income is my student loans and I can't look for a job right now because I'm focusing on my grades and I don't want them to drop.

5x0ln8,5,2017-03-01,Advice for someone looking into IT?,the_grim_11,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/5x0ln8/advice_for_someone_looking_into_it/,"I'm 18 years old and finishing my senior year of high school. We have a thing called senior project where every senior has to find a mentor and shadow their career/business and learn something new. My friends dad is a IT manager at a NBA basketball arena(don't want to name which one to protect his identity) and I got to spend the day at the arena and follow him throughout the day and learn what he does. Prior to this i, I wanted to take time off of school and work. But going that one day and shadowing him really turned a perspective for me. Since then, I installed windows server 2016 on a spare hard drive in my computer and have been messing with it since. Such as learning group policies and active directory. However, the problem is that I hate school and hate learning. Which makes it difficult to get a degree. I've been looking at online school for a degree in IT management and looking at my options there. I've also considered asking my mentor if there would be a way where I could basically do an internship (paid or not, I think it would be really cool thing to do) and be able to learn first had how to run a system like the one used in the arena. Any thoughts on my action plan? 

Edit: let me clarify when I said that I hate learning, which I really do. I hate learning about stuff I don't care about. Ex. How to  use the proper formula to calculate the surface area of Nicki Minaj's ass. But I do like learning about anything technology or computer related.

Edit #2: I'm actually not sure what degree I would need. I've seen many that gal in line with what I'd want to do but not sure."

The second one is web dev for a small defense company in which I'd be doing development using Angular JS and java.

 Both of these pay well, however, the first one pays more(about $4/hour and has a well-known name(Fortune 500 company). I am not too focused on the money as I am on gaining skills that set me up for success in the future. Thus my question is which one do you think I should take that would help me become desirable to big companies in Seattle/San Francisco as my goal is to receive a full-time job in one of those cities.

5x0on5,1,2017-03-01,Balancing internship opportunities?,Throwaway36008,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x0on5/balancing_internship_opportunities/,"I'm just going to jump right in. I'm pursuing a bachelor's in software engineering at a local university, and am in my third year. I am currently attempting to obtain a summer internship or coop before finishing my degree (one semester left). I am very interested in embedded systems programming. I have three companies (companies 2-4) in mind in this field, as well as one company (company 1) that I would rather work at than any of those three but my chances are low (very high standards).

I have received an offer from company 4, however it happens to be my lowest preference. From what I learned recently, the work itself is very similar to company 4 but I'm likely to be translating code from one language to another more than doing development. This does not excite me. Additionally, company 1 does not offer a living stipend and I would have to drive 1.25 hours each way each day if I want to avoid paying double rent.

Company 2 is my second preference. The company seems to be a more prominent name, as well as the work would be strictly development. I would also receive a housing stipend or onsite housing, so no double rent and no lengthy transportation. I have communicated with the representative for this company and let them know that I received another offer, and was told that I was one of three candidates referred to the manager of the team I would be working with (I asked for any idea of how much of a risk it would be to reject my current offer and place my hopes in this company). I will be scheduled for a final interview with this company if I choose to reject the offer from company 4.

Company 3 is my third preference. This is a company local to my hometown, so living expenses and transportation would be easily managed. I have a friend as a referral to this company, as he has worked an internship here before as well as worked with me before. I'm not currently sure that they are still looking for interns for the summer, although I hope to receive confirmation from my friend by the time I must respond to the offer from company 4. This is a company where references from employees or employee's friends means a lot, and the manager is one of my dad's friends from high school as well.
Company 1 is my highest preference, but feels like a complete shot in the dark - they receive hundreds of applicants and reject most of them solely based on their resumes and GPA's. This semester, right after the local career fair, they asked another of my friends, a previous intern and now future employee, for a list of the smartest people he knew. I am one of five people on that list, along with a description of his experiences with me. Last semester I was screened out based on resume, but I have not received an email notifying me of so this semester, and my resume and GPA both look much more appealing after last semester.

Currently, my plan is to await my friend's feedback on Company 3, and if he confirms there will be availability in a few weeks, to reject my current offer. If I do not receive meaningful feedback by my deadline, I will accept my current offer. I'd like to know what Reddit thinks. I definitely don't want to commit to working for company 4, but I'd rather work there than another summer of a non-career position."
5x0p0n,2,2017-03-01,Entry-level salary for GTA area?,Ming0389,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/5x0p0n/entrylevel_salary_for_gta_area/,"Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the proper place to ask this question but I will start here anyways.

edit: GTA as being Greater Toronto Area

I have an entry-level opportunity to work for a small company that I was referred to by a professor. The work typically involves both hardware design and software design, with other duties as assigned. I'm not exactly too sure what the title of the position will be, but my best educated guess would be somewhere along the lines of Junior Embedded Engineer. The interview process is at it's final stages where the salary is now involved. This is where I'm a bit stuck and don't have a good picture of what is to be expected financially. I tried googling, and the only answer I found was from payscale.com and monster.ca. I usually like to have a couple more sources before having a clear picture. I was hoping if there's any senior-level managers or recruiters here on reddit with knowledge in the GTA area about what salary I should be negotiating around. The number I have in mind right now is ~$55k/year

A little about me, for what it's worth:  
* Engineering education in electronics  
* Just under 2-years internship experience at an electronics manufacturing company. Was their test technologist. Also worked with management to write some small excel programs to automate data analysis, and worked with the manufacturing engineering department to complete first article inspections  
* Have a couple of projects (personal, academic, and professional) that involved designing and prototyping embedded systems that uses microcontrollers. Basically, from schematic to board layout on the hardware side. Bare-bone programming on microcontrollers and desktop computers on computer side.  

Thank you for your time and input!

I'm a university student 5hrs from home. If all goes according to plan, I will be set to graduate with my BSc next summer. For the past 3ish years, OSAP has (mostly) covered my school costs, my parents have paid my rent and helped me out when I'm in a pinch, and my pt job covers my food and extra bills. I chose to go to a school far away with express purpose of staying as far away from my parents as possible. I have a little brother (12M), and my parents provide for us as much as they can. Both work FT, my dad doesn't pay for anything so he cooks and cleans, my mom pays for everything. But, it's a very toxic and abusive (physically, emotionally, verbally) house. My parents resent each other and curse each other as much as possible (due to mostly financial stress), my mom will hit and tear me down, my dad will do the same to my brother. My mom is also very controlling about cleaning and where and how I spend my time and money (examples can be given if necessary). From ages 12-18, it was so bad I was clinically depressed and attempted suicide twice, I would hide in classrooms in HS until 10pm-midnight to only come home when my parents were asleep and leave at 5am to avoid them in the morning. When I visit them now every few months, I get a bad panic attack up to a week beforehand leading up to my trip. Point is, shits bad. 

Well, I'm very grateful for my parents financial help. It's been a blessing to get help from them. Now I'm almost done and they want me to come back home (GTA). The promise would be living rent free (really no expenses other than my phone), possibly my own car or sharing my mom's, and I could work and save until I get a ""big kid job"". I'll help care for my brother and ease the financial stress off my parents. I'll be close to all my friends and family. I'm sure it'll be easier to find a job back home simply because of the language barrier I face here. Although the COL is higher, it's a sweet deal, except for the fact I'll be moving back into a depressive, toxic hellhole until god knows when. 

On the other hand, I have a sweet BF of a year. When I'm done school, he plans to start trade school. It'll take about 5yrs to get to a master level I think. Our plan is to move in together when one or both of us have a full time job (does an apprenticeship count?), save some money, and get married 2-3yrs after. This could very well take 5-6yrs. But...this is all theoretical. 

No chance in hell parents will allow BF and I to move in together, but as soon as I graduate I'm expectedly going to be cutoff. COL in GTA is higher than in current city we're in, but I do have a few friends that might want to split an apartment or house to lower costs. Unfortunately, I'd be asking BF to move hours away from his family and friends. Plus we have to find work (or trade school) in new city asap for that to work. I'm trying to find an internship or job close to my BF but no luck so far. If I can't find another PT job or a decent FT job by Jan, I'll have to apply for OW to get by. Boyfriend just wants me to be happy, but I don't want to break up over this.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr: I don't want to tear my relationship apart and I sure af don't want to move back home (serious risk I'll damage my mental and emotional health). But for a poor debt riddled student, the incentive to do so is high. What can I or should I do?**"
5x1jnd,2,2017-03-02,Software dev here. I found a new job with 20% salary raise but reaching bottleneck. What's my next step?,I_spoil_girls,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x1jnd/software_dev_here_i_found_a_new_job_with_20/,"I worked four years at my last job and I'm 29. My wife is a housewife and I have a 4-yo. This January my old employer has ceased wage adjustment on the staff and the company was going out of business gradually. I asked my boss what his plan was and how I could do better. He was being vague. He couldn't even promise a number. Being seriously concerned about my own career, I quit.

I do C/C++ coding on embedded Linux. I guess this industry was growing fast in China like, a decade ago? Anyway, not many embedded device developers can go higher than $40K/yr here. A waitress here earns about $7K/yr, FYI. Internet is trending like crazy. An entry level position of server deployment can easily earn more than $40K/yr. I tried to get a job in that field but was turned down after some interviews. Apparently they don't want an inexperienced, 29 years old guy, although I stated that I was willing to start as an internship. After two weeks of job hunting, I took a job in the same industry. Yeah, embedded Linux again. It's a $25K/yr job.

On my first week, I was really frustrated. Everyone here is working overtime. The official work hours is 9 to 6. But they make you check in before 8:30 and you can see PLs going to a meeting at 8 pm. Sometimes when I'm about to fall asleep on my bed, my phone still beeps and it's someone at work discussing with each other. I feel like I don't have a life anymore. Moreover, with no free time at work, I can't learn new skills. My code quality is good. I have shallow understanding of Linux. But do I know TCP? No. Database? No. Android/iOS? No.

I'm worried about my next stop. Say, what if I work here for a few years and I have to go for a better job? It scares me that all my knowledge gained here will only be useful if I stay, that this industry is going down hill and I still lack the knowledge for another grossing industry.

Dear /r/PF, what do you think?

TL;DR: Mediocre software developer stuck in a low-yielding industry. Too old to start over."
5x1k4t,1,2017-03-02,Canada New Grad - Electric utility vs consulting,younglad2017,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5x1k4t/canada_new_grad_electric_utility_vs_consulting/,"Hello senior engineers,

I am a graduating electrical engineering student this year, and I am extremely lucky to have two job offers prior to graduation: one with an electric utility in the GTA and another with a consulting firm in the prairies, but I am undecided on which to choose...

I have done an internship with the current consulting company for 16 months. I worked on some very interesting projects during my work term, and I know there will be much more to learn when I get brought on as a new grad.

Meanwhile, the job with the utility was very lucky for me. It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity since they rarely hire outside of university new grads and the pay as well as the pension are excellent. However, I did not have a pleasant experience working with an utility (different one) during one of my summer work terms, where I dreaded coming into work everyday. Also, I probably prefer a large city life compared to the suburbs of the prairies.

Do any of you older engineers have advice for a new graduate like me? My heart feels like I should stay with consulting where I am familiar with the people and am interested in the work, but the job security, lower stress and pay are big pluses on the utility side. Are there any other factors I should consider in my decision?"

I have bad luck with landing interviews for jobs, I'm guessing cause I have no experience. 

Anyone  have suggestions of projects I can work on that I can put on my resume/cover letter to get employers attention ? I want to work on some during the summer so when I graduate I'll have it already done. "

He has an English name and a foreign last name, and he's beginning to question whether he's being discriminated against. I won't release his resume, but he has done numerous research projects and coding competitions, and he's a junior at a UC college.

5x2ebq,13,2017-03-02,"Unrelated degree in Canada, go back for CS degree, self-taught, bootcamp?",clothiswoe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x2ebq/unrelated_degree_in_canada_go_back_for_cs_degree/,"Currently reside in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I've read about people being able to find jobs with just being self-taught but over here in my city, it seems that those with degrees + co-op internship are more likely to find employment than those w/o degrees and are self-taught based on what I've heard from employers and friends (if there are those who are self-taught in my city and were successful in landing employment please share your stories).

Due to my low GPA, I'll most likely have to spend a year as a non-degree student taking courses to upgrade and transfer after my first year, this would probably take me a minimum of 4-5 years to achieve a CS degree.

I'm fine with self teaching for two years and by reading around this sub there is a good split between those who seeked out formal education and those who self-taught. However, I feel location plays a huge factor in those who are self-taught being hired versus a CS grad. Please feel free to roast me out on this one if I'm wrong.

I've already begun self-teaching myself Java on my own. I can't help but feel that going back for a second degree is a much 'safer' option than self-teaching for 1-2 years and struggling against the large supply of CS grads in my city with a degree + co-op experience.

I have also considered a bootcamp (HackerYou, Lighthouse Lab) but I'm still skeptical about them."
5x33h2,0,2017-03-02,Can previous experience in the industry hurt my chances of getting an internship?,L2PSCART,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x33h2/can_previous_experience_in_the_industry_hurt_my/,"Hi all,

I am currently planning to enroll on a computer science degree next October, despite already working as a web developer for 1 year and finishing a coding bootcamp. I was wondering if my previous experience will help or hinder me when it comes to looking for internships, as I am not sure whether companies will like the fact that I have previous experience or not want to give me the internship because I already have had a job working?

Any help would be much appreciated!"
5x3j13,1,2017-03-02,Me (25F) and a manager who has weird mean flashes (late 30sF) at a new job (4months),Throwawaytrain29,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5x3j13/me_25f_and_a_manager_who_has_weird_mean_flashes/,"I have a manager who has got lots of issues in her everyday life and seems to lack self awareness. 

She can be nice to me but it often feels like I'm walking on eggshells because she can be rude randomly. 

So for instance she asked me why a student was leaving (we work in placements) and I said oh it's sad really, he couldn't get a placement because he's an international student... was about to say something else but she snapped and said ""it's not sad and it happens all the time"". I was quite taken a back by this because surely it's just an opinion and I'm not a robot.

She's quite left on the political spectrum so it's not that she's xenophobic. It just feels like when she gets like that it can be difficult to talk to her. It's not just me that she snaps at but I definitely get it more because I'm new and she manages me. Unfortunately though I have to share an office with her and her work buddy (who I get on with well with) and I think she finds it difficult for me to share an office with me. She says that she is glad I'm here and I do good work, all true but I also get the feeling that she'd rather I wasn't there. I get pushed out of personal conversations a lot to the extent that when I work and she's there I just don't say anything if I can help it. In a way this means that I'm very efficient and good at my job but it makes me feel a bit sad.

Not only that but she encourages me to ask her questions face to face without sending emails so I can't even do that.

I've already had to confront a coworker in this job who was an intern and was being unprofessional so it would feel like I was a problem coworker to talk advice I've seen on the Internet and call my manager out. 

I'm trying to be positive but I feel kinda sad. I'm thinking of transferring somewhere else in the business but I think it would be obvious that I was leaving because I'm unhappy. The work itself is good and I like the team ethos so it's hard to think about leaving all because of one woman.

TL;DR: Snappy manager and I'm unhappy at work because of it"
5x3lkt,4,2017-03-02,A company I applied for countered with an internship and want my salary expectations. Thoughts?,AussieChopTop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x3lkt/a_company_i_applied_for_countered_with_an/,"As the title suggests, I was applying for a bit of a 'dream job', but didn't hear back. I pulled all of the strings I could, and recently got my CV onto the desk of the lead in the team I wanted to join. Today I received a call from the HR department about a paid, 3-month internship program with said team, where I will apparently perform ""meaningful work"" full-time. I still have to do an online test, but I'm confident and they're currently asking for salary expectations.

Now, this is all awesome (I suppose it's their version of a junior position, and although I've been programming in C++ for a few years, relative to this AAA-ish game developer, I'm a bit of a junior), but I'm just concerned that if I give some lower figure I feel would be appropriate for an internship, it could be used against me if I was brought on to a proper development position where I would want to be paid more. I'm also having trouble arriving at a figure. I tried to dodge it, and tried to get the salary range, but no dice. If I was joining as a developer (this is in games, so a little less than in other parts of CS), I'd be asking for $65-70k AUD in a major city, but as an intern...? 

I was thinking I'd make it clear that I was not sure due to it being an internship, but as a potential job trial of sorts, my ideal would be $50-55k with the ability to renegotiate if I was to be brought on. I would ideally make it clear I'm open to discussion if I'm way off, etc etc.

Has anyone else been in this situation before? How did it turn out, esp. the transition from intern to full developer?"
5x45sz,433,2017-03-02,[MF] Quietly fucking while her parents were next door,PM_YUR_PIERCINGS,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5x45sz/mf_quietly_fucking_while_her_parents_were_next/,"The summer after I graduated college, my girlfriend was doing an internship 6 hours away, so we had decided to ""take a break"" until she was back in school. However, she was vacationing with her parents an hour from me, and they had invited me to stay a few nights.

It had been 2 months since I had seen her, and over a month until someone else had been responsible for making me cum. I was in a dry spell.

After a day at the beach and a nice dinner, it was time to retire to bed. Shockingly, her parents were okay with us sharing a room. Prior to this, any visit to her house had me sleeping on the couch. I guess the cost of an extra room was more than their ignorance. 

When we first saw each other in the morning, it was awkward. We were technically not together, but happy to see each other. As the day went on, we warmed up. I loved see her in a bikini, and the touches and kisses we would sneak just teased. 

As we got undressed for bed, I couldn't help but stare at her. She played field hockey at school, and had the super muscular thighs and ass that come from years of training. Her internship made her work late nights, and her budget actually made her lose weight from skipping meals. She had always been fit, but now I could see the outline of ab muscles when she flexed... and I just wanted to gnaw on the hip bones. Her tits were great for her frame, and I knew that she had super sensitive brown nipples under the t-shirt she was wearing.

I moved across the room and attacked her face with mine. My hands cupped her ass and pulled her body into mine. The thin fabric of my boxers did nothing to hide my hungry, hard cock. 

""Shhhh... my parents are in the next room. Can we do this? We have to be quiet?""

""I need you. I need you so bad, you don't know how much I've missed you. Missed us"", I whispered.

I was laying it on thick, but I needed to fuck her. We moved to the bed to continue, when we discovered that the beds in this B&amp;B were old and super squeaky. The tiniest movement was comical in the noise it made. But, I was not to be deterred. 

I pulled down the white cotton panties she was wearing to see a freshly shaved pussy. I ran a finger back and forth along her slit, with her lips feeling like fire. Sliding my finger in, she took in a deep breath, trying not to make any noise. 

Laying on our sides, spooning, my left arm underneath her, and my right reaching around to keep playing with her wet pussy, I whispered in her ear. 

""I'm going to get you so wet that my cock slides right into you. You have to stay quiet. Nod if you want this.""

She nodded, then squeaked as my left hand pinched one of her nipples, turning it super hard. 

I pulled my boxers down to my knees, lifted her top leg, and pushed the head of my cock in to her. She gasped, but my hand covered her mouth. 

""Quiet.""

Ever so slowly, to keep the bed from squeaking, I pushed until my cock as far in as I could go. Then, we started to grind. Our movements were subtle, with her clenching and releasing her vaginal muscles, and I squeezing my ass cheeks to make my cock clench. 

Every so often, I would pull back just a bit, maybe half an inch, before slowly pushing back in. 

It was painstakingly slow sex, but every movement, no matter how tiny, felt enormous. My free hand would just run up and down her body, finger tips ever so slightly dragging on her skin. I could feel goose bumps forming. 

My left hand would occasionally cover her mouth as her breathing intensified, and we would lay as still as possible until we calmed down enough to re-start, the need for movement would make us mad. 

The first time she came, she shook the bed enough to make noise. I could feel her clenching hard on my cock, so I just lay still. 

The second time she warned me, and I wrapped her tight in my arms, holding her as still as possible. I could feel her abs flexing and quivering as she reached her peak. 

The third time, I had to roll on to of her, to the prone position. Each orgasm was stronger than the last. 

Back on our sides, she whispered to me, ""Please cum, I don't think I can hold back if you get me again.""

It had been almost 30 minutes, and the time spent controlling ourselves had my brain fried. I did more of my slow, shallow thrusts, just enough to have the head of my cock feeling the pleasure of friction. 

On the last thrust, I could feel my balls retract, and I pushed as deep as I could, grabbing her hips and pulling her in to me. 

Each shot of cum sent ripples through my body, as I had to fight the need thrust. Once she felt me cumming, she started flexing her pussy to milk me. 

It was one of the most intense orgasms I've ever experienced, and we fell asleep with my softening cock still inside her. 

The next morning, her parents went to an early breakfast, which gave us the opportunity to truly fuck, but the night before was the best of the week. "
5x4ano,2,2017-03-02,Advice needed - eight months out and feeling pretty defeated,baiduthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x4ano/advice_needed_eight_months_out_and_feeling_pretty/,"I woke up this morning and checked my email to find that I had been rejected by the second to last company I'm still interviewing with. I'm tired and frustrated after eight months of interviewing and failing to find a job. I need fresh suggestions, so I thought I'd turn to /r/cscareerquestions for advice.

Long story short, I changed my major three times before graduating June 2016 with a double major in computer science engineering and statistics. Since I spent my summers catching up on academic requirements, I didn't complete any internships. However, I have done a few out-of-class projects (most for self interest, two for professors). I've interviewed for both software engineering and data science roles at a few large companies, a number of smaller ones and startups, and even a few research firms, but I've been rejected by all of them.

At this point, I'm running out of companies and ideas. What suggestions do you have for me? I'm happy to provide whatever information about myself if it'll help you better advise me. I apply mainly through internal referrals (either through my friends or through networking with engineers at the company). I've progressed from initially getting rejected in phone screens to now getting rejected at on-sites. Most places tell me ""We like you, but we think you first need work experience. Please reapply after your first job.""

The few specific questions I have - 

1. How do I find companies having exhausted big name firms, AngelList, Intern Supply, HackerRank's coding challenges? Is there some equivalent for academic/research organizations?

2. How should I be using my time? I'm currently splitting it between applying, leetcode practice and personal projects. Is there something else I should be doing?

3. I'm interested in applying to grad school, but I'm hesitant because I don't feel comfortable applying without knowing what programs/professors are out there. My plan was to work as a software engineer for one to three years and then apply once I have a better idea of what I'd like to spend my time in graduate school doing. Is this a bad plan? Most of the programs I'm interested in are in Europe and are still accepting applicants - should I just apply now? If so, what should I do while waiting to hear back? Apply for summer internships?

4. Baidu Research and now DeepMind rejected me because they didn't feel I was sufficiently proficient with C++ (my preferred language is Python). Are there any tutorials for more advanced features of C++ that someone can refer me to?

I'm considering working in finance and so I am looking into taking a course in stochastic processes and another in bayesian processes. Over my undergraduate career, I took hard courses that challenged me. I ended up going through two languages, math, stat and finance up to the 400 level. Because of this my grades weren't always the best (a 3.2) but I learned a lot. I believe I've lost out on internships due to my GPA.

I was looking on one of the IB forums and they pretty much explicitly said that recruiters only care about GPA, not excuses for lower grades. Now, I'm confident I can get through these classes. I'm not necessarily confident I can get an A though. Has anyone else been in this position? I understand people will say to prioritize learning but realistically, the reason I'm in this professional master's is to get a better position when I leave, not necessarily to learn.

tldr; What do you think is more worthwhile, poor grades in difficult courses where you learn a great deal or good grades in easier courses that aren't as applicable? "

* Currently set to graduate this May with a BS in CS.
* I have a job lined up as a software engineer. This job starts in early August.
* Currently a software engineer intern/coop at a different company.
* I am miserable. Been hoping things would get better since December-Jan but the situation has seriously degraded since then with little chance for improvement.
* Internship is set to end late April-Early May.
* I have some savings (Enough for May to August, not enough to leave sooner), but still need my current job until graduation. I have cut out all unnecessary expenses. No eating out, saving almost everything I make after bills.

Questions:

I am exploring alternative jobs I could do in the meantime, but I would have trouble making ends meet with the usual college jobs. Are there any work opportunities I should look into for the meantime? 

I have been considering doing a summer internship and that could help offset the loss by leaving earlier than expected, but I very late to the application process for that.

5x4qpm,2,2017-03-02,Scared of grad job skill level. What to do?,LuffCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5x4qpm/scared_of_grad_job_skill_level_what_to_do/,"A bit about myself......

I've loved CS for a while now and though I am doing an engineering degree, I have found myself dabbling here and there and enjoying modules that veer towards programming all through my degree (Currently completing my 4th (masters) year). I enjoy reading about new developments and gaining knowledge about CS subjects/theories.

During summer I completed an internship in a development role at a major investment bank, which I thoroughly enjoyed and received an offer to return as a grad. 

My problem is that, I feel I will be fired if not on day one, then within the first couple of months due to my skill level when compared to other employees. Even during the summer internship,  while some other interns managed to complete 1 or 2 projects, I could only manage to get halfway within the one I was given.

Additionally, most people studied a CS degree from a top (target) university and I feel it is impossible for me to compete with them considering I haven't even studied a CS degree, less alone at a target. 


I received very good feedback all through my internship at the bank and got along really well with everyone, not only my team. But as my starting date is drawing nearer, I'm beginning to waver in the belief of my abilities. I've tried to address my fear by learning as many programming topics as I can. However, there is only so little I can do, considering my masters degree commitments (dissertation, projects, exams etc.). I feel as if I was chosen to come back by mistake or something along those lines. 

I am not scared of the competition during the role and I am definitely not one for self pity. However, as I believe anyone coming into an investment bank is expected to hit the ground running, I just feel that I will be all but useless.

I would like some advice on what to do at this point? Rescind my acceptance of the offer?  Bearing in mind being a developer as been my passion for the past 6 years and I have tried to do as much as I could during my spare time (even going as far as to complete a year placement role as a software developer in between my degree), but essentially can't get the same level of knowledge (theoretical and practical) as someone studying it full time...

Many thanks!"

I interned at both NASA and Google while doing my undergrad and I loved working at both but they were very different experiences. The google internship was definitely more fun and exciting (tons of company sponsored events, freebies, etc), but the work at NASA was more interesting for sure. I loved my coworkers at both and I honestly believe I would be happy at either. How would you make this decision? 


As far as I can see, here are the pros/cons of each.


Google

Pros

 * Very high compensation (~200k / year (salary, stock, bonus))
 * I like the location (sf bay area, CA)
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Amazing perks (Free breakfast/lunch/dinner, free shuttle to work, gym, misc benefits)
 * High prestige if I want to move
 * Good work-life balance (at least for my team)
 * Better Software engineering practices


Cons

 * Very expensive location (I would pay ~2k/month rent for a studio)
 * Specific project isn't very exciting to me
 * Not advancing humanity
 * All software (no hardware which I'm interested in)
 * Most people leave after a few years


NASA

Pros:

 * Very cool project/team (Robotics/Avionics)
 * Good Benefits
 * Cheap Location for living (~800 for a 1BR apartment)
 * Mixture of hardware and software
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Very good work-life balance
 * High Prestige
 * Advancing Humanity
 * Many people stay for life


Cons

 * Not a location I want to live in (very hot + humid)
 * Low compensation (starting around ~45k but likely to increase in the future. Will never match Google though)
 * Poorer software engineering practices
 * No real perks besides benefits
 * Government bureaucracy
 * Unsure what will happen under current administration / future administrations


So what do you guys think? I understand this is a very good problem to have, but I am having a really hard time deciding. I know money shouldn't be the biggest factor in my decision but after receiving the Google offer it is hard to imagine accepting ~4-5x less.

They're offering $12/hr (my current CS internship pays $22/hr for context).

Any tips on negotiating? I'm going to email back that I have a couple more questions on the job and try to schedule a call, then attempt to negotiate for a $16/$17/hr and hope they counter no lower than $15.

To their credit, they are a web dev company in a city with a lackluster university that doesn't teach **any** web development courses. Most of their interns likely come in with zero experience and need to be coddled into competency. I've had wonderful opportunities in the past and have 3 years or internships/student research behind so I feel very comfortable working on their stack.

EDIT: is mentioning current salary a good/bad negotiating strategy?"

5x5uf3,15,2017-03-02,My (24F) roommate (26F) is becoming codependent and passive aggressive and I don't know how to handle it compassionately.,PotatoMischief,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5x5uf3/my_24f_roommate_26f_is_becoming_codependent_and/,"Hey Reddit. So, my roommate (we'll call her Deb) and I have known each other for almost 5 years. We met in college when we lived in the same campus apartment with 4 other girls. We've maintained a friendship along with the 5th roommate at that time (April).

After that year, I moved off-campus into the apartment we are in now. I now have a full-time job, a serious boyfriend of almost 4 years, and am very private. Deb lived in an apartment by herself for a year, and then moved in with April up until this past summer when April moved home. As much as I wanted to live alone, I invited Deb to live with me to keep the rent cheap. We agreed that even though we are friends, we would work well together as roommates seeing as that's how our relationship initially began and we worked well together. 

When Deb and April lived together, they did everything together. I hung out with them maybe once a month to drink and catch up on life, but I don't feel that we're as close as the two of them are together. This is fine by me, as my boyfriend is my best friend I really only open up to him and my lifetime best friend who lives in a different state. Currently, I spend my weeknights at home after work and then on the weekends I stay with my boyfriend at his place. We are both pretty burnt out after work so we save any activities for the weekends. 

&amp;nbsp;

 **Some relevant (I think) info about Deb:**

Deb is perfectly capable of driving--she commutes at least 30 minutes both ways to and from work in city traffic. However she refuses to drive at night because her eyesight is not great. But she also doesn't wear glasses and won't go to the optometrist because she says it won't make a difference (she went to some quack doc when she was a kid that tried to ""fix"" her eyes with eye exercises which didn't work. That was over 10 years ago). So instead, she comes home at around 4:30 before it gets dark, doesn't drive anywhere at night (I always have to drive if we do anything, even though my car is falling apart and she has a brand new car), and any sign of snow or inclement weather she takes an Uber to work or stays home. This has gotten her in trouble at work, as one time she called in due to the snow even though everyone else in her office made it in just fine.

I'm fairly certain that Deb has social anxiety. Now that April is hours away, Deb does not hang out with anyone but me. She used to have friends at her former church, but ever since she left there she doesn't make any effort to keep in touch with them or make new friends. She also works full-time and they have invited her to some group events, but she only goes if I go with her. I've tried encouraging her to go hang out with people when they invite her but to no avail. At one point, she told me of a girl she knew who she really wanted to get to know better. This girl invited her to hang out with her and a small group of other girls, which she was really excited about. She invited me to come but I had plans that night. She ended up not going, and never went to any subsequent get-togethers after that. She said she didn't want to drive because it would be dark out. Three separate girls offered to give her a ride. She said she was tired. She's also been thinking about finding a new church, but won't go unless I go with. I've been very clear with her that I have no desire to step foot in another church right now. And if I did want to find a new church, it'd be with my boyfriend.

Something else worth mentioning is that Deb does have some health issues. They have given her some trouble in the past (In school she needed deadline and testing accommodations) but for the most part they do not effect her day-to-day or quality of life. She has a job, drives, and can do anything any other 26 year old can do and in the past has never wanted anyone to think otherwise. She lived by herself for a year! She has two bachelor degrees! I didn't even know she had these issues until this past year; that's how little they effect her outwardly. I realize I can't speak to how they effect her inwardly, and I am trying to be sensitive to that. However sometimes it feels like she uses her health issues as an excuse, such as the night driving. She is a very stubborn person (she'll be the first to tell you so) and does not like learning new things.

 &amp;nbsp;


So, Deb does not leave our tiny apartment ever, really. Most nights and weekends she is home on the couch, binge watching Netflix and crocheting. She orders takeout almost every night so she doesn't have to leave. Sometimes she will go up to her sister's house an hour away, but aside from there, work, and the grocery store she doesn't leave. This wouldn't bother me except that our apartment is tiny and I'm beginning to feel like she makes her social life and her wellbeing my responsibility.

Her job has been stressful because she *makes* it stressful. Her job is incredibly stable and uneventful (in a good way), but constantly texts me throughout the day any time any little thing happens. If a client gets huffy with her, she texts me about it. If her boss has a meeting with someone else and she doesn't know what it's about, she texts me about how worried she is and she doesn't know what's happening. Her boss had a talk with her a few weeks ago telling her very bluntly that Deb has nothing to worry about, that she's doing great, and she's there for support. Great! A few days later her boss had the same talk with Deb's coworker. In a different room from where Deb had the talk. She texted me a novel about it and how she was freaking out that they were in a different room and ""what could it mean?"" They hired some interns to help with their workload. I got texts about it that she was worried the unpaid interns were replacing her and her full-time paid job. 

 I really care about Deb and don't want her to feel like she's completely alone out here. Since I'm home on weeknights and not at my bf's I try to make sure we have some quality time as friends. Sometimes we make dinner together, or I'll sit and watch Netflix with her before I go to my room and do what I want to do. But mosts nights I really just want some space. I always make a point to chat with her for a little while when I get home, talk about her day and mine, etc. but after that, all I want to do is hang out in my room and paint or clean or hang out with my dog or whatever else. I'm burnt out from work, I'm dealing with my own shit right now (recently started therapy so I'm emotionally exhausted and raw most of the time), and I just want to be alone. MY room is my safe space. I'd hang out in the common areas of our apartment but it's so small and she's always out on the couch and wants to talk nonstop. I can't even just chill for a little while on the couch at the same time because then it turns into us having to watch a whole movie or do actively something together. 

On the weekends when I'm spending time at my bf's, I get a constant influx of texts from her. If I don't respond to her within an hour (and I typically don't because I don't check my phone very often on the weekends) I get two more random texts from her about anything and nothing just to get my attention. Last weekend she knew BF and I had set plans but she invited us to come over and make smoothies anyway. When I thanked her profusely for the offer but reminded her that we were out and about and wouldn't be able to come over, she passive aggressively decided that she would just go to her sister's for the weekend and would be leaving immediately. She's started to make passive aggressive comments about how I ""live"" with my boyfriend when I'm only at his out 2 out of the 7 days in a week.

&amp;nbsp;


This is getting way longer than I expected so I'll wrap it up. My roommate is my friend, but I seem to be her only friend out here. I've become her only friend, her chauffeur, and her therapist. I care about her and don't want to hurt her feelings or ruin our relationship, but lately it feels like she's become codependent on me and resents that I have my own life with my boyfriend. I worry that she has serious social anxiety, but I am also working through my own stuff and don't have the capacity to be there for her the way she wants me to be. I don't know how to handle this. I think I just need some input from the outside looking in, as we have a long history and I don't know if my expectations of her as an independent adult are too high. I'm trying to be sensitive to the fact that she has some limitations, but they never seem to be limitations to her until it gets her out of things she doesn't want to do or wants sympathy.

I am a prospective student and wanted to ask what the atmosphere is like among engineering students?

Do you think you are able to creatively let loose and participate in a lot of clubs and activities that involve engineering?

I am very passionate about engineering and thats what I basically want to do day in and day out, apart from attending an occasional party/social event. For me in order to get a complete college experience I want to participate in robotics clubs and learn as much as I can, get the internships I want (What is internship availability like?) Are there other students as passionate as I am?

In short,
What are the internship possibilites like at MSU?

How are the engineering clubs/robotics clubs at MSU?

Do you like the student atmosphere? Is the library nice to study in? 

I also like going to the gym, is the university gym good? Or too crowded?

Thank you so much!

Chapter 37 
 
Ooh! The 77th floor! 
 
Oh, it's Lero and Quant! Been awhile since they last showed up. 
 
Okay so since he says it's been 6 years, then it's been one year since the previous chapter, right? (or two chapters ago, since last time was a flashback) 
 
Hmm, so this is a mystery forest? 
 
Oh wow that's not suspicious. 
 
""Who would come all this way just to play games?"" Blueberry13 apparently. 
 
Oh, so it's another Khun family member then? Cool. 
 
Haha , he wants to be a game owner, even if no one else plays it. I want that to actually be his real motive, simply because that's hilarious. 
 
Omfg Quant getting so mad over a game. 
 
Aaaaand here we go. 
 
Oh my god, he spent all his money. That was hilarious though. 
 
Lol, can Yugi tag in on this? 
 
Oh damn, he bet his life. (Gonna need Yami for this one then) 
 
Well this is hella suspicious. 
 
Omfg really. 
 
Well that was fast. 
 
Wait, so the place is called ""Wo Ha Ik Song""? That's a mouthful. 
 
Hot damn, Lero's got quite an arsenal!(I love how people draw weapons in this series) 
 
And what is that?! 
 
Oh but he pulls an Edo Phoenix and takes a phonecall right then and there. 
 
And then he offers to take Lero as an *intern*? 
 
Afterthoughts: Well this was a fun chapter. But I have no idea what anyone's motives were here. (Well, I guess Quant's motive is just ""follow Lero"" lol) or why theyre doing anything theyre doing.

Chapter 38 
 
This is a weird way to start a chapter. 
 
Oh my god, this fuckin' guy. 
 
Wow...asking questions like that to a bot...lmao. 
 
""Lol puberty"" im dying 
 
YES 
 
Seriously, though, this is obviously some ploy by someone to accumulate enough info for...something. 
 
*Ohhhh*, this makes perfect sense. 
 
So it's some robot theyre trying to give a good AI system too, basically? 
 
Wait what. 
 
Afterthoughts: Well this was surprisingly short. But I liked it.

Chapter 39 
 
And now it's two years after that. Well then. 
 
Khun looks...*off*. 
 
Well that's a …*weird* test. 
 
*Really?* Mole people?! 
 
Oh, Goro's there too. 
 
Haha, that was easy for Ran. 
 
And Dann's going to rush in and hit the button now, because they found a path. 
 
Oh look, he's already done it. 
 
Of course, Khun scolds Dann for using Emily to make a decision. Hmm. 
 
Fuck outta here. 
 
YES, HE GETS CONFIRMATION!! 
 
Afterthoguhts: So I didn’t care for the test, but it seems to just be a way for Emily to be introduced, and for Khun to actually *know* Bam' alive. Which is good.

Chapter 40 
 
And what's this now? 
 
Miseng knows the Shdaow Clone Jutsu confirmed. 
 
Ooh, savage. I love it. 
 
Oh look, another unstable fire user. 
 
You know, to be honest...i don’t think I like this whole ""showing snippets per chapter of everyone moving about"". Makes it hard to get a grasp on a clear plot. 
 
Although I like Wangnan's new look. 
 
So is the whole team theyre going against just crazy strong for E-Regulars? 
 
Omfg Wangnan no. 
 
Ok good Bam's here to fix this up. 
 
Hahaha, Bam is great. 
 
""he gets stronger everytime"" what did you expect? 
 
Afterthoughts: You know, it's getting harder and harder to write these , because with just individual chapters it's harder to theorise on stuff and get blindsided by things.

Chapter 41 
 
Lol, Horyang has a new Miseng design on his shirt. 
 
Oh ,and this guy thinks he can beat Bam. Well then. 
 
But Bam is smart though, and wont fight for no reason. I like it. 
 
Lol junk food was the prize. 
 
""I feel like I'll see them up the tower sometime"" ...so I'm guessing they reappear? 
 
Hmm, Arkraptor think theyre going too fast. 
 
Oh wait, it's because he hadnt told them about getting involved in the Workshop battle.  
 
I want to believe Khun has been staring at that message ,unmoving, for months lol. 
 
Khun's so skeptical, but it's clear he kind of does want to keep questioning Emily. 
 
Now who's this woman? 
 
Wait, she has a picture of Horyang for Khun. 
 
But that doesn’t look like him at all. 
 
Oh wait there's a wing. I didn’t notice that. 
 
Hmm, but Horyang knows who it *really* is. 
 
Oh wait, Casano is the devil's right arm?! ( Wait...is it maybe something like Casano is the devil's right arm and Horyang's is the angelic right arm or something? Because I remember thinking that his arm looked really angelic when he released it) 
 
Hmm, so Khun's going to have him captured. Well then. 
 
Afterthoughts: Well this just got a lot more interesting! This whole thing with Horyang and that other guy should be cool, *especially* if Khun's involved."

I'm about to receive my bachelors in Human Physiology this June and was hoping to apply to PA school this cycle.

I have all the pre-requisete courses completed with the grades needed for my prospective schools. My GPA is on the low side with a 3.30 cumulative and a 3.05 science. This could raise before I apply, but I did play division 1 football for 3 years and I attribute my lower end grades to the time commitment that takes.

I am currently finishing a GRE prep class and will take the GRE next month, so I do not have any scores at this moment.


For PCE I am currently working with mental health patients helping them transition back into society after being institutionalized, and as a plasma center donation tech where I will receive my phlebotomy certification within 6 months.

Prior to this I was a medical scribe, physical therapy student intern, nutrition intern, and sports science intern. I have also shadowed physicians and physician assistants.

If all of these hours were to be accepted by the time I submit my application I would have a total of 1,650 hours.
My dilemma is not all of my prospective schools will accept all the hours I have earned. I'm worried that it may drop me bellow the 1,000 hour minimum for many of my prospective schools.
Which brings me to the advice section, I want to apply to PA school this cycle. But given my application at the time of submission I feel as though my patient care experience may put me behind. Most schools wont accept projected hours, which if i work full time until matriculation I will have received the 1,000 hours needed on top of the other hours they will have accepted.

I really do not want to wait until next year to apply, but at the same time I do not want to waste money on application fees if my chances are slim for getting accepted.

What advice would do you have for me? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I appreciate your help in advance! Thank you for taking the time to read this and good luck to anyone else applying soon!"
5x6eh2,3,2017-03-02,Physics to EE: M.S. Worth It?,notthebeltdad,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5x6eh2/physics_to_ee_ms_worth_it/,"Hi All,

I've been a longtime lurker on this sub and the material here has been incredibly helpful. I will be graduating from a Top 10 Liberal Arts College this spring with a degree in Physics and CS. After two internships at a national government research laboratory in quantum computing, I decided to change career trajectories towards engineering rather than pure physics. I was lucky enough to be accepted to Columbia's M.S. in Electrical Engineering program as a Tesla Scholar ($2,500 per semester with other perks), with the catch being that living in NYC carries a high price tag alongside expensive tuition.
   
  I am very good at living frugally and that shouldn't be an issue, but I am nevertheless frightened at the thought of taking out hefty student loans. I should also mention that I am fortunate enough to not have any undergraduate debt. My question is: since I plan on an industry oriented career, is this an intelligent investment of my time and money? I am very passionate about my field (photonics) and Columbia is home to some of the best photonics researchers in the world. The course track will be very heavily physics oriented and overlaps greatly with the past research I have done (I will be on the photonics and devices track), so I am not concerned about having to make up ground for not being an undergraduate EE major. While I have considered work directly out of undergrad, I have found that getting a job with a physics degree is difficult compared to an engineering degree--I have general quantitative problem solving skills but no true specialization that is applicable to industry. 
    
  I will also mention that I have no interest in obtaining a PhD at this time as academia is not as enticing as it once was (that is another reason I got away from physics). The main things I wish to know are: 

* Will the connections, prestige, and quality of education of Columbia make the high price tag worth the expense? Economically it seems feasible if I am able to land a decent job post graduation but I'd like to hear other opinions as well.

* How should I go about taking out student loans if so? (i.e. government loans, family, private, etc.)

* Is getting this degree the best way for a physics undergraduate to break into engineering? My job search thus far has been mixed with multiple final round interviews but no offers.

Any advice or information is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** Accepted to Columbia University M.S. in EE mostly unfunded as a physics undergraduate from a small liberal arts college. Given that I am passionate about the subject area and desire a career in industry, is this opportunity worth pursuing?

We have a pretty tight job market here and positions are usually filled without any public search and on the basis of personal connections, therefore I feel like I have to go above and beyond to secure my future.

That being said its a full time summer internship which means I'll need to quit my job. 

So whats the problem? Well, I need a job after the internship... that's kinda an issue because I'd have to full on quit my current job and its not going to be there when I get back. I'm not likely to be kept with the internship since I won't be done with school.

So my questions are:

1. How early should I tell my current job what's going on? I don't want to tell them too early so they don't replace me too quickly. 

2. Since I have 1 more semester of school I'd need a job for the last 5 months or so of school until I graduate in December, should I start looking near the end of my internship? What's a good 'hold me over just to pay the bills' job?

Thanks guys, love you all! "
5x71xh,6,2017-03-02,Me [23M] and my girlfriend [23F] of three months got beaten by her dad. Now she says I messed up her life...,jsmith0007,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5x71xh/me_23m_and_my_girlfriend_23f_of_three_months_got/,"Hi reddit, I’m having trouble with this girl…

I’ve known this girl [23] since I [23] was in elementary school, I always liked her but nothing ever happened. She’s going to public school and working as an intern in a good company. I’m also a student trying to make a living right now after I got into some legal problems. Till this past January we encountered ourselves again, we both changed of course. We started to hang a little bit and a spark ignited the craziest fire. I completely fell in love with her and I thought she did too, we were calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend by the second month and enjoyed each other’s company like crazy, until something happened…

We both used to do different kinds of drugs before we met each other again, and kept doing them together (main drug was weed). Thing is one Saturday morning we went out, her sister smelled something odd on her and ended up telling her parents about it. The night falls and we go out to a club, smoke in the car and have a blast. Night ends and I go take her home, she tells me to wait outside to make it seem to her brothers that she is going to sleep in, then sneak out with me.

I wait for a few minutes and she comes back all happy, we just stay talking for a few minutes in the car when all the sudden her mom is smashing the car window on her side of the car and his dad is smashing the window on my side of the car; my girl gets out of the car and I do the same thing. I must point out that my car reeks weed and of course they notice… 

As soon I get of my car his dad starts beating the hell out of me, I’m shocked as I did not expect this at all. I just cover my head, I don’t fight back and I’m telling them “What the hell is going on, stop hitting me I’m not fighting back”. I end up throwing myself against the hood of a car so he stops. After the beating ends they tell us to go inside the house, we comply. Once inside its just yelling everywhere, they found a little bag in my girl’s belongings with at most a gram of shake, they’re yelling who’s is the owner of this, this is illegal! It’s a felony! Her mom starts yelling at me that I drugged her innocent daughter, that I sell drugs and that I’ve been abusing her, then on top of that her dad starts hitting my girl with a closed punch. I just yell lets be civilized and talk, there is no need for violence! And I tell them that I smoke weed. That they please get to know her daughter and communicate with her, the response I get that my mother should know the kind of monster she raised (Mum knows all about me and my drugs). After that they kick me out of the house. 

Once in my car I noticed that my girl left her phone in the car and I go back to give it to her, as I go back I encounter her mom who starts yelling me and then her brother comes out and throws two sucker punches at me after I stated again that I was not going to fight anyone. After that I finally leave.

Two days later it’s her birthday, we see each other again. At first, she is telling me that I’m bad for her, that I’ve just brought bad things into her life, that all the time we’ve hanged out we were under the influence of drugs (It is true, almost every time but not all). She tells me that she wants to stop doing them all together; I say excellent idea, I support you, this way you can see things with a clear head. I say that me being an easy access of drugs doesn’t mean that we must be doing them. After that talk, we hanged out and had a happy drug free day.

A week passes by until we can see each other again, her parents keep talking bad things about me and she starts distancing herself from me, we agree to see each other to talk and everything goes great, we didn’t even hang for half an hour. Later that night we plan just to see each other for ten minutes so her parents don’t find out; as soon as she gets in my car, her dad tailed her and pulls her out of the car, he keeps yelling at me through the passenger seat and I step on the gas pedal, I come back to see what’s going on and I don’t see them anymore. I wait for a couple of minutes and then his brother arrives, I try to talk to him but he is just yelling me that I drug her sister, I tell him that he has it all wrong, I try to reason with him but he just hits my window and breaks my side view mirror.

Later that night my girl contacts me telling me that she escaped but her dad beaten the hell out of her. A few minutes later her mom and brother arrive to my house making a show yelling at my parents that I’m a drug dealer that drugs innocent girls and abused them…

Two weeks forward we haven’t seen each other but we’ve been in contact, things started to get better until last night after she went to the psychologist. She ended up saying that her mom keeps talking crap about me and that she wishes she didn’t have reasons to think that I messed up her life…

What the hell guys?

Tl;dr: Started dating this amazing girl, her parents caught us doing drugs and in result they beat the hell out of both of us for doing so. We decide to stop doing them. Parents keep talking crap about me to this girl, now she is blaming me for her problems.

If you need more insight feel free to ask me anything

Hi all!

So I have a question - I know what I would want if a guest were to have this come up in my wedding but just want to double check I'm not stepping on toes.

So, I was sent a Save The Date (I can't stand the abbreviation, y'all) for a wedding in June for my cousin who I like well enough but we're not super duper close. Since then I have accepted a really rigorous chaplaincy internship in another state and I know that I will not be able to take the time off for their wedding.

Is it inappropriate for me to message prior to receiving an invite saying ""hey, thanks for the save the date! I just wanted to let you know I won't be able to come due to my summer internship. I figure you've probably got an A list and a B list going on so I figure letting you know this far ahead would be more helpful in planning."" blahblahblah polite things.

I would want a guest to tell me if they knew before I sent out a $5 invite with $18 dollars of postage (no wedding planning for me until after this internship!). I'm just checking with other brides -- are we on the same page or do you think reaching out before I get the actual invite in hand is rude?

I tend to overthink things like this. I should probably just send the facebook message but my family is weird and gets offended by weird things. Y'all don't know anything about that, right? ;)

5x7e78,9,2017-03-02,Unsuccessful coming out round two,Thoslomas,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5x7e78/unsuccessful_coming_out_round_two/,"Hey everyone, I'm new-ish to this sub. I usually try to find answers and advice in questions already asked, but I'm at a point now where I really feel like I need some help. 

I'm 21, senior in college, and currently in a 1.7 year relationship. I first tried coming out to my family as a sophomore in high school. It was a really lonely time in my life, feeling those typical high school I-don't-belong type vibes and struggling with my sexuality only worsened my situation. I came out to my mom hoping to get support from her during a difficult time, but it only made it worse. My parents flipped and sent me to a counselor who told them she could fix me. They barred me from taking to certain people and monitored everything I did constantly. After a couple sessions of therapy I started skipping because I knew it was BS and a total waste of my time. They took me no longer going as a sign that I was cured and in an effort to save everyone from the pain, I stopped talking about it. 

Fast forward a few years to now and I'm in almost the same situation. I've been seriously dating my awesome boyfriend for awhile now and I thought it was time to begin being honest with everyone, so I wrote my parents a letter telling them everything. (Important note: they live an hour away so I drove home to drop it off while they were at work. I'm lucky to not be stuck in the same house with them and repeat what happened last time). It has been ugly since then. I'm getting constant texts with bible verses, complaints about how unnatural I am and them mourning the loss of grandchildren, and other messages hating on my boyfriend. They blame him for poisoning me and have demanded that I don't spend any time with him until we have a conversation first (lol, like that will happen). 

I guess I'm just coming here for advice now. I think I was naive thinking that they would take it better this time. I'm a full time student, working an unpaid internship and only have a couple hours each week to devote to my part time job. My parents don't help me much financially, but the contributions they do make are really needed. They've ""demanded"" that I come home this weekend to talk to them, but I'm terrified of the confrontation given some of the things they've texted me today. I don't necessarily feel safe, and in fact I'm afraid they're going to make the drive from my hometown to where I am now. The last message I sent them was asking for more time before we talk so we have time to cool off. 

Has anyone else had parents like this that eventually came around? Am I in too deep here? Should I cut off even more communication? I genuinely appreciate any advice. Thanks bros"

I interned at a well known bank during college and ended up accepting a full time offer for a position immediately after graduation. Because I was so excited to have a job after college before even starting my senior year, I accepted without question. The problem is that this job is all the way on the east coast(I'm not going to give specific details, but you can probably infer the details from what I'm writing). I've been working there for around 8 months now, and I can honestly say that I hate every moment and every aspect of it. My intern experience was nothing like my current experience working full time. Now I love developing/designing systems and building software, but this job has so many restrictions, a lot of corporate politics, and the thing that has put me off the most is the lack of passion I have for what I'm working on. I also have zero interest in the finance industry. On a more personal manner, I'm starting to notice that being away from my friends and my family is starting to take a toll on me mentally. I'd like to move back to my home town to find a job at a more tech-focused company. Would it be a bad move to quit my current job and move back in with my parents until I can find another job? If I don't do that, what's the easiest way to interview with companies outside my current city?


**TL;DR Moved halfway across the country right after college for software job at a bank. Turns out I despise my job and hate being away from my friends/family. How do I go about moving back home and finding a new job outside of the finance industry?**

Anything I should know or do/can be doing?",CabbageIT,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/5x8bsk/23_yrs_old_cant_hold_a_job_applying_for/,"This is gonna get stupid big because I am terrible at giving details in a short manner.  TL_DR at the bottom if it helps.

So, to give a... small as can be summary..

I was originally diagnosed with a form of high functioning autism, really young in life.  Later during high school, I was diagnosed with a second condition of bipolar.  Most recently, I have contracted a condition of essitintial tremor(slight shakyness in my limbs; more noticeable with emotional stress or heavy weights and makes precision movements with hands impossible).

I graduated from a local technical college with an associates in computer maintence.  I may not have been the most motivated student due to depression and anxiety, but I have always had average to above average grades in school and college.

So now, to the issue at hand.  I've had a horrible time keeping a job, and just getting a job period.  I was often turned down by an automated system, or never got a response to an application period, despite my attempts to keep in contact with employers.  When I did get an interview, I was often turned down for various reasons, sometimes for no given reason or explanation.  Today I was Google searching, in hopes of finding some advice when I found this subreddit.

So far, I've had 5 jobs.  2 of them were unrelated to my study, 3 of them were related to it, and one of those 3 was an internship.  I will list them in order.

Krogers: let go on the first day of the job.  No explanation given.  I called for my schedule and I was told ""we don't need you"".  I wish I was exaggerating, doesn't seem like appropriate wording but that's what they said.

Local IT position / Internship: I had anxiety issues from things outside the job that made me miss a lot of days, had no problem while at work.  Problem here is my boss didn't seem to think I was capable of anything and didn't feel like having me do actual work.  It was a typical ""busy-work"" internship that's a waste of time for upcoming graduates.  I spent almost my entire time wiping hard drives.  I shouldn't complain too much; I was one of the very few students at my college to get a paid internship, espc for something that simple.  When I asked if it would turn into a full time job, the boss said they were not needing anyone to fill a full time position.  That was bs, because a friend of mine got hired during his internship with them full time just two semesters after me.

Local pc repair store: my longest job, and only one I quit and feel bad about doing so.  My boss was very... forgiving, of my anxiety issues.  Problem was that she didn't understand them, so her sympathy made me worse.  Everyday I felt like I wasn't performing to acceptable quality, and that I would run her already struggling family run business down.  Didn't help that at the same time, I was dealing with home/family issues after coming out of the closet.  I spent a small bit of time away from my home town to live with my brother on the other side of the country, causing even more strain for keeping the job after I returned.

Fast food restaurant: I quit this job, if you can even call it that.  I know that working with managers, even if they grind your gears, is a necessary skill to have when seeking job employement, but this was just completely unacceptable.  I was there for three days, for about 15 hours of total time there.  I trained for maybe 3 hours, at the most.  They said to be there at a specific time, I did my usual 10 minutes early arrivial.  I sat there, with the other new recruits, for 4 hours, because the manager couldn't take 5 minutes out of his job to bring a laptop and load up a training page.  I only clocked in one of those days, for just barely an hour.  They never paid me, even for that time.  I witnessed another restaurant of the same franchise have the manager sit with new recruits to assist in training, and the first thing they did was clock in.  Needless to say, I quit after the third day.  Fuck those guys.

Finally, a IT help desk: this was my most recent position, and the one that caused me to file for disability.  I was there for just a little over a week.  Training seemed to go smoothly, but when it came time to do the job, I realized why.  It seems to be a common trend these days to do ""on the job training"", which is more along the lines of ""have one of our supervisors watch you learn something on your own in a real life scenario"".  I don't want to complain too much here, but I will say that during my college course on help desk style troubleshooting, I learned you do NOT waste a customers time if you can't assist them.  This style of on the job training is abysmal for a help desk position, where time is of the essence.  I should have had more time to learn procedures of the company before they throw me in un-discussed territory. But I digress.  I tried my best to keep my wits up, but after two mental break downs, they fired me for not being able to keep up with their training methods.

Bleh, that was a lot to go through... so I've filed for disablity.  I feel my mental state of anxiety is keeping me from holding a stable workflow.  Even in jobs where I got past training, self doubt has crippled me and caused to make even more mistakes on the job.  What I want to ask is.. what can or should I do while I wait to hear back on disablity?  I feel like I'm going into a depressive state because I stay at home all day, but I don't want to apply to another job right now.  Although it would make me look more active in actually trying to find a job, considering how fast I have job hopped (all those jobs were in a less than 2 year time span), I don't want to damage my career reputation anymore than I have, in case I can build my mental strength later in life.

I tried doing volunteer work, but lo and behold, volunteer work has become a job that you just don't get paid for.  They still expect you to fill out a resume and have experience in whatever your doing.  Have not heard back from after aplying.  Also, the local area is very insufficient in internships; this small rural area has a surprising abundance of colleges, so they tend to get first dibs on those positions.

Again, being a rural area, not much to do as far as hobbies.  It's a 30 minute drive to anything of interest, an hour and a half to actual big city material.  Right now, I'm interested in knowing if there is anyway to make small bits of money while unemployed?  I don't want to get into a contract position, but I do wish to save up, to prepare moving closer to a bigger city with a better job market (as well as live closer/with my SO).  Time spent out of the house would be healthy, and I might even get some good experience.  If yall have any recommendations on what I can do that would be productive use of my time, I'm all ears, and would really appreciate your advice.

TL_DR: I have trouble holding a job because of mental and physical conditions.  I have applied for disablity, but I am seeking advice on what I can do to improve my life while I wait to hear back."
5x8q98,4,2017-03-03,Me [21M] seriously regretting breaking up with my ex [22F].,uhhhhmir,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5x8q98/me_21m_seriously_regretting_breaking_up_with_my/,"I dated my ex for a little over 8 months before breaking up with her late December 2016. We are both University students and once winter break came around, since she lived in sorority house which closes for breaks she was out of a place to live. The plan was for her to couch hop between mine and other friends houses for the next 5 weeks. I was relatively stressed out as my internship that paid amazing was ending in January and I was on the job hunt but couldn't find anything even close to the pay. 

So she ends up basically just living with me for the first week and I started to feel very suffocated. I live in a house with friends but my room is quite small and all her luggage was taking up a lot of space. I am also a person who needs alone time to decompress and relax, this was obviously taken away from me as a I had to share a tiny room with her. I am a very impulsive person and on top of that I have this thing where I get something in my head and can't get it out. It just dominates my thoughts for the most part. The thing that managed to occupy my head after the first week she stayed was that I need to break up with her. Not ask her to go stay at a friends house for a couple days, because I'm a huge idiot. I was in a really weird state of mind but that's no excuse for how blatantly I disregarded her feelings.

I texted her this week apologizing for how I cut her completely out of my life. Then I asked if she still had one of my sweatshirts still and she said yes, she offered to bring it over but I told her I didn't want to inconvenience her, she could just leave it outside the sorority house and I'd grab it. When I got back to my house I texted her apologizing for how I handled the breakup. She called me and told me that a text apology wasn't cool, so I apologized over phone and told her how immature it was of me to just break up with her out of the blue. I kept saying I'm sorry but she just said ""don't say that if you think it was the right thing to do"".

Not a day has passed where I haven't thought about her and missed her. But I am scared to talk to her because we talked about how dumb it is for people to break up and then get together and decided if we broke up that was that. But ever since I talked to her my regret has just increased each day. On top of that earlier in February I ended up going on a date with another girl to see if maybe I was ready to move on. I ended up sleeping with her but could only think of my ex the whole time. I know I sound like a terrible person but I just do things on a whim without think about the repercussions later. And maybe that's my biggest flaw.

So my question is would it be worth it to try and get back with her? I feel so guilty about all of this but I'm scared that if we were to start seeing each other again I may end up hurting her again. As of right now I am very tempted to just ask her to get coffee and explain everything to her and see how she handles it. But on the other hand, maybe it would just be better for her if I just let this all go.

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend 2 months ago, miss her more every day and can't stop thinking about her but feel like I handled the break up and the succeeding months after the breakup too poorly to get her back. "

I just wanted to thank the profession and share how I've been touched.  
  
I'm a senior in high school and I've definitely had my ups and downs.  I only got diagnosed with ASD at 16 after pretty bad depression, anxiety, and self-harm ideation.  I'm a girl and since I didn't have any disruptive behaviors, I went unnoticed as ""shy"" and ""docile,"" and I guess I just internalized all my problems until I just couldn't function at all.  In the past couple of years, I've worked with dozens of professionals: psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, licensed therapists, psych. nurse practitioners, BCBAs, etc... I've had good and bad experiences, but social workers have been consistently very helpful.  I like how they've focused more on me as a person and less on just the diagnosis.  
  
I honestly don't know a lot about social work and how it's different from the other counseling types, but when I was hospitalized my social workers really were able to focus on how to work with my home and school environment and make changes so I could be successful.  A lot of therapy is hard for me because I take so long to verbalize things and sometimes if I'm with someone new, I just won't talk for a while, but the social workers worked with my parents too and my family has been much more understanding.  They kind of just could understand the situation and worked actively to help make things better.  Everything had been kind of stagnant with the psychiatrists, but as soon as a second social worker got added to my team, she really just made things happen.  I had felt so stuck and helpless, but they were able to help me make real, tangible progress and growth.  
  
I hope I'm not rambling, but when I was in a day treatment program, we had three SW interns who I loved so much!!  They were just really good at paying attention to me and listening.  I can't believe they were unpaid.. they seriously did amazing work.  They helped me learn a lot of skills and ways to cope.  I don't know how they did it but whenever I was having a rough day, one of them would pull me aside and help.  They never pressured me into talking or explaining but made me feel at ease until I was ready.  I don't know how to explain it but I felt comfortable with them.  It really is a skill to be a good listener.  I've been working on things like body language, facing the person and making eye contact, etc., but I hope one day I can become a little more like them.  
  
Lastly, the social worker at my school is amazing :)  She facilitates a group that meets twice a week for kids who have had some problems and it's been so good for me.  She is so positive and somehow just makes everyone feel open to sharing, but never pushes me farther than I'm ready.  I haven't really been able to share much of my own yet, but it's just nice to listen to others' stories and know I'm not alone.  Autism can be really isolating but she is the sweetest person ever and is just so encouraging.  When I had bad anxiety or had shutdowns in class, she'd come and just have such a calming effect on me.  She's taught me a lot about meditation and she's really one of my role models.  There's something about her that just makes me feel safe and accepted.  
  
Really sorry if I'm trespassing here because it seems to be a professional space but I am just so grateful to all of the people who've helped me.  I honestly haven't been able to thank them properly because, well, that would require talking to them and figuring out when the best moment would be and scripting my words (stress just thinking about it!!), and I wish I could.  I know the monetary compensation isn't great in SW, but the impact on my life has been amazing.  Anyone reading this might have some clients who don't thank them but really appreciate and benefit from their work.  So thank you and please keep doing what you are doing :)"

Miami is just so large and foreign to me that I wouldn't know how to begin planning a move.

Personally, I am a low level IT support professional with some entry level Systems Admin type experience and I've noticed over the years that IT work seems to be light down in Florida.

I have my own questions and those posts were years ago. I also read the post with links helping to explain to people exactly what it entails. I'm a junior in high school that has been in love with the idea of studying the ocean for years.   


**So the basic question is what would be the best college for this?**  My idea of what marine biology is that there's research diving which I'm super interested in, just to specify I'm very interested in the actual wildlife of it (in general. No specifications for this). Also location doesn't matter much to me (since I want to move out of state anyway) but I am in the US so if there are complications that would be involved please inform me (if you know.  No need to look for me if you don't).   


I've read about another school, coastal Carolina, that I heard is a great school for marine biology in this subreddit but whenever I look around the internet everything seems to say **Duke University** is the best (yes I have a competitive gpa. I haven't taken the act or sat yet but my psat score was high without studying). **Is it the best?  Or are there better?** I hear very often that this field is competitive and I'm assuming getting into the best college possible for it would really make me stand out. I do plan on pursuing a PhD in this field.   


I've heard **internships, scuba ( and later research) diving certification,  and studying gis** will help. Along with computer sciences (I think?). Also doing **labs** on marine biology.  **Anything else? Do all of those matter? Also is there anything in specific I should look for when getting a scuba certification (idk if it matters)?**   


Last group of questions.  The plan is to do whatever work gets me through until I can try to find a job in say an aquarium (or something similar until I can get into the actual field). **I heard a masters degree can get me into the actual research side of the field (please confirm if you can).**Then a PhD will push me the rest of the way. While I'm working on my degrees I plan on interning and working (volunteering?) in labs to make sure i enjoy it.  *I've heard that studying biology with a major in marine biology is better than simply majoring in marine biology only for job opportunities*. As I mentioned earlier it would involve gis at least (not entirely sure about computer science and statistics). **(you'll need to read that block of info to answer these) Anything I'm missing that I should keep in mind? Anything else that I would have to add to my plan (I laid it out very simply but that's the general idea)?** I'm really trying to secure my future in this field so I don't want to mess anything up along the way. Also the lack of money shouldn't be an issue (I'm probably going to figure out how to invest in order to make it work)"

Advice on job hunting for new-RDs,LEE_FORDHAM46,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/5xce8k/finally_employed_advice_on_job_hunting_for_newrds/,"It has been a long time coming, but finally excited to have accepted a job offer last week at an upscale senior living community!  

I completed my DI in Oklahoma which finished in July and headed back to my hometown of Philadelphia, PA in search of a job.  While keeping in mind that it may be more difficult to find a job on the east coast in a major city, I was optimistic that I would find ""the perfect job"" in no time.  I was confident in my skills, have a great personality, am a male dietitian, and my preceptors seemed to like me.  I started applying to jobs in the clinical field, landed 2 or 3 interviews within the first month.  The interviews went well, walked out of every interview feeling that I would be a great candidate.  I would follow up with a thank you email and sometimes a phone call expressing how interested I was.  A month goes by and still nothing.  At this point I look for a job as a bartender, since I know this isn't going so well.  This would help supplement my income while I looked for a job.  This ended up working out really well for me and provided sufficient income.  Christmas time comes and now, I must have applied to about 100 jobs and landed about 5-6 interviews in 5 months.  At this time, all my friends have gotten jobs, I get a little depressed.  The routine was getting very tedious....waking up, looking and applying for jobs, waiting, waiting, and doing the same thing the next day.  At a certain point I started applying for every job I saw, even if I wasn't interested in, because at that point I would take anything I was given.  This actually turned out to be a great idea.  

After over 150 job applications, only a handful of interviews, and 7 months later I landed a job which was the perfect fit for me.  It was a Nutrition Care Manager at an up-scale senior living community.  It incorporates about 75% managerial dietetics and 25% clinical dietetics (seeing patients).  After many clinical dietitian interviews, it dawned on me that clinical dietetics is kind of a dead end profession and the day-to-day is a lot of the same, and the respect for dietitians as a professional in acute-care is not held by many.  The managerial aspect allows me to advance through the company in years to come, which is great because advancement and reaching higher-pay is a serious problem in dietetics.  After 18 months I'll have opportunities to relocate overseas, which is attractive to me as single adventurous male.  Also, while still seeing about 10 patients per week, I will be able to keep up my clinical skills.  Long-term care and senior living was really what I was looking for and I had no idea, also it pays much better than an acute-care position.  

*So I do have some advice for Interns and job seeking RD*s:

* Do as many job interviews as you can, even if you're not interested in the job, this will help give you interview practice.  Soon enough you will be able to anticipate the questions and have your well crafted answer ready.
 
* Stay in the area where you did your DI, this will **REALLY** help with connections and recommendations.  This is really important and probably my biggest mistake.  Don't think you can just land a job fresh out of a DI in no time.  

* It's all about who you know, not what you know.  
 
* No matter how discouraged you get, power through it and wake up everyday with a new attitude.
 
* Network in your area, I didn't do this as nearly as much as I should've because I'm pretty introverted....however I know this is a huge part of landing a job.  Again, it really is all about who you know, not what you know.

* Have several people look over your resume and cover letters preferably someone in the profession or someone that hires candidates

* Don't lose track of your profession and what you worked so hard for!

tl;dr finding a job fresh out of a DI is exhausting and tough.  7 months and 150 applications later I found the perfect job.

5xciss,12,2017-03-03,Never Look it in the Eyes,EM_Bond,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5xciss/never_look_it_in_the_eyes/,"I am telling this tale to the best of my recollection. No longer having the audio files that I stumbled across, I must do my best to tell you this story from memory. For me, it started on a hiking trip through the Florida Everglades. Camping and hiking are passions of mine. I’m outdoors any chance I can get. A couple of months ago, I went backpacking through the everglades and camped in some of the primitive sites the park has to offer. Feeling a little adventurous, I went off trail for a few nights. 

Normally, going off trail is a bad idea, especially in the Everglades. Several people have been lost in there, never to be seen again. Not to mention, the myriad of dangerous animals like alligators and crocodiles. 

I was fine, however. But during one of my nights camping off trail, I came across a small clearing that looked like it had been used as a campsite previously. There was a small pit in the ground with dusty embers inside. Other than a few small pieces of trash, it was empty. I thought I had missed the campers by mere days. 

I pulled the tent out of my bag and set it up in the middle of the clearing and used the already dug pit as my fire pit. Collecting a decent amount of firewood, I settled in for the night. Nothing of major importance happened that night but in the morning I stumbled across something…strange. 

A few feet away from the fire pit, I found another patch of disturbed Earth. While investigating, I realized it was a buried box. Removing the small, orange shovel- usually reserved for restroom purposes-I uncovered a green plastic box. Opening it, I found an audio recorder inside. It was strange but I didn’t think too much of it. Grabbing the recorder, I pressed play. 

I was greeted by the sound of a man describing some sort of ecological trip they were conducting. It seemed like research notes of some kind. Interested, I scooped the recorder up and dropped it in my pack. Placing the box back in the hole, I broke down my site and continued on my way.

Like I said before, nothing of importance happened on this trip. It was when I got home I found out how disturbing the files actually were. I will now recount the audio that I found on those files to the best of my ability and hopefully in the correct order. 

“This is Dr. Alan Crane with Cathy Cumberland,” the male voice on the recorder said. “We are documenting this trip with audio devices to better gather our research.” I could hear shuffling around as if some papers were being pushed aside. 

“Hey, don’t touch that,” said a female voice that I assumed was Cathy Cumberland.

“I need the space for my recorder. You want to get everything documented, right?” 

“Yes, but-“ 

“Now, now. Don’t give me any lip.” 

“Shut the hell up, Alan.” 

It was obvious the pair didn’t get along. I wondered why it was they were working together. Then the male voice spoke again, “Ah, and this is my intern Laura.” 

“You mean my intern,” Cathy shouted. 

“Nope, mine.” Alan whispered to the device. “Say hi, Laura.” 
A shy voice in the distance said hello.

“She is coming with us on this expedition to learn more about our particular field. Care to explain what it is we are studying, Laura?” 

She mumbled something about audio experimentation but seemed too shy to continue. Alan pulled the recorder away and pressed it close to his face saying, “That’s Ok, I’ll explain it since I’m the only one here who really understands it.” 

I don’t quite remember exactly how he explained it, a lot of it went over my head. But from what I could gather, they were studying levels of what they referred to as “sound pollution” deep in the Everglades. I guess there was a theory that sound produced by modern society was actually causing a shift in the ecosystem. Certain animals were no longer found in their normal habitats near busy cities and instead traveled deeper into the woods. This sets off a chain reaction in the ecosystem and throws a lot of it out of sync. Animals that were normally nocturnal have been found hunting during the day and so on. From what it sounded like, they were planning to take a backpacking trip into the Everglades with audio equipment and try and take “samples” to see how the audio levels were affecting the ecosystem. 

Not much happened in the first audio file. Alan talked more about the expedition and the type of data they would be collecting. I remember he spoke in a sort of arrogant way, almost as if he thought he was the smartest person in the room. I could tell his colleague, Cathy, didn’t take kindly to this and they hardly ever got along. 

On the second audio file, Alan was introducing another man by the name of Sean. Apparently, he was an entomologist. “State your name and profession for the record please,” Alan said into the recorder. 

“My name is Sean Whitcomb. I’m an entomologist.” 

“Bug scientist, in layman terms,” Alan teased. 

“Sure, you can call it that.” 

“And why are you tagging along with us on this trip? “ 

“To collect data about local insect species and how their patterns are disrupted at night due to audio vibrations caused by neighboring geographical locations of the human variety.” 

“In other words, to see if the bugs get pissed at the loud noises from cities.” Alan joked. 

“Correct.” 

He seemed like a shy guy as well. Him and Laura the intern would probably get along. Farther along on the files one last person was introduced. Again, Alan asked him to state his name and profession and why he was there for the “expedition record.” 

“I’m Brian Hunt, zoologist. I guess I’m doing the same thing everyone else is. Studying the local ecosystem where animals are concerned.” 

“That’s right, folks,” Alan interrupted. “We have an animal scientist, bug scientist, my intern, and two acousticians. We’re heading out into the Everglades with our expensive equipment to study audio patterns and have the zoologist and entomologist here to compare their data with ours.” 

He spoke sarcastically as if he didn’t like the others tagging along. I figured it was because he felt he could do a better job all by himself, but maybe it was because he had a thing for his colleague, Cathy, and saw the other two men as a threat. 

The rest of the audio followed the group preparing for the trip and heading out in one vehicle together. There was a lot of banter during the drive out. I think Alan was recording most of the trip without everyone’s knowledge. I’m not sure why he wanted all of it recorded, but maybe he just really liked to hear himself talk. 

Regardless, nothing of any major importance happened until the next audio file. They had camp all set up and night was falling. Their audio equipment had been set up deep in the woods, far from their campsite. Alan must have flipped his recorder back on and I heard them sitting around a crackling campfire talking and telling stories. Alan told some stupid story about the Florida Skunk Ape. I remember Brian, the zoologist, laugh about it and tell him why the animal didn’t exist. 

It was around this time something happened that terrified me. Cathy said she was going to hike out to the audio equipment to make sure everything was running properly before heading off to bed. None of the others decided to go with her, probably not wanting to make the trip out there. Cathy didn’t seem worried, however and headed off by herself. I listened to this part so many times, wishing I could tell her to turn around. I begged she wouldn’t find whatever it was she found out there. 

The ones left at camp, save for Laura who had gone off to bed, sat around the fire still talking. I can’t remember what it was they were talking about, but I remember the scream. It was a blood curdling cry unlike any other I had ever heard in my life. What was weird, it seemed to cut off as if the sound itself had been plucked out of the air. It was Cathy. 

Alan must have grabbed the recorder and slipped it in his pocket. Then next few minutes all I could hear was muffled shuffling around and what sounded like booming footsteps on the ground as if he were running. Finally, the recorder was pulled out of the pocket and I heard Alan say, “Cathy, what the hell is wrong? What are you looking at?” 

She mumbled something that I couldn’t hear and Alan asked again. “Please, turn around and tell us what you saw. A bear or something?” 

“A bear out here would be highly unli-“Brian started but Alan cut him off.

“No one cares, man. Cathy, what the hell was it?” 

Finally, I could hear Cathy turn around but what she was saying made no sense. 

“Darkness, utter darkness like I’ve never seen before. Green glowing orbs and silence. Oh god, the silence. I couldn’t even hear my own thoughts!” 

“If you’re pulling a prank on us, it’s not funny,” Brian said. 

Then something happened that was unnerving. The sounds of the woods around them ceased. The cicadas that chirped, the branches that swayed in the wind, even the faint chirps of bats as they fed stopped. All at once, there was silence. 

“What the hell?” Sean asked, noticing the silence. Then a sound broke over the recorder. It was utterly terrifying. It sounded like all of the sounds of the woods concentrated into one single wave of audio blasted in a stream, like someone had weaponized sound itself. I could hear them all scream and begin to run. 

They ran until they made it back to camp. Breathless, Alan said, “What the fuck was that thing?” 

“I’ve never seen anything like it before,” Brian said. 

“Cathy, is that what you saw out there? Is that why you screamed?” Alan asked. 

I heard a soft yes in return. 

“What the fuck?” Sean screamed. “It was like a shadow. Nothing but darkness. An outline of a person. You guys saw that, right?” 

“Yes,” Alan said. “But what about the eyes?” 

“Green orbs!” Brian shouted. “Just like Cathy said.” 

“It absorbed the sound, everything. How the hell could it do that? I’ve never heard of anything that can do that.” Alan rambled. 

They went on talking about the creature in hushed, terrified tones for a few more minutes. From their descriptions, I learned it was a tall, humanoid figure. Maybe about eight feet tall. It was completely dark, no color whatsoever. I pictured a shadow with a mind of its own. But it had bright green eyes that glowed like little spotlights in the middle of its pitch-black head. They said it could absorb sound in the area and push it forward in a focused cone of energy. 

“Get Laura out of her tent,” Alan screamed. “We’re getting the fuck out of here.” 

There was rustling and the sound of a tent being opened and then…

“Laura,” Alan began shouting. “She’s not in her tent. Where could she be.” 
My blood ran cold when I heard another scream on the file. It was Laura. Much like Cathy, it was loud and all at once silenced. Everyone began to talk over each other. I couldn’t understand a word. When the sounds of the forest slowly receded, I knew something was wrong. Desperately, I screamed at my computer screen for the group to run but they just stood there, questioning.
 
God, the silence was strange. All the sounds of the forest stopped in an instant. There was nothing. It shook me to my very core. As I waited for the inevitable wave of sound to return, a terrible thought crossed my mind. 

Whatever had happened on these files happened where I had camped only a few nights before. Whatever it was that attacked these people could have come after me. At least, I thought. Maybe the group had found a way to defeat it. I had to get to the end. I had to know what happened. 

The blast of sound did return and the audio file clicked off. I think the rest of the file was corrupted. Before it ended, however, there was this odd mechanical hiss. It reminded me of the sound an old cassette tape made when the film got caught. 

Trying to listen to the next file, I found it was corrupted as well. I was frantic. I wanted to know what was happening. I clicked on the next file and crossed my fingers. It started with the sound of a man sobbing. I recognized it as Alan. Leaves shuffled underneath him as he moved. 

“It took them,” he cried. “There was sound and darkness and then they were gone. All of them.” He continued to sob. “I tried to save them. I think it’s coming back for me.” 

Again, the sounds of the woods stopped. I could hear Alan jump to his feet and start running, panting as he went. He tried to explain what was happening, but I couldn’t understand him. He ran for the remainder of the file. When it ended, I quickly played the next.

“I think we lost it,” Brian was saying. I realized this file was out of order. From what I could gather, they ran shortly after being blasted by the sound wave. Laura wasn’t with them. They had left her out there. Left her to the fate of that thing. I guess I didn’t blame them. 

There wasn’t much of importance on this file. The group mostly walked and talked about the being they had seen. They argued about which way was out, which way was back. The last thing on the file was the sound of silence once again. It had returned. 

Only one file remained. I doubled clicked it and listened to the distressed voice of Alan. “I’m the only one left,” he stammered. “It’s coming back for me, I can feel it. I stumbled across our camp again. I’ve been trying to get out of these god damned woods for hours and I was walking in a fucking circle.” He laughed. “Perfect.” 

I heard the sound of something unzip. I figured it was his pack. 

“I’m going to bury this recorder. I know I won’t make it out of these woods. If someone should stumble across these, know what happened here. I don’t know if they’re dead but they’re all gone. Brian, Sean, Laura, and Cathy. It took them all. It was like a cloud of black smoke. It circled them. When the black fog cleared, they were gone. It took them one by one until only I was left. It’s going to take me too. No matter where I go, it will find me. I don’t know how I know that, I just do. Even if I made it out of these woods tonight, it would eventually find me.” 

My hands were actually shaking as I listened. I couldn’t believe something like this was actually happening. This shit didn’t really happen, did it? Maybe in movies but not real life. 

“To the person who finds this recorder, get away from here. Run. Don’t stop until you get out of these woods. If you happen upon this, this thing, don’t look it in the eyes. Those green orbs are the death of you!” 

With that, the file ended and that was it. There was nothing else. 

Dumbfounded, I looked up the people from the recordings. All of them are missing. Their equipment had been found in the woods. The sensitive audio equipment they had used had all been scrambled. It seemed the only thing that had survived the attack was the recorder. 

I had planned to take the recorder to the police. I thought they should hear what was on it. Maybe they could figure out what the hell was in the woods that night. Maybe they were all out there still and had a chance, though somehow, I knew it wasn’t true. They were most likely gone. I locked the recorder away in my desk and went to bed, terrified to dream of the creature. 
When I awoke in the morning, the recorder was gone. The desk was locked but the recorder was no longer in it. I have no fucking clue where the damn thing went. What’s worse, the audio files I had copied to my computer were gone too. Any proof I had that some creature had taken that group of people was gone. Who had taken it? In my mind, there was only one explanation. It was the creature. It had come for the proof of its existence. Does it know about me? Will it be watching me now? 

I sit here now, writing this here. No one else would believe but I figured you all might. It’s been a day since the recorder went missing. Thinking that I only misplaced it, I tore my house apart. It wasn’t there. I think it wants to come for me. Last night, the noise outside my bedroom window stopped. I buried my face in the pillow and stayed that way all night. Whatever happens, I will do my best to never look it in the eyes.

5xcvhn,1,2017-03-03,Overachieved or Underachieved,Mysterio446,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/5xcvhn/overachieved_or_underachieved/,"Today is my birthday, I turned 30. Since I was a kid I had always loved this day, waking up on this day make me feel hopeful and happy within. Today I remembered a thought which I had in my early 20's that the day I will turn 30 I will reach a certain stage in my life, which I named it ""Successful"". But looking at myself today I feel confused as to whether I have Overachieved or Underachieved. The feeling of Overachieved is because I have came a long way from what I was 10 years back, moved to a different country, got my Masters degree, out of all odds landed a internship in one of the dream companies straight out of University, manage to land in well earning jobs. No Debt at this day, took care of a family finances as a responsible Man. The proud feeling in family eyes definitely make me feel I have achieved something good.

The feeling of Underachieved is because I read somewhere in My early 20's and I started believing that the age of 20 to 30 is what decides if you have been successful or not. In my early 20's successful for me meant a lot of money, respect, power etc. Today when I look at my savings or investments they are good but not extra-ordinary as what myself in 20's would not call it successful. I don't feel that I have achieved something extra ordinary, probably might be that I got used to what I have achieved so far, I don't know. I had this feeling of doing something different but I have never been able to show that feeling the day-light of implementation. Was my early 20's too naive to quantify the meaning of Successful? Why I am following that feeling of achieving something more? I am not sure what I am chasing? but I am sure that I am chasing something?"
5xcwl3,0,2017-03-03,"[Career] Was offered an internship last summer, then cancelled a few weeks before.",thegb3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5xcwl3/career_was_offered_an_internship_last_summer_then/,"I have been reading some great career advice on this subreddit and thought this would be relevant and hopefully, I can get some advice.

This happened last summer, yes quite a while back but I figured I may as well get it out of my mind by getting an answer. I was offered an internship by a tech startup around Jan 2016. The internship was supposed to go from June-Aug 2016. But a few weeks prior to the start (in May) the CEO emails me saying they don't have funding and cancelled the internship offer.

It was all in writing and I still have the letter. It was quite upsetting because I had basically stopped searching for internships after signing it, thinking I could focus more on my academics instead and really was looking forward to the internship. I didn't really have a backup option for that summer (especially since it happened just a couple weeks before) so it was frustrating.

My question is: Is this legal and is there anything I can (still) do? There was no other reason for cancelling the internship apart from them not having the funding. They said they had gotten $500k in seed funding, which must have been a lie. I believe the thought process was that they were hoping to get that much money by the time the internship came around. I know they got some funding, perhaps around $10k, but I highly doubt it was in the $500k figure. In hindsight, it was foolish on my part since they were just around for 2 years and didn't really have a track record of success or revenues to show. I kind of just took their word for it.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: In case it helps, the offer was for $30/hour, no real benefits (i.e. no free food, transportation, etc.). The startup is registered in Delaware but located in California. They have gone through an accelerator. They have a board of advisors but they didn't really help, even when I tried contacting one of them, nothing much happened and the issue was kind of dropped (the advisor himself left the startup too).

EDIT 2: Also, one thing I'm curious about is if this has happened to other people and if they had done anything about it (like trying to reach out to offers they had previously declined)."

I met someone at a show who is the senior engineer for a luxury goods company that offered me to apply for a summer internship after mentioning to him that I'm a CS student at a top tier school. He invited me to take a look at their offices soon after, which I did, and we had a sort of informal mix of an interview and hang out that went well. He forwarded my resume to the HR dept and a recruiter followed up with me for a 20 minute phone interview. I was told they exclusively code in Javascript. They asked if I had any experience with Javascript and I was honest, telling them I only spent around 50 hours learning and using it during the summer for an online code camp. I did tell them I've used Java and C in classes, though. I made it to the next round phone interview, which was with an engineer. He had told me they code exclusively in Javascript and had asked again what my experience was with Javascript. I had described some of my coursework and the languages I've used, but there were no technical or screening questions at all. I had passed that round too and now I'm at what seems like the final round, apparently a 2.5-3.5 hour interview at the HQ. What sort of things will they likely test me on or what do they expect from me, given how little I know Javascript? I've checked out their Glassdoor questions but I'm unsure how much would apply to me given my position. Thanks in advance."

It's jokingly called ""The Fresh Meeting.""  Like ""Fresh Meat?""  Yeah, I don't think it's funny either.  In this case, we met in the main conference room over Tim Horton's coffee and some succulent, fresh Timbits.  That's really why everyone comes to these, anyway.  You met all 27 of us, and I'm sure it was a blur of forgotten names and small talk.  Our start-up is pretty tight-knit, but we're still a little uneasy after having to fire our last IT guy, Theo.  Apparently, he wasn't a cybersecurity expert at all and was embezzling some company funds.  He didn't even clean out his desk when he left in handcuffs.

Anyway, I'm sure you'll do better than he did while he was here.  Just make the WiFi works, and you're all right in my book.  If you need anything, I'll be in my office.  Welcome aboard!  I'll send you an email in a few minutes to make sure your company account is working.  Try to get settled at your desk in the meantime.  Throw out any of Theo's stuff you don't like!

*In the bottom drawer of Theo's desk are several items: a pocketwatch, a crystal pendant, a pocket metronome, a small spiral disk attached to a fan, and a small, black book.*

The book contains the following handwritten pages:

-------------

**Amanda**, Marketing Director, 26, Blonde/Blue, Glasses, Caucasian, Athletic

Progress notes: I have snuck the app onto Amanda's phone with several modules.

Modules: ""Hypnosis susceptibility"" ""The crystal makes me sleep and obey"" ""Sexy underwear belongs under work outfits""

Notes: Amanda seems to be most affected by subtle control and conversational hypnosis.

Personal: Former college cheerleader at a religious college, likely a virgin.

-------------

**Jessica**, Quality Assurance Lead, 29, Black/Brown, Asian, Athletic/Curvy

Progress notes: I have installed the software on Jessica's laptop with several modules.

Modules: ""Hypnosis susceptibility"" ""The watch makes me sleep and obey"" ""Breasts are for pleasuring my hypnotist""

Notes: Jessica falls deeply and quickly while staring at the crystal if you overwhelm her with words.

Personal: Second generation from a strict upbringing, often dresses conservatively in the office.

-------------

**Sarah**, Social Media Intern, 24, Brown/Hazel, Caucasian, Athletic

Progress notes: I repaired Sarah's Smart TV with a special component that injects malicious modules.

Modules: ""Hypnosis susceptibility"" ""The metronome makes me sleep and obey"" ""Wearing sexy boots makes me horny""

Notes: Sarah responds best to physical stimuli while hearing a metronome at 60bpm.  Gently rubbing both earlobes is most effective.

Personal: Sarah generally insists on wearing flats because of her height (5'8"")

-------------

**Rana**, CTO, 25, Brown/Brown, Lebanese, Athletic

Progress notes: I have not managed to alter any of her electronics.  Will attempt hypnodisk at some point.

Modules: 

Notes: Practices guided meditation in her office every afternoon.
Personal: Willing to try many fads for her personal well-being, frequently fasts from technology.

The highest paying offer that I've received thus far is a software engineering internship at JHU APL, more specifically in the cybersecurity group, but I have a few concerns about the position. First off, I'm worried that things could get very bureaucratic due to the nature of the work. Also, I'm curious as to how a position like this would look to the Big 4 and similar companies, as I am planning on applying to such positions for Summer 2018. I've received a few offers from startups in the area that seem like they might offer better experience as they have great culture, let their interns be more hands on, and make most of their software open source where interns can be seen as contributors. I feel as if I would have much stronger portfolio at the end of the summer working at one of these startups, as most work I would do at APL would be confidential. However, the startups I've received offers from pay significantly less and are widely unknown. Being this is my first internship, what option do you think would be the best to jump-start my career?"

Aside from venting, does anyone know if there will be more course expansions, or any past experience with the likelihood of getting off the waitlist. I'm 4th on the waitlist for a course with 100 seats, and 17th for a course with 210."

This is my first post here. Figured I would give this a shot, maybe see if anyone has some advice...

I'm 21, live alone, parents pay for my apt. They live 2,000 miles away. Was going to community college, couldn't take it anymore. As soon as you stepped on campus, you could tell everyone resented the place. There were some good professors there, but it wasn't the norm. It was always hard to stay motivated, and I got incredibly burnt out. A family member I was incredibly close to passed away during finals week, and it completely killed any motivation I had left. Figured I'd take this semester off, get a job (or two), apply to colleges, apply for my second summer internship, and by September, I'd be away from it all, happy, no longer burnt out, and ready to fulfill my dreams.

In the middle of January, my car died on me. The transmission was/is shot, $2k to repair. Neither myself nor my parents had/have the money to fix it, so it's still dead. I live in a fairly rural area, so I'm pretty much confined to the house unless one of my two friends can drive me places/hang out with me. My parents were on their way to fix it, and then...

I tried to send out my transcripts to the colleges I'm applying to, but I couldn't. We owe $3k to the school, so there's a hold on my account. At this point, trying to come up with $3k is so out of reach that it might as well be $1,000,000. So now I'm stuck at home with no car, no internships have called me back, and no ""light at the end of the tunnel"" of me getting out of this place, continuing my education elsewhere. I just got a job I can walk to, I start next week. I'm about $4k in credit card debt (wisdom teeth surgery), so I'm trying my best to pay that off. There's no feasible way I could pay off my school in time with a part time job, seeing as the latest application date schools need the transcripts in a months time. All of the schools that I've applied to don't accept spring transfers, so it's looking like I have to wait over a year. I'm pretty dead-set on those schools since I've done countless hours of research into them, and their programs are exactly what I want.

While all of this has been going on, I've had a friend completely stop talking to me, and I caught two others making fun of my inability to finish school on Facebook. Needless to say, they're out of my life too. To top it all off, last night, someone I had been seeing for the last 7 months said he wanted to go separate ways. He lived fairly far away and there was a bit of an age gap, said he didn't see a future with me. He was my way out, even before any of this happened.

I'm only so well aware that the only way out of this is money. School is everything to me, and I've already taken 4 years to get through 2 years of college due to financial issues. It seems like I can only depend on myself, because my parents are notorious for mismanaging money. It's really hard to stay positive when I'm virtually alone in all of this, and with each passing day, I'm feeling less and less like this will actually get better. Getting even a little bit of help from other family members for help is out of the question. Despite the fact that I've had multiple accomplishments that would easily prove to anyone that I'm very serious about my education, their opinion on the matter is that it's my parent's job to send me to school, and they won't pick up on their slack. I can understand it to a degree, but I'm clearly biased.

Anyway, I just want to thank you for reading this. Even if this doesn't get any replies, it's nice just getting it all out. I'm simply feeling incredibly stuck in one place, and my way out of this environment, transferring in the fall, is no longer an option. I feel like if one more bad thing happens, I'll be pushed over the edge."
5xew4z,1,2017-03-03,On Campus Social Life?,b00gerbrains,UAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAH/comments/5xew4z/on_campus_social_life/,"Hi,

I'm an out-of-state student considering attending UAH for my Freshman year starting in 2017. As a computer science major, I really like the opportunities that the school offers as far as academics, internships, and research goes. I also visited the campus over the summer and was very impressed with the facilities.

However, I am a little concerned about the social aspect of living on campus as an OOS student. I have heard that UAH is a ""commuter school,"" however I have also heard that description is becoming less accurate as the school grows.  
  
What is the campus life like? Are there plenty of activities and groups to be a part of? What is the campus like on weekends?

Thank you for your help!"

So, I've been accepted for Computer Engineering at UIUC, GT and Purdue. Overall, UIUC would have the highest cost at $27,000. Whereas GT and Purdue would end up at around $20,000-$22,000.

Are there any specific benefits of UIUC in contrast to the others? Specifically career fairs, internships and co-ops as an undergrad. I plan to get a MS degree as well, if that's of any help.


Another question I have is how hard is it to find a part-time job on campus as a freshman at UIUC?


Edit: To clarify - CE as in computer Engineering

I have applied through websites, been to career fairs and done pretty much everything I could do to secure an internship or co-op since sophomore year, but have had no luck in any of them so far. I have pretty decent GPA ~3.75 and have a couple undergraduate research experiences. It looks like for most internship opportunity out there, people with prior experience are preferred and it seems like I won't ever be able to find an internship before graduation. Co-op is pretty much not an option since I will only have two rotating terms available and most companies want at least three.

Because of this, I've been thinking of going to grad school instead of trying to look for jobs that never seem to be within my reach. Do you think this is a good idea or should I just keep spamming hundreds of more resumes?

As far as programming goes, I don't have much experience other than a few Udacity courses and an intro to CS course by MIT. A few questions:

1. What should I do to better prepare for college during the summer? I feel like I'm going to be way behind others.


2. I received CTCI as a gift from friends would starting to read that help me out now or is it too early? I haven't opened it atall yet.

3. My goal is to try to land a programming internship/job my freshmen year summer so what should I focus on now to make that a reality?(I know internships are rare for freshmens)

4. Should I start practicing on Leetcode/Hackerrank to get experience for interviews?

Also I know that I should enjoy my last summer in high school so I don't plan on just focusing on this 24 hours a day, I just want to prepare and get ahead if possible. Thank you!"
5xfevs,0,2017-03-04,Sent out over 300 applications..Struggling to find an internship. Don't want to graduate with 0 experience,theofficialLlama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xfevs/sent_out_over_300_applicationsstruggling_to_find/,So basically long story short I go to a pretty reputable school. Not ivy league but definitely not a no-name. Over the past couple months I've sent out well over 300 applications and have had a handful of interviews but I'm getting nervous that I'll be totally boned if I graduate with 0 internship experience. I will be graduating next May and started off  as a business major so I didn't have the full 4 years to be grinding out internship applications every semester. I'm really passionate about CS in general and cant wait to get into industry but I feel that the disadvantage of not having an internship is way real. I'm putting in the time and the work to actually apply anywhere and everywhere but time to land an internship position is dwindling down. Anyone in the same boat as me ? Anyone have some suggestions as to where to go from here?
5xfll2,5,2017-03-04,Has anyone ever suddenly left without notifying their parents?,alugo6555,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5xfll2/has_anyone_ever_suddenly_left_without_notifying/,"Im 20 years old and I'm thinking of leaving my toxic abusive relationship and never coming back once I get a job and save up money. I'm thinking once I save enough money up, I'm gonna have a friend drive to my house when my dad is gone one day and I can pack all my stuff and quickly jump in the car and they can drive away hopefully a couple hours before dad comes home. I'll ask my friend to drive me to the airport so I can take a plane to another state like Hawaii (I've always wanted to go to Hawaii) or just any state far away from Arizona so I can be far from my dad now that I realize he really doesn't love me even tho he has told me that. I just have to get out of that house. I can't live with someone that doesn't really love me, I always thought he did until I realized it was only conditional. I been unemployed for over a year now and had a lot of job rejections but now I'm with this employment agency so I hope maybe after the internship I have for 3 months, they can help me find a job. It might be another year before I move out but I wanna move out unexpectedly when he's not home one day and just leave so he doesn't cling to me and stop me. It might take another year living with him since I need to get a real job saving money first so I can afford an apartment in Hawaii or another state. This is my plan. I'm terrified he might find me somehow or call the cops and they might find me and when they do, dad could lock me up in my room forever even tho I'm an adult. I have no friends or other relatives to stay with except maybe my mom but she has issues too. She might be a narcissist as well. Dad told me once that if I ever run away, he will catch me and break my phone and take everything out of my room and lock me in my room. This scares me but once I save all my money up after getting a job then I want leave and take a flight to another state and never come back again. I'll try it when I have had my job for awhile if I get one soon after my internship ends. Does leaving unexpectedly when he's not home sound like a good idea? I can't take us calling each other names and him not apologizing anymore. I call him names first a lot but only cause I get sick of him criticizing me about what I'm doing wrong all the time or picking on my weight even tho yes I'm obese I won't lie but im trying to lose it. He's also insensitive so I call him names for that and calls me names back and I apologize, he doesn't. He says I'm the one who abuses him but I think we abuse each other, he just doesn't think he's abusive as well. He can seem like a real loving dad to me, even in private but he still criticizes me constantly about eating to much or being lazy cause I lay in my room a lot. I'm trying to get away from him and I'm gonna start going for walks more. I want therapy to control my anger so I don't call anyone names anymore but dad doesn't want me to get therapy since he doesn't think they help even tho he's been to therapy about his ptsd before. I can't stand this relationship now that I figured him out some more so I need to move out soon even if it takes a year to save up enough money to leave. Have you guys ever left your N parents unexpectedly and never came back? Were you afraid to get caught? How did you feel? What happened? Is this a good idea? "
5xfmjx,7,2017-03-04,"Cornell or Waterloo, is the cost worth it?",Confusedstudent1357,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/5xfmjx/cornell_or_waterloo_is_the_cost_worth_it/,"I have been accepted at Cornell, yet it dawned upon me that as an international student My parents will have to pay USD 280,000(probably more) for four years. Although they could pay, I don't want to burden them like that. I am a Canadian citizen living in America, and a perspective cs student.

Looking at the Waterloo application, I have some questions:
1. Do they only look at GPA? I go to a small school that doesn't offer math beyond ap calc ab(which I took junior year), so would they still look at my senior year grade GPA or sat? Is it cumulative high school GPA or junior and senior year only?
2. for someone who is not a mathematical genius, how manageable is the cs circulum(how many hours a week do u study)
3. Should I apply for the co-op or graduate in 4 years. Is the extra year in lost wages worth the additional internship experience?
4. What's the overall cost of attendance( how much is the cost of living, the website never specified)?
5. have you ever regretted picking Waterloo?

I have found that I can take the opportunity to pursue a one year graduate program to attain a Master's in Computational Science at little cost besides a year of my time and grueling study (I suppose the opportunity cost of my first year salary in industry as well). I do have an interest in large scale computation and programming, and I am currently working as an Analytics Intern at an Oil Industry leader. My questions to whoever has the insight: Is it worthwhile to pursue this Master's? Would it give me a leg-up on competition/salary?

5xfxyl,2,2017-03-04,My life is slowly but surely going downhill and I feel like I'm going to implode,LilWrench97,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5xfxyl/my_life_is_slowly_but_surely_going_downhill_and_i/,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting on this subreddit. My first time venting about my life on any site, for that matter. I currently see a therapist, and the stuff I'm about to say I couldn't even bring myself to tell him. Because that would mean I would have to say it out loud, and face it.

I am a 19 year old man, currently going to college and studying computer science. However, the reasons for my depression start way back in middle school and highschool. I'm a chubby guy, not that that matters much, but that was my first source of self-esteem issues. I'm smart, but I always had a hard time making friends. I'm not sure what it was in middle school, but my one older brother had a large influence on me growing up. Whatever he liked, I liked. He was about the same weight as me, but liked sports. So, I liked sports too. I tried to make friends with kids through rec basketball and soccer, which worked somewhat, but I never EVER had what some people call a best friend. Even in middle school I had weak relationships. I was bullied in middle school for my weight, and that further compounded my hate for myself. I was a good student however, and got straight A's. Then came highschool.

By the time I got into highschool, most of the other kids my age already had concrete circles and cliques. I did not. I did join theater with my brother and loved that, and made some friends through choir and theater, but I always had the nagging feeling that I was the ""new"" friend and was already coming in to established circles of best friends. Again, I had no one to call a best friend. I still got good grades however, straight A's freshman year. But that's when my life started to take a major turn for the worse.

I guess I should mention that I've always loved video games. Played playstation, gameboy, DS, xbox, starting from around 1st grade up till now, they were my crutch to get enjoyment out of life while other kids were hanging out with friends and being invited to things. I'm not sure when I truly developed my depression, but it was probably sometime around Sophomore year. I was still getting good grades, but I noticed my procrastination getting worse and worse. I would wait till the last minute to do assignments because I was on the internet watching youtube or playing games. I ended up getting all A's and one B at the end of the year, but the damage  was done. Coming into Junior year I was becoming better friends with kids from choir class, but I was still the awkward outside friend. I wasn't getting made fun of for my weight, but I was often the butt of jokes. I was an easy target. I was the only overweight person in my friend group (the friend group who had been best friends for years before I started talking to them) and they were all extremely outgoing and attractive people. One thing that hurt particularly bad was one of my friends, who I shall give the name Carl, was the closest person I could say was my best friend. Except he already had a best friend, Jason. They were inseparable. I was always the third wheel when I hung out with them or the friend group. Carl I had met through theater and choir, and was very nice, but Jason was the leader of the friend group persay, and the bulk of the jokes towards me were made by him. For the life of me I don't know why. I would ask myself why would he make fun of me so much, what did I do? We had a lot in common, we both liked video games and anime and choir, but I felt like such an outsider. I couldn't get new friends because there wasn't anyone else. If I abandoned this circle that I started in Sophomore year, I would be utterly alone. So I stuck it out. I guess I was pretty anti-social, as I hardly ever texted anyone or used snapchat, or instagram or twitter. I would always think that people would judge me, and it became so that I never sent a text because people were so used to me not contacting them that I feared they wouldn't care. It would seem so out of place, so out of character. Everytime someone would talk about the snaps they were getting it would kill me inside because I wanted to be social, to be in on these snapchats but no one sent them. I can't blame them either, because I never really sent them to my friends in the first place. 

Anyway, Junior year was when my grades started to slip big time. My procrastination got to the point where I would stay up till 3 or 4 am on my laptop instead of doing homework, and my grades slipped hard. This is when I realized I might have depression or addiction to the internet, and I started seeing my current therapist. I have been on anti-depression meds ever since, and I honestly do not know if they are helping. He helped for a while, but senior year was basically the same issue. Then came college. I had no idea what I wanted to do and I didn't feel like I was smart anymore. I didn't have anything I was good at. My parents kept pushing me to join some type of engineering because it paid well, and I kind of liked some of the computer science classes I took in high school, so I chose that. However, my problems with the internet and procrastination doubled. I ended rooming with Carl and Jason in a dorm, it was originally going to be just me and Carl but Jason decided last minute that he would want to go to OSU. I feel like the only reason he was rooming with us was to be with Carl. We had a lot of fights, and when we would be in new groups of friends we made in the dorm, and he would still make me the butt of jokes. However, he would also sometimes be really nice and we had so many things in common that he and Carl were the only other people who I could talk to about the things I liked. It would be off and on him being nice then being a dick then being nice. Luckily he joined a frat so he was away a lot, but I was back to being anti-social. I was kind of included into a group of friends from my dorm, but somehow found myself the same awkward friend no one invited to do anything. Starting my sophomore year I got an apartment with Carl and one of the other ""friends"" from my dorm who we only picked because we really needed a roommate. I started failing classes but ended up retaking them and getting ok grades. I have no idea if I actually like computer science or not, and it's becoming so hard and tedious. I never hang out with people, and no one ever invites me anywhere anymore. Jason comes around a lot mostly to talk to Carl, and the worst part is it feels like the group of friends I made in the dorm has completely forgotten about me. This would be less painful if not for the fact that Mark, the other roommate, is deep in that friend group and plays video games with them all the time. I sit in my room and here him laughing and playing and talking with them, and I'm not and it kills me inside. I don't know what to do. I feel like it's too late to change majors because I don't even know if I like computer science, I don't know if I'm good at it because I never really try due to my procrastination, and It's too late to get new friends. I have no idea how I would start to strenghen the relationships with the people I already know. I continue to do bad in school, and I need to keep good grades in order to get this internship that will pay for my college. I feel like I can't quit computer science because if I do my parents won't be able to pay for my college debt without those internships. My days consist of skippin/sleeping through lectures, going to some classes, getting on the computer and watch youtube/anime/facebook hours on end. The only video games I play anymore are rpg games on my phone, and I hate my life. I feel like it's too late to fix anything and I'm sinking. 

Sorry for this rant about my life story, I just didn't know where to put it and I need to get this out somewhere. No one knows this part about my life except me."
5xg1lk,1,2017-03-04,"Me [24 M] with girl I have been seeing and now talking to long-distance [24 F] of 5 months, asking her about the lack of communication as of late.",giddy23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5xg1lk/me_24_m_with_girl_i_have_been_seeing_and_now/,"So this girl that I have been talking to long distance after several months of dating has not been communicating with me as frequently as it used to be. We met while I was in that area for an internship and we immediately clicked. I learned that went to college in my hometown and wanted to move back to that area to pursue better career opportunities.

We soon started dating, not really knowing how far it was gonna go and we eventually were dating exclusively. Essentially BF and GF though not official yet. When my internship was over I moved back home and we continued to talk through texting, snapchat, and occasional facetime.

Lately though she has been really hard to communicate with in a meaningful way. We snapchat everyday but you can hardly have a conversation and catching each other up on each other lives through that. Facetime has been most meaningful way of talking like we were in person.

I just find it strange. I feel like I'm doing all the work in wanting to talk to her and not the other way around. I learned from our last facetime that she's for sure moving back up as she has gotten several job opportunities up her so I can't imagine that shes ghosting me or anything. I also don't want to assume the worst about the situation until I talk to her about how I'm feeling right now. 

How should I confront this girl about how communication between hasn't been good lately? Should I even try to fix it or tell her we should wait until she moves back up here to start something? I've never done anything like this before so I'm not sure how to approach this.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girl I've been talking to hasn't been really communicating lately except for snapchat. She is moving up to my area very soon so I can't think she's ghosting me. How do I approach this situation and tell her how I'm irritated by the lack of communication lately? "

I'm getting overpaid for my internship this summer, so I want to build the fastest computer I can for both general purpose, software engineering, and gaming - within a ~5K budget (5K preferably post-tax, that is), with all the bells and whistles and future-proofing and sheer *power* that I can possibly get.

**TL;DR**:

I have built a PC before, but I've been out of the game for some time.

* I will be purchasing this computer **mid June 2017** - is there any new hardware I should be on the lookout for?

* **Use cases** involve software engineering, general purpose, and gaming


* #### **[IMPORTANT]** I run a **144 Hz monitor** which has been giving me a **headache re. Ryzen**, as I'm not sure if an SLI 1080 Ti setup will remove the bottleneck enough to make FPS vs the 6900k a big deal. **This is what I'm really worried about,** as it dictates if I switch to AMD instead, which will be $1k cheaper.

* Silence is an issue for me, as I use open-back headphones

* It seems like I'll be running my GPUs in 8x instead of 16x PCI-E - is that something to worry about? Last I checked it didn't make a difference at all.

* RGB RAM because why the hell not?

* Already purchased the 850 Pro for my laptop some time ago.

As you can see, I'm not trying to cut any corners. I want to build something future-proof and something I can look at and go, 'wow!'. I realize it may be more cost-effective to periodically upgrade more often instead of going all-out, but part of the satisfaction of this build will be me being able to revel in just how insanely *fast* the computer is."

5xghxd,4,2017-03-04,Offered a summer teaching internship. Requesting Advice!,nolin9889,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xghxd/offered_a_summer_teaching_internship_requesting/,"First time posting in this subreddit, so I apologize if I'm breaking any rules.

I'm a senior majoring in CS graduating this December at a mid-tier UC in southern california (i.e. not Berkeley). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get an internship in previous years. 

I know it's not ideal. But there were personal circumstances such that for all intents and purposes I started my CS major classes in the fall of 2015, so I didn't have enough CS knowledge to start looking until last summer. I wasnt able to find an internship last summer, so i opted to do a month of travel + a month of summer school instead. This year, I applied to more places and was rejected/ignored for a few internships. 

The only offer I have this summer is a position as instructor at iD Tech Camps. For those of you who haven't heard of this company, they offer week-long coding instruction to kids and teenagers in a camp setting, from June through early August. I'll be teaching a group 7-8 high school and middle school students how to code: languages like java, C++, or python &amp; raspberry pi depending on which class I end up teaching. This is for 8-6pm, five days a week, with a new group of students every week.

The position itself doesn't pay too much, though this doesn't really bother me. BUT I'm wondering if it's a worthwhile use of my summer. 

Pros, in my view:

1) Something to put on my resume. Not a software development position, but a whole lot better than nothing (?)

2) brush up on coding fundamentals; i've heard it said that teaching something is a good way to understand it yourself

3) improve my speaking and presentation skills, and help me become more social (am an introvert)


Cons:

1) Not a software development position, so not great on resume. Not sure how much of an impact it'll have in helping me find a job after graduation.

2) Opportunity cost--maybe the time could be better spent working on personal projects and practicing interview questions. Perhaps even travel to Europe instead?



I do have an interview with a company developing wi-fi diagnostics next Wednesday through my school's Team Internship Program. Needless to say, I'll do my best to get that position, but my school's giant population of CS undergrads makes these programs extremely competitive, so my chances isn't very high.

I'd like any and all advice. Should I take the teaching position, or do  personal projects to brush up my resume + study for interviews? Thanks.


TL;DR: is an internship teaching coding any good for my resume? Or should I spend my summer trying to do personal projects and study for coding interviews?


EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone! I ended up getting the software development internship at aforementioned company. Which is a good thing too, since the hiring manager at iD Tech never called me after the email offer and request for commitment details."

My career advisor said that I should have no problems getting a Summer engineering internship, and that I might be able to land a job with my science degree and background in CS. I want to get an engineering (or coding) job, but what would I be best suited for now or in the near future?

**My background:**

* 25, German citizenship
* will graduate with my Master's (Media Studies) in September. 
* previous work experience of three years in different jobs media-related /PR and communication
* no debt - but also no savings ...
* fluent in German, English

**My problem / wish / plan:**
Graduating in September, I cannot stand the idea of going back to my hometown and find a corporate job immediately. However, I know I will go back there eventually as I want to settle with my long-term boyfriend. Nevertheless, I am not ready for this yet and feel like I need some “adventure” or experience on my own, abroad, to grow and gain new perspectives before I try to set up a steady life for me. 
Call it Quarterlife Crisis, First-World-Problem or Travelbird Syndrome. 

To make the long story short for you:  I am searching for an opportunity to life abroad for 3-4 months. However, I need to find a way to fund this endeavour on the go. I bring some work experience and have searched for internships as they provide the possibility to work for a limited amount of time. However, 99% of them do not pay, especially in media-related fields … 

There is a knot in my head that says that because I have previous work experience, I must find something “qualified” that looks good on my CV. I know it is ridiculous, but I cannot get this twist out. Maybe someone has an idea? Also, I would absolutely work in retail or related, but it would be lovely if it was indoors. :D

Does anyone know of any opportunities to make a (small, short-term) living abroad? I am thankful for all opinions, advice and experiences as I feel stuck right now.



Thank you so so much!

5xief0,2,2017-03-04,Can get employer to pay for dev course (possibly) what to choose? (also need career advice),tigim101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xief0/can_get_employer_to_pay_for_dev_course_possibly/,"I posted this is r/learnprogramming, figured it would fit in better here.  
  
I'm in a unique position, I just graduated with a mechanical engineering degree in NYC, and the first job I was thrown was this ""data center engineer"" position, at this major financial institution (started in September), where I spent most of my time plugging in cables and racking servers. I had it before I graduated so I just took it so I could start paying off bills. Short story, it sucks and I see no growth in it.   
   
They also have this full stack application they use to monitor all their data centers globally, and I've been slowly pushing/getting pushed into doing that, possibly full time. It looks pretty simple on the front end side, and the back end is in C++. The backend is pretty reliable so far and it definitely needs a lot more love on the front end. It uses HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery. I got a 3 month stint where they are making me only work on this application full time, since it has basically been on life support for 2 years. Right now I'm mostly doing operational tasks that don't involve any coding, but I have the opportunity to pick it up. The people who wrote it (who moved on to do other things in the company and seems like they don't want to support it anymore) are saying I could possibly get the company to pay for some dev courses (probably a few thousand $$ max).     &amp;nbsp;    

So right now I basically have an opportunity to learn programming on my own (while getting paid), other than the basic upkeep of the application I have a lot of free time, and don't really have a boss right now. I'm thinking of turning this into a transitional opportunity for me, where I can learn development and then transition into a better software engineering job.     &amp;nbsp;  

What are some good online (maybe in person in NYC) courses that I should take? The two developers told me not to sell myself too short and pay for some super beginner web dev course that only has html and css, since I studied engineering and should pick up the basics pretty quickly. Seems like they prefer I learned fullstack.   
  
  &amp;nbsp;    


    

These are the options I see right now:      
    
Udacity Full stack with Uconnect (once/wk in person meetups) : $299/month (about 3 months completion)     

CodeAcademy ready, front end only: $500 OTP, 8 weeks     

Thinkful frontend, with once a week mentorship: $500 per month (about 3 months completion)      

General Assembly, frontend or javascript, in person 2x/wk in NYC. : $3950 OTP. (for this one they say javascript needs basics of HTML and CSS, maybe I could pick this up on my own beforehand?)    

   
   
&amp;nbsp;  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
  
   
Also what are your takes on me using this to transition into software development? I didn't do much internships, just two but they more gear towards construction and facilities. My GPA was a 3.6, went to a small state school that isn't too well known outside a few niche industries. Only programming kind of knowledge I have is some MatLab, which I used in a machine learning elective I took in my last semester.   

Also in case anyone is interested, compensation is:  
$60k base salary, + annual bonus (roughly 15% of base), + overtime over 40 hrs (time a half, roughy 43-44$/hr)  
   
Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks!"

So, I'm relatively new to the accounting profession. Currently, I'm working an accounting internship for a small non-issue firm in the last semester of my undergraduate. Recently, I have been tasked with the responsibility of designing an excel spreadsheet summing employee deducts by month for the year 2017. But here's the catch; in 2017, we will be differentiating between salaried and hourly employees, because there is at least one month in the coming year that will have 3 pay periods for biweekly employees. This is different from our previous format in 2016 when there was no such extra period and we formatted all employee deducts by month. 

I know this probably is a common problem with an obvious solution. Like I said, I'm still new to this and trying to learn every day. Hopefully I have provided enough information for some of you to help me with a solution. Any help is greatly appreciated, and I'll be responding to comments/PM's if any of you have questions. Looking to get this worked out ASAP! Thanks in advance.

5xis3v,2,2017-03-04,"I've had to watch my family fall apart from 1,200 miles away.",DecadesofSun,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5xis3v/ive_had_to_watch_my_family_fall_apart_from_1200/,"So I considered putting this in the venting sub-reddit because I'm expecting it to be long and less about depression itself and more on the events behind it, but I figured it would fit better here because it really is tied into why I'm a depressed nutcase.

About seven months ago my stepfather was killed in a vehicle accident on the Atlantic coast, on the exact opposite side of the country from where my family lives in Portland, Oregon. It caused a ripple effect throughout my family- in my case it prompted me to get hammered drunk (with subsequent vomiting all night long), attempt to off myself and come out publicly as having gender dysphoria, and it was only a few months after I moved far away from home for a year-long internship in another state. Immediately I had to take a month off work and return home to take care of my elderly grandfather (who my mom takes care of) while she rushed out east to deal with my stepdad's affairs. That entire month was awful for everyone involved, and once she returned and things settled down slightly, I had to go back to my internship. I visited again at Christmas to find her struggling to put up with Grandpa every day, hating the fact that he's there and her husband isn't. I've been worried for her mental health also- she has a wall with dry-erase boards normally for her artwork, which she filled with quotes my stepdad used to say as well as info about the men who murdered him (it was a hit-and-run and they were in the country illegally before bailing from the scene of the crime).

Since then things have only gotten worse. Mom has recently decided to sell our house and move back to another state to be closer to our family, though she has no place to go and no job to support herself. She's trying to put Grandpa in a home, but if she does we won't have enough savings to finance it, so our house will have to be sold anyway. I agreed to move back home after my internship ends in order to help her out, but I wasn't expecting her to move away so soon. She says the house haunts her with memories of her husband, and she wants to be gone before the one-year anniversary of his death. I expected she might move away down the road, but nowhere near this soon. I was making plans to go back to school this autumn and live at home to save money, but that won't happen if the house is gone. And I'm stuck where I'm at for one more month until my internship ends, watching everyone else around me landing newer, better jobs in the field and moving on with their lives while I'm forced to backtrack and deal with my family back home first. I lost a lot of opportunities for personal advancement when he died, and I feel like I've just wasted almost a year of my life as a result.

I don't know what to do. Throughout my entire life, Mom has found excuses to move away whenever things get difficult. I never had a stable upbringing. I never learned how to hold and keep long-term friendships and relationships beyond people I know online, so I've lost tons of friends over the years by moving away. When I accepted this internship, I'd hoped it would give me a way out of that lifestyle, and that I could finally be stable and have a life of my own. All of that went out the window as soon as he died. I'm trying to do what I can and help Mom, but I'm only good to her if I'm there directly- being this far away doesn't do anything for us. But if she moves away from where we're living now, I'm not sure I can go with her. We've only had that house since '14, and it was thanks to my stepdad that we got it at all. It was his last big gift to us, and the best thing that ever happened for her. Now she's throwing it all away in emotion and her life's about to take a big step backward whether she realizes it or not. I don't feel comfortable moving back to where she wants to go, even with family close by- the last time I was living there, things turned sour and I became slightly traumatized. I can't figure out what's more important- me being there to support her even if it means reverting back to a place and a life I've spent years trying to escape, or branching out on my own despite my family's needs in order to take care of myself and put myself in a better spot. I'm torn, I really am, and I hate myself for even thinking that it might be better for me to ditch my family if it comes to that.

I just... I think I could do with a lot of therapy at this point. My gender identity issues have only gotten worse and I'm not yet at a point where I can properly address what's going on. I'm sick and tired of Mom taking flight whenever things get shitty, and I don't want to continue in my parents' bad footsteps for the rest of my life. I'm tired of seeing everyone around me make better lives for themselves while I'm taking two steps back. And I wish I wasn't the only one in the family dealing with any of this. I lost my father at 18 as well, so losing my stepfather was a double whammy that none of my half-siblings (whose father is still alive) have to deal with. I'm also the youngest in the family by a pretty wide margin, so even though I'm the one trying to help Mom and Grandpa directly, no one else takes anything I do seriously and they've all got lives of their own, so I can't count on them for help.

Sorry for venting, I just feel trapped. No matter what I do moving forward, someone gets hurt whether it's my mother or myself. There's no good options for either of us anymore, and I wish I wasn't so far away while all of this is happening. What started out as the best year of my life has easily turned into the worst in such a short amount of time that it's hard to find anything positive in daily affairs anymore.

I miss home."

# [Dating With Daughter by MrDotsGames](https://www.patreon.com/mrdotsgames)

## **Incest Warning**

## **Incomplete Game Warning**, **$5+ Patreon Wall Warning**

Dating With Daughter is *another* Renpy visual novel, this time(like many others), with an incest theme! Dating With Daughter uses a wholly first person perspective and 3D rendered imagery within the game. 3D imagery is hit or miss and so are Renpy games. Does this one hold up to scrutiny? Find out below!

**Gameplay:** 4 stars. I know I know, what could this game possibly do different than any others? And the short answer is nothing. It does absolutely nothing other games haven’t done before. The game combines choice making, friendship, love and corruption based on your actions towards the titular character(the daughter). The actual choice making makes sense(you can’t be a pervert from the start, she *will* hate you and you will get a game over). You have to slowly(not too slowly in the current version) build up your relationship and encroach on boundaries. The game is a simple pick what you do but the choices have immediately quantifiable consequences which is great. It allows you to “save scum” if you so choose or you can simply go through a singular “route” if you will and start over. 

**Art:** 3.5 stars. 3D art is generally awful. We all know that. This game has completely made the daughter look like she’s been through the ringer of plastic surgery with her body type. What this 3D rendering does *right* is the faces. They don’t fall too far into uncanny valley territory and as such makes actually looking at the images a somewhat enjoyable experience. Otherwise the 3D models have the typical “look” you’ll find in the game in regards to texture, except slightly better. I will commend the rendering on the attention to detail with close up shots of faces. It’s refreshing not to see entirely smooth matte skin on a 3D rendered model.

**Story:** 3 stars. The story is fairly light but it is present and it gives good context to why the father/daughter start having an odd relationship. There are hints here and there to a larger story but as of this version it isn’t completely fleshed out and as such can’t really be addressed. But with the way the game is going I can see some fairly interesting tracks coming to a head later on. But as of now the actual story provides good context to the situation and lays the groundwork going forward.

**Accessibility:** 5 stars. It’s a Renpy game. Hard to fuck that up but the game goes to extra lengths to help you figure out the best way to approach the relationship as new tiers and days are achieved. You’ll quickly learn what’s acceptable and what is not with how long you’ve known your daughter. 

**H Opinion:** There isn’t much in regards to *blatant* sex scenes but there are a few masturbation scenes, groping and nudity and those are all well done and nice to look at. Though it does make you feel a little let down that there isn’t more but the slow build will make the actual release of sex scenes all the better.

**Overall:** 4 stars. This is a fun Renpy game that features a fairly popular theme(Incest) with decent 3D renders. It features a nice system of love, friendship and corruption that gives instant gratification to the choices you make. While not super long currently, you will have fun playing this game and “dating with daughter”.

# [Corrupting the Intern](https://www.patreon.com/posts/corrupting-0-7-7716817) by [LambdaDude](https://www.patreon.com/lambdadude)

And next up in this impromptu Renpy extravaganza is Corrupting the Intern. If you couldn’t tell by the name this is another trainer game, except it has 3D renders as opposed to drawn. Obviously you’re corrupting the new intern at your new job. What else do you need to know? Nothing. Nothing at all. Just roll with it.

**Gameplay:** 3 stars. This is simply the basic trainer game dynamic done well. There’s really no difference to any other trainer games in methodology. You’ve got favors and orders and training. All of these are done to make your corruption target sluttier and more willing to do things. Of course she earns the money for you as well. Overall it’s everything we’ve seen before but it doesn’t suck at what it’s doing. You can order money and interact with one other woman in game. You can also pick a few different wardrobe options(a few of which are “story” driven). This is a basic Trainer game and if you liked those you’ll like this one as long as you aren’t bored of that style. 

**Art:** 4 stars. Holy 3D renders Batman! These 3D renders are really really good, especially for a Renpy game. I guess it helps that there are only a few that the developer needed to make so there could be more focus on making them look good. There’s no uncanny valley feeling looking at these renders so it doesn’t take you out of the moment at all. If there’s one complaint I have it’s that the “cum” looks pretty meh. Odd complaint, I know but it threw me off. 

**Story:** HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WE DON’T NEED NO FUCKIN STORY. There’s a few lines of actual story but it’s not important at all so I won’t rate this category.


**Accessibility:** 5 stars. It’s a Renpy Trainer Game. You know what’s up. I know what’s up. There’s color coordination for the different favors you can ask. You know what you need to do and how you need to do it at all times. You’re gonna jump in clicking without a care.

**H opinion:** The sex scenes are partially animated and the models all look very well done. There’s no reason you won’t enjoy these sex scenes unless(like me) the cum throws you off a bit(it looks like white paint). In any event the scenes are fun and they progress to be more and more lewd so you’re treated to rewards for going through a click fest.

**Overall:** 3.75 stars. Hey, there’s good 3D models and you know the game. The downside is there’s no ambition to differentiate it from every other trainer game out there. But if you do enjoy trainer games as I do you’ll have a fun time with this game while it lasts.

# [Fairy Tale by Masquerade](https://www.patreon.com/Masquerade)

## **Incomplete Game Warning**

Fairy Tale is a game about….fairy tales. There’s lots of different Disney characters and original characters mixed together to tell a story that includes sex. It really, truly seems like the creator is trying to make a medieval intrigue story with the characters while making light reference to their actual stories and abilities. Does it work well? How’s the Rule34? Find out below!

**Gameplay:** 3 stars. The third Renpy game of the day. And it’s fairly uninspired as far as Renpy games go. Sure there’s stats and gold but it doesn’t feel well implemented. Mind you the game isn’t done yet but nothing seems to be truly important in the game and that makes the mechanics suffer. It seems the developer wants the story to have the main focus and for that the actual game part of the game suffers.

**Art:** 4.5 stars. The characters that do have art are simply a pleasure to look at. The Rule34 characters are easily recognizable with some changes to their proportions(the developers seem to really like big tits). Otherwise the characters are drawn very well and seem like they would fit into a Disney world. The original characters have a different feel to them but it’s not too drastic to where it would take you out of the game for more than a second as the difference is easily ignore-able.  

**Story:** 2 stars. I’ll come right out and say it. I really, really wanted to enjoy the story that was in this game but I simply could not get into it. There are a lot of interesting ideas but they don’t come together and mesh in such a way that it feels fun to read. The story threads are there and they do serve to move the plot forward but too many times does the game simply skip things that would be better served as fleshed out and it focuses on things that don’t particularly need focus. The game does away with characters and you’re not allowed much of any emotional investment to actually care about them when they do leave the story. It becomes a *meh* feeling. The tension is slightly there occasionally but for the most part it just kind of flops.

**Accessibility:** 5 stars. Every game in this review set has gotten 5 stars for this category because it’s a Renpy game and it’s kind of hard *not* to know what you’re doing or what’s going on. Some things you have to figure out on your own but nothing completely off the wall is coming your way with this game.

**H opinion:** Uninspired. That’s the best way to describe the sex scenes. They’re short and seem to be tacked on for no reason. The descriptions are *meh*, they’re few and far between and are only saved by the art. 

**Overall:** 3.6 stars. This game’s saving grace is the artwork but everything else withing the game needs a lot of work. The story is lacking and the gameplay is uninspired. The “adult” content in the game isn’t really there for the most part and is boring. The game is pretty to look at but that can’t drag this title up from mediocrity. "

I am currently a Junior studying Radiation Health Physics and I am seriously considering graduate school. I have been in contact with several institutions (UNLV, Colorado State, Texas A and M, and Idaho State) and they all have informed me that I am a strong candidate. I have been doing pretty well with my major (3.7 GPA) and have worked with faculty here at Oregon State University on a research project (dosimetry programs). While I am not opposed to staying at Oregon State for my masters the faculty member I worked under has encouraged me to pursue a PhD and go elsewhere. I have a lot of respect for him and he talked with me for a few hours about this topic. My girlfriend and I are convinced that this would be a great opportunity and that I should pursue this now rather than later.

We have been together for 3 years now and have no intentions of breaking our relationship off. She is a pre-nursing student at a community college back in Portland and is kicking some major ass. She has a 4.0 and is a certified CNA with work experience. However, she has been working at her degree slowly as she needs to work (swim instructor) to pay for school. She will be completing the pre-requisites required for all BSN programs in Oregon this spring term.

Now, many of the schools I am considering either have a nursing program or are within 20 minutes of other respected nursing schools (University of Northern Colorado for instance). She is very excited about going out of state although she will miss her family a lot. At first she worried about leaving but her family has really encouraged her to go out and see the world. They are all loving and supporting people and are just happy to see her working towards a degree (her sister and her are the first to do so).

So I am beyond grateful that we have the support to do this but I still have some concerns. I currently work part time to pay for living but I have saved some money for an emergency fund. This summer I am lucky to have an amazing internship opportunity which will only help me when I apply to schools in the fall. She will also be applying to schools in the fall but she intends to work all next year as a CNA 40+ hours a week to save money. I think we will have enough to get started in another state but from there I am a little worried.

I am expecting (hopefully) to receive some sort of research or graduate teaching position. It won't be a lot but I am used to living off of less than $10,000 a year so I may actually have a little more money than usual. However, she will need to find a job to help with expenses. We have talked about this and she was already planning on doing so.

We have never lived together but we don't want to expand our already somewhat long-distance relationship into an even larger one. We think that this is worth the risk because it may help us and our relationship grow.

Honestly, I typed a lot of this intending to ask a lot of questions but I don't really know what to ask. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar position and has any advice. I would really appreciate your insight."
5xjzfa,12,2017-03-04,How to get referrals for top companies or even have a chance to interview if you hardly know anyone working at prestigious companies?,rmislj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xjzfa/how_to_get_referrals_for_top_companies_or_even/,"Hi,

A bit of a background before going in:
Hiring for interns is slowing down and I was lucky enough to secure an internship from the big e-commerce company for next summer. I applied to more than 200 internship postings throughout  September to early February, using tools such as intern.supply and Apply Everywhere (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7vxbL0Wjt58Q6M73b3leNjIYSkUeej1E8afQF86ZeQ/edit)
. Throughout the process, I was only able to get no more than 20 interviews with different companies. This is through straight online applications with no referrals. This is less than 10% callbacks for a college junior that had a previous internship as a SDET and 3.9+ GPA.

Now, looking forward, I really want to know an appropriate strategy going forward when I'll be looking for a new grad in the fall. I'm quite aware of the abysmal callback rate when blindly apply online and almost everyone suggests getting referrals in order to have a better chance to land interviews, but how can I magically ""get referrals"" when I'm not in the position to do so?

Here's a fun read that seems almost fictional that supports how important referrals are. I linked the second part but feel free to read the shorter first part as well. 
http://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-ii/

I go to an very uncompetitive college where students don't care much about their career and are generally unmotivated. It's a big state school but also very hard to find other students that have internship experience in my school. As an example, our school hosts annual contests that students can participate in by talking about their previous summer internship. There were only 15 submissions out of 20,000 enrolled students. No one hires from my school and STEM career fairs consist of 30 companies that no one has heard of that are paying $15/hr without benefits and a 2.5 or lower on Glassdoor.  I am born in the US and as a first generation Asian American, the first person in my family to go to college and pursue Computer Science. As such, no one in my family are working in tech. I have lived in the suburbs Southern California since I was born, highly populated by Asian and Hispanic immigrants working in other industries. The area has no reputable tech companies nearby (can't think of any off the top of my head) and very little tech influence. Tech and CS in particular were seen as nerdy and an undesirable career path. While attending school in this area, peers are mostly first generation Americans that are of low and social status (I am too) that are just as clueless as me, the first person in their family going to school in the US and possible college. 

As such, I don't have many strong connections that could possibly help me, although everyone keeps saying how important it is and to not just apply to companies online. All I have next year are possible referrals from Apple and Facebook. I didn't even get interviews with any top company except Amazon, if that's even considered a top company anymore, and a few other tier 2-3 companies that you guys would have a hard time recognizing. 

Is there a better way to go through the application system as someone who doesn't have the luxury to know many people working in the tech industry? I don't even get a chance at interviews with ""unicorns"" and would love to see, at the very least, where I stand if I were to interview at places such as AirBnb, Zillow, Box, Uber, Palantir, IBM, Nvidia, eBay, Microsoft, Google, etc. The list goes on and on. 

Let me know what you guys think."

5xk0tn,1,2017-03-04,Cry for Help from a 19 year old musician,hsvarsenal,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/5xk0tn/cry_for_help_from_a_19_year_old_musician/,"I am 19 and have played piano since a young age and can play well,

I also play a lot by ear and have been said to have a great talent in doing so.

(I don’t want to come across as bragging but it makes my inability to be creative while producing that more frustrating. Just wanted to emphasise the point).

I never really worked on DAW’s up until last summer where I worked as an intern at a music advertising company (during my gap year). In those couple of months I learned how to use Logic and how all the plugins worked around. I was hooked. I used money from my savings to buy Logic Pro X and some plugins and began producing music in my spare time. I progressed well and made some basic enough EDM and some piano themed tracks. It didn’t sound all that amazing but I knew it was a learning process.
Once I finished that internship and started working at a bank for a second internship my interest began to cool a little bit. This was due to a combination of having hardly any free time at this new internship and the fact that I no longer worked in a studio with a amazing set of plug ins to jam with in my spare time at work. (such as a pretty much full Kontakt library with strings and all, massive serum etc.).

I then went off to University last September brought a small midi controller I had along with my Laptop. I produced every now and then at the beginning but never really got going. Always ended up playing piano on the controller instead of producing. Then the midi keyboard starting making my wrists hurt when playing complex piano pieces, so I put it away to stop it from tempting me. 

Im now really wanting to start producing again, listening to Djawadi’s work on Westworld made me want to start experimenting with classical and film music type pieces, while I still would like to produce melodic electronica like flume or disclosure.

I just don’t really know where to start in terms of composing. I still have serum from last year but really struggle to use it as an instrument. I don’t know all that much about how synths work. I often just end up sitting in front of the empty Window screen on logic and don’t know where to start, thats why I always used to resort to just playing piano on the midi keyboard back at the beginning of uni.

I realise I have amazing technology (Logic+ Serum+ Alicia’s Keys + Splice) at my disposal and have been a musician all my life, but I just can’t get any good ideas. I tried copying other songs to get a hang of logic and it somewhat worked, but every time I try to compose something it ends up sounding like shit edm/techno or a cheap ripoff of ludovico einaudi. 

Its really frustrating me, I don’t even know if I want to make techno music, I don’t mind listening to it in clubs but it doesn’t really seem like the music i would enjoy making.

Anything you guys could suggest to kickstart my producing again and get me motivated. I loved the feeling last year of working on a track and gradually improving it. I just can’t get started now.

Sorry if this is a bit of a long post but it really means a lot to me"

5xk4ll,3,2017-03-04,Confused and venting,jhangiee,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/5xk4ll/confused_and_venting/,"My SO (20M) and I(21F) have been long distance since the start of university, basically our whole relationship besides summer and winter breaks. We are currently finishing our 6th semester at university. I love him very very much. We have both been very stressed about school, finding an internship and just been very busy. No matter how busy I am, I will always find time for him. I will always text him back, answer his snap chats, answer his phone calls.  The texts/snaps are normally 6+ hrs apart on his end. 

 The thing is that we haven't talked much lately. I've realized early on in the relationship that it's something I need to feel close to him. I've tried my best to learn to accept the amount that I get is the ""best"" he can do and that I just have to deal with it if I want to be together.  

Last week, we planned a Skype date and watched a movie together. It was really nice. I thought that it would bring us back on the same page and help me feel less distant. I really enjoyed the time together but it didn't make me feel any better about the relationship. He barely texts me back, when he does find time to call me, he's talking to his friends at the same time.  I just feel like I don't matter. And if I bring it up, he just tells me that we're both busy and stressed and there's not much we can do about it...

Both of our spring breaks match up this year, which is perfect. We are both going home which I am very excited about. However, he seems to be very busy with his family and doesn't have much time for me.. which is something I can't really justify to be mad about. It just sucks. I just keep thinking to myself that I'll be happy with whatever time he finds for me...

I just don't know if staying together is the right thing to do. I know that if I am able to stick out the shitty feeling, it'll all be worth it, someday. But it's such a shitty feeling and I'm just so tired of it all. "

5xkcw0,1,2017-03-04,My [18F] roommate [18F] is driving me crazy with her arrogance and competitiveness,bleleh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5xkcw0/my_18f_roommate_18f_is_driving_me_crazy_with_her/,"Both my roommate and I are freshman in college living in a dorm together. Towards the beginning of the year everything was fine and we got a long okay, but as the year has progressed we've become closer. She's become one of my closest friends at the school, and I like spending time with her most of the time. 

The problem however, is that she is extremely arrogant and basically thinks she's better than me in every way. I didn't really notice this until this semester, but every time any topic comes up that involves us both, she has to make it a competition and subtly assert her dominance over me. For example, we're both premed and are taking a couple of the same classes. She always talks about how smart she is and how she's sooo good at every science subject, and yet when we get our scores back I consistently score higher than her. Every time this happens, she always makes some sort of excuse like, *oh my exam form was *really* hard* or *I must've bubbled in some answers wrong* as if there has to be some sort of other reason that she did worse than me than that she's just not as smart/hardworking.

Another example of this is that she hardly ever studies and instead sits on her ass doing nothing all day, and then crams for exams the night before. When she sees me trying to study, she always says things like ""wow you study so much, I wish I had your work ethic."" While this may sound like a compliment her tone of voice is really saying ""Wow you have to study more than me because you aren't as smart."" Other times she'll straight up say things like ""why are you studying for the exam so early? that's stupid."" Sometimes she'll even try to distract me while I'm studying, and its really obvious. 

Beyond academics, she always talks about how pretty she is and makes small little comments implying that she's better looking than me and guys like her more. She also always makes similar comments about how she's more social and outgoing than I am. For example, I work at a place that requires me to interact with people a lot. One time she said something like ""Lol that's so funny that you work there. I should work there, I'm a people person."" The thing is she's not even that pretty and her social skills are just average, though she is more extroverted than I am. It just pisses me off that she always makes these comments but I don't know how to handle them.

She also always has to be right. She thinks she's some sort of genius, and that she knows sooo much. Any time I correct her about something or say something that contradicts her in anyway, she gets extremely irritated and dismisses me as not knowing what I'm talking about. This is about stuff that isn't based in opinion. For example, she once told me that Adderall isn't addictive. I know for a fact that it is addictive, and I even looked it up and tried to show her studies that prove it is. She said I didn't know what I was talking about and that she wouldn't discuss it further, and put in her headphones to listen to music. 

All of these little things have slowly been adding up, but the thing that really did it happened this week. I recently got into a pretty competitive summer internship program that I'm really excited to be in. When I told her I got in and how excited I was, she went ""Yay! I knew you would get in, you knew the professor!"" For reference, the professor that selects who gets into the internship was my professor last semester, however about 80% of the students that applied for it were his students, and only about 10% of applicants get in. For her to say that pissed me off beyond belief, because she was essentially saying I got it because I knew the professor, not because I was qualified for it. It was her way of telling me ""you got in for reasons other than your talent"" and to basically undermine me. She ruined a really happy moment for me and I was pissed off for the rest of the day.

I honestly don't know how to deal with this, and if I even want to be friends with her. But at the same time, she's probably one of the few close friends I have at the school, and I don't have many friends, especially ones as close as her. When we're just talking about random things that can't spark competition or hanging out, she's fun to be with and really funny. I'm not very good at making new friends so I want to preserve our friendship, but I think I'll go insane if she keeps making these comparisons. How can I stay friends with her while making her stop all of this negative/rude behavior? 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My roommate/good friend is extremely arrogant and thinks she's better than me, and constantly feels the need to remind me of it in subtle ways. She's one of the only close friends I have at college I don't know what to do."

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

I'm a computer science student in the midst of my second year, so the kind of stuff I'll be doing isn't something where I need the most computational power. I'm also not trying too hard to future proof it because I plan on getting my skills sharp enough to land an internship next summer, and software engineering internships pay pretty well. 

My original Idea was to build a rig with kaby lake and a 1080 because of the price drop of both, but after doing the math the build wind up being over $1100 not including a monitor, or input devices. 

so here's what I'm looking for:
the ability to play most modern games at 1080p with 60 fps. (to name a few I really want to play: mass effect Andromeda, Agony, and Resident evil 7, etc.), I'm really not looking to max out every setting, but to play the game at or slightly above recommended settings. 

cpu with full 40 PCIe lanes and correct PCIe spec for the motherboard. this allows me to add more gpus later. I'm not to concerned with clock speed, so long as the cpu doesn't wind up being a point of failure for trying to play games, or play around with data. 

motherboard needs to have USB-C and hdmi or vga support(though I can compromise on the usb-c), and would prefer DDR4(though I'm still not sure if this will make a difference for most games). 

I have a 186 gig SSD from a laptop that recently died(the reason I decided to build a rig), so a 1 TB hd would probably be all I need. (I would appreciate recommendations on this note but It's not really necessary, I can find affordable 1TB HDDs). 

and a full size tower case. mainly so I can add parts later, and leave plenty of room. granted this rig is only until I start interning or doing co-op, so this isn't an absolute requirement. 

oh and don't worry about linking a copy of windows 10, I'm going with arch linux. 

price range $5-800. I don't want a pre-build; I have no experience trying to build on a budget(or build at all for that matter) so I'd appreciate any help in either generating a build or points in the right direction. "

Economic policy, the implication of NAFTA &amp; GATT, and a public affair that shook the nation are just some of the events people associate him with. As most of you know “The Clinton Chronicles” has been floating around the w**e**b for a few decades.  This grainy, over-dubbed documentary debuted in 1994 on a limited VHS run and ended up selling approximately 300,000 copies making it a cult classic in the conspiracy world.


Accusations of drug running, money laundering, murder and womanizing were brought to the for**e**front in this gutsy, tell all documentary. Going hand in hand with the documentary is the ‘Clinton kill list’ 

Below is a comprehensive list of 53 mysterious deaths connected to the clintons that have grave implications.


1 – James McDougal – Clinton’s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr’s investigation.

""I don't think you're thinking this through. This is just like the time you hung a dirtbike with a rope and made it into a swing.""

He took another deep drag. ""No, I did research this time. Science says that every cigarette you smoke is like eleven minutes of life.""

""I think you're not understanding this. I'm pretty sure that doesn’t mean you're actually travelling in time.""

The cartridge now empty, Michael took it out. He lifted up a new refill cartridge. ""I bought these puppies on eBay. They're from China and have fifty times more nicotine than normal cigarettes. I did the math. Each one of these is like 2,000 cigarettes.""

Jane shook her head again. ""Well, you've been at it since dinner and you're still here. But, whatever- I have to get up early tomorrow. I'm going to bed. Have fun.""

Michael waved his fingers and said, ""See you in the future.""

When Jane woke up the next morning she reached over but was met with just covers. She looked and it seemed like Michael had never even gone to bed. ""Oh, god. I bet he stayed up all night smoking that thing."" Jane walked out of the bedroom and was greeted with a cloud of smoke, but didn't see Michael though. She quickly grabbed a bagel out of the refrigerator and left for work. She sent him texts at each of her breaks but didn't get a response.

""Hello, Michael?"" She said as she walked into their apartment that afternoon after work. There was no response.

Her worry quickly turned to fear when she flipped the lights on. Michael lay on the floor next to the table. She quickly ran to him. He felt warm, but there was blood around his lips. She pulled out her phone and dialed 911.

Seven hours later, a doctor flipped through some papers and looked up at Jane. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Phelps. Your husband is in a coma. It looks like the e-cigarette he was using exploded while it was in his mouth. We've sutured the cuts to his lips and left cheek. The good news is that he is completely healthy. He's breathing on his own and the EEG is showing brain activity. At this point, it's just up to Michael to get up.""

Jane spent every possible hour at the hospital with him, even sleeping next to him in an uncomfortable chair. When he was moved to a long-term coma care facility, she would visit every day. After a few months, she would come every weekend. Weekend visits became monthly. As the years went by, Jane created a new life for herself and would visit Michael once a year.

Jane brushed aside a grey wisp of hair away from her eyes. ""Hello, Michael. The nurses say you're doing well here."" A muscle in Michael's cheek twitched but Jane didn't notice. ""My kids are doign well. Charlie is almost done with college. He's looking for internships already. They've already grown up."" Michael suddenly inhaled deeply. ""Michael?"" Jane got up and walked to a nurse. ""Excuse me, he seems to be breathing differently. Is he okay?""

The nurse lifted his head slightly and put his finger on a monitor that she couldn't see. ""Says he's fine."" He went back to his phone.

Michael's eyes were open when Jane walked back. He was blinking a lot, like he was trying to get his eyes to focus. Jane yelled back at the nurse, ""Hey, his eyes are open!"" She turned back and tried to hug him while he lay in bed. ""Michael! Can you hear me? Are you okay?""

Michael stopped blinking as much and his eyes now scanned the room. Then he looked at Jane and studied her face. ""Hhmph.""

""Oh my god, Michael. Are you back? This is amazing.""

""eeet fert.""

""I can't believe it! It's so nice to see you doing something again.""

Michael looked at Jane, and carefully spoke. ""Jane, it worked.""

""What worked, Michael?""

""The cigarettes. I stayed up way after you went to bed. I heard a fizzing sound and then the next thing I'm here. And you look so old.""

I'm not sure if I should post it in the Office Hours thread, but since it does not apply only to professors, I decided to post it here. Sorry if this was a mistake.

Look, I'm a computer engineering undergraduate. In my country, my CE course takes at least 5 years, by the standard curriculum, but I'm completing it in 6 because I spent one year studying abroad in the US. Well, I'm currently somewhere near my 7th semester and I still got 2 more years until I get my degree. I could actually get credit for all the classes I took while studying abroad, but I wanted to really take it easy and have some time for my hobbies and also to dedicate myself to the classes I was taking and to the projects I was getting into at the lab I'm working.

I've worked on several projects at the same virtual reality and image processing lab in my university since I was on my second semester and I got really fascinated by researching and making science. I have already published a 4 page paper with a poster in a major conference (ACM SAC 2017) in my field as the main author and I also have been active on events and conference contests, resulting in two 2 page extended abstracts with some friends, also. I mean, my grades are also really good and I was thrilled at the thought of pursuing a masters program and, finally, a PhD to become a researcher and a professor, just like my adviser. Since I had only worked at the lab at the time, I wanted to see what it was like to work at a company, so I applied for an internship. I worked for a year in one and for 3 months in another, only to realize that I had absolutely no attachment to the projects and didn't really felt motivated to work, since the objectives were quite different compared to working in an academic environment, which assured to me that working at the lab was the right thing for me to do.

The problem is that after talking to some colleagues (two PhD students and a professor) recently, I came to realize that there is a lot of self-interest when a peer is reviewing a paper and that a great deal of the published papers are not even read. The proposed modifications are so minimal and specific that it just supports the ""publish or perish"" idea. I kinda lost that thing I had about publishing papers, you know? I mean, I wanted to really invest a great deal of time on something and publish a meaningful project that would actually be useful or at least read, but it seems that my adviser needs to fulfill a publication quota, so there is always not much time to actually get into a paper and produce a useful result. I don't blame him, he's a great guy, and it is either this or not actually getting fund for anything and getting in trouble with the university/government for not publishing. I really enjoy working with him and I feel that I have grown a lot since I started working at his lab, but I just find that all the things I did, although it was cool and got me some publications, my actual contribution is not really useful. I want to contribute to science and create knowledge, but it seems kinda rigged, you know? I can't really focus on something interesting when we need to meet publishing quotas and all of this is really frustrating me to the point that I'm not sure anymore about my future, since I don't enjoy working at companies and the academia has become frustrating, since it seems unreasonably difficult to make useful science.

Does anyone has any advice for me about what to do?"
5xllrh,8,2017-03-05,Reneging internship offer,superdankswag,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xllrh/reneging_internship_offer/,"Hi guys,

I signed an agreement over this past winter break to intern at a company for the summer of 2017. At the time, I was content and looking forward to working at the position over the summer. The recruiter actively went out of his way to find me online (this is rare for me since I've usually been the one knocking on company's doors). The interviewers were kind and the recruiter helped me out so much.

However, one of the programs I applied to/interviewed with before I accepted the offer just reached out to me and I very much would like to take the offer. I think that this program aligns much better with my interests and would allow me to grow much more in terms of personal development and my CS career.

I've already mulled over the moral/ethical decisions in my head, reading Quora posts/advice and random blogs. What I got out of reading this stuff online is that it's okay to make decisions for my own self interest, but to just be aware of the consequences. So I plan to renege on my accepted offer to go with the second offer. 

But I can't help but feel guilty and I would like to call my recruiter to be honest about my situation, especially since he helped me out so much. I would also like to do this as soon as possible to allow them enough time to hopefully get in another candidate for the summer.

Before I call him, one of the things that I'm worried about is that he will ask me what program I decided to take in place of theirs. Should I tell him? If I do tell him, I'm paranoid that he might contact the new company about what I did. If I don't tell him, I feel like I'm not being honest enough with him.

And just in general, what kinds of things should I say when I renege? I want to be honest, thankful, and apologize as well. 

Any advice is appreciated

Thanks

TL;DR
Accepted offer from company A. Got a new offer from company B and plan to accept it as it much much better aligns with personal interest. Need advice on how to go about communicating this with my recruiter from company A, as the recruiter was so helpful and kind to me."

I'm very certain I'm about to get a position at a well established global company as a Technical Support Representative troubleshooting their tax software material for clients. Now my interest really isn't in support work.  I've been maintaining and running my school's lab for 4 years and been hired as a member of a network engineering team for my internship and I stayed with them after my internship ended. 

I've been putting out many applications (loads of fun to be had there), and I got a few other interviews that look like they'll pan out, but all lower end support work for the most part. 

My dilemma is that I believe that the tech support work will allow me to learn and gain a foothold within a great company that I really want to work for, has great benefits, work/life balance, and great lateral movement between teams and is also very close to home. But, it's not necessarily related to my internship or work experiences.  

So do I take the position and wait there a year and learn the company and THEN move (or look for) into a more suitable position within the company, or do I keep on the job hunt and wait for something better? 

I appreciate the help!

I'm a newly minted CS student and I'm at the beginning of a two month internship. I'm supporting a Spring / Hibernate system that is enormous and has tons of both new and legacy code. The system is very complex and I have yet to see a system of that scope and size. I'm having difficulty finding what I need to find. Like a specific method to troubleshoot or a class to fix. Even front end code has become difficult to find because a lot of it is buried in a very deep file structure (in some instances, up to 8-9 clicks deep). 
&amp;nbsp;

So my question is what are some tools or strategies I can use to find what I need to find? (We're using eclipse) we also have ajax and jquery on the front end as well. Also I'm not a bachelor student. I was in a three year technical program. (Lots of coding, with a bit of systems analysis) Any suggestions would be really helpful.

1) Will working with Java cause any problems or create a hassle for collab on a project with the team I'll be working with if they use C#? 

2) Visual Studio is in their tech stack. I'm currently learning how to use it and working on a project to familiarize myself with C#. From what I've been told, C# is very similar to Java, but I'm worried I'd be over-burdening myself with a language I'm less familiar with if I jump into the internship using C#.

I don't even know where to begin, i feel like the whole relatiobnship has a some bearing to my situation. I guess i could start by how we met. 

Right of the bat, our relationship started out with lies. She claimed that she was been beaten by her abusive ex, and me like a fucking idiot valiant prince, i went in to comfort her. I went to her coffee shop to get coffee all the time, and she would talk to me about this or that, nothing really specific. Until one day, she was looking very distraught and i asked her what was going on. She told me that her ex had visited the night before and had gotten a little rough with her, and she left some bruises on her arm. So i was upset because i am very against people getting beaten or taken advantage. I started talking to her more and more often, and obviously she was very attractive so i kinda had the hots for her anyway, so i so it as a way to get to know her, and obviously I felt like she trusted me because she would tell me her very personal situation. As the week went by it remember her coming into her job very fragile-looking, and of course since she had mentioned her ex had gotten rough with her, i asked her if everything was okay. It was at this point that she told me her ex had gone to her house the night before and basically punched her. She had a very convincing black eye, and more bruises on her neck and arms. Honestly i was just very gullible and I felt like I needed to help this dansel in distress. We ended up getting together because she liked me and i liked her. Honestly things were going very welll at the beginning. She was very caring, she bought me things, she would pick up the check from time to time, and i was like really into her.

The only thing that was bad about our first months of our relationship was that her ex would keep contacting her and supposedly stalk her, it even got to the point where she told me she was pressing charges against this guy because he had gone to her house and pulled a gun on her. She even told me that the cops had come and that they had caught the guy while he was trying to leave, and that he was going to go to jail. I never really got involved with that situation as much as i should have. Now, looking back into it, it is very obvious why she never got me involved. It was all lies. One of her supposedly friends, who happens to work at the same coffee shop, told me that she had made all that stuff about her ex beating her, She used that to get me interested in her. There was never any case with the police, and all the bruises i saw on her, were basically just make-up. At the same time that this was going on, she was also making social media profiles acting as my ex. She, at the end of the relationship, admitted to making said profiles. She never told me why she made them, but she was using those profiles to send herself nasty messages about my ex saying how i was going to get back with her, that ""she was nothing but a roadblock"" and that i was going to realize how great my ex was, and that eventually i was going to get back with her. I feel like she was just very insecure about our relationship, and she was using those fake profiles to measure my feeling for her and my ex. 

Also around this time, she pretty broke the news to me that she had gone to the doctors and there were two possibilities. Either, she was pregnant, or she had an ovarian tumor. As things went on, she basically it turned out that she was both. and according to her, she aborted the baby. Again, i offered to go to doctors consultations, and do anything i could do to help her out. She never budged, she pretty much took care of it on her own, because we were such a young couple that she didn't want things to get tarnished by the situation. The other part of this ordeal, that i feel is very important, is the fact that she claimed to have cancer. After she supposedly aborted the baby, she told me that they had run some tests, and that she did in fact have a tumor. She said she almost didn't want to tell me because she told me that when i found out, i would just leave her. I obviously was very taken back by this revelation. Naturally i tried to comfort her, and be of any help. She told me that she didn't want to burden me, and that we should probably just split up as she didn't want me to see her all messed up. Any time i would offer to go to the clinic or the doctor, she would say it was fine, that she would go on her own. I now know, that this were all lies, and she had never had cancer, and I didn't want to suspect something like that, as it is such a fucked up thing to do. But like i said, things just weren't adding up. This was confirmed by on of her co-workers, who told me this isn't the first time she said something in that ballpark. The co-worker claims that she had said she had cancer in the past, and that she has faked many pregnancies.

The lies kept on piling up. The day that i realized that this girl may not be entirely truthful with me, she basically told me she had graduated as a registered nurse, and that she was going to start her internship at a hospital. Over the months leading up to this day, she was asking me if it was okay if she would go in to work at th hospital, as she was on-call. She said she didn't have a set schedule so they would just give her days that she could go in, and she would go in. On this day, she called me in the morning and told me she was going to go for a shift at the hospital, and that she would see me after. When she got to my house around 6pm, something didn't sit right with me, i greeted her in and i noticed her scrubs looked brand new, as in when they had just been unfolded after been just unpackaged, like it still had the crests on the shirt. I asked her how her day had gone at the hospital with an incredulous tone, and she just rolled with it, she basically told me, some guy had gone in and his hand had been almost cut off and Yadira yards yadda. From that point on, i was very careful with what i would believe from her. I recently found out that she never even graduated, let alone gotten a job at a hospital. One of her coworkers basically told me alll that.

We stopped being intimate, and that just made things worse. I honestly couldn't bring it on myself to have sex with someone i didn't trust, or was basically lying to me, but i also didn't have any evidence to support my suspicions, they were just that, gut feelings. It wasn't until later that month, when she said, On a Sunday night i may add, that she was going to go for her treatment. I thought this was very suspicious, and since I worked pretty close by to her house, i went to check to see if she was lying. Her car was there, and since there was a possibility that she may have uber or picked up a ride, i texted her asking if she had. She replied, not knowing that i knew about her car been there, that she always drives herself, she had asked her brother but he was unavailable (he didn't live with her). This confirmed all my suspicions, i knew that she was lying, i just didn't know about how much.

Around this time, is started noticing her gaining weight, and i straight up asked her if she was pregnant and if we needed to go to the doctors for check-up, or what not. She replied, very hurt at the notion implying that she was, that there is no way she could be pregnant, as she had ovarian cancer. 

The combination of finding out about all this things, made me realized that I shouldn't be anywhere near someone like her. I didn't know when i broke up with her that she was pregnant, as i had asked her plenty of more times as her tummy continued to grow. I saw all the signs but she kept denying everything. I also didn't know about her not graduating from nursing school, or working at the hospital, or he lying about having cancer, and totally dragging her ex's name through the dirt by making up the stories about him beating her up. The only thing i knew when we broke up last month was that she was a dishonest person, and that she was making fake profiles impersonating my ex.

Now I honestly feel so lost, her co-worker basically told me today that she had told her manager about her being pregnant because she needed to work less hours.. So all this time i was trying to go to the doctors with her and, her supposedly having cancer, are just lies. I honestly don't understand why she wont tell me. I have no idea what to do. I honestly don't want anything to do with her. But know there is a human life involved. I need your guys' help. What should i do, what kind of steps do i need to take in order to protect myself. I am probably gonna have to get a lawyer, but I don't even know where to start looking, or how much money that's all going to be. I don't make a lot of money, i live pretty comfortably, but that's only because I don't have anybody else to care for.



Please, i am literally shaken and i feel like my life is going to end. 

Tl/dr: My ex is a pathological liar, while in the relationship she claimed there is no way she could be pregnant, as she supposedly had cancer. Ended up being a lie. I am 99.9% sure she's pregnant, but she wont admit to it.

If she decides to keep the baby, i would love to have custody of the baby. I am also concerned. As she mentioned to someone that she wouldn't need me and the she will do it on her own. If she tells me this, what are the legal ramifications of that statement. I know am fucked, i just want to know how badly.

5xlvbm,14,2017-03-05,"Can We Be ""Too Theoretical""?",LimbicLogic,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5xlvbm/can_we_be_too_theoretical/,"**ETA**: I've made a few changes to the original post to try and get across the idea that the examples I listed involving staff members were done to express perceptions I've had with them *which can reasonably be generalized* to at least a portion of the therapeutic community.  Please note that I'm listing examples which *involve me* but don't make the post *about me*.  I've also tried toning down the rhetoric and jargon, which is based in me being a new member here and writing another post which was full of even more jargon without significant concerns by any members, leading me to think that the type of jargon I originally had in this post before editing was the norm.  I'm learning, folks.  You also have to keep in mind that our group had the most laissez-faire approach you can imagine, so any responses to my supervisor or other members was far from disrespectful but actually *encouraged* given my supervisor's wonderful openness to our opinions during discussion.

-------

Confession: I worked at a university for five years with wonderful colleagues and my end-of-year evaluations always had high scores in terms of dedication to learning and contributions to the group in terms of theoretical or technique-related possibilities, which I include to drive home the point that my supervisor at least (and a few other members) thought I was the ""theory guy"", which is relevant because of the seemingly contradictory messages I've recorded below.  That said, a weird dynamic regarding the value of theory also went with this group (ETA: this actually happened exclusively with two members out of the seven I've worked with, not counting interns).

For one, my supervisor considered my way of thinking to be such that it prevented me from seeing easier, more practical solutions.  My response to this was that she was basically saying my way of thinking granted me a sort of intellectual disability (given that I wasn't able to access easier solutions, in a sense being unable to see them because I was perceived as being ""lost in the clouds""), and that, no, my way of thinking in my case didn't at all mean I was incapable of seeing smaller and more practical solutions.  Given that she had no access to my therapy sessions, she couldn't see how I was much more here-and-now focused, emphasizing emotions, practical applications, and overall offering multiple options for treatment to my clients when appropriate, loosely keeping in mind Lazaraus' Multimodal Model, all which I think would have helped her realize that I started from the ground up rather than the sky down (i.e., starting with more practical applications first and adding more abstract stuff on top of this foundation rather than the other way around).  

Another piece of odd evidence indicating a strange group dynamic regarding theory: other members seemed to equate experience with competence, and a few had the tendency to disregard theory because ""time on the field"" was deemed as the more important factor than theory.  My response: experience is like a beach, and you can easily spend twenty years on the shore getting your feet wet or a few years in the deep end roughing it out with strong waves.  One colleague had a problem with my recommendation that the group should consider reading a book on schema therapy because it had so dramatically changed my practice (and even my personal life), because she interpreted it as me thinking I was better than other members -- when that was far from the case.  Her dismissal of my recommendation reflected the idea that experience trumps theory, and also a deeper belief among at least a few members on staff that you can go too far with theory whereas experience is a more valued currency that in itself seemed to indicate competence.

And then there was the time where a staff member and and I got into a constructive discussion on the place of theory vs practice.  Her point was that we shouldn't lose track of practice by focusing on theory.  My response was that *this very statement made by her was theoretical*, and so it isn't a matter of theory vs practice so much as it is a matter of *how we deal with theory* in the therapy session.  Again for emphasis: to say that theory should be used in such-and-such a way and shouldn't interfere with practice *is a theoretical statement*.

I say all these things not to point to myself (God no), because I think I'm just a young professional who has plenty to learn, and has a natural knack for reading and learning that preceded my practitioner status.  I definitely take no credit for any roots I'm naturally given regarding intelligence, capacity for learning and memory, and so on, and leave it up to others to determine how well off I am in those areas.  I bring up these examples because they bothered me in indicating a larger perspective many people in the therapy community (at least at the MA-level) might have toward theory, using at least a few of my colleagues as a ""sample size"", so to speak.  

(If you've gotten to the last paragraph and find it hard to take me at my word that I really don't mean to imply that I'm better than anyone else, I humbly ask that you trust my intention to the contrary, which is why I wrote this paragraph, and also consider my earlier statement that I used these examples to possibly generalize to at least part of the therapy field regarding the question of theory vs practice.  If this still doesn't do it for you, then I at least ask that you own your interpretation of my behavior, given that the vast majority of our communication is non-verbal, and this is a text-only medium through which I'm communicating my ideas, making it much easier to unintentionally project interpretations and/or tone that I'm not putting down.)

I think we all remember what it was like when we were green as therapists during our pre-graduation internships or practicums and were meeting with clients for the first time, easily sucked into our heads, wondering what to say next and what theory to apply in which way.  As we moved on, we put into practice Salvador Minuchin's great quote about theory: learn it and forget it, i.e., learn it and then put it into practice in such a way where you don't even think about it.  

Because I think we can be too theoretical *only if* we're losing a here-and-now immediate focus and attunement with our clients by getting lost in the clouds of our theoretical skycastles in session by *thinking too much* about theory.  Otherwise, I can think of nothing wrong with continuing to learn as much reputable theory and related techniques as possible, because this just increases the number of tools in our toolboxes.  And this includes the absolutely required foundation of the congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathy -- which are super important in creating a good relationship with our clients, but we shouldn't forget that these three ""core conditions"" are *also* theoretical; it's just that we're so used to them and put them into practice so much that it's easy for us to forget this.  

It's not the amount of learning that by itself creates problems with theory, but how we handle the map of theory, so to speak: are we looking at it constantly in session, distracting us from a much more important rapport with our clients, or do have have the map memorized as much as we can and trust the moment to lead us along and pull out whatever theories and techniques are needed in this moment right here with this particular client?  

What do you folks think?"

*****
&gt; The UK&amp;#039;s privacy watchdog is launching an inquiry into how voters&amp;#039; personal data is being captured and exploited in political campaigns, cited as a key factor in both the Brexit and Trump victories last year.

&gt; The ICO spokeswoman confirmed that it had approached Cambridge Analytica over its apparent use of data following the story in the Observer.

&gt; Green MP Caroline Lucas, who campaigned for Remain, said: &amp;quot;Clearly, there are questions to be answered about the Leave campaign&amp;#039;s use of big data and a potentially huge &amp;#039;in kind&amp;#039; donation by Cambridge Analytica. To have a foreign billionaire&amp;#039;s fingerprints left all over such a seismic moment in British history is deeply concerning and requires urgent further investigation as to whether electoral law was broken.""

&gt; The Cambridge Analytica spokesman said: &amp;quot;We do not use data from Facebook. We do not have access to Facebook likes What you have sent us relates to a research project done in 2015 with an intern data scientist using an anonymous data set. The goal was to reproduce findings in the peer-reviewed literature Its application for us is limited by the fact that we don&amp;#039;t have Facebook likes covering the population.""

&gt; Dr Simon Moores, visiting lecturer in the applied sciences and computing department at Canterbury Christ Church University and a technology ambassador under the Blair government, said the ICO&amp;#039;s decision to shine a light on the use of big data in politics was timely.

&gt; &amp;quot;A rapid convergence in the data mining, algorithmic and granular analytics capabilities of companies like Cambridge Analytica and Facebook is creating powerful, unregulated and opaque &amp;#039;intelligence platforms&amp;#039;. In turn, these can have enormous influence to affect what we learn, how we feel, and how we vote. The algorithms they may produce are frequently hidden from scrutiny and we see only the results of any insights they might choose to publish.""

There's nothing wrong with me other than the fact i have social anxiety. 
I'm totally fine with most social settings, but things like relationships or clubbing always scared me.
Also, as engineering student I was fairly isolated from opposite sex during uni years.
Recently I started internship abroad in huge company, and finally found a courage to ask out a girl who started internship with me.

My question is: is it considered creepy if I only invite her for 1v1 meetings all the time (walks, pubs etc.)?
I prefer it this way because I feel more comfortable + the company is male-dominated, so you can guess how these work events look like...
However, I worry that she will soon meet a group of ""cooler"" guys, taking her to parties / clubs etc., providing more fun.

Thanks!

tl;dr: Is it normal to only go out with girl 1v1?"

&gt;**Minimum qualifications:**

All that is pointing to only uni students, not community college students. It's a bummer, as I *really* want to take an internship during the summer between Freshman and Sophomore year.

* What general job opportunities are there available for someone with a b.s. in bioinformatics? I don't really want to do research, but rather something on the applicable side.

* Is it feasible to go right from undergrad to a PhD program? I have a good GPA, research experience, and hopefully by the time I graduate an internship and publication.

* What other questions should I be asking/asking myself to narrow down what i'd like to focus on?

I think I am literally un-employable.,oksygo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5xmz9l/is_there_any_fixing_this_i_think_i_am_literally/,"First, I know I've fucked up big time. Second, throwaway account because of how ashamed I am that I let it get this bad. ~~I'll try to keep this short~~ This is going to be long.

A little about me: I graduated in 2009 top of my class with a BSc in mechanical engineering from a very respected engineering school.

Mistake 1 (and this is the big one): I have ADHD. I was diagnosed when I was 7-8 and was medicated from such a young age that I never learned how to do stuff that most people take for granted, like how to study on my own, because the medication did it for me. There were times in high school I tried to go off the meds, but my grades would always go to shit, so it wasn't long before I started taking meds again. Fast forward to college and I'm still medicated. One of the side effects of the medication is it makes me reclusive so I always had my nose in a book, happy to spend all my time studying which meant I didn't network literally at all, so I knew precisely zero people who matter after graduation.

Mistake 2: I didn't take any internships while in college because I was always taking summer classes so I could still graduate in 4 years while also doing an academic year abroad.

Mistake 3: After graduation, I decided I would take a couple months off to just relax and unwind after four years of 8 A.M. classes and constantly being on the go. Well, a couple months turns into 6. 6 months turns into a year. I finally start applying for entry level engineering positions and get a couple interviews despite having zero experience and no references except for a few of my former professors. I actually get a call back from one company and they fly me and a bunch of other candidates to New York for more interviews and hands-on stuff. It turned out to be a very corporate situation (think massive cube farm) and this scares the shit out of me so I decide I'm going to ""work for myself."" Great fucking decision to make based on what it was like to interview with one company, right? So I start making and selling stuff. It's really just a glorified hobby, but I make a little money and keep busy.

Mistake 4: Circa 2009 I get started doing an annual e-sports tournament (GT Academy) where the winner is basically fast-tracked into professional motorsports, which was and always has been my dream job. This was supposed to be the answer so I go hard. Remember how I mentioned I have ADHD and take medication to treat it? Well, now I'm abusing the medication to try to gain an edge in the tournament. If I had to trace my addiction back to a single event, this is it. After GT Academy ended, I found myself longing for the comradery and competition, so I started playing other games and kept abusing the meds. It didn't take long for the substance abuse to start spilling into other parts of my life and before long, I found I needed the medication to complete even the most menial tasks. This shit continues for several years; living one monthly prescription to the next. How do you get clean from a drug that makes you *normal*? 

Back in 2008, when I was still in college, I got really, **really** lucky. When the economy was just starting to recover from the recession, not knowing a damn thing about investing, I (foolishly) dumped all my savings into one stock. As the economy continued to improve, the share price skyrocketed and I turned my small savings into a decent amount of money for my situation (not rich by any stretch of the imagination). I'm 30 now, still live with my dad, and haven't had a job since I earned my degree (8 years ago, now). I wasted the better part of my twenties playing video games and abusing prescription medication. What tiny income I have comes from investments but it isn't much and I'm not putting anything away for the future. I know I'm a huge burden on my dad and if something happened to him, I'd be homeless. My life is a literal dead end.

I'm not looking for sympathy. I know I've fucked my entire future and I have no one to blame but myself. I don't even apply for jobs any more because who the hell is going to look at a candidate with zero experience and an 8 year gap? I see people worry because they have a 6 month gap in their résumé and my spirit just fucking bottoms out. Is there **any** coming back from this or have I rendered my education utterly useless? 

TL;DR I played life on easy mode but now I'm stuck on hard mode."
5xn6i2,2459,2017-03-05,"My ex broke into my house, so...",aHeroicLemming,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5xn6i2/my_ex_broke_into_my_house_so/,"After we broke up, my ex-girlfriend and I stayed close friends. We lived together until our lease was up. I met the boyfriend who is now her fiancé. And she often visited my parents to help take care of our pets while I'm away. Because of this, my family and I decided to trust her with a house key. Even after the breakup, my family loved her, treated her like one of our own, and would do anything for her.

Big mistake. The day after I left home for a nine-month internship, my parents called to say that someone had broken in and stolen ~$800 cash. We checked the secret security cameras and, sure enough, it was the ex. My parents were devastated. For reasons, my parents decided not to press charges but just to cut ties, which we did a few weeks ago.

The revenge? I just found out from a mutual friend that her fiancé, who I thought was a wonderful guy, is cheating on her. Ordinarily I'd tell her; even an ex doesn't deserve to be cheated on. But a backstabbing thief? Fuck it, she can find out the hard way.

Doing nothing can still be a form of revenge, right?


EDIT: For those mentioning the backlash that this might cause her fiancé, this just occurred to me: the guy is here via DACA from a fairly dangerous country, and I don't know if she could use this against him in any way.

EDIT 2: Since a few people asked, I already confronted her about this. She denied it until I told her about the security photos. Then she immediately confirmed it, but vastly downplayed how much money she took. I told her to stay away from me and my family."

Things haven't gotten any better since I posted that. I sort of finished college, but to officially get my degree I have to do a second internship and I haven't had any luck finding one, let alone an actual job, for the past six months. I'll be 30 soon and I've never worked before, so you can imagine how well that's going (it's not). Last year at this time I was doing my first internship and almost went insane from the anxiety and stress. I had to pop Valium just to cope with the work and having to speak on the phone all day long, and now I can hardly find any work that doesn't involve being on the phone all day or direct patient interaction. My throat and stomach tighten and my hands shake just reading the job ads. I don't know how I'm gonna cope with working even if I can find someone who will hire me.

I've moved so little this past year and a half that now I can barely stand or walk for more than a few minutes before I'm drenched in sweat and in excruciating back pain. I've always been in bad shape and I'm morbidly obese, but I was at least able to walk the half mile home from my bus stop without too much trouble...now I can't even make it to the kitchen or bathroom without ending up in pain. My teeth are rotting out and hurting most of the time because I don't take care of them (or the rest of my body for that matter) and can't afford to fix them. I have never cut but I do hurt myself daily and pick at blemishes and small wounds until they're 10+ times as large as they started and turn into lumps of scar tissue. There's big red painful wounds on my face and arms and belly and other places because I just can't stop and I hate myself. I'm ashamed of my weight and my scars and my hideousness.

I'm still lonely as hell. The ex fiance that ghosted me several years ago came crawling back, and I stupidly gave him a second chance just to have him ghost me again a few months later. He also treated me to the visual of seeing him drunkenly point a thankfully unloaded gun at his head and pull the trigger, which still haunts me two years later. The timing of his reappearance (and my shit choices) ruined the chance of a relationship with my wonderful best friend, who rejected me romantically around this time a year ago. I withdrew from him and my few friends and have hardly spoken to anyone except my mother since then. I find myself in tears frequently because I'm so heartbroken and excruciatingly lonely.

I don't get any enjoyment out of anything anymore. Everything hurts. Everything and everyone I ever cared about is just gone or I've pushed them away. All I wanted in life was someone to love, a few good friends, to make art and write, to see the world, to make it a better place...

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I promised my mom I would help her out of the debt she incurred taking care of me and helping me through college, but I can't even do that and I'm hurting so much I can't cope anymore.

I spend at least half my days thinking about dying and how to do it in the least inconvenient way for my mom and the least painful way for me and how I won't be hurting anymore.

I can't do this anymore"

IT was really small, just the CIO and myself. One day, I get a somewhat urgent sounding call asking for help in one of the operating rooms. I figured that a surgery was scheduled shortly, and that a pre-op check came up with an issue with the surgical computer.

As this was the OR, of course it's a clean room, so I had to be prepped before I could enter. So after getting dressed, I head in to find out that I figured wrong on when the issue was found; hint, it wasn't during pre-op. The patient was already on the table, anesthetized, waiting for the procedure to begin.

I don't recall what the issue was, but it was a little unnerving as a college intern working on a computer with a room full of surgeons watching and waiting on you so that they could begin."

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

You're going to put my in my place. Make me your bottom bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review, my secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks, a young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me.

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add another bitch to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

I know there is the option of PEY but I think I would rather just work every summer in my field of study and also come out with about 12 months experience but graduate in 4 years instead of 5. 

For anyone who went down this path, how hard has it been for you? Does it become difficult competing against schools with coop program (like Waterloo, Mcmaster)? Or do you feel like you have a fair chance still? 

Mostly directed toward CS or engineering too but if you're in a different program let me know about your experiences as well."

[long]",ketchuminmypants,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5xo31t/me_32_m_with_my_wife_38_f_of_10_years_is_she/,"My wife keeps forcing me to do things that I do not want to do, but given the circumstances, I can't tell if she is abusive or if i have unreasonable expectations.

My wife and I met in college when I was just starting my degree and she was working in the area. So to get straight into it, after years of dating I randomly ask if she has ever been pregnant and I found out she had been pregnant (unplanned) with our kid two years ago and gotten an abortion and never told me. She said it was her body and her decision only and none of my business. She said she didn't want me to have to drop out of college (I was in engineering) and ruin my life to get a low paying job.

She had me get a job in college. I didn't want or need one since my parents were supporting me. She had to work all through college to support herself and said i should too. Also, she took my whole paycheck every month. We weren't living together yet (i was still in a dorm) but she did buy me stuff whenever I needed it, whether it was clothes or games or whatever. I didn't think anything of it at the time but looking back I think it was shady. I think the age difference had a lot to do with it.

My plan this whole time had been to get an engineering degree and then move home and do something else with it. I liked one aspect of engineering and decided to explore that further so after finishing my degree I decided to go to grad school for that. I found the classes fun but towards the end of my degree I got assistantships and intern type stuff and realized I actually did not like it. I wanted to quit and move home to follow my original plan. She gave me an ultimatum to stay for the one semester I had left and finish my degree or she would leave me. I chose to stay and finish my degree but felt the ultimatum was unfair.

I moved back home and decided that I wanted to do IT. After a year, I had basically all the CompTIA certifications and was working towards the CCNA and hadn't failed one yet. I had found a full time temp job in computer repair and installation. My wife found me an engineering job through one of her friends. The engineering job required a masters degree in what I had focused in and it payed significantly more than the $11 /hr I was currently making. I should note the temp job was already over but I was still working there past the end date, so it was uncertain how much longer I would be employed. I told her I was following my dreams and actually doing it. She said it wasn't happening fast enough. Again she gave me an ultimatum to take the engineering job or she would leave me. I took the job under the condition we would start going to marriage counseling because it felt unfair again.

I should mention I told her to follow her dreams. She listened and decided to start a phd program at home where we were and where the IT job was. The engineering job was 4 hours away in the next state. Her dad lent me a car until I could get on my feet in the new town. I saved up and wanted to get a motorcycle as my only vehicle. I had a motorcycle back in college so I was an experienced rider. She said they weren't safe and that I couldn't make the trip to see her and back and it has no storage space and what if it rained, etc. So after 2.5 years of marriage counseling I finally convinced them I needed a motorcycle. I had rain gear for when it rained, I went to the grocery store every other day, and making the 4 hour trip both ways on a sport bike was rough but I did it and I loved it.

I unsurprisingly did not like the engineering job. It was the same terrible stuff I did in grad school. I told her I wanted to quit and move home again and restart my IT career. She told me I needed a new job first before I could quit my current one. I told her it was easier to find a job in a city if you live in the city. She gave me an ultimatum again and said if I quit my job without having a new one she would leave me. I felt like I should be able to quit my job without having a new one first as long as I was considerate of her concerns, which meant just compromising on the amount of our emergency fund.

So she has done other things as well. We had a cat at one point that was old and needed $2000 in blood transfusions. We paid that then it ran away right after. A year or so later she wanted another cat, I said yes as long as it was young and had no health problems. Long story short we ended up with an old cat with a messed up tail, no teeth, and digestive problems. When I asked her how she could do this, she said the cat just chose us. She now refuses to get rid of the cat. I am basically stuck for years caring for this pet I hate. We wanted to go away for a weekend recently and had to take the cat with us because of its special medications and had to deal with it pooping everywhere (the digestive issues) which was very frustrating.
  
We have been to 3 marriage counselors in 4 years and they have all said they can't help us. We left marriage counseling one day and she noticed I wasnt wearing a seatbelt so she pulled over and refused to move until I had it on. I said I knew the risks. We started moving again and she said she would drive off this bridge nearby if I didnt strap in and started heading for it. I buckled up and brought up the fact that she tried to kill me the next week in therapy and the therapist just asked why I hadnt just done what she said. I realize I should wear my seatbelt but I was just trying to have some control over my life and to be able to make decisions that affected me again.

She also broke two phones by getting angry and throwing them across the room. She got angry again and I took the third phone away until she could calm down so she didn't break it. She started hitting me saying to give it back and that I was being abusive. She has also been very bad with money. She took my grad school student loans and used them to pay for her credit card debt. Thats taking unsecured debt and securing it. I had to call my mom to beg for money to make ends meet.

Lol how did it get this bad? I'm thinking leaving is the right choice. I have a lease in front of me and a chance to move on Wednesday. How do I actually make the decision to leave?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: She secretly had an abortion but said it was for my own good. Forced me to get a job in college but said it was for my own good. She gave me ultimatums to finish my grad degree, take an engineering job, and not quit it. Is she in the wrong or am I being a whiny baby? I feel like I have wasted my life. I feel like I can't keep living the life she wants me to live and that, good or bad, I need to live a life I am proud of and follow my own dreams."

I hope you can help me out here.  So last week I had an interview with a very popular oil and gas company for a supplier engineer position.  They were impressed with me and said they would get back to me this coming week on the decision.  I'm very sure I will get an offer from them.

The other company is an HVAC company and I had already interviewed with them 3 weeks prior.  I sent a follow up email to the HR recruiter to see where they were in the decision process. I sort of had small red flags why they were taking so long but I thought I did very well in the interview.  I'm not sure why they were taking that long but I think I will be hearing back from them this coming week.  The good thing about this company is that I had interned there for 2 summers before so they are very familiar with me.  I interviewed with 2 senior managers at the same time and one of them had already worked with me in the past.

Now I know I haven't legitimately gotten 2 offers from any of the companies but I expect to be hearing back from both this week. 

My question to you redditors is how to compose myself during negotiation between both of those companies.  Ideally, if I do get offers I would like to leverage each of them that I have received an offer somewhere else so hopefully I can negotiate to bump up my pay.

I am hoping for minimum $65,000 and above but expect that they will both offer around $60,000.  Is it possible that I could negotiate all the way up to $70000?  I believe I am a very strong candidate and before I graduate college I will have 4 technical internships on my resume.  Any help or advice would be awesome.  And I apologize in advance if this is the wrong thing to do to post here. 

Cheers!"

The Bad News: I am not receiving any job offers.

My parents are telling me to work in sales, work at a department/retail store (or any store), or be an informational technology technician or work for the US Government.  

There are not many internships for recent college graduates out there and my geographical location is a large market that doesn't have anything. 

I have been searching for several months and I am not sure if I should continue anymore. Things haven't worked out despite having  multiple journalism experiences/internships already. I feel like something is wrong with me and my demo reels. Maybe the news directors and executive producers believe something is wrong with me, the demo reels, or that they do not believe or think I can do it.

5xpbk5,65,2017-03-05,My gf (20F) of 2 years broke up with me asking for some time alone and I (20M) found out that she has been seeing another dude while we were still together.,topherbalagtas,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5xpbk5/my_gf_20f_of_2_years_broke_up_with_me_asking_for/,"I met my (ex) gf on tinder 2 years ago.

Our relationship was a relatively LDR one. She was from the province and i'm from the city. Our houses were nearly 3 hours away from each other. But because we were both still studying, she lived in a condo near her school. Hence, we only met for at least once a week. Our main methods of communication were through texting the entire day and phone calls every night. 

Fast forward to December of last year, we barely met because of conflicting schedules. Then on Christmas eve, we barely talked to each other. The next day, she told me that she was not happy anymore and she wanted some time alone. Taken aback, I tried to know why. I spent all the months leading up to February 14 trying to win her back and know the reasons why she wanted to end it. 

She eventually admitted that she grew tired of the obligations (the calls every night, having to say I love you too back whenever I said I love you; or basically the routine we had for over 2 years), of our LDR, of me being a very emotional guy, and of me being a jealous person. 

I believed everything she said and I started the process of moving on, when all of a sudden, just 2 days ago, (March 4) a friend of mine who were friends with my ex's best friend told me that my ex has been seeing this dude which I was very jealous about a few months back, even before we've broken up. 

She told me that my ex's best friend, (my friend's friend), opened up to her because she got so pissed at my ex because of what she was doing to me. My ex's best friend told my friend that my ex has been flirting with the dude even before we broke up, and that my ex never even grieved about our break up because she was already flirting with the dude. She said that they've been regularly texting and seeing each other since June and that things got serious on October, when they actually started to look like a couple publicly. She even said that she (ex's best friend) saw my ex disgustingly flirting with the dude on the very next day we broke up. 

What hurts me more is that my ex and I fought about this dude a lot. She met him in June last year during her internship, and he has been texting her ever since. I never told her to stop replying because I didn't want to control her, until one day, I saw the dude text her ""babe"". She cried and explained to me that he was like that to all women and that she never called him babe back, plus that the dude had a gf. From that moment, I knew the dude was serious about my then gf. However, because I was madly in love, I trusted my then gf and told her to tell the dude to stop flirting. I still didn't tell her to stop texting because I really didn't want to come out as controlling. Then a few months later, my then gf told me that the dude gave her flowers. I got mad at my gf because I knew the dude would never give her flowers if she was never lenient on his flirting. So we fought about it for a few days and just tried to forget about it after. She never brought up the dude in any conversation ever since. 

Fast forward to today, I talked to her and she told me that she wasn't necessarily ""meeting"" up with the dude when we were together because he was only coincidentally studying in the same floor as hers. However she confessed that they did dine out a few times while we were together and she apologized for that, but tried to justify it by saying that she knew I'd get angry because she knew how jealous I was of the dude. She also confessed that she has been seeing the dude more the past few weeks, but she insisted that she never flirted and that she's still not flirting with the dude. She just told me that she didn't break up with me because of the dude; that everything was merely coincidental.

However, when I directly asked her best friend, she just reiterated and reinforced what my friend told me (which was essentially her story really); that my gf and the dude had been flirting since June but things only got serious on October, and that everyone knows that they've been flirting with each other ever since. She also told me that when I caught the dude texting my ex ""babe"", my ex was guilty as hell and my ex simply made up excuses to downplay what happened. She (the best friend) apologized for not telling me because she was so torn between principle and friendship. She however told me that her relationship with my ex has gravely changed because of that. 

Right now I feel so betrayed and stupid and confused about what I should do. I have big exams coming up and I really really need advice. 

TL;DR My gf broke up with me and I learned of her continuing affair during our relationship with another dude weeks after our break up.

5xprki,3,2017-03-05,How will I know that I'm ready for a programming internship?,Bat_002,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xprki/how_will_i_know_that_im_ready_for_a_programming/,"I went to CC and now I'm in my first semester at university. I'm 21, and technically I am a second semester sophomore. I had to take mostly prereqs and gen. ed courses at CC. Because of that most of the courses I have left are my CS courses. This semester I'm taking Calc II, Physics I, Intermediate Programming and Discrete Math. I plan on taking courses over the summer.

My path has been different than the average path and so my programming experience is currently only what I've learned in intermediate programming. We've done projects with nested classes, interfaces, abstract interfaces, .jar files she provides us, etc. Outside of that, I've only made around 40 C# scripts from tutorials while playing with a project in Unity. I'm not the best student in my class; I would say I'm in the upper half.

I desperately need a job that pays better than minimum wage and I really want an internship that would provide job experience for when I get my degree and that would apply what I'm learning in class. So far my classes have been taught only in Java. 

When I look at jobs that are available I feel intimidated and I don't know what I'm worth. Basically, what do I need to do to get an internship as a programmer? Should I work through the ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" problems? What kind of project can I do so that my resume doesn't look empty? How many hours do you think I should set aside every day and how long do you think it will take until I'm ready?

I'm feeling very discouraged and I could use some advice. Thanks!"
5xpx2x,17,2017-03-05,Still trying to secure a summer '17 internship -- what to do?,lmtys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xpx2x/still_trying_to_secure_a_summer_17_internship/,"I'm a sophomore in a top 20 university in the US studying CS. My resume was quite bad in the fall, so I didn't get any interest from any companies. I reworked my resume a bit and added some small projects and sent around 60 applications out in mid-February, of which I got 2 interviews from medium/large companies. One interview I had about 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard back (will email them if I don't hear back by Monday). The other interview I passed the phone screen and I am going on-site next week.

What advice would you have for securing an internship this summer this late in the school year? I'm going to focus hard on preparing for next week's interview, but I won't count on getting that offer. I want more interview opportunities over the next month as backup. 

What job boards/resources do I use to find companies to continue to send out resumes? I'm skeptical that a lot of companies are still recruiting now. I've sent out around 10 in the last week to companies with postings on Glassdoor and nobody is responding. I've also tried AngelList and I've only gotten spammy 1-man companies soliciting for specific skills that don't really fit me. Are there better job boards for companies that are still recruiting interns?"

5xq4n6,0,2017-03-05,Did I Make a Big Mistake?,BernieForWi,UWMadison,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/5xq4n6/did_i_make_a_big_mistake/,"I have recently committed to UW - La Crosse, but I get a weak stomach thinking about the mistake I made not deciding to go to UW - Madison. I know that UW-LAX has a 25 ACT average and isn't a low uni, but I don't know if my opportunities are limited because of my decision.

I did not even apply to UW - Madison, but got a 28 on my ACT and have a pretty high GPA so I would have had a good shot at getting in. I am majoring in Computer Science and don't know how strong the program is at La Crosse. 

Do you all feel like I am making a big mistake? Have any of you considered La Crosse before going to Madison, and do you think I should transfer after my first year? I feel like at Madison I will have many more opportunities to get internships and become something significant in the technology field. I don't know if it's possible to go anywhere if I have a degree from La Crosse. 

Thanks for any suggestions/input. "

I am currently doing a Network Administration internship for a K-8 school (parochial school, not much money). They have already tried hiring me full time but it is agreed that they can't pay me enough.

The Admin is going to retire and they want me to fill his shoes. The pay scale is 50k-80k with full benefits. It is hard turning down this position because even at 50k, its more money than a lot of people with 4 year degrees make (in all fields). For a degree that cost me 10k, the return on investment is pretty great. But I still have the feeling that I need a 4 year degree to get ahead in life. Also, It's not like there is room for growth. I need to figure this out before the end of April because I was accepted to 2 different University's and will have to register for class if that is the path I take. If it makes any difference I'm going to be 25 in Summer.

It's at the same school I attended (accelerated IT program) so I already finished my program and got hired because the afternoon Help Desk guy left and I did my internship with him for 4 months, he spoke highly of me.

so ""technically"" I have 7 months in.... I got my A+ last April, I'm retaking some of the classes again to prepare for the Network+ and then MSCA/E (which I understand better than N+)...I'm in the midst of building a PC for Lab/Gaming (hard to with PT money) and I am interested in learning and getting certified in Linux/VMware/office 365 

Am I in the right path, the job is rather easy because it's a school so I spend alot of time just preparing classrooms for new terms by cloning images, installing driver updates, software, troubleshooting some hardware, have built 15 computers since my internship for the school.

I worry that it's not ""IT"" enough because it feels 55% Operations 45% IT, I figure I take the year to get experience in the meanwhile I want to focus more on my certifications because it was harder to focus when I was getting denied for several jobs due to lack of experience and just an A+. My goal is to finish the year in Dec and have atleast be working on MCSE...."

Mobile and I'm an emotional wreck, just going to kinda talk until I feel better. 

(also want to add: I don't care about your feelings about abortion. I don't want to be talked out of it, my mind is made up. Just want someone else to hear how I feel bc I have no one I can talk to about it.)

I took a pregnancy test about 2 hours ago and have been crying nonstop - I am pregnant. I already have one, still with her dad, and cannot physically, emotionally or financially handle another one. I know this is selfish. I am a piece of shit, I know that, you don't have to even try and convince me that I'm not. Having an abortion is a shitty thing to do (although I am very pro choice) and never in my life did I think i would need to have one.

There is no ""thinking"" about it either. I am trying to transfer to a very nice school right now and have the grades to get in -- being pregnant at this point in the semester would ruin my 4.0 GPA and destroy any chance I have at a scholarship and bettering my already living child's life. I have come so far as a teenage mom and to have this happen to me feels like I'm 16 all over again... I have overcome so much and at this point it feels like it's going to come crashing down on me. It's disgusting, but I am more focused on my own future right now. I WANT to graduate with a 4.0 from my dream school, I can't do that with two kids. I can't believe I'm doing it with one right now. 

Aside from that, I am not the type of person who should have children. Don't get me wrong, I am a fantastic mom to my child. I love her, she is my princess and I would literally die for her. But my patience is thin and I find myself getting irrationally angry at a toddler for not listening to me. I am in a constant state of guilt because I am not as understanding as other parents and am scared I'm going to be too mean or strict as she grows up. I know that sounds bad but it's just how I feel. Had I not gotten pregnant with her, I would have never had children. 

Financially, I am barely making it as it is. Daycare is ridiculously expensive and if I want to finish school I would have to put my new baby in daycare almost immediately. For my two kids it would be somewhere around $450 A WEEK. A WEEK!!!!! I'm struggling to pay my child's daycare right now and it is THE CHEAPEST in the entire city. She has everything she wants and needs but that would drastically change if I had another baby. I have a job, an internship go to school full time (15 hrs) and I volunteer. The only day I have off is Sunday, which is reserved for homework and spending time with my baby. Every other day begins at 6am and doesn't end until 11:30pm, but I usually can't get to sleep u til 1am because I have to clean my house and do laundry. I already work SO MUCH, I would have to give up my minuscule amount of sleep in order to get a second job. I don't even know how I could manage it. My boyfriend has a good job but we do not live lavishly. It is bare minimum everything, we don't even have cable because it's too expensive. We are considered ""successful"" for teen parents but ""very poor"" for adults. We don't have family that would help us financially.

I know the logical explanation would be to carry to term for a family who wants a baby-- while that sounds amazing on paper, that is much harder than it sounds. I have one, I know the love I could feel for that child, I wouldn't be able to do that. I would keep it and make everyone's life harder. The worst part about this decision is is that my boyfriends cousin just buried her stillborn baby. She was told not to get pregnant again because she would probably die. She wants and DESERVES a baby SOOOOO BAD. I could give it to her - but I honestly could not do it. I don't want to give a baby away, if I'm going to deal with pregnancy again I want to keep the innocent little person to myself.

I am selfish in so many ways. I want to graduate college, I want to have free time, I want to keep a baby that I don't want to myself instead of giving it to someone in need. I fucking hate myself. I am a horrible, horrible person. I can't stand even thinking about what I am going to do tomorrow - call every abortion clinic within 100 miles. I know it's what I need to do but I don't want to at the same time. I want to be a good person. I know this is just a bundle of cells - but so was my daughter at one point. i know tons of people have abortions and I don't judge a single one of them, but it's hard to think about when it is your own body. I wish things were different so I could raise this baby and be a wonderful mommy and just have a good life. Most people are excited about being pregnant, but I've been crying so hard my face hurts from the tears.

Lesson learned though, I am never having sex EVER again. Literally ever. 

This is all so jumbled up but long story short: I hate my life. I hate this decision. I hate myself. I am a bad person.

5xrn1b,29,2017-03-06,Am I Being Selfish?,i_am_eating_food,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5xrn1b/am_i_being_selfish/,"Hello, I am a long time lurker finally posting for the first time (so excuse my poor formatting hehe). First of all, I want to take this opportunity to thank r/applyingtocollege for helping me through this college application process in many ways.

So before I start my story, here is a little bit of background about myself that might help me explain the situation better.
1. My family immigrated to the U.S. 7 years ago, and our income is pretty low (got 0 for EFC).

2. My parents are extremely religious. And I mean, EXTREMELY religious that they don't care about my education at all.

So I'm a high school senior and fortunately, I got into my realistic first choice college. It is a state university, but it has a great reputation, great engineering program, and is affordable. As I mentioned just now, my EFC is 0 but because our income is so low, I qualify for another state grant that will cover most of the cost for attending that school, so the money is not an issue here. And I would be paying for my college somehow anyways so I don't think my parents can control my college decisions since they won't be paying for it. Plus I think the loan is worth it if it is for the education.


Knowing my religious parents, I knew living on campus or off the campus was never an option for me. They think dormitories are full of sex and drugs and I will leave the religion because of the bad influence. My parents and I had many talks about it. The talk always ended in some form of physical disciplinary action so I stopped resisting. And for a while, I really thought I could commute all 4 years. The school is only 40 minutes away, an hour with the traffic (but there is traffic most of the time), and I have seen a couple people commute from their house, too. But now I'm actually about to attend that school, and I just simply do not want to commute. I want to live in a dorm. And here is my reason.


1. I want to perform my full potential in terms of academic. Maybe in the first year, I can pull a satisfactory GPA with all the time spent on driving but what about the next year and the year after when the classes get harder? I would have to work on a lot of team projects, too. I will probably have to work as well, too since the grant does not cover everything. If I live in a dorm, it would be easier for me to get an internship or on-campus job, too.
Honestly, I'm very scared. The route to the school is notorious for having many car accidents. I'm afraid that I won't be able to perform my full potential. I'm afraid that I won't be able to make friends because I commute. I'm afraid that my life will fall apart after the high school.


2. I want the full ""college experience"".


3. I want to get away from manipulative and controlling parents.


I will be 18 by the time I go to college, so I know my parents can't legally control me, but I have a younger brother (4 years younger than me) and my parents will destroy his freedom if I leave the home because they would want to make sure my brother does not turn out ""bad"" like I did. My brother and I already had a talk about me going away for college and he was terrified that our parents will ruin his life because of my ""selfish"" action.
Also, I will get disowned and support myself completely on my own (car, car insurance, health insurance, phone bill, and all that stuff). And my mom has been threatening to kill herself if I do anything to disappoint her and God, and I think she will really commit suicide if I leave home for college. I'm not sure if I can handle the guilt. I'm scared to even talk about it with my parents because every time I do, my mom ends up having a meltdown and stops talking for me for a few weeks.


So given the circumstances, I will probably commute to school all 4 years and I know it is not gonna be that bad but I can't help myself feeling angry and frustrated over this. It's not like I'm asking for them to send me to an OOS college that cost over 60k a year. I just want to live in a dorm and my parents won't have to worry about paying for it. Am I being selfish for wanting to dorm?



**TL;DR Religious and overprotective parents want me to commute but I simply don't want to for a number of reasons. Am I being selfish for wanting to live in a dorm?**"

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls 

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5xsuic,233,2017-03-06,"[Plan] I'm a 22 yr. old, female, loser. I have A LOT of issues that I need to work on. How do I work on them and where do I start? (UPDATE)",frustrated20smthng,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5xsuic/plan_im_a_22_yr_old_female_loser_i_have_a_lot_of/,"Hello, /r/getdisciplined. I posted [on here eight months ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4qehul/plan_im_a_22_yr_old_female_loser_i_have_a_lot_of/)  and now I am back again. Someone suggested I post an update after a few months so that I can get some more help if I need it. I think now is a good time because I have been having a really rough month. I need more help if you guys don’t mind. I’m going to give you a detailed update of the last eight months. But if you’re expecting a big-ass progress, I’m sorry but you’re going to be disappointed. Anyway, here goes...


Okay, so after posting here eight months ago, the first thing I did was read through all the comments and compiled the ones that I found helpful. [Here it is if anyone is interested.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TEjFvDHY2N8Rl96_A6J9LLk8OvmaX5yAgMfZr0_X_XU/edit?usp=sharing) I included the websites, books, and motivational quotes people sent me. I didn’t read all of them but someone on here might find interest in reading them (they’re at the very bottom). I found Dale Carnegie’s book the most helpful with communicating with people. I still need to do more when it comes to my social anxiety though.

So after doing that, I was all pumped. I wanted to get my shit together already! I started with journaling everyday, working out, and watching YT tutorials on graphic design, but not long after that I crashed and burned. I was suddenly overwhelmed and anxious and frustrated again. It took me a few more months to recuperate and set more realistic goals. Instead of throwing myself to getting a design job right away, I tried freelance. I went on Upwork and /r/designjobs and even /r/freedesign just to learn a bit more about GD before working for real. Btw, this taught me to never do things for free or for cheap because clients are the worst.


After getting sick of unstable pay, at the end of last year, I started applying for jobs in my field. It started with 2-3 jobs a day and then setting the bar higher and higher. I was interviewed and denied a shitton of times, but I tried to not let it get to me. Right before the holidays, I got my first job EVER which was related to my degree. I was really excited for it because it’s at an outsourcing company which has a different culture than advertising or marketing agencies that I know I am not ready for. Plus, they offered to pay me more than I asked for.

**
PROGRESS REPORT:**

1.	**CAREER**: I got a job related to my degree.
2.	**HEALTH**: I like to treadmill. I really enjoy it even if I don’t do it everyday, and I have been finding it easier and easier to run. I try to do more stuff everyday like squats and ab workouts.
3.	**LEARNED TO DO SOMETHING ALONE**: I traveled alone last month to a non-English speaking country thanks to my brother who helped me pay for it. It was wonderful. I have never done anything like it and I didn’t get anxious at all.
4.	I learned that I cannot do everything at once. Before my trip, I got nauseous and thought I had to cancel because I stressed myself out too much.



**
WHAT I NEED HELP WITH (NEED A NEW PLAN):**

1.	**ACTUALLY KEEPING MY JOB:** I am going to just include this one. I need help with my social anxiety but my job is my priority at the moment. I am now two months into my job (six month probationary period). I like my job and I like the people. I know their niceness is a front, but at least they’re not assholes. What I need help with is to be a regular employee. I mentioned earlier that I haven’t had a good month. They grade us every month and for January, I got mostly 4 out of 5 but for two of the subsections (speed and internal EPP), I got 1 &amp; 2 which are failing grades. I feel extremely overwhelmed right now and frustrated again. It makes me feel like they feel that hiring me was a mistake.

    a.	**Speed** – Work fast, while producing quality content. Here is the thing. I cannot do that at the same time. My friend told me to master the program and the branding of the company first and that's what I did but I’m afraid I am not progressing as fast as I should. Ideally they want our grades to get higher every month. They just finished grading us for Feb and I don't know if I failed this section again. I got a lot of stuff late in Feb. I’m starting to get performance anxiety. The more I obsess over perfecting the project, the more hot and anxious I get. It makes me not look forward to go to work.


    ***Rant***:  today, a client returned a SIMPLE project to me maybe five times because I was panicking and his instructions were unclear (to me. My TL understood it perfectly) and so my anxiety clouded my brain and did a lot of dumb, careless shit. I could feel them getting frustrated. Before that, I submitted something late that was URGENT. I missed a few things as well and they had to send it back to me. Every time a client sends something back, we get errors. I have a magnet for these things actually. My mistakes are careless and lack common sense. This was the problem at my internship before too. Not sure if it’s my anxiety, or if I’m just slow and lack common sense, or both. I don’t know how to improve on it. I have tried memorizing what I need to check before submitting but when it’s urgent I cannot do it well. I don’t really know how I’m going to be a regular employee after this.  



    b.	**Internal EPP** -  This and speed sorta go hand in hand. The small mistakes I made because I was in a hurry go under here. To help up my grade for the latter, my TL gave me a special project which I hope helped increase it. We’ll see if it helped. 

I'm sorry for the whining, but I am just not making big progress at my job. I have tried writing shit down to remember and checking everything before submitting, but that costs time and sometimes projects are urgent and speed is what I need help with. When I am fast, I do stupid things. Not sure what to prioritize here. Please, if anyone has been in this situation, please help me.

**TL;DR:** Was able to get myself a job I like but I need help keeping it. I need a new plan to help me improve my job skills when it comes to speed and quality. Help me avoid doing dumb shit at work.

5xt694,11,2017-03-06,"CSC Senior, Accepted to Grad School, Feeling Overwhelmed. Is this level of work normal?",Dominator046,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xt694/csc_senior_accepted_to_grad_school_feeling/,"Hello, everyone! This is my first post here in this subreddit, not a frequent user of reddit in general, but finding this board might be just what I needed!

I will warn you, there may be some tangential venting in this post. I don't have too much longer to write, and each time I go back through I end up cutting this post significantly.

Anyways, to begin:

I'm a CSC major, finally rounding the bend as a senior. Technically I'm facing the last semester of my major classes, but I have some gen eds to clean up next semester, since I started out of rotation. So, really, I'm almost a graduate! Yay me!

I've never failed a CSC course. I do quite well on theory, and pre-planning implementation. I'm not the fastest coder on the block, but I can work through problems. I struggle debugging other people's uncommented code (*grumble), but I can do it.  I haven't had an internship yet, but I am waiting on a few phone calls. Yay!

Though, that's all well and good. Why did I title the thread this way? Well, I'm struggling to keep it that way at this point.

I'm at a full load at my university with eighteen credits for the semester, fifteen of which are 400-level senior courses, with one 300-level junior math course. My days are mostly consumed with slamming down code as quickly as possible, tearing from one subject and project group from the next. I'm not learning anything, I'm just trying to keep my head above water with the grades. I'm doing well in almost all of my courses, save the math, and one CSC course.

I have never felt so particularly stressed as I do right now. I don't have enough time to dedicate to truly solving one project, and I have three different groups of people demanding my best work simultaneously. I see my other groupmates do it by largely operating in the same group and dividing out the assignments, taking less classes, or just 'working harder'.

The capstone to my degree, a software engineering project where I cooperate with three other people to produce software that should uphold professional standards is also demoralizing me. I can work on par with most of my groupmates, save one who is definitely way above my level. His suggestion for a project is the one we're working on, and I feel that his aspirations have me in-and-over my head. Between participating in a number of the same courses, ordering additional resources to study in the meantime, and explaining that if 'I'm not coding, I might as well be doing crystal meth', I realize fully that I cannot operate in a way that's going to meaningfully satisfy these expectations without dropping classes.

I've come to terms with the fact that I might need to drop the two classes I'm not doing well in, take an extra semester to finish them, and be done with my degree slightly late. Start grad school a little late, but protect my 3.0+ GPA and financial aid.

But, I am worrying now that this is what my future is going to be like once I graduate. Dedicating hours upon hours every single day to achieving the bare minimum of proficiency, just to then go to work, and slave out the last bits of what I'd been working on. If so, I'm not sure my earlier classes effectively showed me how much work a career in this field would be, and if I can hack it so it speak.

So, really, I'm asking if this level of stress / dedication is normal?

I manage to squeeze in the little things, a weekly D&amp;D campaign I DM (which I've had to cancel a few times at the behest of partners), a bit of youtube everyday typically regulated to an hour, weekly sports practice (which I've almost completely given up to finish assignments or meet with group members), and occasional time out with my lady. I got up extra early today after having a relatively merciful weekend, so I'm managing this post out now before class. 

But I want a bit more out of my life than just a constant grind. I'm okay with constantly learning more. I find computer science fascinating. I like computers! I like solving puzzles, even when I'm not so good at them! I don't like it though when the bare minimum for these tasks consumes my life.

So, my original question. Am I experiencing the normal level of stress that a computer science professional should just 'get with', or after I finish my course work (maybe even get to grad school) will there be a silver lining where I can have my free time back?

Thank you all for reading this far, and sorry if I've been supremely vague. Doxxing people I work with / myself probably isn't in my interest."

So I have from now to mid june to do anything I want.

I'm thinking about:

* improve my C (i'm having fun with coding game);

* learn c++ and java;

* build a little robot with arduino;

* getting my english from b2 to c1;

* learning a third language to a2/b1 level (thinking about German dunno, anyway I dont think I will be able to do it);


What else could I learn? I can't ask for an internship because I work already and I'm interested in medical robotics.

5xu1a6,4,2017-03-06,My boyfriend was once the 'other man' (sort of) in a relationship and it makes me uncomfortable,meepmeep____,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/5xu1a6/my_boyfriend_was_once_the_other_man_sort_of_in_a/,"My boyfriend and I are both in our mid twenties, and have been dating for a year or so. This is my first relationship and, having no prior experience to refer to, would like to get some unbiased opinions from you wonderful ladies. 

I found out last night that my boyfriend (let's call him Bill) had once dated a girl (let's call her Mary) who was in a relationship at the time. Bill says that initially, when he found out that Mary had a boyfriend, he backed off and did not try to pursue anything with her. However, they remained friends and she eventually told him that she was in an unhappy relationship. Her and her current boyfriend (let's call him John) were long distance, and though she had tried to end it a couple of times, John was unwilling to let her go. Thus, they decided to try an open relationship. However, this was not something John wanted, but rather the only way he could think of to prolong his relationship with Mary. Knowing all of this, Bill then begins a relationship with Mary, although he doesn't necessarily define it as dating since they had to keep it under wraps because their friends knew Mary was dating John. Bill and Mary were together for the duration of their internship (a few months) and ended it soon after. 

My boyfriend does not think what he did was necessarily right, but he stresses the fact that he entered into a relationship with Mary after she said it was okay. In my opinion, considering how John was the one getting hurt, I don't think her permission meant much in the context of the situation. 

I'm bothered by this part of his past because although my boyfriend is really kind and loving most of the time, this seems to show a lack of regard for another person's feelings. It was sometime in his early twenties, so not too long ago. I also have some personal issues with cheating, which could also be a factor here. I'd really like to hear some other opinions rather than mull over this by myself. Thank you!!"

I have multiple internships under my belt. I can start from scratch and build anything you want, but for some reason I don't do well on interviews. I guess, I'm just not a problem solver type (at least in the ""fast"" pace). I recently, made it to on-site at Amazon and after solving all the problems - I got rejected -- they said it was a very close decision. 

I'm very skilled and have experience, on-paper, but I'm struggling getting a job as a software engineer. Even though, I know I deserve to be there. I have a phone interview coming up with Google, but considering how fucking hard those are, my hopes are very fucking low - but I'm not stopping trying, I'm trying to solve all the interview questions that fucking exist.

Currently I work as a Tech Support Guy -- I have no respect for my job and I will not give up until I find what I am looking for. I really hate where I am at the moment and I am not planning to settle. It's just so hard when you fall down like this.

I just wish someone would see past the fucking world of the ""interview questions"" and give me a fucking chance. I'm the quickest learner there is, and I can do whatever I have to do, and I'm always the hardest working guy in the room. Anyone that ever, gave me a chance, saw that I was worth it, and I always over-performed.

With the knowledge and experience I have under my belt I could be leading a team of engineers at the moment. But instead, I'm dealing with stupid API problems. 

Sorry if I sound like a person who is crying but I'm really fucking down at the moment and I know I can't change the system, but I have to change me. I just don't know if that will ever be enough. 

Sorry about the rant. It's just that all the work I have put in, and I have a horrible fucking job (even though it pays well), it's making me sick to my stomach.

In my current position, I was hired as an intern and was hired after only 1 or 2 phone interviews. From there I stayed onboard after the internship and I'm still here nearly 2 years later. It's a startup company.

I've landed an interview with an established company for this Friday, going to be spending a few hours with them in-person interviewing with about a half dozen people, varying from directors to VPs.

While in school I worked as a waiter so my people skills are quite good, provided I'm prepared enough and don't get thrown too many curveballs, but I can handle a few because I know I won't be able to foresee every question of theirs.

Does anyone here have any tips for interviews like this? I'm not sure what they could want to discuss with several higher-ups. I already know what I like about the company and how they appeal to me, as well as everything I've written on my resume. So that should answer a decent number of questions.

This is going to be a long one, reddit.


**About Myself :**
I am an undergrad in mechanical engineering. I like what I study (mainly fluid simulations). I do some programming in my free time - build tools for personal use, contribute to OSS projects to fix some bugs that I face. I especially love it when something breaks and I need to do some *google-fu* to fix it on my computer. I don't like competitive programming, but love development hackathons. I am one of those guys who love to learn a little bit of everything but fail to know one thing well.

**The Big Question :** I am not sure if just programming is the right path for me. I am not sure about *just* mechanical engineering either. I would love to do something that involves both. Are there any career options related to this? Do some of you guys from non-CS background have a programming job? Do you like it?

This dilemma took away a lot of internship opportunities for the past years. The companies here don't like jack-of-all-trade types. I would really appreciate your time if you guide me, reddit.

Thanks!

5xvbnu,3,2017-03-06,Mentally exhausted. Long Post,Kasrios,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5xvbnu/mentally_exhausted_long_post/,"Hi Reddit,
I'm sitting here looking at the keyboard and thinking about how to explain my situation. I'm not good with explaining or talking in general so bare with me...
Life story so this is a very long wall of text.
PS: English is not my first tongue.

I'm an Iraqi born guy, currently 21 years old, who's been living in Jordan for a little over 10 years. From an outside shell i always thought i had a good childhood but recently because of what has been happening with me, as i think and try to figure out why am i like this i can't find a reason. Because of my university studies i was reading a book by Christopher Alexander and i came up upon a sentence ( i can't remember the exact words), but it means that if a child does not spend time with other children growing up he will not be normal and that includes both humans and animals. I have a brother who's 7 years older than me, and because of that age difference  we weren't that close and he didn't prefer to spend time with me. We never had a good relationship. I haven't spoken him since about 5 months. Growing up i never went to kinder garden or nursery i was pretty much at home until first grade school. Because of the war my parents are very overprotective and they didn't let me out of the house and play with other kids in the street or something. I spent a lot of time alone, i used to talk and play with  my plushies, imaginary friends, cats ( i love cats )  and a fig tree in our garden. My father worked very late ( up to 10 somedays). So almost the entire day it was just me and mom in a very large house.

So i'm not NORMAL and this is my first problem. I have always struggled to fit in and to have friends, or at least long lasting friendships. I was the kid that would get picked last in a ""school"" game or something like that. I have had a few friends over the years that moved on at some point or another. In my last year of high school i pretty much had no friend. 

I don't have or at least i don't think i have Social anxiety. One would think i'm shy but i'm not, maybe i'm reserved but not shy.
Another HUGE problem which could be one of the reasons people don't like me or lose interest in me after spending time with me is that i don't talk. I like talking ( when i do ) i like being in a conversation i love hanging with people, i love people and i love listening. I just simply don't have anything to say most times. And most the things i talk about is asking questions and routine small talk. I can't explain very well and i can't tell a story in a fun way. The older i get the worse i get. I even stutter now... i didn't stutter when i was a child and it's embaressing and it's getting worse year by year.


And now i'm in my third year in college. During my school days i liked video gaming and i spent most of my time gaming( mostly online) i was little and naive. I didn't feel there was a problem. That i didn't have a social life outside of gaming ( who were amazing people). i stopped enjoying games overall and i stopped about 3years ago. After stopping my social life was non existing. Slowly i started to realise how lonely i am. It's a horrible feeling, like slowly dying the more time passes. 

Social life is very dominant in college and you see it everywhere. People chatting all the time and during their breaks between classes. They socialize in college, outside it, during the holiday, etc. Of course i'm always left out and uninvited. Even from the people i felt i was close to and worse... friends with. 

I did have people who i thought i was friends with, but i'm the one who would get left out or not be included in group's inside joke. I mainly had a group of friends that i will call The Group. I met them since the beginning. I also met another friend in my first day of college who's now my only friend. Sadly he switched to another college. We're still good friends and he's the only friend that i go out with ( actually my only friend in general ). And i'm tankful for that. Even though, hid humor gets on my nerves sometimes, but i love him. And i HATE breaks, contrary to literally everyone, because it's a reminder of how lonely i am, i just usually sit at the college's terrace and do nothing for an hour and a half. Sometimes i go to the piano room and play something. 

If you're still reading i'm reaching the point of posting this post.

So, with The Group i did use to be friendly with for a long while and i'd sit with them. I didn't talk alot which i hate but i enjoyed their company. It's better than being alone.

By the way i'm Bisexual.

In the First semester of second year. I was enrolled in a class. We had a project that we were supposed to work on a group of 4 on it. Anyway, i didn't know anyone that class because it was a first year subject that i didn't take and i'm taking it in my second year. So i didn't know anyone in that class. My chance i was grouped in a group. In that group there was a guy my age who transferred this semester to my college. I'll call him T. I noticed that he's different and not like most people ( not a bad way but a nice smart way). We finished the project, He and i pretty much did all the work ( it was a group of 4) . He worked hard and i liked that a lot about him. I was attracted to him since pretty much our first meeting. We became friends quickly. I felt very comfortable with him. I helped him easing in to the university and classes. Next semester we became even better friends, we also had more classes together and he was more introduced to the other people of our year. I liked almost everything about him. From his hard work, appearance, voice, way of speaking and cleanliness as i noticed from visiting his home. I would feel perfectly happy and serene just by being with him even if we didn't say or do anything together. And i never had full trust and felt completely comfortable with a stranger before that. I realized that i loved him. I never loved a guy nor a girl before him.

I think he's straight and i never told him i love him. 

During that semester he made more friends and also became friends with "" the group"". We were still best friends. But he became doing things that made me upset. Mainly ignoring me, forgetting me, not calling and asking where i'm at and lying to me. Even though i'm always there for him and would drop anything i'm doing to help him. It kills me from the inside when he does that. last semester ( First semester third year ). I and The Group were setting working in a class, and he came and greeted everyone but me. Litrerally greeted a guy infront of me but not me. Then a while later he called my name and asked for gum without even a Hi. I threw it at his face and said nothing, he didn't think something was wrong.

More time passes more he prefers company of the other guys. And later i find out they have been going out a lot of times and i was never invited. I couldn't believe he wouldn't tell me. I was talking with T and hinting at it and he said "" i just went out with the guys"" as if i'm not friends with them BEFORE him, and as if i'm not a ""guy"". I still loved him. Then came the break between semesters and we both did internships in different companies. Before the break we agreed that we'd go out and see a movie together the next saturday. ( was 3 days after the break started). I waited but he didn't call so i called and he said  sorry that he has a birthday party that came up that he needs to go to ,all i could think of is he's just going out with ""the guys"" and he didn't want to tell me so, i was boiling with rage. Anyway, he told me we can go the next day, which was a sunday, and i was like ok great. When he said that i felt more relaxed. Yup, next day he didn't call or confirm through a message, and as i was swiping through snapchat i saw his name... i was terrified knowing what i'm expecting to see and yup... he was out with ""The Group"", but that's not the problem. It's not like they called him to go out and he went out and forgot me, but they were in HIS house. He invited him and secluded me. I died from the inside. I have depression but i don't take medication. After sawing that picture, i died from the inside, and it was the first time in my life that i genuinely prayed to not wake up and die and was genuinely disappointed after waking up the morning after. Why do i suck socially? Why don't i have friends? 

Why people don't like me?
I'm a very nice person, people say i'm too nice so it's not that i think myself as nice but i'm not actually nice. I even look nice and people get surprised if they see me do a wild thing or listen to unusual music. 
I have always been there for him, the week before, we had projects submission. I had finished mine and he needed help so we stayed the entire night working on his project at his home. I couldn't even go back to my house and i had to go to university in my day old clothes without taking a bath. Why doesn't he appreciate me?

I'm madly in love him But after that happened i hated him, had to forget him and get over him. I removed him from snapchat so i don't see what he's doing. He called only once during that break just before the next semester start but i didn't, couldn't answer. I decided to accept that fact that i'm alone and will always be. I cut him off from my life. I also don't talk with ""the group"" again. Only if they say something to me and i speak very coldly to them.

And, next semester starts, the first day i avoid T and in a mutual class i sat to the opposite of wherever he and ""The Group"" do. I hate him but still in love with him. Ignoring him hurts. He did greet me the first day, i said quickly Hi. The next day he came to me while i was on my laptop and asked that i didn't look ok yesterday or sad. I just said why would i be sad, coldly. I think he knew something was odd. 

The reason i did that as the reason i'm writing this post.
i'm trying to cut him off from my life. But i love him. it's been 2weeks into the semester and after the first 2days he spoke to me he never spoke again. I thought this would be for the good but i still miss him and love him, same time hate him. 

The reason i'm trying to cut him off is, i'm mentally exhausted ( from everything i wrote so far ), i just can't afford being hurt again by anyone and especially not by someone who i love and admire like him. But i'm afraid with cutting him off, i'm losing two things, a friendship and someone i live ( He's straight though). If i didn't cut him off i'm only losing his love. What should i do? I'm mentally exhausted. I can't afford therapy and i'm losing my will to live. lost the will to study and hobbies. I used to be an A student but i'm getting worse. I'm barely average now. 

Every single goddamn night i just keep thinking about him and about being physically in touch him. It smoothes me to fantasies about him holding me. even though when i actually see him i hate him so much because he hurt me.

I lost my will to live, my love for hobbits, my will to study, will to do anything.

If i am to... restore our friendship, how would i initiate or explain it? if he asks what's been wrong what should i say? Note that i can't tell him that i love him or that i'm Bi. I never told anyone or my family about all of this and I can't do that. 

What should i do?
Sorry for the very long wall of text.

I haven't spoken him since about 5 months. Growing up i never went to kinder garden or nursery i was pretty much at home until first grade school. Because of the war my parents are very overprotective and they didn't let me out of the house and play with other kids in the street or something. I spent a lot of time alone, i used to talk and play with  my plushies, imaginary friends, cats ( i love cats )  and a fig tree in our garden. My father worked very late ( up to 10 somedays). So almost the entire day it was just me and mom in a very large house.

So i'm not NORMAL and this is my first problem. I have always struggled to fit in and to have friends, or at least long lasting friendships. I was the kid that would get picked last in a ""school"" game or something like that. I have had a few friends over the years that moved on at some point or another. In my last year of high school i pretty much had no friend. 

I don't have or at least i don't think i have Social anxiety. One would think i'm shy but i'm not, maybe i'm reserved but not shy.
Another HUGE problem which could be one of the reasons people don't like me or lose interest in me after spending time with me is that i don't talk. I like talking ( when i do ) i like being in a conversation i love hanging with people, i love people and i love listening. I just simply don't have anything to say most times. And most the things i talk about is asking questions and routine small talk. I can't explain very well and i can't tell a story in a fun way. The older i get the worse i get. I even stutter now... i didn't stutter when i was a child and it's embaressing and it's getting worse year by year.


And now i'm in my third year in college. During my school days i liked video gaming and i spent most of my time gaming( mostly online) i was little and naive. I didn't feel there was a problem. That i didn't have a social life outside of gaming ( who were amazing people). i stopped enjoying games overall and i stopped about 3years ago. After stopping my social life was non existing. Slowly i started to realise how lonely i am. It's a horrible feeling, like slowly dying the more time passes. 

Social life is very dominant in college and you see it everywhere. People chatting all the time and during their breaks between classes. They socialize in college, outside it, during the holiday, etc. Of course i'm always left out and uninvited. Even from the people i felt i was close to and worse... friends with. 

I did have people who i thought i was friends with, but i'm the one who would get left out or not be included in group's inside joke. I mainly had a group of friends that i will call The Group. I met them since the beginning. I also met another friend in my first day of college who's now my only friend. Sadly he switched to another college. We're still good friends and he's the only friend that i go out with ( actually my only friend in general ). And i'm tankful for that. Even though, hid humor gets on my nerves sometimes, but i love him. And i HATE breaks, contrary to literally everyone, because it's a reminder of how lonely i am, i just usually sit at the college's terrace and do nothing for an hour and a half. Sometimes i go to the piano room and play something. 

If you're still reading i'm reaching the point of posting this post.

So, with The Group i did use to be friendly with for a long while and i'd sit with them. I didn't talk alot which i hate but i enjoyed their company. It's better than being alone.

By the way i'm Bisexual.

In the First semester of second year. I was enrolled in a class. We had a project that we were supposed to work on a group of 4 on it. Anyway, i didn't know anyone that class because it was a first year subject that i didn't take and i'm taking it in my second year. So i didn't know anyone in that class. My chance i was grouped in a group. In that group there was a guy my age who transferred this semester to my college. I'll call him T. I noticed that he's different and not like most people ( not a bad way but a nice smart way). We finished the project, He and i pretty much did all the work ( it was a group of 4) . He worked hard and i liked that a lot about him. I was attracted to him since pretty much our first meeting. We became friends quickly. I felt very comfortable with him. I helped him easing in to the university and classes. Next semester we became even better friends, we also had more classes together and he was more introduced to the other people of our year. I liked almost everything about him. From his hard work, appearance, voice, way of speaking and cleanliness as i noticed from visiting his home. I would feel perfectly happy and serene just by being with him even if we didn't say or do anything together. And i never had full trust and felt completely comfortable with a stranger before that. I realized that i loved him. I never loved a guy nor a girl before him.

I think he's straight and i never told him i love him. 

During that semester he made more friends and also became friends with "" the group"". We were still best friends. But he became doing things that made me upset. Mainly ignoring me, forgetting me, not calling and asking where i'm at and lying to me. Even though i'm always there for him and would drop anything i'm doing to help him. It kills me from the inside when he does that. last semester ( First semester third year ). I and The Group were setting working in a class, and he came and greeted everyone but me. Litrerally greeted a guy infront of me but not me. Then a while later he called my name and asked for gum without even a Hi. I threw it at his face and said nothing, he didn't think something was wrong.

More time passes more he prefers company of the other guys. And later i find out they have been going out a lot of times and i was never invited. I couldn't believe he wouldn't tell me. I was talking with T and hinting at it and he said "" i just went out with the guys"" as if i'm not friends with them BEFORE him, and as if i'm not a ""guy"". I still loved him. Then came the break between semesters and we both did internships in different companies. Before the break we agreed that we'd go out and see a movie together the next saturday. ( was 3 days after the break started). I waited but he didn't call so i called and he said  sorry that he has a birthday party that came up that he needs to go to ,all i could think of is he's just going out with ""the guys"" and he didn't want to tell me so, i was boiling with rage. Anyway, he told me we can go the next day, which was a sunday, and i was like ok great. When he said that i felt more relaxed. Yup, next day he didn't call or confirm through a message, and as i was swiping through snapchat i saw his name... i was terrified knowing what i'm expecting to see and yup... he was out with ""The Group"", but that's not the problem. It's not like they called him to go out and he went out and forgot me, but they were in HIS house. He invited him and secluded me. I died from the inside. I have depression but i don't take medication. After sawing that picture, i died from the inside, and it was the first time in my life that i genuinely prayed to not wake up and die and was genuinely disappointed after waking up the morning after. Why do i suck socially? Why don't i have friends? 

Why people don't like me?
I'm a very nice person, people say i'm too nice so it's not that i think myself as nice but i'm not actually nice. I even look nice and people get surprised if they see me do a wild thing or listen to unusual music. 
I have always been there for him, the week before, we had projects submission. I had finished mine and he needed help so we stayed the entire night working on his project at his home. I couldn't even go back to my house and i had to go to university in my day old clothes without taking a bath. Why doesn't he appreciate me?

I'm madly in love him But after that happened i hated him, had to forget him and get over him. I removed him from snapchat so i don't see what he's doing. He called only once during that break just before the next semester start but i didn't, couldn't answer. I decided to accept that fact that i'm alone and will always be. I cut him off from my life. I also don't talk with ""the group"" again. Only if they say something to me and i speak very coldly to them.

And, next semester starts, the first day i avoid T and in a mutual class i sat to the opposite of wherever he and ""The Group"" do. I hate him but still in love with him. Ignoring him hurts. He did greet me the first day, i said quickly Hi. The next day he came to me while i was on my laptop and asked that i didn't look ok yesterday or sad. I just said why would i be sad, coldly. I think he knew something was odd. 

The reason i did that as the reason i'm writing this post.
i'm trying to cut him off from my life. But i love him. it's been 2weeks into the semester and after the first 2days he spoke to me he never spoke again. I thought this would be for the good but i still miss him and love him, same time hate him. 

The reason i'm trying to cut him off is, i'm mentally exhausted ( from everything i wrote so far ), i just can't afford being hurt again by anyone and especially not by someone who i love and admire like him. But i'm afraid with cutting him off, i'm losing two things, a friendship and someone i live ( He's straight though). If i didn't cut him off i'm only losing his love. What should i do? I'm mentally exhausted. I can't afford therapy and i'm losing my will to live. lost the will to study and hobbies. I used to be an A student but i'm getting worse. I'm barely average now. 

Every single goddamn night i just keep thinking about him and about being physically in touch him. It smoothes me to fantasies about him holding me. even though when i actually see him i hate him so much because he hurt me.

I lost my will to live, my love for hobbits, my will to study, will to do anything.

If i am to... restore our friendship, how would i initiate or explain it? if he asks what's been wrong what should i say? Note that i can't tell him that i love him or that i'm Bi. I never told anyone or my family about all of this and I can't do that. 

What should i do?
Sorry for the very long wall of text.

I believe her and accepted the position and moved away. I went and finally sought help for my mental health issues and decided I wanted to get better for her and my love has grown stronger. She, however, told me she felt suffocated in the relationship and needed space. It was 5 days before she was supposed to fly out and visit me that she said we needed to break up so she could have space. She was extremely proud of the progress I was making and there were times when she was feeling happy with me and glad. I don't know if it was the distance and trust, but I was making all the right steps to win her back. I want her back more than anything, but I do not know what to do.

5xwksw,7,2017-03-06,Stuck in Electrical Engineering,ubcengisinteresting,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5xwksw/stuck_in_electrical_engineering/,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if I'm just ranting or seeking advice. A bit of both.


I made the mistake of choosing Electrical Engineering. What I wanted to do was Computer Engineering. 


I'm in my 3rd year (2nd year standing) and I have enjoyed my programming and digital design courses the most, and quite honestly do not like electrical core courses at all. 


Now im not just whining about hard courses. I enjoyed struggling with the more difficult aspects of CPEN 211, CPEN 311, and CPSC 259. But I really dislike courses like Elec 202 and elec 211. And it is very difficult getting through these courses when they are completely irrelevant to what I want to do with my career. 


I am interested in firmware, embedded systems, and fpga related work for context. But would be happy with any sort of software development outlooks. 


I have tried transferring to the cpen program 3 times now, but due to my very low average i have been unable to. I also applied to transfer to arts and science to do computer science as a hail mary but will likely not be admitted because of my grades. I also know I will do better in school if i had the opportunity to more directly pursue my passion and interests. For example i got 90+ percent on the labs for cpen 311, which is a big up from how i did in similar labs in 211.


Now I have taught myself the basics of a new language and have a outlined a project for myself to better position myself for internships. But i feel like im trying to become a plumber while going to electricians school. 


So is the only thing I can do sticking it out with electrical engineering for 2-3 more years? And then shaping my career later? It is just so daunting when getting through these courses is very draining.


I feel like I messed up school and I don't know how to fix it."

* **How does one figure out what they want to do with their degree?** For example Computer Science is a blanket for writing code, building computers, working IT etc. I feel like I have to choose a subset to focus on and I just don't know which I want to do. 

* **How does one go about looking for relevant jobs to get us to our profession?** I'm afraid to say I want an internship because it implies that I can afford to not be paid, which is not true to my situation.

5xx45h,3,2017-03-06,[A4A] Freshman Savages,JamSideDown,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5xx45h/a4a_freshman_savages/,"Kiko stopped in her tracks as one by one the boys emerged from their hut, spears in hand, faces red with blood and war paint, necklaces of bone hanging on their naked chests. She could hardly imagine that just three months earlier they had been six fresh-faced high school graduates, with college, life, and the whole world ahead of them. No one could have predicted the swiftness of their descent into bestial madness.

It had been a simple enough idea. In the spring, the six boys had been recruited by Northern State University, South to participate in a sociological experiment. They would spend three months in the tropical wilderness of Isla de Carne, monitored only by remote surveillance, with no contact with the civilized world. It was safe, relatively speaking--they were supplied with sufficient tools and rations, and the wilds were clear of any predators. It had seemed like a fun idea; Survivor for college credit that they would receive in the fall. The participants were even thoroughly vetted, to make sure only the most accomplished young men were chosen. How could it have gone so wrong?

To this day, no one is sure just how it happened. Maybe it was something in the drinking water. Maybe it was the curse of the island natives, who'd died out two hundred years earlier, and left behind nothing but a promise of ruin for those who followed them. Maybe, without endless streams of MTV and internet pornography to suppress it, human nature had simply taken over. Whatever the reason, in three short months these six of the best and brightest newly minted young men had fallen to their basest impulses. And now Kiko was the last hope to bring them back.

Kiko stood before the boys, the distant smell of freshly carved meat wafting towards her in the tropical breeze. The NSUS Sociology Department's brightest intern, Kiko could hardly afford to fail in her mission. Something more important hung in the balance than just the lives of six soon-to-be college freshmen. This mission would decide, above all else, that thing most important to every college girl: Her grade.

Stuart was the first to approach her. He had graduated top of his class, with multiple national spelling bee, mathlympics, and spellinglympics championship trophies to his name. Hunched forward, Stuart lumbered towards Kiko, sniffing at the ground around her. He sniffed up her leg, past her thigh, and buried his face into the warmth of her vagina. Kiko tensed up, but said nothing, unwilling to show fear, or any sign of weakness, barely watching as Stuart's nose dug fiercely into the front of her skirt.

Stuart straightened up. ""WOMAN!"" he shouted to the others, his voice a guttural grunt.

""Yes,"" replied Wesley, ""We can see.""

""I'm here to bring you home,"" said Kiko, firm-footed as she straightened her skirt. The boys laughed. ""What's so funny?"" Kiko asked.

""The dove flies,"" said Josh slowly, ""but the falcon rules the skies."" Josh stood taller than the rest, his football star body bare and burnt brown by months under the tropical sun. When he spoke, the others straightened themselves.

""The falcon rules the skies!"" chanted the other boys.

*This is going to be harder than I thought,* Kiko thought, startled by the force of their collective voice.

""Why don't we head back to the docks and we can talk all about it there?""

""The falcon does not fly far from his nest."" said Josh.

""The falcon rules the skies!"" chanted the boys again.

""But if the dove has come this far to the falcon's nest,"" Josh said, walking forward until he and Kiko were inches apart, ""she must know what comes of pests.""

""They go back to get reinforcements?"" Kiko asked.

""You will stay here,"" said Josh. ""The falcon demands a sacrifice."" With that, he took Kiko's blouse in both of his firm, calloused hands and tore it in two, revealing her milky breasts to the crowd before shoving her to the ground.

""SACRIFICE!"" shouted the boys, whooping and shrieking as they swarmed forward, charged and ready for action.

5xxmp1,2,2017-03-06,What percentage of interviews consist of actual whiteboard coding?,TruthReveals,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5xxmp1/what_percentage_of_interviews_consist_of_actual/,"So I'm still a newbie sophomore expecting to crack down on leetcode and CTCI in preparation for my Junior year internship search. I hear people usually say that most companies don't actually do whiteboard coding(Aside from the obvious, Google, Facebook, high-end companies). How much time should I be spending grinding on these kind of technical interviews? Should I just focus more on the behavioral side of things as well as being able to talk about my past projects/experiences?"
5xxpjs,1,2017-03-06,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5xxpjs/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.
All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Looking for some advice. 

Are there any entry level analyst jobs out there?

Recently completed an internship as a business analyst which includes some system analysis and QA work.

Having trouble finding any work, starting to get worrisome about my future in IT. I really enjoyed my time at my internship and want to pursue a career as an analyst but lately can't seem to get any responses from employers.

I reached out to TekSystems but they only get senior level analyst roles, the entry level positions are few and far between, at least where I live.

5xxu81,1,2017-03-06,Cold calling is sucking the life out of me and I'm fucking terrified about not getting a job,definethegreatline,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5xxu81/cold_calling_is_sucking_the_life_out_of_me_and_im/," Context: I've been working freelance parttime/full time since I was 16. I'm 23 now. As of late I'm not hearing back from people as much as I used to. Been snowballing like that since 2014 and now my confidence is at an all time low. Not the energised kid I was when I was 19. 

Internship season is upon us and my college internship officer is hardly helpful to say the least. I can list down a list of every place I was interested to go to and he can ignore everything and email me about something completely unrelated. 

I watched the Pursuit of Happyness when I was younger. Will Smith's character did nothing but cold call after cold call in his job and finally he succeeded. Why can't I persevere like that? I guess my anxiety doesn't help.

I moved to this country and I desperately wanted to stay. But I really think when college is over I'll have to move back to where I came from. I can't relax and enjoy being here in the place I dreamt about living for years, because everyday I'm thinking about and dreading going home to that same old fucking shit I was so desperate to get out of. I'm listening to Clocks by Coldplay everyday and feeling no matter what I do I'm watching the damn time run out.

Someone told me 'peaks and valleys', but I've been struggling to climb out of this valley for 3 years. As the kid everyone placed their hopes on to succeed (my mom, my dad, the people I used to work with) maybe it's the fucking millennial situation that everyone seems to find themselves in I'm still struggling under the hope of everyone's expectations. I'm told I'm talented enough to go on and do great things and my friends say ""don't worry it'll be your time someday"" but what if I'm fucking not and I'm just better off going to go get a damn desk job? Fucking easy for you to say innit if you're the one getting all the big clients (that I also used to get before I moved away) the praise and a steady income?

I am afraid of writing this because I hate, hate, hate admitting that I'm the product of some millennial bullshit. Maybe I expected that I'd have gotten more opportunities than I thought I would, but I never have ever expected to not put in the effort. I have never expected it to be handed on a plate to me. If you give me a job I swear I can do it, I swear I can put in the hours, I swear I will clean your fucking toilets, make you coffee even though I don't drink it. I just need the damn opportunities and I'm just tired of having to beg for it, slog for it, work for free for it and end up being ignored with increasing frequency and decreasing confidence (special shoutout to my anxiety meds that barely work nowadays) with almost every email for almost 3 fucking years. 

Also shoutout to my mum praying for me everyday. That's my one source of confidence even though I'll never admit it. Even though she sends me bible verses, even though no matter what I do I seem to be shouting out into the void to God or the universe or whoever it is up there that saved me from choking on a fishball when I was 3, to fucking throw me a rope, or shatter me completely, so I don't have to hope for too much anymore."

Sure, I realize my resume sucks. It sucks because I lack relevant work experience to the jobs I apply for. I wasn't able to get internships and most of my experience is retail and tutoring. However, I do try to tailor the resume to the position. For example, if it's tech, add projects and link to examples.

I realize another thing that might be working against me is that it is going to be 3-4 years since I graduated and the new grad smell might be done.

I'm unemployed now because the last job I worked absolutely messed my body up to the point where I have chronic back, shoulder, and ankle issues.

It's not like I've been doing nothing. I've been teaching myself to program, I have a website or two, some monte carlo projects I coded up as well. I've been learning more about mathematics and statistics even though my degree was in physics.

Plus the annoying factor of being stuck yet seeing friends or acquaintances progress and I'm here like someday I might be able to afford things. Then to add to the stress of the situation my family wants to commit me to a mental hospital because I cannot find a job. It's like, lol wut?

I mean are there some jobs that I'm just not thinking about or something?"

I hope you can help me. Here is my story :

I recently graduated from ""Software Engineering"" program at a university in Perú . Throughout this program I took courses in math (calculus , linear algebra) and programming (mostly C and Java , Data Structures , Algorithmns ) for the initial part of it , but later every course was focussed more on the ""project managment"" side of things.

I did a 2 year internship on a small , local video game company using Unity Engine and C# and I liked it A LOT . I mostly did prototypes of game mechanics and a little AI , but there was always this topic that i never got the change to delve into and that I have always found fascinating : Shaders and Computer Graphics. I always wanted to get into that but everything seemed so overwhelming complex and ""alien"" that I always ended up giving up.

So here I am , a newly graduated in an environment that doesn´t care that much for that branch of programming (everything here in this country is mostly web or mobile apps for customers or banks or big enterprises) wanting to start learning CG from the ground up and hoping eventualy become a Graphics Engineer (at least that's the dream) and work on a videogame or animation company , and I need your help? The plan is that after some practicing and learning time , when I feel comfortable with my skills nad knowledge , I want to pursue a masters degree in computer graphics engineering or maybe , if life and finances go according to my plan , study a full cumputer graphics / computer science program overseas.

How do I start? What books/videos/courses do you recommend? Do you know of any good Masters programs about Computer Graphics Engineering? I'm really eager to start learning about this branch of CS and I find myself really overwhelmed."

When I graduated I thought I would find a job immediately. That didn't happen. So I stayed there waiting for my opportunity. That opportunity finally came with this new job. Pay will be good, medical/dental after 3 months, paid vacation, all the works. 

I should be over the moon happy, yet I feel this unbelievable amount of pressure all of a sudden. There was so much information thrown at me today, I feel so overwhelmed. I've done this kind of work before working internships but damn, I got home and was really questioning if I can do this. 

What if I can't? What if I fall flat on my face? I won't have my safety net job to fall back on this time around and it's terrifying. I've waited for almost 2 years for this and now that it's finally here, I'm scared shitless.

I'm a final semester MS student in Applied Physics from Norway and I'm not sure how to proceed right now. I really want to do a PhD in quantum computing (preferably solid state quantum computing at Oxford), and I have some paths in front of me, but things are a bit unclear to me on how to proceed. Could you help me clear things up? 
________________
So I have an offer of a 9 month - 1 year internship where I'll work as a ""grade 6 research assistant"" for a theory physics group. Apparently I'll be paid at around £35k per annum brutto. While this does sound good at first sight, the problem is though that I think the job will be about coding sub-routines into C and, allegedly, ""learning about computational physics and programming"". However, when I asked the postdoc in charge of the project, he flat out told me that a software engineer with no background in physics or mathematics to speak of could do the job.. This, along with the unusually high salary for an internship, I think essentially means that I'll be working as a full-time programmer, possibly code-monkey, helping them write up their software. 

I also have an offer of DPhil in solid-state Quantum Computing, but with an uncertain funding situation. I might get funding, or I might not, but honestly I doubt it. I'm going to ask for an internship in case of no funding, but I'm not sure if they can fund one that's longer than a couple of months.
________________
So if I get funding for the Quantum computing DPhil, or a reasonable internship offer, I will obviously take this route, but I don't think I will.. So in case I fail at that, as far as I see I have two choices:

(1) Do the Oxford internship and hope it looks good on the CV and apply to Oxford Quantum grad school again, and that time hope for a funded offer. However, I have my doubts as it looks like I won't be contributing to any physics research, but instead just doing coding work.... 

(2) Stay in my uni for one extra semester while taking heavy-weight physics courses and working as a teaching assistant, while applying for less competitive PhDs all over Europe.  
________________
What do you guys think? Do you think I should take the internship with the hope that it strengthens my CV for grad school applications next year, or not take it and instead spend the time trying to find PhD programs immediately? 

PS: In case somebody is wondering how I got this internship, I was basically cold-calling (actually emailing) professors I thought researched interesting stuff and hoping to catch something.

Examples: Jimmy not getting a favor done for him by detectives, and complaining about it on-air to try and force them to.

While complaining about not getting special treatment from detectives, he spits on the floor because Gregg and Anthony woukdnt turn down a callers mic who called him out for acting like a drama queen and not saying what it was that was the problem.

Jimmy talks on air about bringing food back. His latest example was giving octopus back because it was rubbery. Fun fact: octopus is a rubbery texture a lot of the times. Baby boy didnt like that the octopus he ordered wasnt exactly like he expected it, so of course he had to cause a fuss about it.

Jimmy always complaining about how some celebrity is a ""cunt"" because they wouldnt sign or take a picture with him. The biggest example of this is when Jeter wouldnt take a picture with him at a benefit event because jimmy didnt pay. The whole point of jeter being there was to take pictures and sign stuff for people who paid where the money went towards the benefit. But baby boy felt entitled since he was a sirius employee and they paid for a table there.

Jimmy going on a flight. Every flight he goes on, he tries to get compesation back from the airline he was on by tweeting them some petty complaint. He does it almost every flight, and then bitches about it when they dont give him anything.

Jimmy and his free breakfasts in the morning. Baby boy complains in the morning about his food over any little thing. The worst was when he complained about the interns complaining to erock and travis about having to get baby boys breakfast, while they had more important stuff to do for the show. Baby boy causes a fight on air because he felt like it was an inconvience to have to order his food through kenny. 

Jimmy unfollowed everyone on twitter. Baby boy unfollowed his friends because they couldnt partake in a thing jimmy asked a favor for. How self centered do you have to be to get mad about people not dropping what theyre doing to do what you want to do, that you act like they are not your friend then.

Jimmy with customer service. We know he tries to get free meals and flights, so not surprising he tries to get free products by calling customer service. Baby boy actually said ""i know how to talk to customer service where that they will do something for me."" How many times has baby boy actually called them? And he has said he told a lady before ""ill talk about this on air because i do a radio show"" when he realized how much of a clown he sounded, seconds later he said ""i only said that because i know they wouldnt care anyways"". Yeah that makes sense. And if customer service doesnt do anything for him? He talks about them on air.

Jimmy and uber. Baby boy actually says he leaves drivers low reviews because they didnt take routes he would have. Then why doesnt he just drive? Prolly because complaining about uber on air, he thinks eventually he will start getting special treatment."

I am now in my third year of uni and therefore decided it was time for me to look for an internship opportunity to build up my CV. Mid-January, I was lucky enough to be offered a 10-week position in a tiny business management firm (with the total of 2 employees and some associated casual workers). I absolutely appreciate the great opportunity, seeing as internships are incredibly hard to come by in my hometown and this is actually pretty well paid as well. However, I have worked in a shop as a supervisor for over 2 years now, and since the internship is only meant to be temporary, I decided I could not quit my previous part-time position - coming across a part-time job paid as well as my current one is, which allows me to be so flexible and go away for a month each summer and for Christmas, would be basically impossible. So I am currently working 32 hours as well as going to uni - 16 as a shop supervisor, 16 in the internship. I work 5 days a week, and I go to uni in the remaining 2 days. So unless I skip lectures and tutorials or phone in sick, I do not have any days where I could sleep in, relax, and do nothing.

Since starting working at the internship, I have had a couple mental breakdowns, missed deadlines on my university coursework, had to ask for extensions, and am currently in counselling to help me cope.


Basically, my boss is a witch. She is very critical, very harsh, and speaks so directly that I am often almost in tears. As I mentioned, the company is tiny, but does really well. She is the only other person in our office most of the time and she is the one giving me tasks and feedback. She often asks me to produce materials on subjects I have no clue about (ie, create 'top 5 tips' on managing your overheads, online marketing, managing your employees and similar - I have never studied any of these topics, as I am a Politics student). Then, when I do not finish it within an incredibly short amount of time she thinks should be enough, she tells me off and is clearly unhappy. When I do produce something, she criticises it, never ever says anything is good or even acceptable, and chases me back and forth between different tasks.


I hate it. I have always suffered from low confidence and her criticism is absolutely destroying me. I cry all the time, can't focus, don't eat properly, my IBS is acting up, can't sleep at night and then sleep during the day. Most importantly, I skip lectures and don't do any reading for my courses, and I delayed starting an essay for so long that I would've missed the deadline if I miraculously didn't get a GP sick note and wasn't able to ask for an extension a few hours before the deadline. I made an appointment with the uni counsellor, Student Services, and my GP, and I am currently getting help with my mental health issues.
  

I am 5 weeks into this 10-week internship, but the boss said in the first couple weeks that she is keen on making the position permanent... I don't think I can even the next 5 weeks. I dread going to work, it makes me sick to my stomach. I ended up calling in sick last time I was meant to be in because I couldn't face going there. I spend the entire time I am in the office with her completely stressed out and on the edge, and even the slightest sigh coming from her jars me every time. I do want to quit. But I am too scared to. It's really the actual act of confronting her and telling her why I want to quit that's scaring me the most.


How do I actually quit? What do I tell my boss when she asks why, seeing as it's essentially because of her? Or do you guys think I should stick it out, as it's only another 5ish weeks to go?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I hate my temporary internship and want to quit, but my boss intimidates me so much I am too scared to hand in my notice."
5y0ppv,12,2017-03-07,My girlfriend (f26) is dragging me (m28) down with negativity,Anonymitysplosion,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5y0ppv/my_girlfriend_f26_is_dragging_me_m28_down_with/,"So I have a lot to say on this one...

I know people tell you never to date your best friend, but we have been together for about a year. We knew each other all through college, and have spoken almost daily since meeting 7-8 years ago. She came back to her home state (my home state) for grad school, and we hit it off and got together. After a few months of long-ish distance, we moved in together so we could both get out of our parents' houses. 

This is my first time living with a SO. 

There were some hiccups at first, but I am very flexible - I don't usually get upset with people. She, however, is very negative. This may be coming from social anxiety or depression, but I can only be part of the pity party for so long. She is upset about the roommates we have to live with (whose worst offenses include being excited about sports maybe once a week and being sub-par at cleaning). They aren't bad people, but she looks for any excuse to disparage them behind their backs. She says she ""hates everyone"" more as a slogan than an actual fact, but it seems to be self-fulfilling, as she puts herself at arm's distance from everybody who even slightly rubs her the wrong way. 

As a flexible introvert/extrovert, I need what interaction I can find, so it's hard for me to accept that ""we just don't talk to that person anymore"" and similar declarations. I find that I have completely sacrificed any friendship with the roommates that I could have had to her expectations that I feel the same way she does about them. 

She is upset that she is stupid and shouldn't be in grad school. I can't speak to this one as much, as she is in a relatively specific field that I only know so much about - but she is not stupid. She is upset about her weight - she is slightly overweight, but so am I. We're working on eating healthier and being more active. She is upset that she can't get a job/summer internship relating to her grad program. She has applied to hundreds of jobs and internships, but she is trying to break into a field that she has no work experience in. 

All of this is relatively common for a 20-something grad student, but what makes it so hard for me is that she talks to me constantly about it. When I get home from work, she tells me about her day. Always this involves about an hour of hearing about how she isn't good enough, how she is stupid, how she is the fattest person at school, etc. She gets upset if I try to suggest ways to fix problems - she only wants me to listen. She gets upset if I say ""No, you aren't stupid"". She gets upset if I just say ""Ok"", as I am being subdued and not really responding to what she's saying. I feel like I can't win. And I am MISERABLE during these talks. I feel awful, because I just want to roll over and go to sleep when she starts talking like this. I know that I need to be supportive, but I can't support her when she is being as self-deprecating as possible. 

I feel awful that I am even writing this - I want to be there for her, I want to keep this relationship going, as I have fallen for someone like I have for her. We are getting a new apartment together soon, just us two - and I am concerned that I have moved too quickly and confidently with this relationship and I am setting us up for some terrible fallout. I just want things to work out, but with her needing another year or more with grad school, I don't know if I can make it. If she could be happy again, even just some of the time, I would be fully at ease. I just can't take her dragging me down like this. 

Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 

P.S. I was going to put this on relationship_advice, but I figure she would see it. "
5y0v00,1,2017-03-07,I feel like my life have been falling apart.,erickclark986,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5y0v00/i_feel_like_my_life_have_been_falling_apart/,"So, I met this girl and we were in relationship for almost 2 years, then she decided to leave me. And since then, I feel like my life have been falling apart.

Here is my story and let me warn you, its gonna be a long story. 

I was working at a hotel in D country and I met her in August 2014, she was an intern at the same hotel. We get alone and soon we fall for each other. Same year December we went to met her family in R country and in February we went to met my family in H country. Things weren't always good between us, due to our culture and we are actually two different people. I like to stay home and she is more active. I think things got worse when I knew she started lying to me when she went out having dinner with another guys, I found out because I was checking her phone back then. When I asked her about it she said she was only interested to met a new friend and she didn't want to tell me to make me worry and to protect me. Things were getting worst since then, and she did want to break up with me once. I felt that she doesn't love me anymore. 
Last year we talked about both of us moving back to H country so we can be together, build our business and start living our life. She agreed and in May I resigned my job, she told me she did too. Two days before we were supposed to leave, she told me she actually didn't resigned, she wasn't ready. I had to leave the country because my visa was cancelled. 
So since June, she was in D country and I was in H country, and I wasn't happy about it, we still flighted a lot, over the phone. And each month she would told me she resigned, and after a month she would said she didn't. And by then for a few times already she wanted to break up with me, via email and text. 
I tried all I can to keep us together, and in October she told me she resigned, she showed me her resignation letter. So we booked her ticket to come to H country in November. But I picked up some traces of her actually not coming, her friends told me she was looking for apartment and job in Paris, where she used to studied and lived for a few years before going to D country. And when I asked her about it she denied.
In November, the day she supposed to come to H country, she called me and she was crying, she wanted to break up, saying that she wasn't ready and she changed the ticket from going to H country to going to Paris.
I thought, she was just being scared of going to a new country.
Anyway, we were still talking, I told her if she wants she can stay there for a few months, take the time off, and she can come when she is ready. She said okay. Things went up and down since then, she would texted me out of a sudden and want to break up with me (again), I would then call her and see what's going on, and then we were fine again. And one time when she want to break up, I told her let me come to Paris to see you, she said she doesnt want me to do that, but I booked my flight anyway, I also bought a ring, wanted to make her a promise.
I went to Paris, met her, gave her the ring. Though things would get better. She was happy to receive the ring, and said she would give it a try, she just need time. And we book her a ticket for December to come to H country.
Then I left.
Then, I found out, she was actually seeing someone else, I asked her about it, she said they were just friends.
Since then, things go again up and down, we broke up, we are fine, then we broke up again. 
By the time she was supposed to use the ticket to come to H country, she said she couldn't make it because of her job, and she suggested me to change the ticket to February, which I did. 
And once again, things wasn't smooth, when new year comes she send me a long text wishing me good luck and happiness, but she want to move on and step out from my life, etc. Then after a week we are fine again, texting and skyping. Then of course, we broke up a few times, back together again. And in February, which she was supposed to come to H country (again..) she said she doesn't want to do it because she is not ready and she doesn't want to hurt me. Turns out, she has been with this person already for quite awhile, and they went on a trip together for four days during Valentine's day, and she just didn't want to see me upset so she would ""pretend"" we are back together. And last week, she told me the truth, that she is with someone else. Thats where and when I give up trying.
She told me, don't assume she doesn't suffer, or she doesn't love me anymore. She want me to be strong and she hope that one day she will find her way back to me. She signed, ""with love, your other half""

Since that day, we didn't talk to each other.

I have been thinking a lot, I'm sad and angry, regards.

Sad that she would just walked out like this, throwing all we had away.

Angry that she could be in a relationship with someone else that quickly.

In my mind, there are two thoughts I am having, like an angel on my left shoulder and a devil in my right shoulder. The angel would tell me to give her time, and eventually one day she will comes back to me. The devil would tell me to hate her, throw everything away and to forget everything.

I don't know what to do, or what to think.

I left my home country almost 10 years ago, and now that I am back, I don’t have any friends, only family, and we are not close. 

And that's why, I need help and want to talk to some one about it."

At the behest of my boss, we recently upgraded to a new KLKaS array from the older P-series PLPOp. Problem is, an intern has ordered the *wrong damn fitting* for the output SARC, so we powered on with the wrong safety valves!

We now have one fired intern, £300,000 in damages, and the need of a new system. Basically, the fitting for the SARC is blown, the glass on the harmonic chamber is broken, and the Hilbert-inclusive psychlokine emmiter is totally wrenched off (The differential seems to be that it burst due to pressure from the cY base emmision).

How can we fix this without a new loan!?"

5y1eo3,2,2017-03-07,My SOP for cognitive science subject. I really want someone else review. Dont mind harsh criticism.,evilgenius_,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/5y1eo3/my_sop_for_cognitive_science_subject_i_really/,"Best advice I have received, “Study your entire life. Study everything”. Coming from a family of research driven backgrounds I was interested in everything this world has to offer. In school years I enjoyed studying mathematics, computers, philosophy, history, sociology and anthropology.  My own lifetime has essentially coincided with the rise of computers which paved the way for modern computing industry that is why I decided to do engineering and enrolled in Information Technology program of Sinhgad Institute of Technology for my bachelor degree. Like many students in the class, I had been struggling with the labs. I came into my own after some time spend. Combining different studies in developing projects is what I liked most about engineering. I enjoy applying interdisciplinary thinking to scientific discovery. Many scientist debate implementing cognitive behavior in machines over efficient performing model in many theories. I want to implement and develop applications that incorporate such knowledge into the machinery for enhancing further the capability for research in order to take advantage of these theories. This is the reason why I am interested in becoming a student to learn more about Applied Cognition and Neuroscience degree in University of Texas Dallas.
What is intelligence and how to make machines intelligent? We do not come in with any prior knowledge about the world. Our intelligence system starts out with no knowledge. I think we all agree that, one system represent intelligence very well which is human brain and maybe some mammals as well, but we all agree that is the gold standard. As Jeff Hawkins once said, “It’s that learning process that makes intelligence. We continue to learn for our entire life. Intelligence isn’t something you reach. It’s a continuous process you go through.” Human as well as animals go through a methodology to be intelligent in the world. So when I think intelligence in machines, I have got to consider those same learning methodologies that we used for our intelligence. Patrick Winston a professor at MIT, pointed out that we are making less progress on Artificial Intelligence because we are narrowing the field to just one study. Contributions from various fields are so necessary to accelerate this process. To make machines intelligent, scientific methods and simulations are key in learning process. I plan to utilize the knowledge I have gained about certain aspects of humanity to reform the concept of cognitive science, specifically Artificial Intelligence.
Cognitive Science is an accumulation of several other subjects from computer science to philosophy to linguistics. Cognitive science is a large field, and covers a wide array of topics is an interesting prospect for me. Great Satisfaction, for me, is to gain ambiguous concept of knowledge and learn how it can be used to transfigure the world. To base ideas about the world on our personnel experience and try to revolutionize the world is really exciting. Alan Turing said in his paper on Machine Intelligence, “The question machine can think is too meaningless to discuss”.  I think what he meant by that was like asking if airplanes can fly and submarine can swim. In order for us to develop intelligent machines we have to take every aspect which helps us think better and apply them on machines.
The undergraduate program at the Sinhgad Institute of Technology provided me with a strong foundation of computer science and exposed me to various fields of it. During my undergraduate studies at the Information Technology department, subjects like Discrete Structures, Data Structures, and Computer Networks interested me the most. Subjects like Data Structure and Software Engineering has helped me to excel in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and design patterns. The vocabulary and structures of software design seem to lend themselves naturally to the study of human reasoning and learning. I plan to use this training to test how far the mind-machine metaphor holds. In addition to experience with imperative and functional programming paradigms, I have enjoyed coding in declarative languages like SQL. Multiple labs work on databases class is an ideal balance of theory and practical experience with modern database systems. An in-depth understanding of relational and ER models will help me design better knowledge representation schemas, such as semantic networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like word sense disambiguation. At the end of my undergraduate program I was really interested in subjects like Neural Networks, Natural language, Machine learning, Software Design Network and Behavioral sciences. 

I wanted to develop my Major project based on machine learning concept. I wrote a paper on the subject ‘Human Identity Recognition through Ear Lobes Geometric Features’. To understand human anatomy basic concept, I took online course on human anatomy which gave me some ideas to base it on external ears geometry. I published my paper in International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science (IJECS). Later developed this project using JavaScript for dynamic interactivity and MATLAB for implementing mathematical models such as KNN algorithm, Color conversion model, finding gradients, Non-maximum suppression, double thresholding and Edge tracking by hysteresis were used. The project is based on machine learning concept of supervised learning. A supervised learning analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which we used for mapping new examples. This projects goal was to make biometric technologies highly secure recognition and verification of identity. In this dissertation, we propose the ear as a biometric and investigate its potential with both 2D and 3D data.
Not only subjects of my curriculum but extra curriculum was a big a part on my time at Sinhgad Institute. I played state level soccer for my school and also represented my university in college football. I was elected as vice president of sports and linguistic club for our department. During this time, I helped organize many sporting events throughout my under graduating period. After my junior year I took some time off for myself. In that time I learnt Spanish; taken internship at Pune society of Psychology; I have taken a seminars on anthropology and philosophy; spent time with local social workers to help students with anxiety disorder. Throughout collage my intent was to increase my own education, feed my curiosity, and drive to be something great. I feel now that I can achieve a Master’s degree and maybe in the future even a Doctorate.
Browsing through the University’s homepage, I feel that the graduate study at your institution holds a promising career. On-going research and publications on subjects like (Subject name) by revered Professor like Prof. (  ) augmented my urge to solicit for an opportunity to pursue Masters from the (University name). The breadth and depth of the courses coupled with stimulating research environment seems to me, the right blend for seminal work and initiating research.
I found your esteemed university, known for its great facilities, would be ideal place for me to pursue my graduate studies. Interacting with the best minds in this field will be an enriching experience and this will spur me on to be the very best in my chosen area of study. I anticipate your benevolent act of accepting me into your esteemed university and granting admission in (Course name) Masters in Science for Management of Information Systems program.

I am currently finishing up my 3rd year in college (junior) and majoring in Computer Information Systems. I plan on on getting my Bachelors in CIS by the end of next year (only 2-4 semesters left).

I currently have a great internship with a Financial company doing IT Support. I am the only person at the office, but the company is managed by a Managed Service Provider so I get to work alongside them most of the time - which teaches me a lot. For an intern I have good pay, my own office, friendly staff... I can't complain and plan on sticking with them till graduation.
This summer I am not going to be traveling home, so I planned on taking a class or two over the summer and working Mondays-Fridays at my office. Since I won't be AS busy, I wanted to use this time to set a goal and start to study/train for obtaining my first Certification.

Now this is where I am kind of in a pickle... Over the past year working in IT Support, I'm starting to realize that even though I enjoy it sometimes - I can't picture myself ""fixing stuff"" for the rest of my life. don't get me wrong, I love IT and am passionate about it in every way... It's just I don't see myself being a ""Mr. Fix-It"" guy in the future.

Doing more research, I have started to looking at Management Information Systems and am really interested in that. I like the idea of managing my own IT group/company and being in a so called ""higher up"" position then a Help Desk Technician...
So my question is, what would be the best certification to start training for regarding my situation? Awhile ago I was set on the A+, but I believe with my current studies and hands-on internship I learn most of that anyways (plus I don't want to be in PC support in the future). 

Anyone in an IT management role and can help me out?"

5y2jog,3,2017-03-07,Taking a few weeks to pursue comedy and looking for advice.,mardfet,Standup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/5y2jog/taking_a_few_weeks_to_pursue_comedy_and_looking/,"So at the end of last summer, I decided to try my hand at an open mic in Philadelphia, and performed 3 minutes. Looking back, I'd say only about 1-1.5 minutes of that was actually good, but I got some decent laughs and it was an insanely fun experience. 

Flash foward, I'm nearing the end of my first year of college, and I'm really chomping at the bit to get back on stage. 

I figure since this is the last summer that I won't be doing an internship or working mostly full time, I really want to try and make the most of it and try to accomplish at least performing a few more times. I'm not expecting anything career wise to come out of it, but it's something I'm really passionate about, and at the end of the day, I want to be able to look back and know that I gave it my all, even if it won't become a career (or maybe it will. Who knows, weirder shit has happened). 

Any advice? I'm about an hour outside of Philly, 2 1/2 from NYC, and I'm trying to get on stage maybe five to ten more times throughout the summer. I've been working on writing down material and I have around 7 pages worth, which after performing all of it and refining it down to repeatable material will probably leave me with around 4-5 minutes of good shit. Running through everything I have so far would probably be around 8-9 minutes total, if I'm lucky.

Any advice? Which are the best mics to perform in NYC? Should I give up? "

Obligatory long time lurker first time poster blurb. First I'd like to say you guys are awesome, and anytime I get discouraged and see people that have really succeeded it helps me stay on track. So thanks for keeping this subreddit so awesome!

I'll try to add progress pics, but I am not certain how to do that so we will see! - http://imgur.com/a/ruWEH I think this is a link that should work.

Anyways here's my story: Back in high school I used to be super involved in sports until I hurt my ankle, I still played, but after I graduated and went to college I tried to have surgery to fix it and long story short, 2 surgeries later its not better. essentially this took me from a relatively in shape 230ish pound high-schooler to my senior year in college peaking at 300 lbs of couch potatoeyness. Through that time I tried to diet, but I got complacent and at that time I had a long time gf that I figured I would marry that didn't mind my being overweight so I didn't care, hence me peaking at 300lb's. But after the break up(didnt see that classic bit happening right? haha) and finally hitting that 300lbs, I decided to change and actually try and take care of myself. However this time was different, I know literally everyone says that, but this time I wanted to get in shape for myself, I know how it feels to be in shape and have energy, and that wasn't me anymore. I am a computer science major and I enjoy video games. This means I could literally go weeks where my physical activity was just walking to class.

(Insert Epic music start here) I started off by googling some diets and this time I decided not to go too drastic, I found this subreddit and found somewhere (maybe r/fitness or here) that mentioned CICO. So during my internship over the summer I just started watching slightly what I ate. There was a subway across the street so everyday I'd get a foot long chicken breast sandwhich with all veggies, I'd eat half and have half as a rather large snack, but it made me last easily till work was over.

After keeping down on calories, I lost 20lbs. (down now to 280). Not the best but it was progress. At this point it got a little stagnant as it was the first few weeks of school. I was having fun with friends pizza and video games etc. I didnt gain weight but I hadnt lost any. I calibrated my MyFitnessPal and realized I needed to drop a few hundred calories to be losing weight. In this span of time I also found a workout partner. Her and I (she is married and I now have a gf, I know its strange but it worked well as we work out progressively about the same) work out about 5 times a week or so depending on schedules etc. I cut calories a bit more and now I am here in the second semester of my school year, 20 more lbs down since the summer for a total of about 42 lbs and the lowest ive been since 2013(I'm fairly certain its 2013 as thats the last weigh in on myFitnessPal Ive had).

Sorry if this is super rambly and didnt make sense. It's my first post, but I thought since I've finally made some good progress and feel kind of good about myself that I'd make my first post. Let me know how to improve it or if its not allowed etc.

Thanks guys for all you do and all the stories I've read that are so encouraging! Keep it up r/loseit !

I have now recalibrated my MyFitnessPal to my new calories and I have figured out that alternating diets that keep me at a deficit is my best bet to losing weight (right now I am finishing a week of nutrisystem, then Ill probably do the 3 day military diet and after that I am looking into something called Isagenix(let me know if this portion isnt allowed).

I do have a few questions/concerns if thats ok. first off whats the best way you guys have found to kickstart a new weight loss trend (i.e. I seem to always get stuck at each 20lb mark until I basically eat next to nothing for like a week to kickstart the weight loss, that doest seem healthy so I was wondering if you guys had any tips that you use). 

Also, I got a gf about the same time i was about 30 lbs lighter. She is super skinny and I cant help but think she only likes me because I am losing weight etc. I was wondering if there was any good advice on how to not think this way as it doesnt seem healthy and it is probably just a coincidence, but I cant help but think it played a part.

At my first job after graduating we started using git differently: every project would create a branch and pull in other people's changes as you work on your stuff and then when you were done you'd merge your code back into the main branch of that product. I noticed that at my new job that there are a lot of things we aren't doing efficiently and now wondering what I have learned and am taking for granted now that I know more than I did when I started. Like, one example is we have scripts that does goes off from ""change file lists"" to update our servers but that clearly has a lot of problems (only additive so if you add files for one issue and then don't want them for another you have to manually remove them). 

What have you learned that you incorporate into your development process now and you don't think you could not live without (or be as efficient without)?"

5y36vs,8,2017-03-07,My class in Micro/Embedded Systems is a dumpster fire. How do I fix?,2disposable25698,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5y36vs/my_class_in_microembedded_systems_is_a_dumpster/,"tl/dr: Prof is unhelpful, lectures are torturous, lab assignments require time and effort far beyond reasonable, and lab communication has entirely fallen apart. Ruining all my other classes, should I withdraw?

I'm a senior undergrad in Comp Engineering, hoping to graduate in December. I have 10+ years of work experience outside of engineering and two successful engineering internships under my belt. I'm in a Microprocessors / Embedded Systems class that is required for my degree, but I'm spending all my time on lab assignments and it's bringing my grades down in all my classes, even my Capstone project. I want to withdraw, but I don't know if that will hurt me down the road, especially when I don't know if the class will be exactly the same in the Fall. I have an appointment with advising tomorrow, but I could use some more guidance.

Here's what's happening:

1. The lectures are awful. It's a 3 hour class at night (after a full day of classes) no breaks. The lecture slides are generally just walls of text, with an occasional unexplained diagram, and a lot of unrelated or very outdated information. The content seems to me fairly disorganized, so when studying, I usually need to re-write the slides in my notes so all the info that belongs together is together, and I can get a better idea of the material.

2. The prof is not doing well. The lecture slides are exact carbon copies of another professor's slides from a previous semester. But that doesn't stop him from slapping his name on them. He lectures by reading verbatim off the slides at a snail's pace. I did find video of the previous prof's lectures on YouTube, and the slides are still bad, but he gets through the material in a third of the time, and with more helpful info. (unfortunately, I only found those lectures a few days ago, but they will be helpful in the future.)

3. There is no textbook.

4. There is no scheduled block of lab time. Each team is expected to find our own time to work together on the lab. There is only one set of hardware to share. Those are ok, but all of us are commuter students with conflicting class schedules and other commitments (I do not work at the moment, but my partners do) which makes it  very difficult to coordinate time to work together.

5. The lab assignments (60% of our grade) are just the worst. Very little of the information we need to do them is in the lectures. We've had two assignments so far, and 90% of the time is spent just trying to set hardware up and figuring out how to program it, rather than demonstrating relevant knowledge. The prof and TA scatter links to other tutorials and datasheets throughout four separate online platforms, and several times, they were for the wrong device. The actual lab assignment sheets look pasted from several different sources, so key figures and references are missing, and the actual assignment requirements are unclear. The prof and the TA either do not respond at all, or tell you to talk to the other one.

6. My work is being excluded from my lab team. Communication is nigh impossible. I send out emails to try to coordinate schedules or arrange for passing off of the one set of hardware so we can work on it, but multiple times I have found myself in the lab alone without the hardware, so I try to work to compensate, while sending emails to the team about my progress and what I'm working on. When we are able to meet, one partner makes it a one-man show despite anything the team has agreed to do previously, or any status updates. He moves cables, pins, and changes the on-board OS settings while we are working, which has cost us hours, then somehow the day before the lab demo, he miraculously has written all the code weeks ago all by himself without telling us. Directly telling him to stop has no effect. Working out a plan in person or in writing has no effect. He just agrees with what we're saying and then does what he wants. I have zero confidence in the prof or the TA to fix this. They don't seem to care at all.


The result?: I am spending 20 - 30 hours per week in this class on lab assignments. The assignment time is making it impossible to study for the SAME CLASS, let alone my four other classes, including my Capstone Project. The kicker is: NONE of my work is even being submitted. We're each supposed to write individual lab reports on our contributions. How can I write it if my work is destroyed, then excluded!?

I know I should be prepared to study beyond the scope of the class. I know I should study data sheets and put extra time and effort into learning the material. I have done so in many classes before, and it has usually been a challenging and satisfying experience, despite the time and energy cost. I feel this class is beyond a character-building level of unfair.

I know I'll have to work in teams in ""the real world"", mainly because I've been in ""the real world"" longer than I've been in school, and I've had tons of lab classes before this. I've had slacker teammates, I've had control freak teammates, I've had teammates with massive family emergencies that I've been glad to do more than my fair share for, and I've had some teammates do the same for me. Every time, I can get along, or at least grin and bear it.

So. What are my options? This can't go on."

We’re proud to announce our 2016 Law Enforcement Family Member Scholarship Recipient: Tasanee Durrett.  Below is her essay, titled “A Mother Knows.”  It’s a poignent piece about growing up with a mother serving in the Chicago Police Department:

Tasanee Durrett - 2016 scholarship recipient

A Mother Knows

Growing up, my mother always told me “everything happens for a reason”. With everything I partake in and do in my life, I remember what my mother tells me. My mother has been an active law enforcement officer on the streets of Chicago for over 12 years and has been a very strong and impactful person in my life. She is an individual of strength and independence, and she continues to empower me in what I do every day.  Whether out on the streets in her uniform or walking the streets as a normal pedestrian, she carries herself with confidence. I can recall watching how she walked and how she carried herself when I was a child, and wondered why she never felt downtrodden or defeated. I never expected to always see her in such a way; it was for some reason that I couldn’t imagine always being so confident in myself. During elementary school, I was lead clarinet in the marching band and jazz band. Whenever we participated in competitions and didn’t place, I couldn’t help but to feel defeated for days at a time, and that’s when my mother started telling me that everything happens for a reason, and that God had something else in store for me.

For years, she would say these same exact words to me and for years I couldn’t grasp on to what she meant. I would ask myself, “well if everything happens for a reason, when do you find out that reason, and how do you know what that reason becomes?”. It didn’t start making sense to me until a very pivotal moment of my life while I was in high school. During my senior year, I was nominated to enter a national scholarship competition called POSSE. It was about a month long competition consisting of writing essays, interviews, and group leadership charrettes. After weeks awaiting for a response, I received the dreaded letter of denial and felt devastated. I felt discouraged applying to colleges after this experience because I had worked so hard for something that was going to be forever out of my reach. Once again, my mother told me these words:

“Everything happens for a reason.”

Finally, I understood what she meant by saying this to me. She is telling me to never give up confidence. I should never feel discouraged and defeated from anything because I am a strong and intelligent individual who can get through any challenge. My mother was telling me to always get up after a fall, no matter how hard the fall was. Being raised and brought up by my mother being a law enforcement officer has been impactful to me in becoming the confident and independent woman that I am today. My mother has taught me to never lose faith in what I’m capable of doing and what I’m capable of becoming.

To this day, I still refer back to the words my mother told me. Being a student studying architectural design and working part time as an intern, there are times where I get stressed out and too discouraged to push forward in my studies. Whenever I feel discouraged about the progression of a school project, or get stuck figuring out certain aspects of an evolving project, I look to my mother’s words. Her words both empower me and inspire me to continue designing even during those times when I start to feel too challenged to keep pushing forward. My school projects change as they finalize, and although there are times when I am not happy about how a project is unfolding, I continue to design until I reach the desired outcome.

My mother has had the greatest impact on my life. I continue to look back on her words and I remind myself that I have these opportunities of getting an education and gaining professional experience for a reason, and that reason being to become a successful architectural designer."

5y41rg,5,2017-03-07,How well is Unity perceived by employers?,[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/5y41rg/how_well_is_unity_perceived_by_employers/,"So to begin, I don't think there's a better place to put this question for several reasons. I'm sorry if it's completely off topic. 

Anyway, I'm a computer science student and I am beginning to look for a job in the field. Obviously becoming a game developer is the end goal, it's also the most unrealistic one. 

Now I am well versed in c++ and believe myself to be higher than average in computer programming knowledge than most of my class. Unfortunately I only have one small program in c++ dealing with object oriented programming and data structures. I can't think of anything else to make in c++ that would WOW an employer unless I make something absolutely crazy. 

Now Unity is my forte, I have put so many man hours into making a plethora of game concepts, and even have a game on the app stores. I can manipulate it to work almost any way I would like it. My confusion is that this isn't really all that to be proud of, or is it? I don't know that's why I'm making this post lol. 

It seems, pretty obviously, that Unity holds your hand for a lot of things. A lot of the coding is more ""scripting"", which is my worry. It seems completely different in skill comparison than making a program from the ground up and making everything work your way. 

I'm just worried that I won't find a good internship or entry level position, or none at all. 

What are your guys' experience with this. Do you have any insight into what I could do? I would also hope that this post will be able to help others in the same situation because it seems like I'm in a pretty crappy situation. 

Thanks and have a nice day guys!"

I'm having trouble deciding what major I want to supplement CS with. I worked at a software/EE firm last summer, and while the EE work was interesting and engaging, it didn't really strike me as something I'd like to pursue in college and the rest of my life, whereas CS is pretty much set in stone for me.

My parents think that only majoring in CS at Duke wouldn't make the education worth it (vs something like EECS at UCB), and I agree with them. I'd like to broaden my horizons and open up more opportunities for myself in the future, so double-majoring is definitely something I would like to do.

Ideally, I'd like to stick with Pratt because I prefer the engineering education over a liberal arts-focused education. My supervisor at my internship recommended a BME major, as he believes that BME is expanding rapidly and they need CS people to create software for the new tech.

Economics/Finance also seemed viable and I went over that choice with my supervisor, mainly because of the allure of Wall-street, but he had mixed feelings about it, having worked in that sector straight out of college before creating his startup. He doesn't think it's a good choice after the 2008 crash and engineers would earn more while working less.

5y4ft2,34,2017-03-07,JP Morgan Summer Internship (TAP) Info,Hello_Illinois,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5y4ft2/jp_morgan_summer_internship_tap_info/,"Hey Guys. I recently received an offer from JP Morgan Chase as a summer Technology Analyst Program. I wanted to share my experience here, since I wasn't able to find a lot of information myself when I was going through it. So here it is.

I went to a campus career fair, and handed in my resume. They emailed me to apply online, and then the application was moved forward. A few days later, they invited me to an on campus interview. I'll share my experience, and that of another friend as well.

Firstly, the info on Glassdoor regarding the Summer Analyst Internship Position is pretty useful, so make sure that you go over it (Practice the behavioral questions there).

As for my experience, I got 2 back to back, 30 min interviews, In person (I hear the phone interviews are in a similar fashion). The first was supposed to be behavioral, and the second one was supposed to be technical. In my experience, the 2nd one was largely behavioral as well (Just ~12 mins of technical questions), just a little less formal. This however depends on your interviewer. I'll break it down into the 2 interviews.

Behavioral part:
First part behavioral: Describe a moment when you were a leader, when you had to work with a non cooperating team member, when you head to take a risk, when you had to make an important decision, etc etc. These go on for a while, and they take a ton of notes based on your responses (mine did at least).

Behavioral part in the second 30 min Interview (which was supposed to be technical): 
:: Asked me about what I was doing, and my favorite class. 

:: Asked me about my biggest accomplishment in college/on my resume. I talked about personal development rather than the projects that were listed on my resume. I assumed He'd read those before, so why waste time. Also, discussing how college has made you a leader, and helped you become a well rounded person is more unique - I guess. 

:: Asked me the typical ""Why Chase"". Personal advice, don't just say ""I love banking"". Make sure you sound smart :)

:: Since he was an alumni from my University (UIUC), and head of ""recruiting strategy"" for computer science as well, I asked him if he liked being around the college, what he thought about the quality and work ethic of the hires from UIUC, etc. Basically, was trying to be personable (I'm curious about these things anyways so it's a nice way to show the interviewers that you care).

Technical Part: First 15 mins as described above. I asked him questions as well, and the conversation flowed smoothly. Then we moved on to the technical part

The technical questions that I did get asked was: 
1) reverse a string (~4 mins)

:: O(1) space, and O(n) time 

2) Talked a little bit about hash maps, and hashing functions. Basically SUHA Assumptions (~5 mins) 

3) A couple questions regarding basic Object Oriented Programming

The question my friend got: 
1) Given a string, return the first unique character in the string. 
:: Can be done in O(n) space and O(n) time.

The coding part is not very logic heavy, and JP Morgan didn't seem to care a lot about it. But again, this depends on the interviewer.

Other (unsolicited) Advice: This goes for any interview, but specially for JP Morgan (and corporate places). They're looking for people who are pleasant to work with, so make sure you seem personable."

What do?**


Hi, I'm 23 years old on my way to 24 very soon. I have a college degree in social studies and just finished a 3 years college degree in computer science.  With excellent grades. I'm usually good in school but don't know what to do and can rarely get a passion for anything. 

Here in canada, i don't know for everywhere else, but a lot of people start to work after those 3 years of college and don't go to university (they start working around 21 years old but at a lower starting point (30k-50k) ).

I'm 23 and university would take me 4 years, I would have about 3 internships paid around 15k each. 

I'm wondering if I should just start working now (for around 40k a year at the company I'm currently interning) and try to work my way up with work experience or if I should continue with software engineering ... 

I feel like I'm getting old and another 4 years in school seems really long. Most of my friends will be parents / have houses then. Is it worth  money wise / experience wise? I like school and making friends but getting out of it at 27-28..I'm not sure if it's the thing to do. 

Did you go to university and do you feel like people who don't end up with lower-end jobs?"

Ok, so last 2 weeks has been absolutely worst for me ever. I am facing many serious long term shits right now:
First: My gf of 4 years broke up with me 3 days ago. We were together for 3 years and had been in long distance relationship for the last 8 months or so. It was on and off for us in LDR. We are on the opposite end of the globe for each other. I can’t go back to her at least for 5 years, which was the reason for us to be skeptical about us. Still I tried my best to stay with her, gave my everything but she says she doesn’t feel anything for me now. She likes someone else but doesn’t see anything with him. Same was the case with me some months back but things bounced back. But she is adamant that nothing can improve between us. I think I am not gonna get her back ever. I am devastated and just want her back.
Second: I am in my graduate studies and looking for an internship for summer. Even though I have a strong profile, due to no work experience (fresh out of undergrad) and lack of contacts in the semiconductor industry, haven’t received a single call for interview till now. Not even a positive signs from anywhere. I have applied to 100+ positions till now easily.
Third: I dont know why this happens to me, but I am trying to study very hard but not able to get good grades this semester. I have excellent understanding of concepts and mostly solve the homeworks on my own. The guys I help to do homework, ends up getting way better marks than me. ALL OF THE TIME. Sometimes I made them write line by line, still I was the one to lose.
Fourth: I have OCD and currently on medication. Due to these things, I am not able to cope up with my treatment. 
I feel absolutely suicidal right now. I have tendency to self hurt but that’s gone long ago. I understand my life is not that lame to waste so easily, so I wont kill myself. I have amazing parents and sisters who are helping me with breakup but still I am too low to feel like living. Please help me!! You can save my life."

5y5p75,2,2017-03-07,"My application to be an analyst at Defranco news organisation and why Russian hacking is fake news!!! (maybe, probably)",DanielAdelodun,DeFranco,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/5y5p75/my_application_to_be_an_analyst_at_defranco_news/,"So I decided to do some digging on this whole Russian Hacking situation, and I have a few things I would like to ask just to open a up a, yes, conversationnnn.

I would love if Phil points out any of the things I point out, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I do think there is a story here.

I'm not really sure where to begin so I'll start with the declassified CIA report released in January, detailing Russian involvement in the hacking scandal.

If you remember, the mainstream media made it seem like this report was very damning evidence against Russia, right? [http://i.imgur.com/pm0eb2L.jpg]
And with the Arsenal of hacking tools that the CIA has [https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/index.html], if Russia was involved they would know.

But if you really take the time to read the declassified report, the lack of any HARD evidence is kind of disappointing. But, what's more than that, is that it becomes unclear how much even the CIA THEMSELVES believe the hacker was Russian. In the report, they have a page dedicated to 'Estimative language'  all about what it really means when they say things like 'high confidence' etc. [http://i.imgur.com/5gduxsK.png] [http://i.imgur.com/mqdH7pu.png] [http://i.imgur.com/9iidXlR.png]
I think what is interesting here is to note the difference between CONFIDENCE and JUDGEMENT OF LIKELIHOOD, but in the end the point is given the extent of the CIA's power you'd think that they'd know for certain, right?
But they seem to actually only claim to be 70% sure that Guccifer was even Russian [http://i.imgur.com/FqBYNQ0.png].

But wait a minute, why was the mainstream media so confident then? More confident even than the CIA themselves? Well, as we've seen a BUNCH during this presidency the NSA and the CIA are not too shy about leaking information to the news media, so maybe they know more than we know [http://i.imgur.com/HchfTGP.png]. But often the mainstream media is just spouting bullshit and giving things fake and over-reaching headlines, changing those headlines if they need to cover their ass [http://i.imgur.com/uykdO2H.png], and only giving the real information 18 lines into the piece [http://i.imgur.com/VaoglYn.png]

So, you have the mainstream media being 'leaked' information from the CIA, and working with the CIA to seemingly shape the narrative around the situation while keeping the CIA ''''technically''' clean in the sense that they told the least untruthful thing they could have - I mean who knowsss maybe it was Russiaaa. Man, I hope this doesn't become a trend *cough* WMD's in Iraq *cough*.

Okay, so the CIA report doesn't say shit about what proof there is that Guccifer 2.0, the supposed Russian hacker, was Russian. Just for the record, Jullian Assange (who so far has a perfect track record in terms of not lying) has denied that his link was Russian but maybe we should believe the CIA more, make sense right? [http://i.imgur.com/CfndDly.jpg]. 

So I did some more digging, and found the Guccifer 2.0 Wikipedia page. Convenient. 
The first thing to note are the sources - mostly The Hill, places like the Guardian, MotherBoard (remember that one) [http://i.imgur.com/pRdZGJx.png]. I don't have anything specific to say about that, but I thought it was important to note.

Okay so actual proof then - well the way I see it there are 3 main pieces of evidence given:
- The report from the cyber security firm who looked at the DNC's computers [http://i.imgur.com/ZVOiZEz.png]
- The interview with Motherboard and language things. [http://i.imgur.com/wfHelor.png]
- And analysis from 'independent' 'experts'. [http://i.imgur.com/j4HDfz7.png]

With that first piece of evidence, I have done the research and I (and a lot of other people on the internet) don't think that the information put forward by the security firms who look at the DNCs is enough really to come to the conclusion that Russia was involved in the hacks. Here's an article on why: https://theintercept.com/2016/12/14/heres-the-public-evidence-russia-hacked-the-dnc-its-not-enough/ - also since it's recently come out that the CIA can frame other countries that casts more doubt on the whole thing. But on top of that, why where private sector agencies allowed into the DNC servers to check what was up, but not the FBI? Legit question, and the first of many questions I hope Phil asks for me on his show. [http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/]

The second question, to do with the second piece of evidence, is can you ask people who can speak Romanian to look at this interview that MotherBoard did with Guccifer and confirm whether or not his Romanian makes him sound Russian. Because that it was the second bit of evidence amounts to [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-full-interview-transcript]

The third question is could you get an interview with Thomas Rid? I actually go to King's College London, I study mathematics (but you'll know that when I apply to be a journalist at DeFranco Inc. I will work as cheap intern I don't mind) so I could conduct the interview. He's the only person on the Wikipedia page mentioned by name, however I am in the same department as the computer scientists, but Thomas Rid is not in my department, he is in the department of War Studies [http://i.imgur.com/q2JKEQr.png].

So what makes him a cyber security expert? Well, he works for MotherBoard.....but that doesn't make him a cyber security expert, it does call into question his 'independence' though since it was Vice (who own motherboard) who cited him as an expert in the first place...

He has also written some books on cyber security, though - but now the question is are any of these books good? Well, the CIA seem to think so....[http://i.imgur.com/0QC9LOR.png] - 'Independent' 'Expert', huh?

My final question is, in the words of Donald Trump (probably every day but specifically) after he found out that the FBI wasn't allowed to see Hillary's Servers - 'What is going on?'

It's clear that Trump is not involved and has no idea what's happening, and it's also clear that the CIA do not like Trump [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-didnt-think-id-ever-leave-the-cia-but-because-of-trump-i-quit/2017/02/20/fd7aac3e-f456-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?utm_term=.893f2c7dbf8d]. But why? Whether you think he's a stupid misogynist or not it's a bit weird that the CIA and the MSM as sooo against Trump. He's only made very few specific promises, like building a wall, and getting back jobs, and draining the swa....ohhhhhhhh.

Why is it that the CIA report decided to focus so heavily on Russian media, specifically RT in this case [http://i.imgur.com/souiwtz.png]? Why is this coinciding with all the talk about Fake News and what we can do to combat Fake News - before Trump hijacked the phrase fake news the MSM was really pushing the idea that fake news is a super serious problem. Is censorship coming next? [http://i.imgur.com/41m8VP1.png]"

5y5sir,4,2017-03-07,Here's to the future.,Publicfreakout11,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5y5sir/heres_to_the_future/,"It's been one week since I began NC, and that's all it lasted. 

When I found your jacket in my laundry, I knew I'd have to give it back. It would be wrong of me not to, after all we did end on mutual terms. You needed time to figure yourself out and get the panic attacks under control. You needed time to learn some dependence. You needed some time to recover from our last bump in December. It's clear we were still both on edge from that.

When I told you I had the jacket, I was unsure what your response would be. When I offered it give it to a mutual friend to pass onto you, I knew you'd still want to see me. 

When we met in the lounge of the UMC, I felt like all the damage, guilt, and suicidal thoughts left me. When I saw you smile back, it was the most content I had felt in a long time. 

I immediately gave you the jacket just in case you had to make it quick. When you chose to sit down and ask me how I was doing, I knew we could still talk. That was amazing, 2 hours felt like 20 min. 

In those 2 hours, we were able to land on the same page. Weeks earlier, you told me you didn't think you needed self-improvement. You told me you didn't have trust issues. You told me you were over our initial breakup. When the last massive panic attack set in, I knew I'd have to cut you off for you to realize how important these things were. 

At the UMC, when you told me I was right and that you understood why I did what I did, all the guilt was gone. When you told me you were just taking it day by day, all my guilt was gone. When you told me you hadn't felt this content while talking to me in a while, all my guilt was gone. When you began a sentence with, ""I'm excited for our -"" and cut off, I knew what you were going to say. That's why I made you say it. I'm excited for our future too, **we just need time to grow independently on our own**. 

When you're in Seattle for the internship over the summer, I can't wait to come out and visit you. It was nice seeing my best friend smile again. When you heard I was sick today and texted me to offer me some coughing pills, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. 

I know false hope is usually a big problem around /r/breakups, but this wasn't false. What we had, and what we still have is what inspires me to continue my day even though I'm feeling down about the whole thing. When I asked if you were seeing anyone, and you told me you weren't interested in dating anyone until after the internship, I was relieved. 

When I told you it would be okay to date, and to not hold back or wait for me, I saw the look in your eye that told me that wasn't happening. I won't cling 100% to that thought, but with our history, I'd like to think we can make this work long term. 

In the short term, we have work to do. In the short term, maybe we can date around, expand our social circles, self-improve and work on our careers. For me, I have no interest in dating anyone else. Fuck Tinder and fuck the dating apps, I don't have any good photos of me anyway. I won't judge you if you do, after all we aren't technically exclusive. In the long term, I know we still have chemistry. When you kept losing your train of thought when we were talking because you were smiling too much, I knew we still had sparks. We just need to go out and collect some gas on our own before we spark back up again. When our mutual ""relationship guru"" friend confirmed you still had these feelings for me, I felt a sense of excitement I haven't felt in months. A sense of purpose, a sense of desire to become the best man I can be. **IF** I ever achieve that goal, I know I would never take it for granted again.

The way you make me feel is beyond words. Besides being my best friend, you have influenced and impacted me more so than anyone else has. When you said the same for you, I knew this wouldn't just end up being some fling. 

I look forward to skiiing with you next weekend :)."

5y5w27,4,2017-03-07,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5y5w27/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony, VUDU and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

So I am a third year CS student in Canada, and received 2 internship offers a few weeks ago:

Company A:

* Large mobile gaming company
* Position: Game Programmer
* Duration: for 16 months, May start
* Location: London, ON. (~2 hour drive from me)
* About the role: will be working on game development using Unity/C#, etc. 

Company B: 

* Small section under the Science and Technology branch of Canadian government
* Position: Java Web Developer
* Duration: 12 months, May start
* Ottawa, ON. (~ 5 hour drive from me)
* About: will be working on a particular database tool for genome scientists to analyze genomic data, etc. 

Both companies pay the same. 

In my quick haste and excitement at working in the gaming industry, I accepted the offer for the Games Programmer a few weeks ago, and have been feeling lots of regret since. There's nothing I can do about it now, having accepted the offer and signed the contract, etc. 

At first, I decided against Company B because the description of the role did not appeal to me (developing a database tool), sounded much less exciting, and I initially wanted to go into the gaming industry. Since then, I've heard many things about how game devs are often underpaid, undervalued, etc., and just the title ""Game Programmer"" is not as impressive as it once sounded, compared to ""Java Web Developer"". Not gunna lie, I've been feeling hesitant even putting it on my LinkedIn page, where all my peers seem to have landed full-stack web dev positions at ""proper"" companies. 

I've also been working with full-stack web frameworks for this course I'm in, and have thoroughly enjoyed web dev, fueling my sense of regret. Even though the Company B position wasn't ""modern"" web dev, I keep thinking it would've helped a lot in obtaining web deb roles in the future, and I am hindering my future careers by taking this game dev position. 

At the same time, however, I have good web dev projects using full-stack web frameworks, React, and a good GPA. I was thinking maybe since game dev positions have higher competition, having this position would help me in that industry, and my projects/GPA would still allow me to find web dev positions in the future. Is this the right mindset to have?

Have you ever felt regret in a career decision? How did you feel better about it? Is there any advice you have to maybe alleviate some of my feelings of regret? 

Thanks for reading

5y6dof,2,2017-03-08,Possible internship in an area not within my major.,iamrangus,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5y6dof/possible_internship_in_an_area_not_within_my_major/,"For background, I am a junior electrical and computer engineering student.

In a few days, I am going to a Honda small engine factory (motors for lawn mowers, generators, etc...) and getting a personal tour to meet several people. And if I find a place that is interesting, I am pretty much guaranteed an internship in that department. The problem is, this would be a great opportunity for say a mechanical engineer, but I don't know how fitting it might be for myself. However, I do really need an internship this summer, and this place would be amazing.

Does anyone have experience that would know a spot where I might fit in (Electrical or Computer)? Would it be a bad thing if I took an internship offer even though it might be outside of my direct field?

This might be my only hope for this summer."

I'm a second semester junior and have been reflecting a lot lately. These are just some late night thoughts I'd share. I remember freshman year being like it was yesterday. So naive, breezed through high school and didn't really know how to study my freshman year, and got by with all Cs (except English and physics I).


Come sophomore year and I decided to live on campus. As a result, my time management was just so poor first semester. Finally I had the opportunity to meet people and party, and was just constantly putting off homework and cramming when studying. Ended up with 2 D's and was put on academic probation and had to retake a class. After that semester I got my shit together but still got by with mostly Cs.


Last summer managed to somehow land an internship. This gave me invaluable experience in what it's like working with people in the real world. As a result, coming into my junior year I had a much stronger work ethic. Managed to get my first semester with a GPA higher than 3.0 and felt like I achieved something. Also learned how to study with other people, something I hated the thought of in my earlier years just because I liked to learn on my own.


Now I'm sitting here after midterms reflecting halfway through the semester that in a little over a year from now I'll be saying goodbye to this wonderful time I've had here. I've had my ups, SEVERAL downs but NEVER gave up through and through. And yet, I'm wishing I could start over sometimes with the experience I have now. I wish I didn't ditch those classes sophomore year. I wish I took my homework more seriously. It would have made life so much easier. I look around me and see these people with 3.0+ GPAs and several opportunities thrown their way, and even if I make all As before graduating spring 2018 I can't graduate with higher than a 2.97, which will close a lot of doors in the job field. What makes matters worse is that only a few months ago I expressed interest in grad school or a doctorate program, and it's gonna be next to impossible to get into a good school. 


For me, studying engineering has always been an accolade. It's always great hearing people's reactions when I tell them I'm studying engineering and the respect I've been able to garner from my non-STEM friends. I'm not an athlete, don't have any incredible talents. Nothing has made me stand out besides this.


Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this off my chest and am hoping some of you can contribute to this post with your thoughts/experiences so I know I'm not the only one who's felt this way. "

I've learned to keep myself at arms length at all times because it made the inevitable end much more bearable. I'm a master at pushing people away.

In the process of building up these walls I have also developed the inability to really express my feelings to even the closest of my friends. Not for a lack of wanting, it's just something that I can't bring myself to do unless otherwise prompted. So here I am, spilling it all out on the internet instead.

This unspoken rule of not getting attached has been a constant throughout most of my adult life, until I met my most recent ex. It is hard to put into words how different it was from everything I had ever experienced or felt. For the first time in a long time I felt like I could truly be myself without fear of judgement or ridicule. So I allowed myself to let those walls down and let someone else in. And, as i'm sure many of you can relate, I got attached. I fell fast and I fell hard. But it was addicting. The feeling of wanting and being wanted. The comfort that I felt in my relationship with him is something that I haven't really had in past relationships.

But the timing wasn't right. I was moving to a different city for an internship 3 1/2 months into our relationship and he wasn't sure he was ready for a serious long distance relationship. So we went our separate ways and agreed to stay in contact as friends and then when I came back at the end of my internship we could reevaluate and maybe try again. But he moved on and found someone else. And I'm stuck here still waiting to try again.

He made me feel special and then he made me feel like I didn't matter at all. I was merely a blip on his radio yet for me he was the whole song. 

And now I'm here. And he's there, with his new girlfriend, happy. And I can't move on. I can't figure out what it takes. I can't seem to move past this and it makes me feel so fucking stupid. But I just keep asking myself ""what if?"" What if the timing had been better. If we had met at a different time in our lives. My mind is plagued by scenarios that will never come to be.

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this. I don't want to be all woe is me. I don't want pity. I just need some advice because I can't seem to get on with my life and I just want to feel happy."
5y794v,21,2017-03-08,"Big vs. small universities, let's discuss what your experiences has been like in the hiring process?",choosinganewpath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5y794v/big_vs_small_universities_lets_discuss_what_your/,"Over here where I live (Canada) there seems to be a large consensus that employers more often than not hire someone who received a CS degree from UofT/UWaterloo over someone that attended universities that aren't known for their CS program.

The people I've known who attended the aforementioned universities are over at the Big 4 in the states and with good reasons as those were people I considered as high achievers who excelled above their peers back when I was in school with them. However, there were also those who attended the same universities but wanted to remain local and are currently working for big corporations.

For the rest of the people I know who were unable to enter UW/UofT, they had to settle with universities with a smaller/'unrefined' CS program. Co-op/internship opportunities at these universities with smaller CS programs which had a smaller selection of opportunities to choose from. More often than not a few of them did end up having to search outside their school's program for more opportunities and with good reasons.

With the increase in people within this field, would it be fair to say that those who came from schools with a huge CS presence/department are more likely to work in larger corporations since those corporations usually have a connection to those schools/hire them out of their internships? And those in schools with a smaller CS presence/department are more likely in start-ups/smaller companies?

This is a black and white view I'm putting out there and should not be taken as fact but merely based on my observation (and small sample size) because I'm aware some people may just enjoy the start-up environment versus a large company and vice-versa. 

There are also many factors that plays into the effect of how one would end up working in a large company vs. a start-up/smaller companies such as pursuing side projects outside of classes, ambition, skill, preference for work-life balance, etc. These wouldn't necessarily take into account of their school though.

What has your experiences been like?"

I'm busy with an intern at a company and I would like to investigate a little bit deeper in their OEE. You may or may not know of it but that doesn't really matter. 

The first sheet is an database of all the OEE's since it will shift each day. The second sheet is the OEE calculator, from a spreadsheet I found on the web. The calculator will calculate the OEE from different values. I have to put in the values and that way it will calculate the OEE. It will calculate the Availability, the Performance, the Quality and the OEE itself. Since the OEE shifts each day, I want to make an Excel sheet that calculates it everyday when I put in the values and the Calculator sheet puts it in the right box(date) in the database sheet. So the two sheets have to work ""together"", if that makes sense.

The second database has in the Colum from top to bottom the dates ranging from 1-1-2017 to 31-12-2017 ( Yes I'm European haha). The row consits of four terms: Availability, Performance, Quality and OEE. The calculator shows each of the four and I want to get it for each day in the database sheet from the calculator sheet. I will try to upload two printscreens or imgur links.

 From my point of view, I thought I was really clear in what I was trying to communicate. So I try to rephrase it a different way and just get told I speak another language or that I don't make sense. 

I had speech problems as a kid, so I initially thought, that may be why, but I'm thinking it is isn't, and more of my mom trying to play with my head. 

The other day, I made a comment about a car in the parking lot, saying that it looks like a smaller version of your car. My mom said WHAT?? I don't know what you are talking about? I elaborated and said it was smaller than your truck and was a blue ford just like yours. I haven't seen one so small before. She still was confused and said that we speak a different language. I was frustrated, because it was just a small comment I made that turned into 2 minutes of me trying to explain what I said. 

The same happened a few days ago when I asked me mom, how we should go about rearranging my room and if there is anything we should decide on before tackling the mess. She was like, I don't understand what you mean? No eye contact whatsoever, and had her head buried in her phone like usual. 

All my life, I thought I was such a horrible communicator and felt so alien. My mom and sister would always dig at my speech, and it made me self conscious to the point I hate speaking. 

I got a degree in Public Relations and my peers, professors, and coworkers at my internship thought I communicated well. All I can see are my flaws. My pauses in speech. My stutters, my tone, my feminine sounding voice, my volume level, my pace, and etc. 

It makes me so frustrated that I never have confidence in what I say. I used to just say what was on my mind. I used to speak very loudly and freely. Now every word is micromanaged, just to make sure it is appropriate enough, loud enough, quiet enough, masculine enough, clear enough, or assertive enough, but not too aggressive. 

I feel like my mom has been gaslighting me to make me second guess everything I say. I get so frustrated when I have to repeat things to friends or if someone if I have to elaborate. It is exhausting and isolating. I feel like an alien."

I always struggle with becoming friends with other people. I have difficulty initiating conversation with others and keeping conversation going if contact has been established. 

For example, I see one of my previous grad student instructors who takes the bus at the same stop I do. He's a cool guy and he nods at me when we make eye contact but I have no idea what to say to him. I'd love to strike up a conversation but I'm worried I'll run out of things to say and that it'll get awkward. 

Another instance was an internship I held last summer. I joined as one of two interns. I only spoke to people when they spoke to me and avoided people otherwise. I had the same fear that I wouldn't know what to say. The other guy was a lot more gregarious, and he would chat up other employees. He got invited to get drinks after work (I did too, out of courtesy I guess) and he was always talking to different coworkers and people went up to him to talk to him. I was just kinda sitting there, awkwardly. No one really spoke to me unless we were alone together and they talked to me to not be awkward. 

I don't know why I am like this. I do have friends and I am very outgoing among my friends and am usually the more social one of my friends. But when it comes to random people, I get so scared and become stiff and awkward. I really wish I could be just as open and friendly with random people. 

Is there a way I can change this? I am starting a full time job in June at a new company and I want more than anything to have lots of friends in the office and be comfortable enough with my coworkers to drop by their office/cubicle and just chat about nonsense. "
5y92md,5117,2017-03-08,My mute sister spoke for the first time last night.,fairynextdoor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y92md/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last_night/,"I'm gonna try to recount the night as clearly as possible because honestly, I'm still so shaken up by the event. I don't know what to think of it. It just doesn't make any sense. 

My sisters name is Melissa. She is 25 years old. She has cerebral palsy. She is partially blind, always been mute, half paralyzed, and bound to a wheel chair, for those of you who don't know what that is. Any basic need you can think of, she has it done for her. Melissa talked once when she was two. It was the muffled cry ""mama"" through the baby monitor. Or at least that's what my mom told me. She is 8 years older than me. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my sister, but an eerie aura always seemed to follow her. Whatever house we moved to her room was the coldest, we could hear her laughing like someone was talking to her (about the only response she can give to us), and the worst one to admit is I was scared of her. I'd have terrible nightmares that I would go to her room in the middle of the night and someone was whispering to her, leaning over her bed while she giggled. In another one I'd go to check on her and she'd be floating in the air, pitch black eyes just staring at me like she could see me clear as day. As if she wasn't mostly blind. Those always scared me and I grew into the habit of sticking my hand in the door and flicking on the light before id even peak into her room. 

Eventually, as I grew older the nightmares stopped and so did the small habit of flicking on the light first. Two days ago I even took her out for a picnic. Everything was normal. I carried her to our huge living room couch when we got home and kicked back on the other side of the couch then turned on some tv. We fell asleep together on the couch that night and I don't think I ever bonded with her like that. 

I woke up yesterday morning and my mom (her usual caretaker) had already gotten her up. I made myself breakfast and headed off to my internship. It had been a long day working for a grassroots organization and by the time I'd got home I was beat. 

Here's where I can only recount as what I would call  the scariest moment of my 18 years of existence. 
As I come in around 9 o clock, my mom is getting ready to go out with her new fiancé (thankfully he's a good man). About once a month they like to go out and have a few drinks and I usually stay home alone. Well besides Melissa. I put on a movie last night and popped some popcorn in the microwave. My mom had been gone for about half an hour and I was already getting pretty sleepy despite the time. I could hear the faint ticking of the clock in the background and the movie playing. I stood in the kitchen waiting for my food. The light seemed to grow dimmer for just a second but I blinked a few times and it seemed to go back to normal. ""My eyes must be playing tricks on me,"" I thought. 

I pulled the steaming bag out of the microwave and began to walk back from the kitchen to the living room. That's when I heard it. It sounded like a faint whisper was coming from Melissa's room. My heart grew in pace and I grabbed the TV remote to turn it down, as that's what I thought the source of the whispering was. It couldn't be anything else. As I turned down the volume, I could hear the whispering still, just a little more loud and clear. The green drapes my mom used to add a POP in our living room seemed to be drained of their color. Everything did. I was frozen in terror but I kept telling myself I needed to check her because A. Someone is in my house or B. ... I didn't want to think about B. It honestly seemed worse than A at the moment. 

I crept down the hall to her cracked door. It was about half way open. I stood there listening for a minute, what seemed like a century. Just as I began to call myself silly and walk away, it started again. I couldn't make out the words but someone was definitely talking more loudly than a whisper at this point. I could basically feel myself vibrating I was shaking so badly. I felt along the wall for the switch as I entered the room. When I flicked on the light Melissa was sitting up in bed, facing away from me like someone had set her that way. This freaked me out because it just looked fucking creepy. 

The whispering started again and tears began to streak my cheeks as I realized it truly was coming from her. I began to walk over to her. As I began to slowly lay her down I hyper focused in on what she was saying. I couldn't really make out anything, it just seemed to be jumbled together. Her eyes were closed the whole time and I was trying to conceal my cry as I sat there running my fingers through her hair, just asking myself how this is happening. 

Then she said it. 
""Behind you."" And her whispering stopped. I immediately spun around and to my pleasant surprise nothing was there. I was panting at this point and basically took one last look to make sure she was okay before making a break for my phone. When my mom arrived home I couldn't even tell her what had happened at first. When I finally could spit it out, she just looked at me with a combination of disturbed and concern. Her fiancé slept on the couch last night and I slept with her. She told me not to worry about it. It was probably another one of my nightmares or something else. 

I don't know how this could be possible? What did she mean behind me? How can someone who hasn't spoke for 25 years or have learned a language at all, just gain speak? Any answers would be appreciated. Anything.

5y97ic,130,2017-03-08,Some thoughts on the KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC comics from the author,JohnJacksonMiller,StarWars,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/5y97ic/some_thoughts_on_the_knights_of_the_old_republic/,"Just joined Reddit a few days ago, and wanted to make a proper introduction message to the SW subreddit -- hello! 

Coincidentally, today is the release day in comics shops for the second *Knights of the Old Republic* comics volume from Marvel, under the title **LEGENDS EPIC COLLECTION: THE OLD REPUBLIC Vol. 2**. The mass-market bookstore release day is in two weeks. I understand the policy on self-promotion, so I hope I can avoid running afoul of that in this post by linking only to my behind-the-scenes [production notes on the issues in the book](http://www.farawaypress.com/fiction/books/swlegendstheoldrepublic2.html) -- and adding some value here by discussing the series more generally, which ran from 2006 to 2012 in various forms and spawned 57 comic books, two action figures, a number of short stories, and several sections of a RPG campaign guide (which I also worked on) from Wizards of the Coast.

Dark Horse created the ""Knights of the Old Republic"" title in its *Tales of the Jedi* series long before Bioware picked up the title to use for its celebrated role-playing video game. The game was quite different aesthetically, despite being set just a generation after the last *Tales* comics; the intention, I assume, was to make the setting look more like the familiar *Star Wars* than the archaic version seen in the comics. I entered the picture in 2005, when after having written an issue of **Star Wars: Empire,** for Dark Horse, I was give the chance to propose a series that would give the publisher a chance to play off the new popularity of the name it had created.

I was under no obligation initially to either adapt the games or play off them at all; it's a big galaxy, as my editor liked to say, and we could have set the series at any time in that sub-era. So I wrote the pitch about fugitive Zayne Carrick on the run from his murderous masters first, and only later decided to set the series seven years before the first game, at the dawn of the Mandalorian Wars.

The idea there was to sort of play with the dynamics of the Prequel Trilogy, which was just wrapping up. Viewers watching the prequel trilogy knew full well the bad things that were in store for the galaxy; gamers knew the stuff that was going to happen in the KOTOR game. By introducing the Covenant, a group of seers who had seen that bad things were going to happen -- and who had acted to stop it, with disastrous results -- we got a bit of a thought-experiment version of the prequels. What if the Jedi Council had realized what Anakin would become? 

So that was the genesis of the KOTOR comics. Zayne, of course, was no Anakin, and the seers didn't see what they thought they saw -- so the rest of the first meta-arc would be about Zayne clearing his name with the help of the con-artists and criminals he used to have to catch. That, too, was a thought experiment: what if Luke had said the heck with the Rebellion and taken Han Solo's job offer? Here, Zayne became apprentice to The Gryph (or intern, as he liked to say). It was a fun dynamic: Marn Hierogryph remains one of my favorite characters I've created.

There was never, however, going to be just one meta-arc. The other three fugitive characters, Jarael, Camper, and Rohlan, all had their own stories, and each was designed to proceed at different speeds, overlapping with Zayne's initial fugitive arc. Camper's was resolved first, and appears in the first section of the new Epic Collection; Rohlan and Jarael's stories continue to advance in Vol. 2.

Those stories might have ended before the fugitive arc concluded had we not decided to do **Vector**, the ""cross-through"" which connected comics in four different eras during 2008. The publisher wanted the events of Vector to result in serious changes in each individual series; for KOTOR we decided to accelerate the pace of the fugitive arc, which concludes before the end of today's Marvel volume. 

That put Jarael and Rohlan's arcs on the other side and into what will be Marvel's volume 3. (No spoilers please, on those; we worked hard to keep their secrets for a much longer time than intended!) That allowed us to advance Zayne's career to its next ""freelance hero"" phase before bringing it to what, again, I had always intended: his military life, which, with the Mandalorian Wars raging, was something that seemed inevitable for him. As it turned out, only the earliest events in that career appeared, as a limited series in 2012 which, at the publisher's request, had temporarily pared down the supporting cast to just Zayne; had we done more stories, the regulars would have been brought back in. But by 2012 I was moving more into prose, and my *Kenobi* novel was announced before the end of the year, so Zayne's story concluded where it did after 1,258 pages. 

Marvel's reprint series is the first to get them all, incidentally; today's Vol. 2 includes issues #19-37, but also the [Knights of the Old Republic Handbook](http://www.farawaypress.com/comics/swkotorhb1.html) and six more of my in-universe Holofeed pages, which have never been reprinted. I'm particularly delighted about the Handbook, which included two great cross-section designs by Dustin Weaver for the *Last Resort* and *Moomo Williwaw*, as well as Dustin's cover, which appears as the back cover of the Marvel volume.

And yes, for those unfamiliar with the comics, the books do tell the origins -- or at least part of them -- for Revan and Malak. We were careful not to conflict with the mechanics of the game; Revan's face is never shown. (That experience came in handy when I was writing about Shepard in the first **Mass Effect** comics.) The games were always a background element, and never the whole purpose behind the KOTOR comics; as noted, we made our own way. But it was nice to get some characters in larger than cameo roles. I'm proud of what we were able to do with Carth Onasi and Saul Karath, for example.

This isn't really an official AMA, though I am happy to answer questions on the series if I can: as noted, my website linked above has essays on every single issue in the volume, so a lot of questions you may have are answered there. But since it was a post on this subreddit that got me to join, I figured this was a good opportunity to share some thoughts of my own. May the Force be with you, and see you at Celebration (where I'll be giving a talk about my comics work, some of these included)!

I am filing as a resident alien in the US. In the 4 months, I had health insurance in Canada but it's through my school in Canada (so no 1095). Can I file saying that I had health insurance in the 4 months while I was in Canada or would I have to pay the penalty?

My department has helpdesk, network admins who also do systems administration, and devs. Helpdesk workers have virtually no access to any servers, thats a network admin job in this company. 

I'm in my early twenties, just out of school, and I've worked here for a few years as an intern, and accepted a full time job because I am finishing up my degree. I don't want to work helpdesk forever, and I understand that I need to work my way of up the ladder. However, I don't foresee that happening here. 

How do I go about getting experience to be able to apply for the Systems Administrator or Network Administrator positions if I have no opportunities to work with enterprise level equipment or virtualization software? Or, are companies more willing then they let on to take in people who can demonstrate they know how to learn and invest in them?"

Should I be worried since it is a small company? What other advice can you give for a first internship? "
5y9oat,2,2017-03-08,Advice and Chances of Acceptance,Somec00ldude,nyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/5y9oat/advice_and_chances_of_acceptance/,"Hello, I'm a junior in Florida, and it would be nice if I could hear opinions on my chances of getting into NYU.

New SAT: 1430 (750 reading and 680 math); I've only taken it once and that was without studying, so I intend to study more and score in the 1500s next time.

Unweighted GPA: 3.58 (hopefully will get it up to 3.6 something with next semester or Summer courses)
Weighted GPA: 4.1
Class Rank: 57/420-430 (something in that area, which admittedly is not impressive for my school, but at least it's top 15%, which is probably not that impressive either)

I am in the International Baccalaureate program, a well-recognized program that provides students with the rigor of college level courses, so essentially like AP, but as an entire program and schedule, and probably more effective (not to disregard the effectiveness of AP courses, some IB courses do follow the AP curriculum for junior year). I have taken some AP exams, though. I received a 4 in psychology, a 5 in statistics, and I am hoping to secure a 4 or 5 in the BC calculus exam in May. We do have our own IB exams at the end of senior year to determine college credit received for courses taken, but of course this is already after college applications are either accepted or rejected. I am currently finishing up an online course for introduction to computer science in python provided by MITx on the Edx website which will hopefully result in a certificate that actually has gravity given the provider of it. I will also hopefully be interning at the beginning of senior year with my friend's dad, who owns his own IT company, so that should add some depth to my résumé given I am pursuing a degree involving software and computer science. I might also pursue some sort of Summer internship, though I am not sure where or for what at the moment. I am just looking for something that will give me professional experience, even if it is not related to my desired major, like an internship at a law office. I currently work at Publix, and though I do get practice with my social skills, I feel that a more professional environment would be good for me. I have heard of students emailing professors at nearby colleges and securing Summer research roles, which also offers nice experiences and pads the résumé quite a bit.

I was born and raised in Florida, but my entire immediate and extended family is from Brazil. I do not speak it too well, but I understand most conversations in Portuguese. I am not sure if nationality will have any impact on my status as an applicant given I do not identify with the culture.

As far as clubs and extra-curriculars, I participate in the following: Ted-ed Club Historian (you know, those online videos with thought-provoking discussions), French Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta (math club), Science Honor Society, National Honor Society, Pre-medicine Club, Student Council Vice President in Sophomore Year (all we did was set up Hoco), occasional ultimate frisbee member (would like to go more frequently and participate in next tournament), sound technician for a school play last year, volunteer at elderly home once a week (nothing significant, mostly just help with meals, which makes me feel like I should do something else with a greater impact). I do intend to join Spanish Honor next year and hopefully secure a position in one or two of the honor societies I am already in and maybe organize some significant event for the club.

As the IB program is very accelerated, I believe that I am already semi-fluent in French and will probably actually be fluent by the time I leave high school. My sister took IB French at a different school and maxed out her French credits for college, being forced to take business French. As I previously stated, I understand Portuguese, but do not speak it very well, though I could try to relearn over the Summer as they appear to just be dormant lingual skills I have not used in a long time. I thought I should add this section in to see thoughts on bilingual and trilingual skills having an impact on desirability as an applicant.

I would like to apply early decision for some sort of computer science degree, as the New York area is my dream location, and New York University seems to possess a multitude of positive qualities. I do find my GPA worrisome, but I also hope that the recognition of my rigorous program will make up for it. I am honestly not trying to sound egotistical when I say that IB is nationally recognized. I am just not sure how much it counts for along with the rest of my résumé. Even if I do get accepted, I feel like I might not be able to go due to financial reasons, as in I have literally no money for college. I have no college savings whatsoever. I could probably go to University of South Florida with a full scholarship, but I truly have my sights set on New York. I would have to take out tens of thousands in student loans, and see what I could do about financial aid, which is comparatively low for NYU compared to other schools. What are your thoughts on the possibility of a huge grant? Is it likely? I will probably also go through numerous websites applying for third party scholarships worth a few thousand here and there.

Other details: my relationship with all of my teachers is not very good. They do not dislike me, but they do dislike my work ethic, which I admit is very lazy to the point of doing practically no work. The only reason I have semester grades of A's and B's is because I allow my intelligence to carry me rather than putting in concrete work. This probably paints me in a bad light, but I want to be honest, as I do intend to improve this next grading period and beginning of senior year, as all of my teachers know I'm intelligent but just lack motivation. I also wanted to address the college essay, which I believe I can write fairly well. I have been told I'm pretty eloquent in my speech and writing, and I would like to think I have a charm in my written and interviewing skills in terms of social situations(I can't write an English paper or timed essay to save my life). I just wanted to understand the type of tone I should take and what exactly I should emphasize outside of the generic 'well-rounded, be yourself' advice.

Overall, I applaud whoever had the heart to read through this short essay of inquiries I have written. Please respond with your thoughts of my desirability as an applicant, chances of me being accepted when I apply in November, and any advice you can offer. Thank you very much.

5y9tsi,0,2017-03-08,no interviews - wtf is going on?,jeyebrows16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5y9tsi/no_interviews_wtf_is_going_on/,"First let me start off by thanking you cscareerquestions, you guys have been a super big help in the whole internship/job app/career process for me.

But I'm about to lose it right now. Since September or so, I've submitted 70+ applications for various SWE full-time positions and internships, and I have been contacted for a whopping TWO interviews. For my first interview, I actually got to the on-site (didn't get the offer), and I am currently scheduling the first round for the second follow up that I got.

So how is this possible? I've had my resume and cover letters looked at by everyone from my school's Career Services center to coworkers and SWE friends and everyone seems surprised that I've received so few responses... Is it expected that you have friends/family at the places you apply to in order to get interviews? Or a 3.9 GPA? It's not like I'm even applying to just big name companies, I've applied to all sorts of companies from tiny to huge, in 5-6 major cities around the US, and I've applied to every kind of position including iOS, web, front end, backend, and especially focused on all of the general software engineering positions for new/recent/college grads.

Though I'm still an undergrad, I have a few years of REAL web and iOS dev experience working part time for my university. So maybe I just pigeonholed myself for only web dev/engineering jobs? That doesn't seem right considering I'm still in school for my CS degree. And while we're on the topic, I'm also getting a degree in Psychology &amp; Neuroscience - did that make me a less desirable candidate because my education seemed ""less focused""?

cscareerquestions, I need you guys to help me figure out just WTF is going on!

5y9wjl,95,2017-03-08,Always wear headphones on the metro,M0C2K4,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y9wjl/always_wear_headphones_on_the_metro/,"Hey guys. I've never submitted a story on Reddit, but I have to share: I'm being followed. It's unclear who is following me and what he/she wants. I just know that I'm not safe anymore. I'm on the metro (rail/commuter train system in Washington, DC) typing this right now so my reception is crap. I hope there's enough of a connection for this all to post when I'm done..

So background information would probably be helpful for everything to make sense. About four years ago (Fall, 2013) I was a junior in college, and I got an internship with a government agency. It was paid and I was taking an internship class for credit so this was a win-win. I received notice in September 2013 that I’d been chosen, but due to the government shutdown, I was unable to start until October 2013. My schedule was Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

The day was Thursday, October 31, 2013; Halloween. I boarded the metro to embark on my commute to Downtown Washington. I was a little ahead of schedule, which was awesome because that meant there were still seats available. I quickly snagged one and opened my purse in search of some headphones. When I realized that I’d left them in the pocket of another coat I was bummed, but just decided to text some of my sorority sisters about our weekend plans.

My fellow commuters seemed un-phased by the fact that it was Halloween. However, I was feverishly texting back and forth about costumes and fraternities and all that bullshit. Looking back, I wish those conversations were more enthralling because maybe I wouldn’t be hopping from car to car on this damn train trying to avoid this guy. 
So I’m texting away. We make one stop, then another. In total, there are 8 metro stops from my college to my internship; it’s about a 30 minute commute. Not bad. About 4 stops in a man boards my metro car. He seems uneasy; he’s pacing my end of the car and then briskly walks down the aisle to the other end of the car. He’s dressed like an average guy, in an old but clean polo and faded light jeans. The man looks to be in his mid-30’s but weathered; maybe from drug use? 

To be frank with you all, I don’t even know why I noticed him. It could’ve been my justice/law major working overtime. Who knows? Regardless, I kept tabs on the guy for another two stops. 
We hit the sixth metro stop, and the doors open and close. I’m halfway through a ranting text from a sister when the same man comes flying down the aisle screaming, “HELP HELP HELP!” and jumping like a damn popcorn kernel in a microwave. No less than 10 seconds later, a man comes sauntering down the aisle, dressed to the nines. He was dapper as hell, and smelled like nice cologne. This gent looked to be in his mid-late 40’s. As he struts passed me, he’s repeating, “ain’t nothin’ wrong with him,” as his eyes remain locked on the man spazzing at the tail end (my end) of the metro car. I glanced around me to see no ones’ gazes had faltered from their newspapers, books, and iPods.

At this point I felt like a huge asshole; have I been staring at this man’s son, judging him for potential drug use when in fact may have a disability? Damn. What a jerk I was. So I just lowered my head and kept reading the text. We were still between stops and our train was holding to allow another to pass (single-tracking is a bitch!). I looked up from my phone to see the jumping bean cornered, like an animal, by the older gentleman. Weird, but it’s not my business. 

Until…the dapper gent puts his face about 2 inches from that of the spastic man and says in a low, almost inaudible tone, “I have eyes all over this city. If you don’t get me my money by 5pm, I will find you and I will not hesitate to kill you. Do you understand me?” My jaw drops like wtf is this real life? No, it can’t be. It has to be a Halloween prank, right? Then, of course, the spastic man successfully squirms away from the classy gent and begins to scream “HELP!” some more, whilst climbing on a lady and her son. The lady yelps, also in disbelief, grasping at her son. A nearby passenger drops his briefcase and puts this man (who seems to be completely out of control) in a headlock. 

Just then we pull up to the next station, and the guy holding the spastic man in a headlock, pushes him off the train and I saw that guy sprint away from the train, never once looking back. The doors close and the train is once again in motion. I shift my gaze over to the dapperly-dressed man. He’s sitting down into a seat, opening up a newspaper. He catches my gaze, tips his hat in my direction, and smiles nonchalantly. His eyes were so dark and I instantly felt a chill run up my spine. I got off at my stop and went to report what had just happened to the WMATA workers. The woman just smacked her gum and said, “k.” 

Fast forward to last week, nearly four years later. I was on the metro on my way home from work (I got a job at the department following graduation), and I’ll be damned. That same dapper man got on the train in that same damn outfit. He tipped his hat at me and said, “good day.” I just stared at him until I collected myself and stammered out, “you too.” I jumped off the train at the next stop and Ubered home. And now, I’m on my way home from work. I left early since I felt run-down (this sporadic DC weather has me sick all the time). And who the hell is sitting across from me as I feverishly type this? None other than the dapper man. I have no idea what to do. How’d he know I would be on this train, in this car, at this time? What does he want? Why now? Nothing makes sense. Sure it could be a coincidence but what the hell?? Please. Let me know if you too have seen this man, and if you know what he wants. But for those of you who haven't encountered this man on the metro, always wear your headphones and keep your head down when you ride."

This interview was for a paid internship with a company that I really like.  The entire interview was over Skype, but the interviewer didn't have a camera and there was a ton of noise in the background, so it was really hard to judge his reactions.  The first 2/3 of it went great, but towards the end we had this exchange:

&gt;Interviewer: So you're graduating in May, are you looking for jobs elsewhere as well?

&gt; Me: Yeah, I have a few other interviews planned out so far.

&gt; Interviewer: Are they for full time positions?

&gt;Me: Some of them are, yeah.

&gt;Interviewer: (Silence) ...So you would probably take one of those over this?

&gt; Me: If I was offered a full time position I would have to do what ever I thought would be best for my future.

&gt;Interviewer: (Silence)

&gt;Me: I do really like [Insert Company Name], and if you think there is a good chance that I could be hired on full time from this internship then it is something that I would highly consider.

He ended up picking back up with some questions for me, but I felt like the entirety of the interview was thrown off.  I didn't want to lie to him about other opportunities I may have, but I feel like he pushed way to much.  

Do you guys have any advice on how I should have handled this?  Should I just not mention other opportunities in the future?

But for Computer Science I hear it is much easier, the pay should be relatively the same if not better, and the content is much easier. No Physics, just a lot of programming languages (something you'd have to learn in  Electrical  Engineering anyways, but not as in-depth). Also, I hear there's a lot more internship opportunities and you can get one even as a freshman.

Are there any EE / CS students here and are all of these points valid? I'd like to hear anything you guys have to say"
5ybjf8,1,2017-03-08,Am I really a developer?,AlkarinValkari,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5ybjf8/am_i_really_a_developer/,"So I took a few courses in college for computer programming, and began interning at a (small) software development company. Due to my normal jobs work hours I almost exlusively did QA during my internship. In January my internship offered me a full-time job as a Junior Developer. A good portion of my work is still QA, along with Git maintenance and updating servers/managing branches and releases to servers etc. I occasionally have bee given small programming tasks like making sure the copyright updates to the current year on a site, or tweaking CSS, creating an HTML page, running SQL queries to fix things etc.

Since this is a small company I knew I'd be wearing many hats but I feel like I'm not really doing enough development work. While my resume says I'm a developer, I worry if I attempt to get another more programming intensive development job, my current experience won't be as valuable as if I was a developer at some other company. My current job is a great place to work and they said they'd slowly give me more dev work but I still don't think it will be a lot due to the nature of the workflow(We have an offshore dev team who does 90% of the dev work).

While I do not have a degree, my pay is much lower than most entry-level developers and I know this is both a combination of being at such a small company but I feel also because I'm not actually doing a lot of development. I'm just worried I may actually be hurting my career progress by working here, rather than focusing on programming somewhere else.

So I guess my question is this. Does this sound like a normal workload for a Junior Developer? Its hard to tell if I'm being 'tricked' into having this title while they have me do other work, or this is simply part of the process of becoming a career developer that happened to start out at a smaller company with an offshore dev team. I don't have any friends/or know anyone who is a programmer so its hard to relate my experiences with others."

thats only my academic life. my family life is nothing. i have virtually no relationship with my parents or brother and i envy those who actually desire to and enjoy being home. all i do is sit in my room on reddit. 

as far as my love life, it also doesnt exist. im a 21yr old kissless virgin who has never known the interest of another person. it really wears on me. i cry every night that i dont have someone else to love and who loves me. i just want to know what affection feels like. not only do i know that ive never known such a feeling  and currently dont, but i also known i wont for years to come. my ability to be social and havr a conversation with people is severly underdeveloped. to add insult to injury im flat out unattractive (fat and short). 

everday all i feel is either nothing, or an all encompassing sadness for my worthless future and/or shitty present. the only thjng thay brings me joy is my little cockatiel and i cant even be with him while im at college. i just wish i could start all over, but i cant help but see no path forwards for me. ive fucked up to bad and i let it all happen to me. i hate myself for it. i blame no one but myself, but at the end of the day what does that do for me when i know ill never change myself no matter how much pain it brings me. fuck

5ybquj,1,2017-03-08,[M4A] Freshman Savages,JamSideDown,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5ybquj/m4a_freshman_savages/,"Kiko stopped in her tracks as one by one the boys emerged from their hut, spears in hand, faces red with blood and war paint, necklaces of bone hanging on their naked chests. She could hardly imagine that just three months earlier they had been six fresh-faced high school graduates, with college, life, and the whole world ahead of them. No one could have predicted the swiftness of their descent into bestial decadence.

It had been a simple enough idea. In the spring, the six boys had been recruited by Northern State University, South to participate in a sociological experiment. They would spend three months in the tropical wilderness of Isla de Carne, monitored only by remote surveillance, with no contact with the civilized world. It was safe, relatively speaking--they were supplied with sufficient tools and rations, and the wilds were clear of any predators. It had seemed like a fun idea; Survivor for college credit that they would receive in the fall. The participants were even thoroughly vetted, to make sure only the most accomplished young men were chosen. How could it have gone so wrong?

To this day, no one is sure just how it happened. Maybe it was something in the drinking water. Maybe it was the curse of the island natives, who'd died out two hundred years earlier, and left behind nothing but a promise of ruin for those who followed them. Maybe, without endless streams of MTV and internet pornography to suppress it, human nature had simply taken over. Whatever the reason, in three short months these six of the best and brightest newly minted young men had fallen to their basest impulses. And now Kiko was the last hope to bring them back.

Kiko stood before the boys, the distant smell of freshly carved meat wafting towards her in the tropical breeze. The NSUS Sociology Department's brightest intern, Kiko could hardly afford to fail in her mission. Something more important hung in the balance than just the lives of six soon-to-be college freshmen. This mission would decide, above all else, that thing most important to every college girl: Her grade.

Stuart was the first to approach her. He had graduated top of his class, with multiple national spelling bee, mathlympics, and spellinglympics championship trophies to his name. Hunched forward, Stuart lumbered towards Kiko, sniffing at the ground around her. He sniffed up her leg, past her thigh, and buried his face into the warmth of her vagina. Kiko tensed up, but said nothing, unwilling to show fear, or any sign of weakness, barely watching as Stuart's nose dug fiercely into her vagina through the front of her skirt.

Stuart straightened up. ""WOMAN!"" he shouted to the others, his voice a guttural grunt.

""Yes,"" replied Wesley, ""We can see.""

""I'm here to bring you home,"" said Kiko, firm-footed as she straightened her skirt. The boys laughed. ""What's so funny?"" Kiko asked.

""The dove flies,"" said Josh slowly, ""but the falcon rules the skies."" Josh stood taller than the rest, his football star body bare and burnt brown by months under the tropical sun. When he spoke, the others straightened themselves.

""The falcon rules the skies!"" chanted the other boys.

This is going to be harder than I thought, Kiko thought, startled by the force of their collective voice.

""Why don't we head back to the docks and we can talk all about it there?""

""The falcon does not fly far from his nest."" said Josh.

""The falcon rules the skies!"" chanted the boys again.

""But if the dove has come this far to the falcon's nest,"" Josh said, walking forward until he and Kiko were inches apart, ""she must know what comes of pests.""

""They go back to get reinforcements?"" Kiko asked.

""You will stay here,"" said Josh. ""The falcon demands a sacrifice."" With that, he took Kiko's blouse in both of his firm, calloused hands and tore it in two, revealing her milky breasts to the crowd before shoving her to the ground.

""SACRIFICE!"" shouted the boys, whooping and shrieking as they swarmed forward, charged and ready for action.

--------------------------------------

* O&amp;A do a break about bands that dragged on for too long and changed key band members. Opie mentions as an aside that he hopes the show doesn't go on without all of them, but then he also mentions jokingly that he is gonna be done in five years tops. This is perhaps the earliest recorded of several thousand mentions of his intention to quit.

* Jay Mohr calls in to say that Opie will be appearing in a sketch on [*Mohr Sports,*](http://www.espn.com/mohrsports/) some dumb variety-hour ESPN show that eventually flopped. Opie will play a stalker of a WNBA athlete and the skit will be blatantly ripping off the tune of the ""We Salute You"" Bud Light beer ads.

* Dave Douglas is fired from WAAF, much to O&amp;A's satisfaction. The set up a bit in which Psycho Tim goes to WAAF to deliver some sort of 'message' to him, but he had already left the building at that point. Naturally, O&amp;A credit give themselves credit for his swift departure and attribute it to Dave being terrified of them organizing a stunt.

* Intern Francine makes her debut on the July 9 show. She shares some of her standup comedy tapes (which are terrible) and the boys mock it. Her appearances seem pretty grating, since her stupidity isn't at all endearing. She becomes a production staple between breaks for her idiotic observational brand of humor. 

* The show's music beds consist of [Distrubed](https://youtu.be/BsIXGVOvah8?t=2m9s) singles, [Filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q9xRFmUhxk), [Paul Oakenfold](https://youtu.be/q0EeuN-g0Rg?t=1m11s), and [Crystal Method](https://youtu.be/A12-KN5UijA?t=1m22s)

* Tippy Tom injures his foot and ends up in the hospital. The boys call in and hear that he’s on the mend, freshly bathed, and totally sober. They’re surprised by how completely normal, but also very gay, he sounds.

* They go on a T&amp;A with O&amp;A tour throughout Buffalo and other NY shithole locations. Jim ridicules the name of the tour.

* Opie bombs terribly within the first 10 minutes of the July 12 live show (I'd provide a link but it's not on YouTube right now. When it is, just listen through and you'll hear it). Basically, Opie sets up his own punchline by saying that he was riding in the limo with Jimmy to the pre-Ozzfest O&amp;A live show, and he noticed that Jimmy was visibly anxious at the prospect of getting to finally meet his hero Ozzy. Opie says that driving with Jimmy was like “taking John Hinckley to the Dakota.” It gets an absolute zero for being completely nonsensical in a purely comedic sense, but also because Jimmy is swift to mock him for not saying Mark David Chapman. Opie admits that it was “the first joke [he’s] written in about a week” and that he practiced it on Anthony on the bus ride over. He then pivots and says Anthony hung him out to dry just now because Anthony had previously laughed at that joke in private when Opie rehearsed it on the bus.

* [Awkward interview with a half-dead Phil Anselmo of Pantera at Ozzfest](https://youtu.be/NRJg7KUb2II)

* The bulk of the July 15 show is another annoying ""Ozzy is great vs. Ozzy sucks"" argument between Opie and Jim. It turns personal, Opie calls Jim names, repeated shouts ""WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?"" over and over so Jim can't speak. Again, when this show hits YouTube, it should make for some great hate-listening.

* Now four years removed from their termination from WAAF, O&amp;A continue to do longform bits about Rocko. Opie says that if WAAF fire him, they promise to go easy on the station for four months.

* Callers find Lady Di drunk at a bar and say she's coming on to them and is clearly an alcoholic. She calls in a few minutes later to defend herself, but they play the silent game on her.

* Ant goes on a rant against management, lawyers, and Ken Stevens because of the tight leash they're kept on with respect to naming 'another radio show.' Apparently this show made FUCK O&amp;A bumper stickers, yet O&amp;A aren't allowed to address it nor have even veiled references to it. Ant airs out that Stevens even insinuated that Jim's veiled on-air references may get him fired if he isn't careful.

* They recount stories of drinking the night before; Ant says Steve C was the only one of the group who gets drunk and turns into an angry drunk.

* Pablo Francisco in studio. Every single second he spends in studio is via a voice or character. In addition to being completely obnoxious, he is perhaps the most self-unaware guest the show has ever had.

* Not sure if it's the show or just the general state of America in 2002, but there's a ton of gay-focused production. Rick made a song called ""Christopher Street"" to the Sesame Street theme, and Pablo Francisco did some muppets song about having AIDS, compelling him to interrupt the show with ""tainted blood"" every few minutes.

* A caller rang into the FU Line saying ""FU!"" to the NY Times for [publishing an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/world/us-plan-for-iraq-is-said-to-include-attack-on-3-sides.html) claiming the US was beginning preparations for a war in Iraq. He argues that it won't happen. This is the first show mention of what would be the Iraq War.

* Ratings books come in and the show is #1 for 18-49 in most cities but are slipping in DC. They're the number 1 overall show in Cleveland, the first time that O&amp;A have ever been the highest across-the-board show in one of their cities.

* The show has The Crystal Method in-studio to DJ for them during one of their Flaming Dr. Pepper &amp; Teen Slumber Party shows. Over the course of the several weeks leading up to the show, as well as during the show itself, Opie uses the term “house band” to describe The Crystal Method. That’s well and good, since that is definitionally what they're appearing in studio to be, but Opie uses the term ""house band"" between 40-50 times, 10 of those times during the Slumber Party show alone. It’s as if he’s a 9-year-old who just heard showbiz jargon and is eager to use it as often as possible to show everybody around him that he knows what the phrase means.

* The show appeared in Page 6 after having a party on Broome St. that got pretty rowdy. The show still held enough juice to get a gossip mention in the Post, apparently.

* Ant is nervous because hotel rooms are replacing the traditional keys with swipe cards and he's worried that his privacy is being invaded. 

* Tommy Lee calls in but quickly hangs up after the boys try taking about the Pam Anderson sex tape (which was already about seven years old at even that point). They ridicule him after he hangs up, and then he calls back later on during the show. But Opie calls him a pussy and he hangs up again. Opie actually held his own here. 

* The boys bring in [Jimmy's tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ZQzhj_52c) with his awful put-on voice. Rich, Patrice, and Colin are in studio and ridicule him. For the first time, Patrice calls him a worm and claims that the old norton with the high voice is the ""true"" Norton, and the Norton of 2002 is the actual facade.

5ybub8,19,2017-03-08,If you're Nate ...,audiess4,barstoolsports,https://www.reddit.com/r/barstoolsports/comments/5ybub8/if_youre_nate/,"... what do you think of what's happening around you?


I think a lot lately about how Nate has virtually no media franchises compared to every other talent hire at Barstool.


I'm not a fan of Nate's ""spider monkey"" personality that Pres and others at Barstool seem to believe is the best he can offer, but I am aware that he works hard and has worked hard to post a lot of blogs. To his credit he seems to be an accomplished blogger in his own right.


But if you're Nate and you're looking around and you see all of the shine interns like Robbie, Glen, and Ria are getting compared to you, how do you feel about that? If you're Nate and you see that every single talent employee except you has at least one podcast and many have more than one, what are you thinking? I know that it would be supremely hard for me to stomach it. Robbie and Glen are featured fill-ins on Drive Time and longtime veteran Nate is not. Ria (for appropriate reasons) is part of KFC Radio when Jersey Shore Vinny rolls through, but Nate hasn't been on KFCR in years.


And I believe in what Pres once said about Smitty: ""The pine is the great motivator."" I also understand that he has a very weak track record on-air, especially on the Rundown.


But still: if you're Nate and you're looking around at what on-air opportunities others have, are you pissed about it? Or: do you think Nate is self-aware enough that he knows on-air isn't for him? Do you think that he's secure enough in his station at Barstool that it doesn't bother him and that Dave/Erika are very happy with the way he currently contributes? Regarding Nate At Night, Dave skewered him way worse than any hillbilly at R&amp;R.

Of course I don't know what on-air franchises he's working on or bringing to the table currently so this may be a moot situation soon."

5ybzro,1,2017-03-08,What the hell am I doing with my life.,bobby_the_vortex,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ybzro/what_the_hell_am_i_doing_with_my_life/,"I'm turning 29 this year and at this point in my life, I would've hoped that I had some things figured out by now, but I am still as clueless as ever.

Long story short, I started off as a premed major, did terribly in my second year, got depressed, changed majors several times, then graduated with a general arts degree. Then I worked a couple of years at a dead-end job, then went back to school for another 2.5 years and studied my ass off for a rigorous biochem degree in hopes of trying to give med school a go again and getting a better job, did internships, and a thesis project. Despite having good grades and a high MCAT, I did not get a single interview invite in the two cycles that I applied. I eventually landed a job at a CRO, where I have been working for the past 2 years. While my coworkers are friendly and easy to get along with, the job itself is pretty depressing - low pay/benefits, little room for advancement, and unfulfilling. 

I really don't want to be doing that in the long-term and on the whole, I don't see myself being happy in this field. I'm not passionate at all about bench research/being a lab tech and it pays very little in comparison to the education you have and hence why I didn't pursue graduate studies.

Earlier last year, I decided to apply for dental school - on paper, it sounded like a sensible career decision - normal work hours, decent pay, job security etc. My plan was to get into dental school, apply for a navy scholarship or work in a rural area to pay off the debt, etc.

I guess I didn't think things through enough before I wrote the DAT, submitted my applications, and interviewed. In some twist of fate, I got accepted into dental school, but instead of being estatic that I'm finally making some progress into a proper professional career track that will afford me a decent income and path for advancement, I'm terrified at the prospect of being locked into a career for at least the next couple of decades due to the debt load and length of training. 

So I'm at a standstill right now. On one hand, this is a really big opportunity for me to break free of my dead-end job and finally do something with my life and I don't know if I will get such an opportunity again. On the other hand,  dentistry has never been something I've been passionate about - I simply applied because it seemed like a sensible thing to do at the time. All of a sudden, all of those things that didn't seem like that big of deal when I first applied loom large in my mind now (e.g. debt, the fact that I will have to stick with it for a long time, the rigours of dental school/dental practice). I am so burnt out from studying my ass off, applying to med school etc that I really don't look forward to more schooling. But if I don't accept the offer - what then? How much longer will I be stuck at this job, or worse become unemployed? I really have no idea what I'm passionate about, what I'm good at (aside from cramming my brains out at school...) or what I really want to do because so much of my energy has been focused on studying hard at school or trying to get into medical/dental school. So part of my anxiety about getting into dental school is that it would foreclose my possibilities - but what if I never come across viable possibilities if I reject the offer, and end up stuck in this job/field indefinitely?

At this point, I really don't know what else I could do. In a perfect world, money wouldn't matter but unfortunately I need money to survive. And while I am perfectly capable of living a basic, low-budget lifestyle, I would not be happy doing that indefinitely-I want to be able to eat good food, travel, comfortably afford the things that I truly enjoy doing (snowboarding, mountain biking, motorcycling) while being able to save for retirement and have a mortgage - and those things don't come cheap. But I also don't want to go into dental school, burn out/flunk out and left with a mountain of debt or stuck in a career that makes me miserable. 

I am so lost right now it's not even funny."
5yc1jj,2,2017-03-08,[M4F] - A Week in the Life of an Intern,joecalla,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5yc1jj/m4f_a_week_in_the_life_of_an_intern/,"**Monday**  
I pondered, on the way to your office Monday afternoon, what would make you summon me. I think ""summon"" is the right word when an executive requests the immediate presence of a lowly intern without warning. It was only my third week, and I needed to check the wall map outside the elevators to even find your office.

I couldn't guess what you wanted when you closed the door behind me. I didn't take the hint when you told me to sit in your chair, or when you looked into my blue-grey eyes with amused certainty. I thought, somehow, that it was  some embarrassing mistake when you sat on the edge of the desk and shifted so that I could clearly see your red panties peaking out beneath the hem of your black pencil skirt.. I was innocent, far too innocent, 96 hours ago.

It was thirty minutes later when, on the way back down in the elevator, I finally began to process what had happened. I could still taste your cum on my lips, could still feel your fingers pulling at my short hair as you held my mouth to your pink womanhood. I had to check my watch to realize how long it had been, my sense of time and space lost as I tongued and sucked on your pussy until, with a playful shove at my forehead, you instructed me to get back to my desk.

**Tuesday**  
My Tuesday passed in tense silence as I sat at my desk and struggled to concentrate on my work. Thoughts of you kept intruding on my efforts at a comprehensive competitive analysis of my assigned market segment, until at 6PM I finally gave up on the thought of you calling me back to your office. *Was it all a dream?* I wondered to myself, until my phone buzzed on the way to the elevator. Five minutes later I was in your office, gritting my teeth to avoid withering under your intimidating gaze.

I couldn't say ""no"" to you,  and not just because of your position at the company. It was the look in your eyes. At your command, I withdrew my hard-on, solid and throbbing with the energy of youth. You looked on with an amused smirk as I stroked myself in front of you, fingers curling around turgid flesh slick with pre-cum, until I came on command onto the shiny hardwood of your desk. And then you sent me on my way, as though I'd delivered a report on the Asian markets that you wouldn't have time to review until tomorrow.

**Wednesday**  
There was no waiting on Wednesday; you were in my office when I arrived at work. I'd come in early to get some work done, to lay low, but you were there. Like you knew my schedule before I did.

I could see the confidence in your gaze as you lifted your dress up above your waist and leaned over my desk, your bare ass framed by a pair of garters. I could hear that confidence in your voice when told me to get to work. Ashamed as I might have been to admit it, I'd been aching to taste you again since Monday, and I moaned in pleasure as my tongue slid through your sex from behind. I remember the bemused look in your eye a moment later when you looked back at me and shook your head disapprovingly. You didn't correct me with words, simply pulled my face into your ass and pressed my lips to your tight anus.

I licked until you moaned, until I felt your ass hole clench around my probing tongue as you came. I tried to pull back then, but you explained with word and body that I wasn’t done, that I wasn't to stop rimming my boss' boss' boss until I was told to stop.

It wasn't even 9AM when you left me, somehow looking put together while my cheeks were red and coated in the juices you'd made me lick from your thighs when I was done.

**Thursday**  
Thursday's lunch-time lesson was a new one; you called it a ""reward"" for my good service the day before. I got no work done all afternoon, not with the picture of your eyes smiling up at me as your lips were wrapped around my manhood. I came hard, harder than any other time I remember, until drops of cum dripped from the corners of your smiling mouth and my balls ached with emptiness.

I felt suspicion from everyone on your floor as I returned to my office downstairs, as though they could all tell I'd just been blown by the Marketing VP.

**Friday**  
And now it's Friday, 6PM. The elevator beeps as it arrives on 24, your floor. The office is quiet now, late on a Friday. Only a few unrecognized stragglers spot me as I make my way to your office, and I can almost see them forgetting me as they pass me in the hall, their minds focused on tonight's plan or this weekend's upcoming adventure. My mind can't even focus that far out.

I knock on your door, and hear a ""Come in, Josh,"" from within in a voice that's still not particularly familiar; we haven't spent a lot of time talking so far.

I take a deep breath, reach for the knob, reach down instead and adjust my hard-on to make my arousal less obvious, then take the knob and push open the door.

However I am not good enough yet to ask to get paid those exorbitant machine learning salaries. 

This is kind of a perfect solution imo. I can learn for free, from real people in the field, doing real interesting cool stuff, and they don't have to pay me, they can just use my help for free!

However, the resounding advice is to never work for free. Not even taking a free internship.

I'm a current freshman planning a double major in computer science &amp; business. I'm originally from the West Coast and currently go to an engineering-focused school in the East.

Today I got an offer from a tech startup in NYC! Really excited, but it comes with one caveat: it's an unpaid internship, and living costs in New York are really high. Because I have no family in the East Coast, I'll basically pay out-of-pocket for the entire thing, including food, rent, etc..

The startup said that they are not open to paying interns. However, I do plan on asking if they can help reimburse my relocation/living expenses. I also plan to ask for a grant from my University to see if they can help. I know some school offer grants for unpaid internships, but to my knowledge, mine doesn't. Doesn't hurt to ask, though.

My parents offered to pay for my living &amp; housing expenses, but I honestly would feel guilty taking even more money from them, especially because they promised to pay all of my tuition through undergrad.

Does anyone have any other suggestions on how I can make ends meet in New York?"
5ycgfc,1,2017-03-08,"Freshman math/cs major, am I crazy to turn down an internship for a REU?",chamberwell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ycgfc/freshman_mathcs_major_am_i_crazy_to_turn_down_an/,"Hi guys. For context, I'm a freshman math and cs major at the University of Massachusetts. I recently got 2 internship offers that I'm really excited about. The better one that I'm thinking of accepting is at Putnam Investments (medium sized financial company in Boston).  I'm really enthusiastic about this one for multiple reasons. One of the projects that I could work on is Putnam's data visualization software, which I find really cool because I'm a math guy just as much as (if not more than - more on that later) I'm a cs guy. I'd get to work with a team of other interns which I think would be really fun. Also, the pay is pretty good, $24/hour for 10+ weeks. I know that very few freshmen get internships like this, and that I'd be passing up an incredible opportunity if I turned it down.

The other thing I might do instead is this REU program. If you don't know what REU is, it's Research Experience for Undergraduates - the NSF gives grants to various universities so that they can fund undergraduates doing research in various fields. The one that I got into is at the University of Miami and the projects are all about CS. The research projects I could do are really, really interesting, (roughly) in order of my interest, they are studying how GPU's can enhance this elliptic curve factoring algorithm to attack cryptosystems, studying how different normalization techniques can improve how deep neural networks recognize images, this computational neuroscience project that would use sequencing technology to study how neuron transcription changes when neurons are injured, and this project in how to visualize neurological data. It would pay $5k for the summer and a $120/week food allowance for a total of $6200 for 10 weeks. They would also pay for my travel to and from Miami and provide free housing. It's less than what Putnam would pay me, but not a ton less, and either way it's more money that I'd know what to do with so I'm not too concerned about money. I also think it'd be pretty cool to spend a summer in Miami away from my parents and all, instead of living at home and commuting every day.

The way I'm looking at it, the decision is basically deciding what career path I want to go down: there is my dream of being a scientist/mathematician, or there is the software engineer path. Like I mentioned, I like math as much as if not more than I like programming. My ideal career would be one where I do math on a regular basis and apply it to something really cool, whether that be cryptography, complexity theory, computational biology, or something similarly meaningful. I know that this would likely have to involve grad school, a PhD, a postdoc, and 10+ years of making little money and moving up through mid-level academia before I would become a professor and things would get really interesting. I also know how cutthroat academia and how hard it can be to get established.

If I went the safer, more traditional software engineer path, this internship would be an awesome start: not many freshman would get an internship like this, and if I keep my grades as good as they are now I feel like I'd be in a great position to get a big N internship next summer which would put me in a really good place career-wise. However, I have this lingering fear that if I become a software engineer, I'll get a job writing some boring application that won't invovle any cool math/interesting problems, just lots and lots of code, and I won't like my job, given that math and science is what I really like. I know that there are lots of really interesting software engineering jobs that involve lots of math and research-type work, such as in AI like making self-driving cars or in cryptography. However, there's no guarantee that I could get a job that involves stuff like that. Of course, going into grad school and research is no guarantee I'd be able to work on interesting research, as not everyone makes it in academia.

Of course, I probably sound like a crazy person thinking that what I do summer after freshman year will determine the rest of my life. I know that either decision will not determine my future career, and that I could still go either path no matter what choice I make. But it's true that this decision will at least push me a little bit towards one career direction. I'm leaning towards the REU for a few reasons, which I'm not sure if they are true and would like some clarification on.

I'm under the impression that grad school admission generally won't care about industry internships that much (or at least not as much as companies care about research experience), even if it involved something fairly mathematical like the data visualization I might work on at Putnam. On the other hand, even if I do the REU, I would still gain some really practical CS skills depending on the project I do, such as GPU programming, or artificial intelligence/machine learning, or cloud computing. I'm under the impression that companies would view a paid research experience in CS as almost as good as, if not as good as, a paid software internship. Am I correct in those assumptions? Say I decide in 2 years that I want to go the software engineer route. How would the Putnam internship versus a paid CS research internship look to a big N company recruiting me?

Also, I think that REU's are harder to get into than internships, although I'm unsure about this. My sample space for REU's is pretty small (I applied to 3, only heard back from 1 so far) so I'm not sure how hard they are to get into but I believe that they're quite selective. Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I don't think it'd be too hard to get a comparable internship next summer, given the fact that I got 2 offers this year as a freshman, (and a 3rd interview that I'm going to cancel), I think I could get something comparable next year as a sophomore. Still, knowing how few freshman get internships like this, I feel like I'd be a madman turning down 2 of them.

Sorry for this wall of text. As you can probably tell from this long, rambling soliloquy, I'm seriously agonizing over this decision. I know I shouldn't be stressing out so much over this given that whichever choice I make, I'll be in a very good place for a freshman, but nevertheless I am. If only I could do both :( Someone help me make a decision please!"

I'm a high school senior (Boston area) looking for some advice on summer internships as it is a grey area between high schooler and college freshman. &amp;nbsp;


I have been employed / interning with my local town hall's IT department for the past three summers and I would like to move onto a more demanding program this coming summer. &amp;nbsp;

This is a throwaway so I am happy to share my portfolio site/ resume if anyone is interested, but I am most interested in infosec and cyber-security (whether that takes the form of a sysadmin or a dedicated security researcher), so I have been looking into internships with Raytheon and rapid7, but each are targeted to university/ college students, even if they have only completed one year. &amp;nbsp;

My primary skills (and interests) are programming (Java, C, C++, Python, x86 ASM) and Linux systems administration, so I am really looking for an internship where I could apply and grow these skills. Just by my personal projects and homelab I would likely be more proficient than most college freshmen. &amp;nbsp;

I have already applied to Army educational outreach programs (SEAP, HSAP) and I would like to apply to Raytheon, but my question really is whether or not it would be acceptable for me to apply for positions targeted to university students simply because there isn't much out there for graduating seniors. &amp;nbsp;

Obviously over the next couple months I will be networking at conventions and conferences, but any help would be appreciated. &amp;nbsp;

5ycrui,0,2017-03-08,Am I (22M) a selfish boyfriend?,NotVeryCreativeTBH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ycrui/am_i_22m_a_selfish_boyfriend/,"Apologies for the wall of text, but I really need this assessed.

So I've been dating my girlfriend Hadley for almost 9 months, and I really love her a lot. Like, seriously. She's so special to me and so funny and beautiful, and we have a great time together. Anyway, we go to school about 2 and a half hours from each other, but live a few towns apart at home (met over the summer at work). She loves me a lot too and we get on pretty fine.

So, Hadley and I got into what I would call a disagreement rather than an argument. Let me break down myself for you. Right now, I am a senior in college playing college basketball (not DI) and work an internship 13 hours a week. So I have one class a day M-Thurs, my internship on MWF, and practice and/or lift everyday. I also have games on weekends. 

Hadley got upset with me because we haven't seen each other in almost two months and next week we are seeing each other for the first time in a while. She is coming to see me next Friday morning, and was planning to leave Monday morning. The problem my friends want to do the yearly Saint Patrick's day bar crawl in my city and I want to go. It's on Sunday, will last all day, and it will be my last. Hadley is not 21 so she can't come. She got hurt by this.

Her reasoning is that when she comes to visit (normally visits every other weekend, just had a busy few weeks), I'm always doing homework and studying, which normally doesn't bother her but she's upset I'm leaving her behind and basically sending her home so I can clear a day for my friends (she says I haven't done that for her, but we did some stuff last semester). Then she went on about how she is always bending over backwards travelling to me (driving to and from) and I can't make time to visit her for a weekend after my game. I think this is silly, cause I'm busy and we have more time together if she's here.

She then went on to say that I was pretty selfish. She wasn't nasty, but she wasn't beating around the bush either. Right now I'm on spring break vacation with the friends I'm doing the pub crawl with, and I also live next door to them. She says that's selfish of me and I feel like she was testing me cause when I told her that I wanted to go on Sunday she said I could, and then she's saying she understands but she's hurt?

Also she listed some other things: how I told her I'd never take ecstasy again (I used to with my friends years before but I'm not that kind of guy anymore), but did it two weekends in a row before telling her. She's really anti drug and she was so upset saying the only thing she's ever asked of me was to not do party drugs.

She also said I take my sweet time texting her back but when I'm with her when she's here I text my guy friends back immediately almost every time. I guess I don't notice this. I think she's being ridiculous. She says I often put my friends first and have little consideration for her. I don't feel like that's true, I think about her all the time. But my friends are important to me, I wanna be around them.

Oh, and she's also annoyed that I didn't want to buy her a Valentine's day gift because I don't have the budget, but bought an Xbox One a week later. Instead we made dinner and dessert and drank wine and danced, which I thought was nice, and I also think Valentine's day is a waste or money. I got her a card and flowers as well. If I want an Xbox, that's entirely different.

All this had me wondering if I'm really a selfish boyfriend? I love her so much and don't want her to leave me, but is she also being ridiculous? I text her multiple times a day, call her a few times a week, and always tell her I love her. I think about her so much too.

TL;DR: My girlfriend thinks I'm selfish but I think I'm just living my own life, and that's how most relationships are."

Back in October, I interviewed with Company A for a summer 2017 internship position.

The HR rep for Company A told me when I interviewed with them that they would get back to me in a few weeks with their decision (positive or negative). They never got back to me, so I talked to some other students in my computer science classes and all of them said that no one they know had heard back from Company A, so I figured the HR Rep was backed up and I should just consider it a loss.

Around this same time, I applied to Company B and interviewed with them in November/December. In early January I received an offer from Company B and told them I was interested. They had me apply to the company that handles temporary staffing for them, and I received 1) An official offer letter from the temporary staffing agency, and 2) A link to complete information for the background check. Additionally, I completed a drug screening for Company B. I have not signed and returned the offer letter, as it states in the offer letter that it is to be signed and returned on my first day (which I think is odd, but I digress).

Earlier today, I received a call. I didn't answer the call (I never answer calls from numbers I don't know unless I'm expecting a call), but they left a voice mail: It's an HR Rep from Company A. They told me that my information was given to them by my previous HR Rep at the company, and they'd like to ""discuss internship opportunities available for Summer 2017."" This doesn't necessarily mean they're going to offer me an internship position, but I feel that it's likely, and I want to be prepared if they do.

I interned with Company A last summer in a different department, and did not receive a return offer, but my HR Rep at the time encouraged me to re-apply to a different department if I wanted to work for them again. I enjoyed my internship, but I'm not sure if I'd like to work for Company A full time, while Company B seems like a company I might be able to get behind more. However, Company A has a better internship program than Company B:

 - I was paid almost 18% more last summer than Company B is offering me for this summer

 - Company A paid for relocation as well as offered corporate housing or a housing stipend, while Company B does not provide either; and

 - the location that Company A's internship would be is a nicer area of the country that the location of Company B's internship, in my opinion

Anyway, I'm getting way too long-winded here. My question is, if I receive an offer from Company A, and decide that I like their offer better, is it appropriate for me to accept it and contact my HR Rep from Company B, backing out of my summer internship with them? I'm not sure what the etiquette is or what's expected of me. Thanks so much for reading all of this :)"

Realistically, I'd be looking at falling somewhere like 3.3-3.8 by the time I try to apply to CS if I'm in UW probably. However at Western, it seems far more likely I could get into the CSE program. 


PROS UW:
• I'll like the area more 
• Better and more internships 
• I REALLY like the campus
• The ~prestige~ of it being UW Seattle
• Pretty sure I qualify for the Husky Promise 
• Closer to my home, easier to travel


CONS UW: 
• I will probably dorm if I go to UW for freshman year and I don't know if my mental health and thus grades can take that kind of hit
• Probably won't be able to get into CS
• It seems most STEM majors are super competitive
• It would cost more than WWU
• Larger class size on the whole
• High car density
• Probably will regret not going to WWU a lil



PROS WWU:
• pretty neat campus
• Is relatively near Vancouver
• Is relatively near Seattle
• Bellingham's a pretty neat area, I don't know it well at all though
• I'll be in a student apartment with 3 friends (2 who are already students at WWU) so more privacy, better mental health, closer to the campus, cheaper than dorming
• Bit cheaper overall
• Better chance of studying CSE
• Majors aren't as competitive 
• The Planned Parenthood in Bellingham offers a service I might use that I don't think the Seattle one does. 


CONS WWU:
• it doesn't have the same reputation as UW
• I prefer the Seattle area 
• I aprefer the UW campus
• It seems harder to find internships and research opportunities in the area
• will probably regret not going to UW at least a lil too



I'm all twisted up over this. I like both equally but for different reasons. At this point I'm a fence sitter with my feet dangling over the WWU side because the whole CSE thing. I don't want to go to UW and end up having to transfer to WWU after 2 years because I couldn't get into a major I at least was interested in; I'd be slightly okay with the other way around because if I end up transferring to UW, it's because I could get into CSE or a major I like. I could always try to move to Seattle after graduating regardless. Any thoughts, experiences, or advice? "

We've been waiting since we were twelve for this moment.""

""That was last year, Lionel. Stop being dramatic.""

""Fine. Let the ritual begin.""

""Whoo-wee!""

""Klaatu-""

""Barada-""

Meanwhile in Hell, Asmodeus, Lord of Seventy-Two Legions, pondered the fate of the Underworld upon his thone of blasted rock adorned with leering skulls. Suddenly, he felt a buzzing come from the nightstand. He reached over, a little more, and brought the phone to his ears.

""Asmodeus.""

""Sir, it's- it's the summoning, sir! The ritual is nearly complete!""

""What? Did the Mayans get the date wrong again? Send the new intern to look.""

""Y-yes, sir, right away, sir...""

Asmodeus sighed. Pesky human-things. Even as he laid his chin back onto his fist, a tiny imp was scrambling through the ducting into the rocking and rattling ritual chamber to investigate the terrifying disturbance.

""Nikto!""

A blast of Hellish blackflame burst from the pentagram on the floor, and swirled in a manic tornado of tongues. A piercing scream flooded the room, and the boys dove behind a fallen stone pillar as a chill ran down their spine, in spite of the suffocating heat. Then as quickly as it exploded, the flame vanished into thin air, leaving the banshee screech to fill the room.

After a couple of minutes of screaming, James turned to his brother.

""Is that you going on then?""

""No, it's not me.""

""Are we-""

""Still alive? I should think so, yes.""

Lionel gingerly poked his head above the cover of the stone. There, in the middle of the scorched pentagram, was a tiny red winged creature, and it seemed rather upset.

He stuck his head back down.

""I... I don't think it's Asmodai.""

At those words, the imp broke into a frenzy and started wailing even louder, screaming at the top of its little lungs,

""Ahhhhh! Asmodeus! Aaaaahhhhhh! Run away!""

It started flying around in frenzied circles, as though confused by the skulls and torches scattered on the catacomb walls, then flew headfirst into a statue of Mary and dropped to the ground with a soft thud.

This time, James was the one who took a look. He blinked a couple of times, then stood up straight, walked over to the comatose imp, and scooped it into his hands.

""Come here! It's a... I'm not sure what it is!""

Lionel hopped over, nearly tripping over a stray femur in his excitement.

""An imp! Aww, we must have made some mistake in the ritual!""

The demon pit boss sweated in his boots as Asmodeus stared at him.

""What do you mean, there was no mistake in the ritual?""

""S... sir...""

""AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME IMP WENT IN MY PLACE?""

""I... I...""

""YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE RITUAL MAY BE PERFORMED ONLY ONCE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS?""

The pit boss quivered like a devilfish in a sauna, then squeaked and collapsed.

""... never mind. Bring me to the Psychic Communicator. We shall have to make do.""

Back at home in their room, the two brothers gazed at the sleeping imp in wonder. The tiny creature seemed to be enjoying its sleep, rolling around once or twice in the blanket. Unsure of what else to do, they had placed it on their bed and turned off the lights.

""Do you...""

""Shh, let's just let it sleep.""

James nodded.

It shifted a little and put its thumb in its mouth, cooing a little.

""Do you think it's-""

""Shush!""

The soft noise startled the imp, and it sat upright, still clutching a corner of the blanket in its hand. It looked around fearfully, and seeing no fires, sighed a tiny little sigh. It was about to go back to sleep when it saw two pairs of eyes staring at it mutely from the other end of the room.

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!""

""No, wait, wait! We're not-""

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Sirs! I am sorry for my laziness! I am at your service oh please don't eat me sirs although I am not worthy to be even the seasoning grated on top of your food oh please please sirs-""

The poor thing was weeping on its knees when James stepped up and pet it on the head.

""Aaaaah oh!""

It flinched in surprise. James looked at it, then smiled.

""I'm not planning to eat you, kid. Uh, thing? Lionel?""

""Imp, James.""

The imp shivered in fear.

""James, you must understand that the hierarchy of Hell is such that greater demons like to eat lesser ones. Imps are at the very bottom of the food chain.""

""Oh, so it thinks we're going to eat it. No, I'm not!""

James gave it a great toothy grin, which brought the creature back to its knees frantically offering propitiations.

""No teeth! No teeth! Dear Lord, have you learned nothing!""

The imp squeaked and cowered a little, then creaked open an eyelid.

""Interesting... so it didn't burst into flames.""

""Flames, Lionel?""

""Well... I expected that simply mentioning the Lord-"" the imp squeaked again in surprise- ""whoops. Uh, it's still alive! That's good for us, I think.""

James just smiled and started scratching it behind the ears. After a little nervousness, the tension left it, and it curled into a ball, purring gently.

""Aww, it's just like a little kitten!""

""I... wow, I never thought of demons as kitten-eaters, but I don't know why I'm surprised.""

They stood there for a few minutes, staring at the imp in rapt wonder.

""M... masters?""

The boys blinked.

""Did you hear that?""

""Yup.""

""In... your head, too?""

""Ayup.""

""Masters! You have shown me unbounded kindness! I, the demon whose name is Isogolfin, pledge eternal loyalty to you! Please do not eat me, though!""

James chuckled heartily, startling the imp again.

""Hahaha! We're not going to eat you, Iso- Izug- Izzy. We're humans! And we don't eat imps.""

Izzy nodded, then suddenly froze. Its eyes bulged, glowed an infernal crimson, and a booming voice filled the room.

""HARK, MORTALS. I AM ASMODEUS OF THE SEVENTY-TWO LEGIONS. HEED MY BIDDING!""

""No.""

""... WHAT?""

""This isn't fun anymore. I don't want to bring about the Apocalypse.""

""I agree. I'm now more interested in the properties of Hell, actually.""

""...WHAT?""

""Say, Mr. Asmodeus. Could you tell us about the seventy-two legions?""

""I AM THEIR COMMANDER, MORTAL! I STAND AT THEIR HEAD, AND AT MY COMMAND, HELL ITSELF MOVES! THEY- I AM NOT HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, FOOL!""

""Okay then. Bye.""

""FOOLISH MORTAL---!""

With a puff of black smoke, the imp collapsed again.

Asmodeus was furious. As far as demonic standards went, he was positively livid.

""MARK THE IMP. THIS MOCKERY HAS GONE TOO FAR.""

James yelped as a spiderweb of firey lines crept over Isogolfin's body. It grew warmer, warmer, then nearly burning, and it started convulsing in pain.

""Lionel! We can't just let that happen!""

""No... we can't. James.""

""So? Hurry! Let's go get dad's book again! The- you know-""

""I'll never know how you managed any magic, James. For the last time, it's called the Necronomicon.""

Whew, what a ton of work it has been. I'm still feel like I'm extremely limited in my ability to write code as I've only been doing it for ~ 1 year now. My question concerns internships. I've seen many posts about people getting internships in this program at different stages. I work 40+ hours a week so I'm on the 4 year track for now. Does anyone have advice about at what stage I should start thinking about searching/applying for internships? Is there a certain course I should have completed before taking on an internship? 

I live around the Washington, DC area so it's we have a ton of defense contractors out here. I've seen some requirements of 1-2 years of C++ or some other language. But wondered what others have experienced and what could be recommended."
5yd54r,1,2017-03-08,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5yd54r/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed.

I miss you. Like a lot. 

I know I've been sick and tired and less than fun recently. Mono will do that to a girl. But I wish you spent more time with me. Just cuz I'm sick doesn't mean I don't wanna talk to you anymore. 

I know you like your sorority. I do. I know it was important for you to find other people like you (extroverts) to party with and be around. And that's why I supported you when you were trying to get in and was excited for you when you did. But I hate that movie night has turned into oh-no-sorry-I-have-a-party night.

I know most people don't like sharing their failures, but I honestly feel like I've ended up a better person because of this experience so perhaps I'm more eager to tell people about it. 


&amp;nbsp;

**My story:** I applied into anesthesiology and interviewed at a ton of programs (20+) because I was planning to couples match with someone applying into a competitive specialty. We ended up splitting before submitting our rank lists, but after having completed interviews. Anesthesiology residencies are split between categorical and advanced. I hadn't given much thought to the advance programs because I was originally planning to couples match somewhere categorical. I did interview at a few prelim programs, but only a handful of very competitive ones. In retrospect I probably should have done many more prelim interviews and at a wider range of programs. I also probably should have been more aggressive about expressing my interest to this programs after I realized my first choice anesthesiology program was going to be an advanced program. I also should have realized that there was a higher chance of me not matching into a prelim position because of how few programs I was ranking (5 I think?). 

&amp;nbsp;

So come Monday, I barely had on my radar that it was unmatch day and that we would be getting an email. I get to clinic and check my email and am horrified to discover that I didn't match. I basically panic and have no idea what to do. I get an email from the deans office saying to report to the med school with my laptop. I don't have it on me, so I drive home to grab it. I actually am in such a daze that I go home and grab a bag WITHOUT getting my laptop. I manage to make it all the way to the med school,  which is 20 minutes away, and show up in the deans office before realizing that I had to go back home to grab my computer. My experience here is that often in emotional situations brains do weird things. My advice would be to anticipate all the things that could go wrong and prepare for them. 

&amp;nbsp;

After getting my computer, I sat in a conference room with some of my other classmates who didn't match. It is one of those few memories that is most strongly ingrained in my mind. It was very emotionally tough to walk into a room filled with my colleagues and admit that I somehow fell short of where I thought I should be. I realized that I was way luckier than most of the people there because I had at least matched until my primary specialty. The whole experience felt like an alternative reality. I kept wondering how this could be real,  especially for some of my classmates. I was in disbelief that many of them would go unmatched. These were outstanding students and wonderful people. They were not people who were struggling academically, had personality disorders, or had ""overreached"" with the specialty/programs they were applying to. One of the girls had gone on more than the number of interviews she was told she needed and even turned down some interviews at the end. She was one of the nicest, most likable girls I knew. Always very organized, on top of things, and able to get things done. I mention this part because before this whole experience I thought the only people who didn't match were either super arrogant, had a difficult personality, or were some how not qualified academically. By being a person who DIDN'T match, I thought all those negative things applied to me. But I think the reality of the situation is that there are MANY reasons why a person might not match. While the match algorithm is worthy of a Nobel prize, there are many flaws to this entire process. Do not let this one ""failure"" dictate how you see yourself. It in no way defines the kind of doctor you will be. This result is the product of people making a judgement about you based on an extremely limited snapshot they got. I think it is worthwhile to take some time to reflect on why you didn't match, but don't perseverate. Did you not apply to enough programs? Did you not build the right relationships with the right faculty mentors? Did you not have enough research? Were you realistically just not competitive numbers wise for that specialty? Did you do something during the interviews that was a turn off? Figure out what areas you could improve and then move the fuck on. Focus on the work that needs to get done for you to go where you want to be. The next few days are very busy, so fortunately there is a lot to distract from the potentially all-consuming crippling self-doubt that is often encountered with a harsh rejection (at least for me). 

&amp;nbsp;

Next piece of advice is know whether you even want to go through the SOAP. I had a good friend who applied to a competitive surgical specialty. While he had an 'okay' number interviews, he probably should have realized that there was a good possibility that he might not match. I think he was in denial about the reality that he might not match and as a result hadn't fully thought through his back up plan. He had said that he would do research for a year and reapply, which is a reasonable option, but one that many people advised him against. Come unmatch day, he was torn whether he should try to do a prelim year and reapply or really take that year for research. Time is precious once unmatch day hits. You don't have time to talk to everyone whose opinion you may value. Take the time to talk to people NOW about what you would do if you didn't match. Figure out what your options are. Things that you might want to consider are the financial consequences of not matching. Can you afford it financially to defer graduation? Will you be able to realistically reapply if you do a prelim surgery year? This wasn't a process I had to go through so I can't talk to you about all the things you should consider. I can say it was painful for me to see someone I cared about wrestling with these decisions without the luxury of time to really process what the right choice was for him. I think he ended up making the right choice for him, which was taking a year off to do research, but I still think it would have been a much better situation had he planned adequately. 
EDIT: [Big congrats to him for matching into plastics! He recaps his experience in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/5zc7f9/went_unmatched_last_cycle_in_a_competitive/)
&amp;nbsp;

The interview process itself was mostly a blur. I barely remember what programs I talked to and what they asked me. It mostly felt just like regular interviews. Everyone essentially says the same thing. You tell them what you think your strengths and weaknesses are. Make up some reason that you like their particular specialty (even though most likely you don't ACTUALLY like it). You make up some questions to ask about their program to make it seem like you're genuinely interested. I remember spending all day to night on the phone on Tuesday. My voice was super sore by the end of it. The memorable conversations I did have were with residents at the program. I found that to be most valuable because what I really cared about was what my experience was going to be like at the program. I would be suspicious of any program that isn't able to get you in contact with a resident. I had one program that wouldn't put me in touch with their resident. I got really lucky that another resident that I was talking to asked what other programs I was thinking about and actually had a friend at the uncontactable program. She put me in touch with them. While she was very nice, her half-hearted enthusiasm for her program helped me realize that that would not have been the right place for me despite the big name. 

&amp;nbsp;
First round of SOAP I got two offers. I took the more nearby offer, which also happened to be a less malignant program. I have to say that while I was really horrified at the time that I would be doing a surgical intern year, I am actually SO happy that I am doing it. The hours suck, but it has been an overall very positive year. I've been loving the operative exposure. I've met some of the most impressive, kind future surgeons. I really love my colleagues and will be very sad to leave. So happy ending! You never know how these seemingly horrible things will turn out. You may think it will be a horrible experience, but instead you have a great time and are actually pushed in a way that makes you a better person.

&amp;nbsp;

**The process**

&amp;nbsp;

* For the official, most accurate information I would go to [this website](http://www.nrmp.org/residency/soap/). Everything I'm writing below is from memory so there may be some inaccuracies. 
* Emails Monday morning telling you if you matched or not. If you matched an advance program but not a prelim position it will tell you that.
* Your deans will get in touch with you. At my school all the students who didn't match are suppose to go to the deans office and have meetings with them. Honestly I feel like i had very little guidance from my school (despite my school usually being very supportive). I think this is partially because I had matched into an advance program so they were not as concerned about me
* Deans will know and tell you what CITY you matched into for your advance program. The programs interviewing you will often ask you for this information. The programs will know if you matched advance or not, but they will not know where. For me this meant I knew what program I matched at since the city I was in only had one program. 
* Monday morning around 11am, deans will give you a long list of every unmatched position available in every specialty
* ERAS or whatever the webpage is called will open around 2pm for you to submit your applications. I believe there is a limit to the number of positions you can apply for. I also remembering the website crashing multiple times and not being able to submit for a good hour after it opened. 
* Programs will start calling you Monday afternoon through Tuesday night. You should find a nice quiet place to camp out and wait for calls. This part I was not prepared for. For my first call, I was walking around campus and did my interview outside in a noisy place with wind and people walking by. I was honestly very surprised that it was a formal interview. In retrospect I should have asked them to call me back when I was more settled. 
* Expect the interviews to be formal. I don't think I was properly prepped by my program about these interviews. I somehow thought that most of the SOAP would be based on our applications and didn't have any sense of how these phone interviews played a role. My deans made it sound like they were going to be very casual chit chat on the phone. NO. They are full on interviews that you went through for the past few months. To be honest, they were even more formal than most of my actual interviews since anesthesiology is really chill and the prelims I was interviewing for were surgical. 
* Fully be prepared that some programs will violate the rules. Because of how the SOAP works in terms of rounds of offers, programs are very incentivized to know whether or not you are planning to accept a position if they offer you one. I had multiple programs tell me that their goal is to match all of their spots in the first round. One program told me straight up that they needed to know whether or not I would accept the position if they offered me. This really puts you in a difficult position because you don't want to lose out on their offer by saying no because you don't know if you'll get any other offers. This is one of the things I wish I had thought about before having to talk to all these programs on the phone. I gave pretty wishy-washy answers basically saying I was very interested, but not sure.  I've always been a very straight forward person, and I felt horrible that I would have to be dishonest to give myself the best opportunities. My Dean told me that because they are breaking the rules in their own self interest, I had no obligation to do anything but act in my own self interest. I do believe that I missed out on being offered a spot at a particular program because I was a bit too honest. At the end of the day it was ok because I love the program I ended up at, but it still was an unpleasant experience having to navigate this moral gray zone. Hopefully none of you will encounter this, but I wanted to put it out there so you've thought through how you would like to respond. 
* Wednesday rounds of offers start coming out. I know in theory how this works, but I'm probably not the best to explain it. Basically each program can only put out as many offers as spots that they have during each round. So say program X has 2 spots. Only 2 people will get offers from program X during round one. If one person rejects the spot and one person takes it, then program X will have 1 unfilled spot. I'm not going to take time in this post to talk much about strategy here. My understanding is that you take the first offer that you get because you will not be able to hold onto it into another round. Unlike the match algorithm, this does not really guarantee an optimal match, but at this point I think most of us are grateful to match anywhere. 
*Match day! You'll open your envelope just like everyone else (but you'll already know what is inside for the most part). Celebrate with your friends. You have a lot to be proud of. Making it through medical school is no easy feat. 
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Unmatch day can suck and be really stressful. Tips to help you get through it

* On unmatch day, have your computer with you
* Know ahead of time what you're going to do if you don't match (Take a year off vs. prelim vs categorical in another specialty)
*  Be prepared to start taking phone calls Monday afternoon through Tuesday night. Find a nice quiet place with good reception to settle in. This will feel like interview season on steroids. 
* Ask to talk to residents at the program. For the few programs I was seriously considering, I was able to talk to their interns, which gave me pretty good insight into what my next year would be like. 
* Have a mentor in mind who you can ask to make phone calls on your behalf to programs you are very interested in. 
* EDIT: [Friend writes about his experience not matching, taking a year off, and then matching into plastics this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/5zc7f9/went_unmatched_last_cycle_in_a_competitive/)
&amp;nbsp;
* Take the first offer you get in the SOAP
* Relax. This is a small bump in the road and does not define you as a person or a doctor. It is easy to let this sort of rejection make you feel horrible about yourself, but you can't let it make you give up. Instead take a few minutes to reflect on why this happened and then focus on the actions you're going to take to make your future better. A the end of the day, everything will be ok. "
5ydkbv,1,2017-03-09,Trying to figure out where to live for a year while attempting to building up an online business,movingadvice2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5ydkbv/trying_to_figure_out_where_to_live_for_a_year/,"I am about to graduate college with a computer science degree and have a great, high-paying job offer from one of the country's largest banks to write software for their mortgage banking department. I have interned with this company for the past two years. It would be a safe option to take and I could live in New York City.

Regardless, I'm not going to take the offer. I don't think I'm going to take any offer. College, and these past two internships have really taken a toll on me. Every day I wake up and have a series of classes or a day of work I *have to get through* as opposed to things I look forward to. All of my hobbies, which are fairly productive, are put on the backburner for these obligations and I don't want to do this anymore. Not to mention, some family issues with my parents' violent divorce have caused me to see things in a different light recently and sort of solidified that I want to do something sort of ""out-of-the-box"" that I know I will enjoy more. At least, if I don't try it now, when can I? I have a lot of self-taught web-development experience and at one point was making around $3k/month from my websites but a lot of that died when I had to do college full-time. I have a plan in place that I think could allow me to make as much or perhaps more, and is more scalable. I have told my family, including my parents, that I won't be taking my job offer and surprisingly they understand and actually want me to try, especially as they know I have not been doing well lately. 

So, on to the actual question. I'm trying to find a place I can move to for a year or so while I pursue this. I have $6k saved for this and will likely make more by the time June rolls around. Also, my father would likely help me if I asked. I'm sure I could borrow a few thousand from him if I need. I'm from a very cold, snowy region of the country. We have great summers, but the winters are long and draining. I have spent the past 4 years in a state with slightly better weather, but similarly draining winters. I'm so done with the cold and the snow, unless it's a place like Denver that embraces the cold and makes it great. 

Here are things that matter to me:
* Warm climate
* I'd prefer a house, and I'd vastly prefer a place with a garage or shed where I can work on cars or motorcycles (part of my business plan as well)
* I'd like to be surrounded by other young people but wouldn't mind an older crowd to an extent (I'm 22). I think the best way to achieve this would be to find a college town, but most college towns don't combine well with my other criteria.
* Somewhere chill
* The ideal place would be a beachy, medium-sized place by the water
* I know most of these things do not combine well

Here are the places I'm considering, in order:
1. St. Petersburg, FL - It looks so awesome, just worried that the population is gonna be really old
2. Denver, CO
3. Austin, TX
4. Anywhere in California that is by the water and *remotely* cheap
5. South/North Carolina (?)

One other question-- I'm really worried about moving somewhere and not knowing anyone. I can always meet people (I'd probably get a job at a bar or something) but part of me is still worried about this even though I've done it before when I moved to college. Any advice?\

I know this is long, but this is a huge decision for me and I'd like to consider everything. If you have any input at all, I would appreciate it greatly!"
5ydkef,1,2017-03-09,Help choosing between two really good job opportunities,RogerfuRabit,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5ydkef/help_choosing_between_two_really_good_job/,"So Im a wildland firefighter for the US forest service. Ive been doing this job for 5 years + 1 more year as an Americorps intern. I’m entering season #6. I’m basically a sergeant/NCO, my role is a ‘squad boss,’ leading 4-6 firefighters during day-to-day forest work and/or out on the fireline. I can be in charge of small forest fires. I want to do this as a career and the next step is to qualify as a ‘single resource’ boss, basically being in charge of a fire engine or 20-man handcrew.

**Here's my conundrum:** I have to choose between two jobs I really really want. I’ve taken one… but I’m about to be offered the other, and I’m really fucking torn.

**Job #1** The job *I have* is a GS05 temp seasonal job in the town Im I currently live in.

* I get some benefits (paid leave, sick leave, and some help with healthcare while Im working, so 6~ months of the year). I have very few rights and can be laid off in a few days notice if some budget snafu occurs or whatnot.
* It's a covetted location to work, a cool mountain town with lots to do in the summer. Ive lived here for the last 6 years... except when I leave to work in the boonies every summer.
* I can come home to my long time girlfriend [soon to be fiance] and 2 dogs every night, except when we camp out on fires or go on 'off forest' assignments, so like 80% of the time Im working (april-october). I can tend my garden. I can go shopping whenever I need to on the way home. My job is basically at the fire department that handles wildfires.
* I'll probably work 6-7 months of the year and make $35k, but only get 5.5 months of full time status which counts for 'time in grade' i.e. my ability to qualify for a GS06. That's kinda lame.
* I'll get good work experience at this job and it's on a new National Forest for me, in an area I want to stay in, so it'll be good networking.
* I'll also be one of six GS05's and it's a big organization, so I'll realistically be like #10 in charge out of 30 firefighters. 
* It's also on a firefighting engine crew, whereas I've only ever worked on handcrews, so it'd be a new experience and good cross training.
* I have committed to this job and will start in a few weeks. If I take this second job, there might be some hurt feels, but they will be short lived as it’s the federal government and everyone knows our hiring is whacky and taking a promotion suddenly is par for the course. For instance, the guy who hired me at this job wont be there this summer as he took a promotion.
* I dont know my bosses really at all. They seem cool, but wildland firefighting attracts some strong personalities and Ive worked for dicks in the past… it makes life hell, as we usually work 6-7 days/week for between June-September… we often live at work.

**Job #2** I have this second job offer waiting in the wings. My old boss is working behind the scenes to offer me a GS05 permanent seasonal position. This in kind of a big deal

* In addition to paid leave, sick leave, I’ll be a fully vetted government employee and get matching retirement, cheap healthcare year-round (and I can basically not pay it in the winter and have that debt taken out of my large summer paychecks), and **a pension** which is based on years of service. I'm 28, i'll have to retire between age 50 and 57. Oh yeah, and if I get hurt while not at work, they cant fire me and have to find a new job that I can do or pay me disability. It’s a pretty sweet benefits package.
* I worked for this boss for 3 summers and really like him and his #2 in charge. I'd be #3 in charge. At times, I'd certainly be #1 in charge.
* It's a sleepy district about 1:40mins away from where I’d live. I'd have to commute weekly. I'd have to pay for housing and live with the mostly single dudes. I've calculated this to be a $2000 expense, plus the untold suffering of not coming home to my GF and dogs about 80% of the time between april and October.
* It's not even in a town and Id have to do strategic grocery shopping.
* Being a perm, I'm guaranteed 6 months of work all of which will count as time in grade. I can also apply for temporary 'details' in the winter and try out random other jobs in the USFS. I’m also due a $0.75 pay raise every 12 months for the rest of my career, in addition to getting promotions etc.
* It's a sleepy district. I love the area, I recreate and hunt there in my free time, but the fire load is light and there's not much to do after work besides shoot guns and drink, both of which I enjoy, but…
* It’s a firefighting handcrew, and leading a handcrew is what Id really like to do someday. It’s a hard qualification to get, usually with a long waiting list to get training opportunities for it, and I’d be prioritized.
* It’s on a different national forest that’s kinda provincial and an old boys club.
* I’d probably make less than Job #1
* If I turn down this job, my old boss would be kinda butthurt, but we’re friends and he’d probably understand.


So looking at these facts, and I can’t list them all. What do you think?

I’m kinda leaning toward Job #1. Coming home every night to the girl and dogs is HUGE. Plus this new forest seems to have a lot of opportunity, for instance they called me today and asked if I could start work early to help the camp ground managers cut down dead trees at all the campgrounds around the district - working full time, 4/10 schedule, starting in 3 weeks… So I’m making commitments now cuz it’s getting closer and I’m starting to really stress out. I’ve turned down 2 other ‘perm’ offers becuz they’d require a 3 hr weekly commute. I think I need to keep with that school of thought and say money/benefits be damned, my personal happiness is more important. Plus, it’s something new, the unknown, and… yeah, that’s exciting. Versus going back to my boys out in the boonies. Fuck… this has got me stressed."

5ydu64,6,2017-03-09,"Me getting frustrated [21 M] with my Bro in-law [33 M], did my sister marry a slob?",Aimer821,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ydu64/me_getting_frustrated_21_m_with_my_bro_inlaw_33_m/,"My sister (25f) is married to a guy (33m) for 2 years now, and I am getting increasingly aggravated by him. I apologize in advance for bad grammar. 

Some backstory. We all live together in the same condo since my dad bought it for college since it is right next to uni. The year my sister got accepted into med school (in the same uni as she did for undergrad), her bf proposed and they got married. I have known him for 8 (though he and my sis only dated for 2 years) years since we all go to the same church and we were chill. I don't really hang out with him since he was in another age group. 

So after they got married I expected my sister to move out but since she got accepted into the med school they decided that he should just move in to save money since he is doing his masters and she is going to school as well. I agreed since he is almost graduating and will find a job. As a part-time job for him he was a delivery driver and worked 4-5 shifts a week (around 20 hours). He was really nice and treated my sister well and would buy me the occasional dinner when I came back from school. We started to play basketball a lot together and we starting hanging out a lot.

Flash forward 2 years. He has dropped out of school, works only 2 shifts a week, plays video games like 4 hours a day, and smokes weed like everyday. If he isn't playing games or working he is taking a nap or just playing basketball at the gym. My sister doesn't realize this because she is at school or the hospital doing her rounds most of the time. I wash all the dishes I use but he doesn't so every couple days there is a fat pile of dishes in the sink that aren't mine but I clean anyways because I don't want my sister to see it. I don't tell her about this since she is so busy with school and she would just get stressed out. My sister caught him smoking weed and got upset and he agreed to quit but after a couple weeks he goes and lights up a joint when shes out of the house.

So during all this time, my mom was paying for everything. She pays for the tuition, HOA fee, our car, gives us allowance every month for food/gas, and our insurance/medical expenses. Money isn't tight but my mom should be using that money on herself. I got guilty for this so I started working as a server and told her to not give me any more allowance and I started paying for half the HOA/utility bills and my phone/insurance expenses. I basically pay for everything a normal person pays for except for rent (lmao). However, my sister/brother-in-law does not pay for HOA and utilities and my parents do. 

Anyways, I'm getting increasingly frustrated because I feel like he is leaching off my parents money and I have no way of telling them or my sister this without causing a shit ton of drama. I am graduating this year but my parents don't want me to move out of the condo even though I have a well-paying local internship waiting for me during this summer. I really hate when people ask me why I live with my sister and brother in law because it really should be the other way around. My parents bought this place for school, which I am in and he is not. As much as I hate his laziness, he is still a nice person and I don't want to make it awkward around the condo. At most, I will have to live with them for one more year until my sister finds out where she is going for her fellowship. However, I don't know if I can take another year of this. 

Do you guys have any suggestions of what I can do to make him realize that he needs to start contributing? Or another completely different suggestion? Thanks...

  **tl;dr**: Brother-in-law marries my sister, we all live together, and he seemed like a decent person in the beginning. In the span of 2 years, he is progressively becoming more and more lazy and me more and more angry because of this. How do I deal with this..."
5ydv1k,5,2017-03-09,My [26 F] with my LDR boyfriend [30 M] of 1.5 years. He is angry at me because his FB messenger notifications didn't pop up on my phone and I didn't respond to him in time.,ldrthrowaway26f,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ydv1k/my_26_f_with_my_ldr_boyfriend_30_m_of_15_years_he/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My boyfriend (well, ex now. Let's call him Peter) have been together for about 1.5 years.  I moved a few states away to start grad school, and I am staying with my family who lives here.  He and I have very busy schedules.  I am almost certain that was one factor that killed our relationship.

I'm in the process of pursuing 2 master's.  I have class from 3-9pm from Monday to Thursday, and I often come up to school early to do projects/homework/presentations, etc.  I do my internship from 8-5 on Fridays and Saturdays.  Sundays are usually the days I spend time with my family.

His schedule, however, has been conflicting with mine.  He's always had a full time job working from 3-11pm.  He recently took on another part time job that has him work 11-7am.  So really, we have a few hours to chat at night, when he isn't working his part time job.

So, I got a new phone a few days ago and apparently, I didn't know that I had to set certain settings for FB messenger's notifications to show up (which caused all the problems).  FB messenger is what we use to communicate.  For what it's worth, we aren't the type to call each other frequently, and he has an old phone which neither of the cameras work for video calls.  Given the nature of my week, I've been communicating with people through chatting.

I've been having a week full of midterms and presentations that I have only been able to talk to him sporadically throughout the day.  All the issues between Peter and me started Monday night.  I messaged him on FB a little before 3pm saying I hope he has a good night at work.  I got done with my exams at 9, took a 30 min drive home, showered, and go to bed because I was really exhausted.  I didn't get any FB notifications, so I assumed he was just really busy with work.  I remember falling asleep around 11pm.  I then got a normal text message (SMS) from him that wakes me up at 6am the next morning.  He asks me if I wasn't getting his FB messages.  I told him no, I didn't see any notifications pop up.  I check my FB messages and saw that he messaged me at 11:30 pm, 3am, and 6am (basically, when I was showering or sleeping).  He began giving me the cold shoulder treatment since then.

On Tuesday, I took another midterm and got home the same time as Monday night (9:30pm).  I shot a FB message to Peter right when I got home, saying I miss him &amp; asking him how work was.  I had a group presentation the next day, so I was spending my night collaborating with my classmates through WhatsApp (not all my teammates have FB, and we find it faster than normal texting).  I periodically checked my FB messages to see if I had gotten anything from Peter, which I hadn't.  I remember that I took a break from it around midnight to brush my teeth.  Peter responded to my FB message during that time.  I didn't get back to him immediately.  Three minutes later, he sends me a normal text  (SMS) saying, ""You must be ignoring me again, huh?""  This turned into an argument that kept me up until 3am.  He admitted to me that he downloaded all the chat apps he could think of and was able to see that I was on WhatsApp a few minutes before he sent me a message on FB.  He also accused me of cheating because he saw I had accounts on Viber and Kik, neither of which I've used for a LONG time.  I kept explaining to him that I was only working with my classmates through WhatsApp.  When he wasn't having any of my explanation and kept accusing me of cheating, I said I was calling it a night because I needed to wake up early to study for my midterms for Wednesday, that I will be working on a presentation with other classmates in person after my exams, that we needed to cool off, that I hope he sleeps well after work.

Tonight was the night I broke up with him.  I FB messaged him at 9am saying that I hoped he had a good day.  Again, I checked periodically to see if he left me any messages.  I take my first midterm at 3 and I get done at around 5.  I checked my FB messages and saw that he got back to me at 4:30, wishing me a good day as well.  I messaged him back right after my first exam to thank him and inform him that I was about to take my second exam, then went right to some last minute cramming.  I got done with that exam at around 8:30, then I went straight to meet up with my presentation group.  That lasted until a little before 10pm.  I messaged Peter as soon as I left school to say that my midterms went okay.  He asked me if I just got done, and I told him no, I got done with my midterms at 8:30 and went straight to meet up with my group.  Basically, he blows up at me saying that I didn't have the courtesy to text him when I was done with my exams and that it only takes a couple of seconds for me to do so.  Long story short, it turned into me explaining every detail of my day, him saying I should just go hang with my ""c-cksucker friends,"" and him calling me a ""guilty scandalous b-tch.""  After he cursed me out, I immediately decided I wasn't going to have it and called it off.  Why am I regretting it now?

This all sucks because for some reason, I feel like somehow I was in the wrong.  Maybe I should have been more diligent Monday night when he messaged me while I was still awake.  I could have at least wished him good night.  I had planned to see him during Spring Break this coming week, and it sucks that my plans have changed so abruptly.  I really do care about him and I am afraid of losing him.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend got mad at me for accidentally not responding to him on FB messenger Monday night (I forgot to change some notification settings), chatting with classmates on WhatsApp on Tuesday night, and basically not texting him right after getting done with my exams Wednesday night.  He cursed me out, I broke up with him, and somehow I think it's my fault.

Last CoderRadio (CR 247), Mike asked if you guys sounded sane to college kids.
I wanted to respond to that from my personal perspective.
In short, I feel the same way you do.
The longer version is a bit of a rant, but this topic really gets me.

I'm studying Computer Science right now.
My college offers four specializations after the first year: Media Technology, Business Intelligence, Software Engineering and Forensic IT.
When I started college, I had a three year old Acer that ran Windows 7 on 8 gigs of ram.
Throughout the first year, I had to run Photoshop, Eclipse / Intellij, VMs, and some databases (mostly Postgres).
Now, my laptop wasn't fast, but it could handle the workload, for about six months on Windows, and after that (thanks to LAS) I got another five months or so out of it by installing Linux (specifically Netrunner at the time).
At the start of my second year, I badly needed a new laptop.

Now, I chose software engineering as my specialization.
This mostly meant that I had to be able to run IDEs, databases and some VMs.
Other specializations have similar workflows, but exchange running databases for running Photoshop.
You get the point.

My parents were able to help financially if needed, so I had some decent options for laptops.
CPU-wise, most of them had an i5.
Tragically, in my price range, which was around €700/€800 , they also had 4 or 6 GB of ram.
If I wanted 8GB or more, the average price would be €1000 or more (believe me, I looked for cheaper laptops than that, I really did).

I felt a bit stuck, since the available options were not at all appealing.
Even under Linux, running Intellij along with perhaps some college videos and postgres, 6GB did not feel as enough ram.
Maybe 8GB would have, but where do I start my VMs then.
So this is where I compromised, which is the reason I am typing this right now.

I decided to buy a Chromebook (Acer C720P) and run it with Crouton.
Later I hacked it to install Arch, which has not seen a reinstall now, almost two years later, and is still my trusty companion for working mobile.
I still had 4GB of ram to work with, an underpowered CPU, and 32GB of ssd storage, but it costed me €270.
Thanks to you guys, I had workarounds:
- VMs &gt; start a DigitalOcean droplet
- IDEs &gt; only have one installed at all times, replace if needed (Jetbrains all the things)
- IDEs alternative &gt; I learned to work lightweight with vim and bash
- Databases &gt; start a DigitalOcean droplet
- Storage &gt; mostly only write code and push it to bitbucket, remove projects locally and clone them when needed
This worked back then, and still does.
I think I have spent around €200 on droplets in two years.
I saved around €300 in total in the end.

My situation is far from unique.
I know quite some students who are starting their first or second year of college, asking me for what laptop they should buy.
Even now, €800 gets you around 8GB of ram with Windows 10.
From what I have seen, W10 eats something like 4GB already, leaving you with not much to work with.
My recommendations usually are: get more money and buy either a macbook or an ultrabook with Windows, or buy a laptop with the money you have and install Linux (gets you around 2GB more to work with), where I'll help if you get stuck (I have to note, this is the most popular option).
No matter what specialization you're in, you are going to need the horsepower.

Perhaps CS students are somewhat demanding of laptops, but still I feel like you guys make a fair point.
8GB of ram is a bare minimum, considering the need to run IDEs, VMs and the like.
Even so, I know people who study psychology or communication, and simply want to run Word along with some Youtube.
It is frustratingly slow on W10 + 4GB.
They think it is normal to grab a drink and wait for Word to boot (""it's not that bad, I wanted a drink anyway"").
Students are not a rich bunch of people, and recommending a laptop makes that painfully obvious.
I haven't even started about needing to purchase docks.

So yes, you guys do sound sane to me.
There are use cases for more powerful laptops, and there certainly is a demand for it.
The fact that you have to drop around €1100/€1400 to get a reasonably powerful one frustrates me to no end.
Most people just get what they can afford, which usually comes down to an underpowered laptop, where I see 8GB and some decent storage as a minimum.
It's better nowadays, but I feel like it is still hard to find a good laptop.

Thanks for reading, keep up the great show!

PS. I know Chris likes hearing how sponsors helps listeners; as I mentioned, I use DigitalOcean extensively, saving my ass a bunch of times (10 minutes before presentation and no server, started a droplet, cloned the repo, still ready for prime time).
I am learning at Linux Academy to get LPIC-1 certified (almost there), and just the fact that I'm learning for it helped me land my current internship, and before that a parttime job.

Feel like (very minor) health issues are affecting my performance, how should I tell him?",mistermister99,grad_school,https://www.reddit.com/r/grad_school/comments/5yef9x/internship_update_making_progress_pi_is_still/,"Background: So earlier i posted about my tough time in the lab. The advice that r/gradschool gave was that I should just push forward - my PI was making me feel the way I would normally feel in grad school. I also made some organizational mistakes (accidentally sent an email to the entire lab group instead of him, asked him to sift through folders for files instead of putting my updates in an easily accessible document [i immediately corrected this). Also he wasn't able to properly explain how he wanted me plot some data and ended up sending an up with part of it in all caps (""JUST ONE FIGURE PER SLIDE""). 

This made sense, so I pushed on. I made progress and I am far ahead of schedule (halfway through my internship and nearly finished the main project objective that he gave me at the beginning - although I'm starting to think that he gave me a really easy task because he wasn't sure how capable I was and set the bar really low). Despite my updates, he hasn't even read any of them (I regularly post them on a google drive. At first this seemed understandable because he was in the heat of grant season, which I understand is stressful and takes lots of time. 

I thought most of his behavior was due to his weird personality (hypernerd with stereotypical antisocial characteristics) but two things are starting to make me think he just doesn't like me:

- The way he talks to another undergrad intern who started the same time as me and is only a week ahead of me in terms of progress. He jokes around and is nice to him and laughs with him. He is apathetic and irritated when he talks to me. (Granted, he does not speak English as a first language and the other student is the same nationality as him so I guess that makes them chummy but stillllll. He's reallllyyy nice to him and kind of a dick to me).


- He asked me quickly for an update and didn't understand me and then (nearly) yelled at me in front of everyone that I cannot keep putting files in folders on the Drive as he does not have the time to go through them. I told him I was in the process of preparing the updated report and he reverted back to his apathetic self, ""Ok. I will expect your email."" It was really embarrasing being spoken to very sternly in front of everyone else. It made me feel quite incompetent.

- I didn't sleep well the previous night and came to the lab really late. I said Hi to him and he just looked at me. As if I was the essence of disappointment and a general piece of shit. He did not say Hi back. I haven't told him that my sleep issues are because of some health reasons partly because I don't want to be even more of a burden than I already am and my ""health problem"" is a sleep disorder - not really something that generates empathy among hardworking people. 


My question: I am not sure whether or not I am just reading too much into his odd tendencies or if he really doesn't like me. I want to ask him but am afraid that my plan will backfire as I will be effectively asking ""Why don't you tell me I'm pretty?!?!"""

Currently I am an intern as a Systems administrator, but it is rather boring, because I can't express myself creatively and the job is quite menial. Plus I can't stand the 9-to-5 work hours day in and day out.
I have an opportunity to participate in a project related to Data Security which is the field I ultimately want to work in. It is in a company which does consultation in Data and IT security in general. That could mean work with people, and it could mean 8 hours of paperwork. I don't know.
The problem is that I don't know what that project entails. It might be this same boring menial stuff I am doing currently.

A little about myself:

- I'm a college student about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science this summer

- I have little to no experience in game development

- I have experience mainly in C++, C, C#, Python, and Java languages

- Currently working as an intern doing some web development in ASP.NET

- Been passionate about video games my whole life (Chose computer science major to pursue game development)

My plan was to learn a great deal of game development via Unreal Engine independently so that when I graduate, I could hopefully work for a major game developer. Sadly, I didn't foresee the level of stress that I would be under, as well as the extremely difficult challenges that I would have to overcome as a student. Also, every time I tried to sit down and start learning the basics of game development in Unreal, I would get extremely overwhelmed and give up right away. I want to make another attempt, but definitely follow through with it because I can't see myself being a web developer the rest of my life...May y'all offer me some tips on how I should approach this process? In other words, what should I go about learning first? As a beginner, will I need to worry about model design using a software like 3DS Max? I would just really appreciate some advice from anyone who is willing to share their personal experiences.
 
Thank you,

At the start of september I was selected for a 1-year long training program to be molded into a Java Enterprise Edition developer.
There were around 75 applications and only 10 were selected. 
At the end of May we will have finished the course completely in which we have been given a firm understanding of Java.
We have been working together for 8 hours every day since the beginning of september.
In that time we have seen a fair bit of Java and the optimal design patterns needed for OO programming.
We have also had multiple lessons on HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML, JUnit, SQL, and starting next week we will start with JPA with Hibernate and following that we will finish the course with lessons on Spring. We will then combine all these practices by making a fully functional bank application (we will be making this with the entire group)

Now the reason that I am saying this, do you think its possible for me to receive an internship? Or is it out of the ordinary for someone without a degree to apply for this? 
We are already being approached by companies who want to recruit us (locally) with a fulltime offer for a junior development position when we finish this course.

Any ideas on how to approach this? Any sites I should check out to apply on? 
Since its probably not common it's quite overwhelming and I'm having trouble finding out where to apply to.
Thanks in advance."
5yethk,4,2017-03-09,How should I invest my free time? (Which opportunity to choose?),EggerChristian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5yethk/how_should_i_invest_my_free_time_which/,"As the title states, I have a problem to decide which university/career related opportunity to choose.

First of all, some context: I am a 2nd Semester computer science student in a somewhat (QS Ranking for CS: 51-100) good university. My grades are excellent and now that I got used to the university life, I find that I have quite a lot of free time.

So that is why I am trying to make use of that time.
Here are my current options to choose from:

a) Working part-time (12 hours/week) in the R&amp;D department in a rather unknown but very successful tech company. I have previously done two summer-time internships there (same position, same company) and have always learned a lot + was mentored very well.

b) Becoming a Tutor at my university. A tutor is basically supporting the team of a specific institute. (Correcting tests, helping students taking courses at that institute, assisting other members of the institute etc.)

c) Two fellow students and I are currently working on an app that seems to have rather good chances to be actually released by the end of summer. (We already have an appointment with an investor)


Taking option a) or b) wouldnt end c) but just limit the effort that i could put into our app by about 70%.

So which one of the above options would you say is best? (And would look best on a resume) Which one would impress companies like Google, Facebook etc. the most?

TLDR: should I work part-time as a software developer intern, become a helping hand at my university or put 100% of my time into an app that im working on currently?

5yexvu,33,2017-03-09,A year and change (and what a change!),Montis_Rex,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5yexvu/a_year_and_change_and_what_a_change/,"I missed posting on my soberversary (though my girl and I did have an awesome steak dinner with homemade ginger sodas to celebrate) but I just wanted to post a few of the accomplishments/changes I've had this year, none of which would have happened if I'd still been drinking.

I got into grad school, in a top ten program! AND I got a 4.0 my first semester. I barely managed not to fail my last few semesters of undergrad because I was depressed and drunk.

 I've never had to call into my job or internship because of a hangover. 

I've started taking fitness more seriously, and have been going to the gym 3 days a week. Turns out heavy lifting really helps my anxiety (and so does not drinking)

I know a lot of people lose weight when they quit. That wasn't the case for me, because I replaced booze with a lot of sugar and I still have a somewhat unhealthy relationship with food. But sobriety is allowing me to work thru that in ways I couldn't drunk, and the past few months I've been able to (mostly) stick to a healthy diet.

It turns out, I'm a morning person. No wonder I never got anything done when I spent my most productive hours miserably hungover.

I have a much better relationship with my girlfriend. We never fight any more, I'm never a drunk jerkass. I remember when we have sex. I'm more present. She's been incredibly supportive, we have a fridge full of fancy homemade syrups so I can make a soda that feels like mixing a drink when I get cravings (bonus: way less sugar/calories than regular soda!) 

On the gross side: no more booze poos! it took a while for my body to get regular again but this has been one of my favorite changes.

I'm so much happier. I'm less anxious. I laugh all the time. It's hard to describe, but I feel somehow lighter now. 

I had a really good support system. The first few months I checked here every day, usually many times. Any time I wanted a drink I'd scroll this sub. I use it less now but I still drop in at least once a week and keep it on my front page.  My girlfriend and family have also been supportive. I have one good friend who got sober a few months before me, she was really an inspiration and a huge help, because she knew exactly what I was going through. Our relationship used to be just drinking and it's so much cooler now.

Even my best bud who is super into home brew (I used to help all the time, of course) has been nothing but supportive. I have had a few friends try to get me to drink but recently they've seemed to realize this is for real.

Thanks for everything guys! And to everyone struggling in those first few months, for me the first 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months were the worst. I won't say it's been smooth sailing since then but it's been a lot better. It's worth it.

5yf9zv,6,2017-03-09,How do my [M23] fiancee [F22] and I deal with the fact that she might have to turn down two well paying entry level ICU positions at Level 1 trauma centers to move in with me.,Robpocalypse,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/5yf9zv/how_do_my_m23_fiancee_f22_and_i_deal_with_the/,"I'm reaching out to you guys because I feel really guilty about it, and I don't know how to handle this. I graduated college last year with a STEM degree and not many job offers, but I ended up with a decent paying position at a company in Cleveland, OH ~3 hours away from where we grew up and went to college at in central Pennsylvania. I ended up now loving my job and I see it turning into a great career as far as pay and work experience, and the plan was always that when my fiancee finished up her BSN this May she would move out here with me. She is at the top of her class in school, and her passion is the ICU where she has over 500 hours of clinical experience in between an internship and preceptorship. She is kicking ass.

Now the problem is that she has already been offered entry level ICU positions paying ~$32/hour at two different hospitals that she has had clinical experiences at in the same area that we are from. One of them she would be working with one of her professors that has been a great mentor and teacher to her. Now she was ecstatic about getting these offers, but we've both assumed that she would be able to find equally competitive offers while applying to hospitals near me because of the sheer number of hospitals and population in the Cleveland/Akron area.

No such luck. I've lost count of how many different positions that she's applied to online, but they've all been turned down. We are assuming it's because she's a new graduate. The only interview that she's gotten so far is a phone interview with a Cleveland Clinic branch hospital for their ICU which isn't even a rated trauma center and it would start at $6 less per hour than her other offers. She was invited to go to the hospital for an in person interview and an opportunity to shadow so we are waiting to judge until she actually gets to check out the unit, but compared to her other offers this just seems like such a step down from what she could have and what she is passionate about. She is also going to attend an open interview session with MetroHealth hospitals in Cleveland and hope that by talking to someone in person she can get where she wants to be.

Are we naive in thinking that she'll be able to find an entry level position here comparable to the ones that she's been offered? And why is that? I just can't wrap my head around it because she has all of the credentials that she could need.

I feel super guilty about it because she is the motivated, career focused one in our relationship. I had poor grades in school and I feel like I lucked into the great position that I'm in based on personality and the fact that I went to a big name school. She is the passionate one and I hate thinking that she'll have to take a lesser position than I think she deserves doing something that she doesn't love. Because critical care is really the only nursing field that she has found that she has any interest in.

Now neither of us blame each other for anything, and we've talked about her taking the dream position that she's been offered to get the experience and just going another year without living together but we've decided that isn't something that we want to do.

So where do we go from here? I know that a lot of people would probably kill to be in the position that we are, and typing this out it does seem very ""First World Problemy"". But she has worked her ass off in school and been very successful and her having to settle for a lesser position and something that she really doesn't want to do just breaks my heart.

Sorry for the book, but this has been very heavy on my heart and I wanted to reach out to someone for help. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this."

5yfkrt,1,2017-03-09,Drop out of college to travel ?,Yoshiwhut420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5yfkrt/drop_out_of_college_to_travel/,"Hey guys, I don't have many people to share my ideas with so please give me some input on whether this is a good/realistic plan or not.

I'm going to try and be as concise as possible. Well i'm currently 24 and in community college and i am not enjoying it at all. Not only did I screw up my GPA when i was younger, but i have heard that a college degree by itself is pretty useless if you do not also network/internship along with it. This idea does not sit well with me because I have very bad social skills which makes it difficult to make friends. Not only that, but it is hard for me to connect with kids who don't share similar interests with me. I know you can say that its my responsibility to go out and initiate and that is correct, but out of all these years nobody has tried to network with me either since it goes both ways. i think this has something to do with the fact im gay (bisexual) in a very conservative environment (Texas).

So I was pretty bummed that i can spend years and years obtaining a degree only to be told that i ""didn't have experience"" or that i couldn't get my resume read because i didn't know someone to vouch for me at a company. I think both of these scenarios are very possible. Even internships have requirements. Ive came to the conclusion that i cannot compete in the job market and have became pretty suicidal. I feel that 'time' is the most valuable thing in my life, and i am unwilling to invest it in a degree that doesn't guarantee more than a mediocre soul crushing 9-5 lifestyle that i would probably kill myself in anyways. 

Mid last year I was looking around reddit and discovered backpacking around the world. My logic is that since i am not enjoying college, i would never be motivated at it so ill be wasting my time and not getting much out of it. However, I love the idea of traveling and seeing different cultures around the world, even at the expense of comfort. I live a very comfortable lifestyle right now but isn't worth it if i'm this unhappy and suicidal. I figured before i kill myself i might as well try and travel the world and see what comes out of it, maybe i can even find a job and make a living somewhere and never have to come back home! Worst case scenario, if things still don't work out and I cant figure anything out after traveling, then i can kill myself anyways but at least i would have tried to make things better. Remember, the reason i'm so scared to invest so much time into school for a piece of paper is because TIME is incredibly valuable and a degree does not seem to guarantee anything by itself. My biggest regret would be to graduate and not find work while losing 4-6 years of my life for nothing. Relationships, Travel and time are probably the things I value the most way above money.

Finally, I'm sure a lot of you are going to suggest getting help for my ""clinical depression"". However , i do not believe i have clinical depression although i am diagnosed with it. The reason is because if I had clinical depression, whenever something exciting happens (scored a date, seeing a good friend in a long time, discovered something interesting... etc.) I would still be depressed regardless of circumstances. I feel it is circumstantial and dependent on my environment. My doctors disagree and kept shoving meds down me, and i stopped taking them over a year ago. Also, the fact that I had been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and bipolar without ANY tests done whatsoever is very suspicious to me. Asking me how i ""feel"" and how my day went is not a very accurate way to determine a mental illness.

 I herd life is too short to do things just for the money. I'd rather be poor and uncomfortable but happy.

Sorry for the rant, thank you if you took the time to read this, but what do you think i should do in this situation? stay in school? if so why? Travel the world? For how long? I really appreciate yalls responses and would like to get opinions of other people instead of just my own, maybe yall know something that I don't. Thanks!

** I have also done a lot of research to find these answers on my own and they are contradicting ( college is worth it/ college is worthless,   Traveling now it will change your life/ You should wait till you get a career to travel ,   Get this degree/ get that degree  etc...) It seems there is no clear answer."

I posted [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5wd4xx/internship_compensation_help_xpost_r_internships/) asking about how to ask about internship compensation. 

To give a TLDR: At the internship interview with a global company, both interviewers stated they absolutely wanted me and were going to check on the hour restrictions for interns at their company and would get me onboarded ASAP (which they are not 100% sure how long it would take). COmmenters said basically once I received a formal offer we would talk compensation.

As I had interviewed 2/22, I decided to email the admin on 2/27 asking if there had been any update on the above-mentioned items and an hour later the recruiter emailed me stating "" I wanted to let you know we’re working on some final internal details before make the official offer and get the background started"". 

I asked the recruiter on 3/2 what kind of timeline I should expect from this process and he said ""It should not take much longer, my worst estimate is 3 weeks but I know the team is excited about having you on board so they’re pushing to move forward. I hope to have better news next week but it really could be 1-3 weeks"".

Today makes a week since that email. Should I reach out to him again just to check in? On one hand I do not want to harass him, but on the other I want to make sure they know I am still interested and keep the process moving forward, instead of stalling.

My situation is that after university and getting my A+ is that I don't really want to be stuck in ""Help Desk"". I was wondering how hard it is, or what kind of time frame, it would be to get the N+ right after I get my A+. Does the information carry over making it an easy transition?

for those that have gotten their A+ then went right for the N+, can you share your experience and how you did it?

5yfzj4,15,2017-03-09,What to expect/demand from your college career services,HackVT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5yfzj4/what_to_expectdemand_from_your_college_career/,"All
I want to help you get some help from your career services centers and to leverage them. Here are some ideas of mine on what you should demand regardless of the size of your college or school , full or part time. 

Here's a quick list that you should get out of or at least start demanding that your career services start doing. 

**1. Resume review**

At a minimum they should be looking at and reviewing your resume for the most basic formatting and grammatical issues.  It's up to you to go and see them but if you are making the time to get there use them to review what you have and to provide you examples. 

*What you should not get: a big fat resume book with samples and that's it.* 

**2. Mock interviews**

Again, this requires very little from them just to have you answer some interview questions and get some feedback. Even if you get outside HR people asking you fit questions it will be great for you to get done. And for your mock interview wear the clothes you will wear for a real interview. 

*What you should not get: paired up with someone not in your industry or who talks the whole time.*

**3. Whiteboarding groups**

Technical interviewing and whiteboarding sucks but it's a core aspect of what we have to do. Getting some students to ask you questions and provide some pizzas should be something that they can organize to occur. Even if you get paired up with a peer who can time you and look at your answers. 

*What you should not get: No help. This is really tantamount to being able to deal well in a situation where you will be challenged.*

**4. Internship ideas/local company connections**

I write this from the least second lowest populated state in the US -- local companies are the lifes blood of the career centers. Yes Big 4 are great but more students in their early collegiate years will be able to work during the school year for local small shops. The ability for these firms to come to a career fair is really important. If you see that there are companies missing that are local, demand that they work on getting them to the event. Conversely, if there are other career fairs at other schools that may have a larger draw, they should work to arrange transport or at least get you the details so you can get there. 

*What you should not get: Interviews to just government or state agencies. There are places that you can intern at and they should be small. Additionally, make sure that they aren't gouging employers to show up there.*

**5. Basic guidance for budgets during and after school**

Again, this can happen in probably an hour but having a budget becomes super important once you graduate. Having your finances in line is extremely important. The earlier they tackle this with you the better or you can learn on your own. I have seen so many new and expensive cars in the parking lot driven by new hires that it's staggering. 

*What you should not get: just getting dumped off by your parents and told to learn from the experiences of college. College is a safe space, you are there to learn and to fail gently. Making financial mistakes early can have long term impacts that are significant down the line.*

  To start off, I am currently a junior in college and have an internship lined up for the summer.  However, this puts a slight pressure on me, because the way the company described the internship is that you'll have a job lined up for you at the end as long as you don't truly mess up.  Thus, a lot of thoughts pop up into my head wondering if I should just work at the company I intern for this summer, or take the risk of just applying to full-time jobs.  

  I know I'm probably looking too far into the future with this, but I would just love some brutal honesty of how *far* I can go I guess.  I put a link to my resume below, and I'm excited to hear what you guys have to say.  

**Thanks!**

An old friend that graduated 2 years ago is in the digital marketing business in fact, he and a partner own their own company.

 I contacted the guy, let's call him Bruno, to make him an offer. He said he was really busy but that he could fit in a call with me. I asked that we meet face to face and he obliged , after some finessing on my part.

My background is in computer programming and I want some sort of position in his company. An internship would be ideal. I have a lot to offer, I'm ambitious and I know I can reach my goals 

I'm a good talker,I can get my ideas across pretty easily but I honestly don't know what to say and how so say it. 

How do I get someone to invest in me their most valuable asset, time? What are things that you mentors look for in a mentee? What are things that scare you away? I need some serious guidance because this internship could lead so much. 

I do not want to mess it up.

I need it because I live in Texas and I plan on living in Austin for an internship this summer, and just to use for at least the next 5 years with as minimal problems as possible (so reliable and a low problem car is a necessity). I'm a big dude, so I need plenty of leg space where possible (6'3"", about 275 lbs). I'll be moving away from my college town soon so something that can carry an apartments worth of crap would be nice, or at least be able to pull a small uhaul trailer.

I've been really liking the Jeep Grand Cherokees lately and have had my eye on a few on craigslist, but haven't made a move to buy one yet. Dodge Chargers also catch my eye quite often, so something along those lines would be preferred, but I'll take any suggestions since I know jack squat about cars. Another on is a Ford Escape.
I would like it to be as new as possible, but I would heavily prefer a clean title and as low mileage as possible, I know these are specifics that I'll have to find myself, but I may as well throw it in.

I live in the Dallas are and that is where I'll be ultimately making my purchase if location helps at all.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice you guys have to offer!

**Preferred Specs:**

 * 4-door
 * Automatic
 * Not gas guzzler/at least ~18 mpg
 * big enough for guy of my size + friends
 * an SUV or mid-size is preferable, but open to sedans
 * will be purchasing in the Dallas area because that's where I live"

My worries of accepting the 8 month term is that although I will be able to do more meaningful work, when I come back to school, I won't do as well.

5yh439,8,2017-03-09,Rede von Vizekanzler Anaxastron zur Aktivität,Gelbstern,MBundestag,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBundestag/comments/5yh439/rede_von_vizekanzler_anaxastron_zur_aktivität/,"[Anwesend im Plenarsaal: 14 Abgeordnete, davon 8 schlafend, 1 auf dem Tisch liegender Geschäftsführer mit Burnout, 1 Reporter (nach 10 Monaten Urlaub mal wieder da), keine Besucher, keine Lobbyisten, 3,7 Tonnen Staub]

Sehr geehrte Abgeordnete, sehr geehrter Geschäftsführer, sehr geehrter Besucher des Modellbundestages,

Bevor ich zum Inhalt komme: Diese Rede ist innerhalb der letzten drei Wochen entstanden. Durch den Artikel der Zeitung „Die Presse“ [der Reporter wird trotz Urlaubsbräune rot und grinst verlegen], die Vorschläge von /u/Venedig für dieses Subreddit und den Antrag von /u/Raptor-Eins-Null gewann das Thema an Dringlichkeit und ich habe nun die Rede überarbeitet und fertiggestellt.

Allgemein ist hier momentan die Stimmung, dass der MBundestag so nicht funktioniert. Es werden Vorschläge für einen radikalen Neuanfang gemacht, mit Auflösung des Bundestages und neuer Verfassung oder mit völlig anderen, größeren Parteien. Sie zielen darauf ab, das System zu verändern, sodass es funktioniert. Der Antrag, über den am Wochenende abgestimmt wird, beginnt mit dem Satz: „Der Bundestag erkennt mit der Moderationsleitung an, dass die 1. Republik durch diverse Fehler gescheitert ist.“ Dieser Feststellung würde ich gerne widersprechen. Selbstverständlich ist nicht alles am aktuellen System ideal, und einige Verbesserungen wie einen kürzeren Gesetzgebungsprozess oder ein Bundespräsident, der dem Geschäftsführer Arbeit abnimmt, sind bestimmt sinnvoll. Aber als Fehler kann man den aktuellen Gesetzgebungsprozess trotzdem nicht bezeichnen, denn dafür müsste je etwas grundsätzlich falsch sein und nicht nur etwas umständlich. Und auch sonst wüsste ich nicht, was wir groß falsch gemacht haben. Das sage ich nicht, weil ich keine Fehler eingestehen möchte, sondern weil ich wirklich denke, dass das aktuelle System grundsätzlich gut so ist. [/u/dalvikim: „Ohhh... jetzt hätten wir endlich mal ein System umstürzen können!“]

Bevor man die erste Republik einfach beerdigt, um den MBundestag neu zu gründen, müsste man sich erst einmal überlegen, was man anders machen möchte und wie das die aktuellen Probleme löst. Der einzige große Vorschlag bisher ist ein neues Parteiensystem, bei dem es weniger, aber dafür größere Parteien gibt, mit dem Ziel einer größeren Rivalität zwischen den übrigen Parteien. Die bisherigen Parteien wären dann eher Flügel innerhalb der großen. Allerdings weiß ich nicht, was daran so anders wäre, dass der MBundestag dann funktionieren würde. Schließlich ist es völlig egal, welcher Partei inaktive Mitglieder angehören.

Ich glaube, das Problem ist viel banaler. Es ist unser innerer Schweinehund. [/u/sdfghs: „Ein Schweinehund? Ha! Da war doch Gentechnik im Spiel!“ /u/Sinnaj63: „Quatsch, er meint dich, du Hobbymutant!“] Wir brauchen nicht dem Bundestagssystem die Schuld für die Missstände geben, wenn die meisten Mitglieder selbst verantwortlich sind. Würden wir uns nämlich einen Ruck geben und uns einfach die Zeit nehmen zu diskutieren und Gesetze zu schreiben, würde die Bude hier laufen. Aber wir müssen uns nichts vorhaben, fehlende Motivation, Faulheit und langes Aufschieben sind sehr normale Probleme der Menschen. Auch diese Rede hätte ich am ersten Tag gleich fertig machen können statt nach dem ersten Absatz Pause zu machen, um den Rest wann anders zu erledigen. [Ein Abgeordneter der CDU wacht auf, ruft leise „Faulpelz! Buuuuh!“ und schläft wieder ein] Man muss aber dazu sagen, dass der momentane Zustand auch nicht dazu einlädt, sich reinzuhängen. Viele machen nichts, und für die wenigen bleibt viel Arbeit, was dazu führt, dass sie fliehen oder so viel zu tun haben, dass die Kraft irgendwann aus ist. Unser Geschäftsführer ist dafür ein Beispiel. An dieser Stelle möchte ich um einen Applaus für /u/Raptor-Eins-Null bitten – keiner tut mehr dafür, dass der Modellbundestag läuft, als er. 

Auch wenn ich weit weniger als Raptor mache, versuche ich auch, dass im Modellbundestag Leben ist und ich glaube, ich kann von mir behaupten, mehr Gesetze als der Durchschnitt geschrieben zu haben. Vor der letzten Wahl bin ich aber zur Erkenntnis gekommen, dass die Version des MBundestages, die entspannt wäre und Spaß machen würde, unerreichbar ist. Gedankenexperiment: [/u/Sinnaj zeigt seinem Nachbarn ein Bild von einem Panda in Denkerpose, /u/i_ruined_scotland spielt auf seinem Handy sphärische Klänge ab] Jeder Minister hat zwei Staatssekretäre, die ihn unterstützen, pro Woche kommen drei bis fünf Gesetze raus, im Parlament sitzen 50 Abgeordnete, und wer keinen Sitz bekommen hat, beteiligt sich an Debatten, parteiinternen Positionsdiskussionen oder schreibt für die Zeitung. Diese Version hört sich im ersten Moment nach viel Arbeit an, aber in Wahrheit wäre es für den einzelnen viel weniger zu tun. [/u/Gelbstern: „Viel weniger zu tun? Hast du mal an mich gedacht?!?“] Ok, bis auf den Bundestagspräsidenten vielleicht. Unter diesen Umständen würde es reichen, sich über die Woche verteilt eine Stunde Zeit zu nehmen und einmal im Monat selber etwas größeres wie ein Gesetz, ein Programm oder einen Artikel zu erstellen. Eigentlich nicht zu viel verlangt für ein Internetforum, aber wir werden leider trotzdem nie so viele Mitglieder bekommen. Und selbst wenn, bezweifle ich, dass jeder seinen Beitrag bringen würde. 

Da weder ein solcher MBundestag, noch einer verkleinerte Version dessen erreichbar ist, wäre ich dafür, den Modellbundestag zu schließen. Aber nicht einfach zu begraben, sondern sich diese Legislaturperiode noch richtig reinzuhängen, um das Ganze geordnet abzuschließen. Wie wärs, wenn die Regierung dieses Mal den Koalitionsvertrag ganz abarbeitet? Und die Opposition, die in dieser Hinsicht bisher grandios versagt hat, nicht nur bis zur nächsten Wahl wartet und die Regierung kritisiert, weil so wenig Gesetzesvorschläge kommen, sondern selbst als Fraktion Vorschläge einreicht? Wenn ich mich richtig erinnere, kam in der ganzen Geschichte des MBundestages ein einziger Vorschlag von der Opposition. Und es stand auch schon einmal der Vorschlag im Raum, dass die Opposition die Regierung jede Woche vor eine aktuelle Entscheidungssituation stellt. Warum ist da nie etwas daraus geworden? Der Opposition wäre nicht so langweilig, die Regierung kann intern diskutieren, und das Ergebnis wiederum kritisiert werden. Regelmäßige Debatten wären natürlich schön, und ab und zu mal eine Rede oder ein Zeitungsartikel. Wenn die Regierung aktiver ist, kann sie auch Pressekonferenzen oder Ministerfragerunden geben und /u/Raptor-Eins-Null würde vielleicht wieder Wochenberichte schreiben. Wer weiß, vielleicht gäbe es sogar wieder ein paar Gedichte der Woche von der Bayernpartei. Wenn wir auch nur manches von den Vorschlägen umsetzen, können wir in paar Monaten glücklich in die wohlverdiente ewige Sommerpause gehen. Und wenn es uns Spaß macht und wir bereit sind, dauerhaft so viel Einsatz zu zeigen, können wir dann immer noch weitermachen. [Zwei Abgeordnete der FDP klatschen und seufzen, als der Redner doch nicht fertig zu sein scheint]

Andersherum, ich denke nicht, dass strukturellen Veränderungen unser Problem lösen, wenn wir nicht aktiver werden. Und dann sind sie auch unnötig. Vorschläge wie Demokratie-Simulationen würden vermutlich eher schaden, da sie das ganze für Einsteiger undurchsichtiger machen und an der Idee des MBundestages vorbei gehen. Aus diesen Gründen werde ich GEGEN den Antrag des Geschäftsführers stimmen. Zum einen finde ich den ersten Satz schlichtweg falsch, zum anderen glaube ich nicht, dass dadurch etwas gelöst wird. Dass es tatsächlich nicht mehr als Motivation und Einsatz braucht, um mitzumachen, zeigen doch die beiden Mitglieder der TPD, /u/Minysterfo und /u/Gelbstern, die neu dazu gekommen sind und ohne Schwierigkeiten jetzt mitwirken. Ich wüsste nicht, wie das aktuelle System Willige ausbremst.

Zwei Probleme des Systems gibt es aber meiner Meinung nach, die behoben werden müssen: Zum einen der Discordchat. Je mehr sich dort abspielt, desto inaktiver und damit abschreckender wirkt das Subreddit. Außerdem wird dadurch das ganze für Besucher weniger transparent, sie werden abgeschreckt, und die Hürde für einen Einstieg liegt höher. Warum verlagert man den Discordchat nicht ins MBCafe? [/u/Venedig: „Das war meine Idee! MEINE!!“] Zum anderen wurde bisher /r/MBToilette sträflich vernachlässigt. Alle Inhalte, die für das Cafe zu niveaulos sind, und alle Inhalte mit höchster Dringlichkeit können dort besprochen werden. Aber in diesem Subreddit gab es bisher kaum Beiträge, obwohl es wichtiger Bestandteil der Simulation wäre.

Ich bin gespannt, was die werten Mitglieder des Modellbundestages zu meinem Vorschlag meinen. Schließlich ist es ein ganz anderer Ansatz als die anderen Lösungsideen, und er beinhaltet bestimmt auch etwas Arbeit. Aber selbst, wenn ich nur auf Widerstand stoße, hab ich dem Subreddit im Sinne von /u/Venedig etwas Gutes getan – die Polemie gefördert.

Ich bedanke mich für die Aufmerk... ach, lassen wir das.

However, I currently have another paid internship. I asked my current manager if I could take an unpaid leave, but he told me that I had to work minimum 5-6 hours per week during the unpaid internship. The other internship is a fulltime internship where I am supposed to work 8 hours a day, 5 times a week. Additionally, all this is during the exam period where I will have 2 exams during the unpaid internship (3 before the start of the internship).

The problem is that I think my current internship/part-time work is pretty good for a student, as I am working as an investment advisor. It pays ok (however, way below my firm's competitors), and I like my co-workers. It is generally pretty flexible year-round, and it usually fits my masters progamme. However, if I am going to work full-time internship + 5-6 hours per week in the second internship + revising for exams, it is going to be very exhaustive, and that will have a negative effect on my study (and possible both of the jobs). However, if I manage to do all three and get good grades, I think it will be pretty good to mention in future interviews. 

What do you think I should do? Should I quit my current internship, or juggle two jobs while trying to get good grades?

So I never had any actual software development experience like internships, however I did work at an on-campus lab working on hardware and software support for students and faculty. The thing is, while I worked there I developed an application to automate one of the daily tasks that we had to do, and is now being used everyday by the employees that work there. I was wondering if it would be okay to list the details of the application under the ""Experience"" (as in employment experience) section instead of ""Personal Projects"". Or would that be looked bad upon because it wasn't an actual software engineering job title?

I'm asking because I had it under ""Personal Projects"", but I'm getting hardly any responses from applying. I thought maybe I would have more responses if I have something in the experience section that is software engineer related instead of ""provided hardware and software support etc"". And I would also have an more space so I can put another personal project on my resume.

Any input on this would be appreciated. Thank you."

**OPEN DIALOG**

*Welcome to a new series of blog-style articles called ""Open Dialog"".  These are intended to generate discussion and comments.  Enjoy!*

= =

**BREAKING IN**

I am often asked how I get to do the job I do.  People ask how to move from TV to film, or vice versa.  People ask how to start doing bigger budgets.  These questions have no straight-forward answer.  There is no golden ticket to being a UPM, no checklist of things to directly do in order to achieve these goals.

I was discussing this with someone last week who asked how they might be able to start doing bigger budget projects.  I certainly started on films which were sub-$1M, then gradually got offered bigger and bigger shows.  To date, my largest budget for a studio was $143M.  The largest show I did as a UPM was just under $120M.  The smallest show was $350k.  It’s difficult to quantify ‘what I did’.

For me, it was not only being in the right place at the right time and getting the opportunity to show what I can do by two producers who trusted me.  It was also *years* of hard work and dedication to learning.

**MY STORY**

My story is unique.  Ask 100 people how they got their start, how they got to be where they are now and you’ll hear 100 different stories.

I have known I wanted to make films since I was five.  Yes, I am one of *those* people.  Aside from working with a cinematographer way back in my early teens while he worked on commercials, I really started out as an intern on two features for an Italian film company.  I was 18.  Meanwhile I was working at a local CBS affiliate doing various things - eventually as the Director of Weekend News (the guy controlling the technicals of the show, not the news stories).  Then, I finished school and moved down to Los Angeles.  After a few months of no jobs, living on the street for a few weeks (don’t tell my mom), I landed a job on a show as a set PA.  After a few years, I was an AD.  Then, on one show working as a Second AD, I was thrust into the office setting.  Long-story-short here, I was enamored and mesmerized by all the things that really go on behind the scenes to allow the set to do what we did.  So, I started over in the office as a PA.  Worked my way back up.  A few more years pass.  I was a production supervisor on a high-budget documentary with a big name director.  He and his Producer were kind enough to give me a shot at doing the budget for a shoot in Mexico …and boom, I was made the UPM.  Eight years after that, collecting non-union UPM days along the way, I was able to join the DGA.

I worked hard to prove I can be trusted with bigger projects.  I worked hard to create great budgets and well thought-out production plans.  I took time in the evenings and on weekends to review things, attend some seminars, have meetings with people who would lend their time and share their experiences. I listened a lot. I sent resumes to hundreds of people.  I pounded the pavement.  In the beginning, I did a lot of budget work for free.  Tried everything I could do to show I had what it takes to be given the next opportunity.  *I still do all these things* (well, perhaps not doing budgets for free anymore).  My network has grown a lot since those beginning days.  My resume is much longer and my experiences are much broader.

Each show I do is its own challenge.  Each project has its own heart and desires.  Each director their own vision. Each producer their own needs.  Learning the ways to navigate not only the needs, stress, and nuances of how to create budgets and schedules are beset only by the need to understand the hierarchy of Hollywood and cultivate relationships.

Still, how did I get here?  Hard work, dedication, sacrifice *and a little luck*.  Many people say “It’s *who* you know” that will propel you - and while this is a lot of it, there is also something to be said about *what* you know.  You can be besties with the head of a studio, but if they hire you and you fail because you really don’t know the job - that’s egg on not only your face but theirs too.

**MOVING FORWARD**

Considering the core query, looking back on how I got here, what did I do which helped me get here?  I don’t have a solid, one-stop answer.  It’s a combination of things.

**Have lunch with people**.  Offer a meet at Starbucks to say hello and get to know someone (I can sometime be coaxed by way of a Venti Chai, *hint*).  Cultivate a friendship which will perhaps lead to a job in the future.  Perhaps they know people who know people, who know people…

**Study**.  Take the time to review things which have nothing to do with your current project.  Read blogs &amp; websites and see what other people are doing.  Attend some industry conventions and see what the latest buzz items are.  Knowing a new technology is out there will help you when figuring out how to do a shot or something later.

**Learn more**.  I was the UPM/Line Producer on a film at Fox.  At the time, I was horrible at Post Production.  I knew just barely enough to get by.  So, on that show, I hired a Post Supervisor with a caveat - she had to hire me as a Post PA when I was done with the shooting.  She did.  I worked as a PA in Post for six months after.  Learned a ton.  We did another show together, and today, I have 5 projects with Post Supervisor credit.  I now know that world too, which helps me as a UPM.  Take a class, feed your brain.  Listen, 10 years ago, I did stuff I thought was awesome.  Looking back, I have grown and know so much more.  In 10 more years, I’ll know even more than now.

**Stay updated**.  Ensure you have or have access to the latest rate guides and contract information.

**Be involved**.  Nothing creates a sense of community than getting out there and being involved.  Peoples access to you, and yours to them, when people are active in the community.  Our community of filmmakers are things like this Reddit, or local gatherings like Women in Film, DGA and PGA events, or a host of other seminars like ones put on by Greenhouse.

**Be attentive and show you care**.  In whatever project you do, be there.  Be 100% dedicated to the show and ensure your producers know it.  If you are half there, people will notice.  Dedication has lead me to additional work, because people see I really care.  Which I do.  You should care about the work you do.  Do it to the best of your abilities.

**Do more**.  Ask what you can do to expand your knowledge.  I was the VP of Production and Post at a company for awhile.  While there, I was interested in dabbling in marketing and promotions.  They allowed me some opportunities and I ended up running the Oscar campaign for a film.  Do I do this now for a living?  No.  However, what I learned from doing that is still referenced in projects I do today.

**Don’t be afraid to PA.  Test other waters**.  I can’t tell you how many people I speak with who want to simply jump into the hot seat as UPM.  No.  Learn the ropes.  Understand how things work and you will be a better UPM later.  I rest a lot of my abilities on the fact that I have done a lot of different jobs.  I have been a Grip, Boom Op, done Post, Marketing, been a VP at a major TV studio, intern’ed in Wardrobe, been a PA, AD, POC, APOC, Camera Assistant and more.  If you don’t want to actually work all those jobs - find people who do those jobs, *get in their head*, ask questions and understand what they do.

**Find your niche**.  For me it was tough shows in odd places.  I slowly built my career on being able to parachute into tough places, figure out how to make a film and do it - on time and on budget.  From Zimbabwe to Jordan, and Scotland to South Korea, 18 countries later I am very comfortable doing this.  I get hired because of this experience.  Find what drives you and figure out how to put that into your job.

**Do it well**.  Whether you are doing a project for $100k or $100M, do it well.  Take the time to ensure your budget and plan are well thought out.  Communicate issues to the crew and your producers/studio.  Strive to ensure your projects never go over budget or off schedule.  Think through as many ‘what if’ disaster scenarios as possible and you’ll be ready in case something goes awry.

**Experience Matters**.  Don’t expect to grow into this position with one project worth of experience.  Have a long term game plan and you’ll get there.  Take each show for what it is and learn what you can from it.  Keep that knowledge for the next one.

**Choose projects which speak to you**.  I was once given the scripts to two films and asked which one I wanted to do.  Both got made, but I chose the $4M film shot in a far-off land, as opposed to the $22M feature directed by a legend.  Why?  I felt the smaller film had more heart, more grit and was a bigger challenge.  That decision has not haunted me one bit.  The bigger feature was a total disaster, and while the smaller one failed to gain mainstream notoriety - it is one of those films which I still hold as one of the best I have ever done.  (check out: *The Stoning of Soraya M.*)  So, be ok with passing on shows you don’t connect with.  Do projects which will challenge you and you can feel proud of.

**Read this Reddit**.  Is this not a well veiled plug for this group?  Well, so be it.  It stands to convey the aspect of a community of like-minded people.  Being a UPM and/or LP is a fairly lonely position.  No one else on the show does what you do, and most of the time 80% of the crew feels you are screwing them over - even when you are not.  So, use forums like this one to ask for help, query others on best practices and share your experiences too.

**Love what you do**.  I end this article with my greatest advice.  You must love what you do!  L-o-v-e.  Don’t be a UPM for money, glory or fame.  Do it because you love doing the job.  It’s a tough job, no doubt - but rewarding too.  As a related note, try to hire people who love what *they* do too.  My father once told me, “Find a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.”  Indeed.

This is *your* career.  Make the most of it.

**WHAT ABOUT YOU?**

Have some additional words of wisdom?  What’s your story?  How did you do it?  (or how are you doing working on it currently?)

The goal of this discussion is to inspire those who are looking to break in or move up.  I encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and wisdom.  *Liked this article?  Find other Open Dialog discussions by searching for ‘Open Dialog’ within r/FilmTVBudgeting*.

I'm currently a junior studying computer science looking to get into software engineering after graduation.

Got an offer for operations analyst at Goldman Sachs in Salt Lake City and an offer for technology analyst at JP Morgan and Chase in Columbus, Ohio. I'm leaning towards JP Morgan because I'd actually be doing software development and have potential for full time employment after graduation. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience in either program?

3) What is the workload like for Comp Sci and how good are the professors?
4) How is the campus like on the weekends?

5yj4mk,9,2017-03-09,Resume help needed,TeoTheGreat,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/5yj4mk/resume_help_needed/,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently a 1st year grad student in a primarily research MS program in ECE (I completed most of the grad coursework in undergrad and continued at the same school). My focus is mainly in computer architecture and high performance computing using FPGAs. I have a 4.0 GPA for my grad school credits, obtained a research assistantship, and am working on 3 papers for 3 upcoming conferences, but regardless I haven't been able to secure any summer internship employment despite 50+ applications sent out. I was able to get an interview with one High Profile Company, but they've been reaaally slow (got past 2 rounds of interviews, submitted availability for a 3rd, have not heard back in over two weeks). 

I guess it's too late now to hope for any summer internships; luckily, my stipend will continue into the summer as well. However, I was thinking I could start applying to fall co-ops soon. Could you guys (particularly those in a similar field/are researchers) critique my attached resume?

5yju8x,2,2017-03-09,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5yju8x/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Have a bunch of questions",tmadness,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/5yjzpl/college_student_require_car_for_under_5000_have_a/,"I am a college student who has a internship linedup for summer. Given that I would need to travel around 70-100 miles a day I thought it best to invest in my first car. I have 5000$ saved up (although I would rather not spend as much as the upper limit.) I need something that will last me as I will probably own this car for attest 3-5 years, it needs to be robust I have a job but that pays minimum wage so no lemons that I need to pour money into.
I have a bunch of questions If you are able to anser even a few of them, thank you:

1. Brands : I know Toyotas and Hondas are known for their  reliability and maintenance costs. But are there any other brands that I can safely buy without insane maintenance costs? what about German cars(BMW, Merc. ,Audi )? what about American cars (ford, chevy)? Hyundai? Mazda? 

2. Models: other than the accords, civics, corollas and Camrys what other models meet my requirements?  I think that buying hybrids used at my price range (2006-08 Prius or something like that) is a bad idea as they have batteries that probably need to be replaced (expensive), comments? 

3. Mileage and age: I want to own a a car that has been made after 2005(12 years), any older and I think that the maintenance costs go up. in my research I've come across cars that meet both the price and age requirements have between 120k - 210k. What's the absolute maximum mileage i should consider(right now I think 180 K for a Japanese car is about the limit.)? What are the problems that appear on cars with over 140K miles?

4. Fun: I  am a young guy, I want a car that is at least zippy,  I've driven a 2014 base ford focus  and I want at least that much pickup and handling(although I am willing to compromise if that's not possible). I see a good amour of German cars: 2006/7 Audi 3s/4s, 05/06 BMW 3 series/ mec c-class etc. Should I consider them?

5. Maintenance cost: what's the yearly cost of maintenance on a car with the age, good history and 150K? please provide a dollar amount. I know costs vary based on brands so can you please provide the average costs for a generic Japanese(honda or toyota), generic German, generic american?

I know that these are a lot of questions, but , this is my first car and I need it to last without breaking the bank."

I'm a computer science student from the Netherlands specialising in web development. I'm in my third year and in September I have to do a 6 month internship. I'm looking to widen my knowledge of web development so I have a better chance of getting hired at a fun internship. I find it really hard to figure out what to do, though. I feel like businesses require so many things and then they list another 20 things as a 'nice to have'. I understand that people get hired without fitting every single requirement often enough, but I find it hard to distinguish what's important and what's not.

So far I've learned quite a lot about JavaScript:

* I've used it both server side (with express) and client side (with react+redux)

5yl3f7,15,2017-03-10,My Story - Non Demominational Christian to Atheist.,Crackers91,thegreatproject,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegreatproject/comments/5yl3f7/my_story_non_demominational_christian_to_atheist/,"I grew up a semi normal life. My parents got seperated when I was 10 and then divorced when I was 17. 
I went to a methodist/protestant  secondary school(high school and middle school combined) and was a very hyperactive kid. I hung around with the Christians as they were the only ones who wouldn't take the piss out of me, so I kept hanging out with them.
They persisted in asking me did I want to go to the christian union after school on a Friday, and eventually I said yes. I was 15 then. I became a christian within a few weeks/months and then started going to god camp and the like. 

Fast forward a few years and I went to study computer science in university. I was in a year full of logical minds. Christianity and CS didn't mix well, and I felt quite weird about it. I was on the committee of the christian union in 3rd year uni ( a 4 year course) for about six months, and then gave up as I went out on a work internship.
By then I was having some internal doubts but I told myself to shutup and deal with them, as I was just ""wrestling"" with my faith. I went on a holiday with 3 Christians the summer after that school year, and started getting annoyed by 2 of the christians - they were intentionally cock blocking me etc. I always struggled with the pre marital sex rule as I felt it was a whole load of bullshit. I struggled with a lot of conflicts in college - I wanted to have ""the craic"", and generally enjoy myself. Heck, there were one or two girls who were flirting with me and I would have been interested, but I was nervous what my christian peer group would think, as I'd eventually be tempted into breaking that stupid rule. I also started having internal doubts about the adam&amp;eve story  - as it made me think god was either stupid or malignant ( I have a recent reddit comment on that). Basically, I was looking for an exit from it all. Soon I would get it. 

I also went to a church during this time, a Pentecostal one. They spoke in tongues, they always felt you were in need of prayer etc. Overall, they were lovely people, but it was very odd and cult like. 
Looking back I was happy there, but  it was a deluded kind of happy. It felt weird, and my parents noticed(my parents aren't particulary religious). When I came back from the holiday, I stopped going to the church, and I avoided some of the friends as I knew from previous experiences with others who had lost faith that they'd be preachy and want to pray  for you etc.
In 4th year I wasn't religious, but I wasn't a firm disbeliever either. I simply didn't care. 4th year was too busy too worry about that kind of shit. I also started dating someone, who's now been my girlfriend for 3 year, and I ditched the pre marital rule as soon as I was comfortable with her.


I started to really examine my beliefs about 8 months ago, as up till then I just didn't care. I'm somewhere between agnostic and atheist now as for me I don't think a higher power coudl exists, the evidence is overwhelming, but I can't rule it out completely as I don't have all the facts. I simply believe in nothing.
The past few months though, I've started to depsise religion - be it the tuam case in Ireland (I'm Irish), the arrogance and sheer anti-intellectualism of the Christian right or just the plain irritation for how much I've grown to hate the idea of Christianity. This has allowed me to question my beliefs a lot more, and it's helped me understand that religion for most is just a way to escape fear.
I got scared by my own mortality a few weeks back when I realised this is it, but I'm coping now as it's one life and I have to make do with it the best I can."

My project is using TWINCAT3 as its software, and it's actually my first time using this software, so I have no idea if my code right or wrong because my supervisor is not an expert using TWINCAT3. I would like to ask what kind of basic programming to use for this kind of software. I have tried using a structured text (ST) to do this project and I would really glad if someone can confirm it for me.  Is there anyone an expert using this software?
The main idea of this water curtain is to make and exclamation mark with a dot on the right side after the exclamation mark. So if the water curtain gets a power supply, then 25 valves will pump out the water, next, there is a button with LED and if the button is pressed the curtain will stop for a few seconds then making the ""!."" mark, after that it will keep dropping a water curtain like before, it will not change if the button is not pressed. thankyou before

&gt; I'm sorry to hear that some of you dislike the DLC. As one of the many Content Designers who worked very hard to see this finished, this is a great personal disappointment. It is, however, of course entirely your prerogative to disagree with the direction this DLC took, and we hope that any future DLCs we make might be better to your liking. However, I would like to point out that:

&gt; * There were no interns working on this DLC.
* M&amp;M is the largest single amount of scripted content we have ever added to the game. You may have any opinion on the quality or the artistic vision, but please do not insinuate that it is 'little content'.
* M&amp;M involved a tremendous amount of Content Designer (and other) work to make, and I would like to combine this with the previous point to dispel the notion that we ""do the least we can get away with"".
* If I am not mistaken it is, in fact, the Hermetics that have the most content, and not the Devil Worshipers (though the latter are more prominently advertised).
* We were aware that some people might not like the Devil Worshipers, and therefore added a specific game option that allows you to disable them. This was specifically detached from the supernatural option, so that people who enjoyed the rare supernatural event could still enjoy those without feeling forced to play with DW's as well.

5ylich,2,2017-03-10,What to learn to increase my chances of getting a nice internship in september? (x-post from /r/learnprogramming),welpie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ylich/what_to_learn_to_increase_my_chances_of_getting_a/,"[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5yl1bn/what_to_learn_to_increase_my_chances_of_getting_a/)

Hi!

I'm a computer science student from the Netherlands specialising in web development. I'm in my third year and in September I have to do a 6 month internship. I'm looking to widen my knowledge of web development so I have a better chance of getting hired at a fun internship. I find it really hard to figure out what to do, though. I feel like businesses require so many things and then they list another 20 things as a 'nice to have'. I understand that people get hired without fitting every single requirement often enough, but I find it hard to distinguish what's important and what's not.

So far I've learned quite a lot about JavaScript:

* I've used it both server side (with express) and client side (with react+redux)
* I know how to use web sockets 
* I know how to write unit tests using mocha
* I know how to write automated tests using a testing framework like mocha in combination with selenium and webdriver
* I've built several applications for school assignment using all of these techniques combined.
* I know some jQuery (and I think my google-fu is good enough to find out more about it when needed)

Apart from JavaScript, these are skills I have that are worth mentioning:

* **php**: I know fairly well how to use the language itself, but I've never used it in combination with libraries.
* **java**:  I've used it in combination with maven packages and I've even used it to write web applications (for a school assignment). Most of my java knowledge has kinda faded after not using it since the start of my second year, but I'll have to use it again soon so that will refresh my memory.
* **SQL**: I've done a semester on database design and implementation. I've used a lot of different aspects of T-SQL and I know about normal forms. I've used SQL server and MySQL.
* I have experience with **git**
* I have some experience with **mongoDB**

So, I guess these are some questions that I hope you can help to find an answer to:

* Is there anything within the JavaScript world that is really important to learn about that I might not know?
* Is it worth learning how to use php in combination with composer (and specifically laravel)? It seems a reasonably common requirement but it seems it's usually only smaller design/media businesses that use it.

I'm currently in the process of buying a new laptop. I'll be using it to replace my current deskopt and laptop during my internship abroad for the purposes of school/work (fMRI analysis) and gaming.

Specs (Clevo P650RP6-G) are an i7 6700HQ, 16GB DDR4, GTX 1060 6GB. I have to choose between a 1080p G-sync screen or a 1620p non-g-sync screen for 100 euro more (both IPS). I really like the idea of more screen real estate to work on, having 2 applications open side by side would be great for productivity. 

However, I'm wondering what the downsides are to this uncommon resolution. Since a GTX 1060 is not the strongest card, it won't be able to run all titles at 1620p, certainly not for long. How would visual performance be for 1080p content (movies, applications and games). Will reducing resolution to 1080p limit refresh rate (my current monitor switches to 30Hz on 1440p for example)? 

Many (older) threads on websites mention scaling problems, as well as blurriness due to a change in pixel density. Is this still a problem today (fixed by news windows), or a hardware problem that can't be fixed (I've read about physical difference in pixel density ratio, but maybe there are easy workarounds by using a resolution close to 1080p with a similar ratio?)? 

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR Downsides of a 2880x1620 screen (for a GTX 1060) with regards to blurriness, scaling issues and such?"

5ym9nh,4,2017-03-10,Best practices for new account initial passwords?,vrtigo1,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5ym9nh/best_practices_for_new_account_initial_passwords/,"I work for a small company (~150 employees) and am trying to figure out best practices for provisioning new employee Active Directory account passwords.

At present we use a combination of a static phrase + the last 4 digits of the employee's SSN.  Theoretically this is something that the employee should know and be fairly difficult for others to guess.  We also use last 4 digits of employee SSN + MFA for VPN access passwords.

Problem is if we have interns or contractors, our HR team often doesn't get their SSN.  As well, we are starting to hire people outside the USA and they don't have SSNs at all.

Our HR team wants to stop using the SSN as a unique identifier, but I'm not sure what else we could replace it with.  Obviously we could generate a random password, but the problem is that we don't always have a mechanism to communicate that password to the end user (i.e. if they're working on a remote office).

It was suggested that we use birth month and birth day to replace SSN (i.e. Jan 10 = 0110), but I don't think this is a good idea because birthdates are public record in many cases and many people other than the employee would know their birthday (much more so than someone would know their SSN).

Seems like this would be a common challenge for corporate admins, interested to hear how others handle it."

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

As the title suggests, im looking to achieve better opportunities until the end of this year, so im looking forward to get some certifications and improve my social skills, i want some advice if im in the right path.

**My background**

School: i have 3 technical courses (about 1,5-2 years each): 1- Computer Maintenance; 2 - Web Programming and Design; 3- Information Technology (covered a bit of all areas in IT). Now I'm my 3 year of Computer Engineering(the government pays for it);

Languages: Im native Brazilian Portuguese, i speak english fluently and im at an advanced level of spanish;

Professional Experience (chronologically):Starting at 18 I did internship in a small local IT maintenance shop, got promoted to supervisor after 6 months, i quit a year later to study in another city. 

In said city I got a position of Service desk analyst to a multinational company, again got promoted to Leadership of this team of 15 analysts after 6 months. 

After 1 year and a half as leader of this team, due the low payment (10,5/hr) decided to send some resumes and got an opportunity to work as level 2 system technician for 15,5/hr.

Im this position so far for 6 months, but i know i wont have promotions, big challenges due the amount of job i have to do daily and with this salary i can just pay for my needs.

Total: 4 years so far.

**What now ?**

I love IT in general, **I dont know which certification i should try to get first, CCNA, MSCA or ITIL** because i want to try to go for a position where i earn something like 20/hr at least, is it possible ? **am i being greedy ? Or am i undervaluing my skills(im pretty afraid of that) ?**

I know i can get these certifications pretty quickly because i have been studying for them during the past years looking to one day have the spare money to spend on it, and i know this year i'll have the money for sure, but i dont want to be dumb, so **i want to get the most cost beneficial certs related to my background.** 

**Also, which roles do you suggest to me to look for?** . I dont mind working in the future with managing teams, or in a support role, because im not sure of what i want in the future (middle term) and im love with almost anything related to IT, the only thing i'd refuse are programming roles like Java, C+ or PHP, i dont dislike them, i just feels its not for me.

Thanks in advance"

5ymxdb,5,2017-03-10,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5ymxdb/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I am interested in going to a top law school or working @ a big 4 firm after graduation. I am struggling with this decision and planning for my future has always been something that stresses me out. With that being said I will just let you guys know what I like/don't like about each path and maybe you guys could share some wisdom.

Law School -- If I went to a top law school I would hope to eventually be a corporate/transactional lawyer in biglaw. Going to law school and working in biglaw is attractive because of the pay ($160k starting) and the exit opportunities are good. What I don't like is that the hours suck even at the non-equity partner level and the work can be very dull.

Big 4 -- I like this because I don't have to spend well over $100k and 3 years on extra school. The hours during non-busy season also sound better than law. I would like to work in advisory/TAS and the work sounds somewhat interesting, I enjoy travel and the exit opps are good. What I don't like is that the career progression in accounting seems pretty stagnant outside of the CFO path, but working in corporate finance/accounting doesn't really interest me. It would also take something like 10 years or more to make the kind of money biglaw attorneys make.

I appreciate any advice. Thanks."

-potentially could teach me more hard/tech skills
-I don't actually know what I'd be going yet as I haven't been placed into a specific field outside of IT intern (this will happen later) 
-I could be offered a job at the end of the summer for after graduation that would pay very well, but I'd have to move to a different state and leave my SO of 2.5 yrs behind (he is at a job he loves and i don't want him to risk that)
-is a well established company that treats its employees and members very well and isn't going anywhere

Job B:
-pays $19
-is only 15min from my house!!!!
-would probably teach me more project mgt based skills (maybe less useful/marketable than hard skills?)
-I do know almost exactly what I'd be doing and I think I would like it
-I could be kept on as an intern through my last year of college and offered a job upon graduation, it would likely pay well but not as well as the other job. This would be close to my family and SO.
-it's a start up company about 7 years old now that is doing very well and competes with ""the big boys""  but could potentially be bought out by another company etc 

Both:
I REALLY like both places and their company cultures. 

There are so many factors that I can't seem to make a clear decision. On one hand I'd like to stay in my current city for a few years after graduation, but I think what I learn at the out of state job could teach me more. WHAT DO I DO!???

I asked for some time, knew I was better off, etc., etc.  Go ahead and laugh because, of course, it doesn't feel over with. 

I'd decided to take some time and I asked for time, which he respected... I guess until yesterday?  He stopped by my office (we work in the same building) and my co workers told me that I was out running.  Fast forward, there I am, running, and he pulls up next to me, rolls down the window and yells ""I just needed to say hello"".  I jumped in his car and didn't look at him.  We drove for several minutes without a word until I finally asked ""hey, do you mind if I just hop into your car?""  

I was at a loss for words so I said ""I jumped in your car and I really hadn't thought much beyond that point.  Can you take me back to the gym?"" 

So we parked at the gym and instead of running, I changed back into my business attire and agreed to meet him in a neutral semi public location.  We sat for two hours and he explained that things had started to go a million miles an hour, that he knew I loved my husband but eventually I couldn't have both and neither could he.  I'll save all the saccharin, sweet ""we are meant for each other"" bullshit for my memory because you've all had your own and don't need to hear mine. 

I did explain that I wasn't comfortable with any of it.  It was all betrayal.  Things were different from when I was an intern.  I have a life to think about.  

He walked me to my car and we kind of rubbed our faces together for 10 minutes without actually kissing and then we went our separate ways. 

It was naive of me to think it was going to be a clean break if I didn't just stay the fuck away.  I mean, seeing him and holding him, hearing how much he loved me was wonderful, but I'm at a bit of a loss. 

This is just me getting it out of my head.  Thanks if you read the whole thing.  "

So, for this year I've got a summer internship lined up (it'll be my first internship ever) as a programmer for a big corporate company. I was speaking to my college advisor and he gave me two options for next year (2018). He said I could either take classes in the summer of 2018 and graduate the following december or I could seek another internship for next year which would push my graduation date further back to spring of 2019. He says I'd have to work out the pros and cons of what would be better and he says that my schedule might be a bit crowded but doable if I go with classes instead of a second internship. He says if I graduate early I could probably start working starting in January 2019 but if I get that second internship it would mean I would get paid more for my starting job if I have two internships under my belt. How true is this? Do jobs really pay more if I have more internships under my belt? Is two better than one? Should I just take the classes and graduate earlier since I'll already have one internship?

I recently got an interview for an IT internship in the Cincinnati area.   
  
When they emailed me, they didn't specify whether they wanted to do a phone or in-person interview, so I gave them availability for a phone interview and told them to let me know if they wanted to do in-person.  
  
I got an email back saying that they would prefer to set up an in-person interview (actual wording was ""If we absolutely cannot let me know.""). Since I'm on Spring break next week  and not really doing anything, I *could* technically do an in-person interview, however I really would prefer to do it on phone for a few reasons:  
  
- It's a 4 hour drive down there (8 hour round trip)  
  
- I don't have a car anymore (because I don't need one in college), so I'd have to have one of my parents drive me down, which is problematic because they both work.  
  
- It's an IT internship that isn't specifically for freshmen, so I think as a CS freshman who frankly knows very little about IT my chances are slim. So I'm not really thrilled about wasting an entire day or two of both my time and my parents' time, not to mention the cost of gas.    
  
How should I respond? Should I suck it up and get my ass down there?

5yo3p7,33,2017-03-10,[23 F] How to deflect attention from [40s M],nothankyouhomeboy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5yo3p7/23_f_how_to_deflect_attention_from_40s_m/,"I manage a coffeehouse. We're a small-town joint, and our regulars tend to get quite cozy with us. It's not unusual for them to sit at the bar and shoot the shit while they gulp their bean water. Enter Reginald. He comes in every damn day for his hit of liquid ambrosia and hour of forced conversation. 

I am a woman in customer service. I have basically witnessed every flavor of male tekking imaginable. I have been flashed countless times (the most memorable being a buck naked fellow posed like Captain Morgan) I have been followed, hopelessly hit on and I have even been serenaded (with guitar accompaniment, of course.) Not much gets to me. 

But Reginald creeps me out. 

He's in his forties and the dude exudes that kind of frantic kindness so consistent with desperation. We work alone on weekdays and business does its little death knell after 10am - Reginald typically visits at this time, as there is no way to politely extricate yourself from his conversational talons. He told me once that he considers us (the bean wenches) to be his closest friends. He is so clearly lonely. This used to activate what little human emotion was left in the charred rubble of my soul, but an incident that happened a week ago has depleted that. 

Ole Reg has never demonstrated an awareness of boundaries. He tries very hard to force our friendship, offering me internships, laptops, grocery store giftcards, etcetcetc. I have obviously never accepted. He badly pries into my personal life. Guffaws uproariously at my bad jokes. Eschews patronizing wisdom. Pouts if not given sufficient attention. He has made comments about my appearance. That is a huge (YUGE) deal to me, and something I have repeatedly explained to him as being off limits. I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder, so any feedback about my external qualities triggers very unhealthy thoughts and behaviors. BDD has brought me to extraordinarily low points, and I had to drop out of college for two years until I had enough self worth to resume working on my degree. I still have issues with self harm and depression caused by conflating my appearance and my worth as a human person. External reinforcement does not help. I'm tall, slender and typically perceived as being conventionally attractive. I usually can't leave my house without strangers making comments about my appearance. I accept that attention from strangers will happen. With friends or acquaintances I usually make it explicitly clear that I don't appreciate that kind of attention, even though I know they mean well. He does not respect that.

Ultimately, his undivided attention makes me incredibly uncomfortable. He is so nice that it was impossible to establish boundaries without feeling like an asshole. He just tries so hard. Like a car crash or Mama June twerking, it's hard to watch. 

Last week his ""daughter"" liked an old IG post of mine. I just had this immediate gut feeling of revulsion and I instinctively felt that it was him. My IG does not have my name attached, and it also is not linked to any other social media I have. His daughter is nine. I have met her once. I seriously doubt she has her own IG, and even if she did why would she be lurking the posts of an adult she doesn't know? I immediately blocked the account and made my page private. I no longer want to interact with Reginald. His behavior unnerved me, and I do not welcome that energy into my life. I still feel sorry for him, but I can no longer pretend to tolerate him. 

I have decided to be polite and cordial and still provide good service, but I will no longer talk to him beyond the brief interaction of his order. He is having trouble accepting that. He keeps asking me, ""are we okay?"" and it turns my stomach to hear that he thinks that I am a composite of ""we."" He wants to know how he offended me or if something is wrong with me. Everyday this week he asks me about my shift in behavior. He keeps trying to rope me into conversations.
 
I am wondering how I can handle this. I need advice. I can be tactless, and I want to handle this without it being a huge ordeal. I also want him to stop trying to force my hand in this quasi-friendship. I want him to leave me alone, but I don't know how to gently communicate that.

5yoj9w,11,2017-03-10,Need Advice on Summer Internship (private equity vs corporate finance),twohwang,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5yoj9w/need_advice_on_summer_internship_private_equity/,"Hi, I am currently a junior at University of Michigan, majoring in Mathematics (finance and risk management) and minoring in Computer Science. I applied to a bunch of summer internships but I either got rejected or never heard back from most of the places. One of the place I did hear back and had a pretty successful phone interview is a media agency called Starcom in Chicago which has a corporate finance position. 
In addition, I contacted one of my family friend, who's on a board of a middle-market private equity firm in NYC, who is willing to find me an internship position. I know this summer internship is very important in regards to my future career path, and I wanted to hear some insight from people who are experienced in this field. 

So following is my questions:
1. Between private equity and corporate finance internship, which one would put me in a better position when I look for a job after graduation. 
2. If I chose to intern at private equity, do you think I have a chance to get a return offer right after college, knowing many enter private equity with at least some work experience and MBA. 
Thanks,
"
5yonec,3,2017-03-10,Just started my first position and I'm hopelessly out of my depth. What do I do?,DrowningInCodeHelp,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5yonec/just_started_my_first_position_and_im_hopelessly/,"Hello all, I'm a senior in a small college's CS program. I'm graduating in December so I have  a fair amount of experience. However, I just recently got an internship at a local development company and I'm dying. I was immediately assigned to work on the flagship product, and the only other developer that's ever worked on this thing is a contractor from India, who has the opposite work schedule as me (I.e. He's only on at night). I'm an intern getting paid $14 an hour. 

When I look at this code I don't even know where to think about beginning. It's thousands of class files spread across dozens of projects and 4 solutions. There's asp.net mvc, Javascript, Jquery, kendo ui, Ninject, and god knows what else. I get sick to my stomach because I can't even figure out how to make a simple popup with an image in it. Theres factories for everything, and every single class seems to have hundreds of interconnects.

 What the fuck do I do? Is this normal? Did I get thrown in the deep end? Am I just a bad programmer? I feel completely helpless and terrified. Should I just quit? "

Nobody's really sure what we do, but we're really good at it. We are a young, hard-charging, painfully trendy, tech firm. As such, we live up to all the stereotypes. Ping pong tables in the office, bean bags, a snack bar, ... and a ""unique"" corporate culture ... of which you're going to be a key part....

So who are you? The older buttoned-down corporate lawyer / office Mom who just wants to fit in? A young intern, who'll do what she's told? A useless programmer we can't fire but are determined to get our money's worth from? The HR person who has happiness as their only KPI?

Whatever character you choose, the idea is that you will end up sd the office plaything, or at least mine, available to be teased, demeaned, degraded and humiliated. The details of that can be discussed, I have some specifics in mind, but it's what you find most interesting that I'm interested in exploring....

5yp2qq,8,2017-03-10,"[Fantasy] Wizard's don't practice magic openly, but you work a little into your job in tech support.",LewisClarke,LewisClarke,https://www.reddit.com/r/LewisClarke/comments/5yp2qq/fantasy_wizards_dont_practice_magic_openly_but/,"""Kids these days are always glued to their phones.  It's like - hello - try to live in the real world for one whole minute, you know?  I was having dinner with my son the other night and he spent the whole meal texting his girlfriend."" Karen was saying to Bill, the twenty-something intern that had started last week, as I walked into the break room to grab my morning coffee.  I poured to the last dregs, then added more grounds and water to the machine.  My ancestors had mixed ingredients like these in the past and chanted incantations over the mixture to create elixers of life.  I merely pushed a button.

Centuries had passed since the last wizard or witch had openly practiced magic.  Unable to support ourselves through the traditional means of transmuting lead to gold or selling potions of immortality, we had turned to more mundane means of earning money.  Most chose fields that teased them with their proximity to actual magic - chemistry, physics, electronics.  I chose tech support.

I sipped at my coffee.  It was lukewarm.  Words mumbled past my lips and steam began to rise from the cup.  I took a second sip of the piping hot liquid and had just enough time to appreciate the improved flavor before burning my tongue.  I had no time to enjoy my minor success because at that exact moment Karen popped over my cubicle wall.

""Steve, my computer is freaking out.  Can you fix it?""

""Can you be more specific?"" I asked.

""I'm not really a computer person, and I think you know that by now."" She said.

""I'm sorry, Karen, but I can't really help you unless I understand what's going on."" I replied.

""I already told you I'm not a computer person, you're refusing to help me so I'm going to contact HR!"" Karen said.

""Woah woah woah, just let me take a look, and I'll figure it out."" I said, dragging myself out of my chair and walking over to Karen's cubicle.

""So...uh...what was the problem?"" I asked staring at her perfectly functional computer.

""I need to run a report in Excel, and I need to average these values"" she said, pointing at column A ""but when I type average in the box, it doesn't do anything.""  Column B, row 1 said ""Average"".

I could feel my rage opening a portal to the demon world, but stifled my emotions just as the first imp's arm poked through.  Karen's mug full of pens fell over, but the office was otherwise spared a grisly destruction.

""Let me give you a pro tip, Karen.  A smart lady like you can get through this just fine with our good friend Google.  Here, let me show you."" I said, opening up Chrome.

""See, we just type what we want here.  'How do I average values in Excel'.""  As soon as I clicked the mouse I focused my magical energy, performing my most impressive magical feat of the morning.  In the tiny fractions of a second that Google spent processing the query I willed the fourth result, which I thought to be the most helpful to the first position, slightly optimizing Google's incredibly efficient algorithm.

""See, very first result.  We just click the link and voila - just like magic there it is."" I said as the page loaded into a step-by-step tutorial with pictures.

""Oh wow.  Thanks, Steve.  You're such a tech wizard!"""

Literally the next day, I had a phone interview with my dream company, and I found out today I made it to the next round, if I get this, it's a no brainier, I'm turning down this internship and accepting my dream company in a heartbeat. Today, I also got calls from two other really big companies for interviews, they would be better experience, and significantly better pay than the offer I've accepted. Finally, I got an offer today from a company that I'd like to work at as well, offering slightly less pay, but for a longer internship duration than what I've accepted so pay is balanced out, plus they're offering to hire me at the end of the internship, and I can actually see myself starting my career there

So I have a lot of decisions, but I've already accepted, I haven't signed anything yet, so I guess it's not 100% official, but still. I don't plan on working for this company in the long run. Has anyone else been in this situation, what did you do?"

I do above average in my classes (3.3 or 3.4) and I’d say I feel passionate about CS in general, but I have very few side projects (besides a snake clone using pygame), and have absolutely no relevant experience in the field aside from my classes. Right now, I’m quite depressed about my prospects for an internship for the summer because I’ve applied to a few places but haven’t gotten any responses. I also have very bad social anxiety, so I get really worked up over having to meet potential employers for internships. I just feel hopeless right now to be honest, and would just like to hear from someone who has gone through this before so I know I’m not alone and can get through this. Thank you to whoever replies, I really do appreciate it! I just feel like a fuck up right now and would like to hope that I can get out of this hole."

I was assigned a mentor and I would ask him questions through HipChat (the software we use to communicate). After my 2nd question he began to give facepalm memes and emoticons that although seemed silly, made me lose confidence in my own capability. I know it sounds stupid but I lost a bit of confidence in myself since every question was met with a response that basically implied I'm an idiot.



I completed the task and now I'm at home but I feel upset and like a fool. Is this imposter syndrome? I guess my question is, is it normal to feel this way when you begin work?

5yqr1j,13,2017-03-10,Personal Epiphany on Burnout and Depression,xuziq,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5yqr1j/personal_epiphany_on_burnout_and_depression/,"Hi Reddit! I'm a 20 year old junior year college student and artist. I've always been a VERY hard worker when it comes to art making, and for the first two years of college I worked myself to the bone drawing, painting, applying to internships, and doing everything else. I pulled so many all-nighters that I began experiencing intense mood swings/mania around my first semester of sophomore year. This all led me to ""crashing"" and steadily going into a numb, mild depression during the next semester. Even though my second semester of sophomore year was light, I decided I could take a ton of classes my first semester of junior year (I thought I had ""recovered,"" but nope) and overloaded myself with work again. I'm currently on my second semester of junior year and am taking a very light course load and have been recovering from last semester (again). This has all been terrible for my mental and physical health - I've developed hip problems that go away with exercise (seeing a chiropractor about this on Tuesday, wish me luck!), possible bipolar/depression, anger issues, etc....


The thing is... I used to have a ton of passion for art and artmaking. Since the age of 12 to 18, I drew for around 4-8 hours daily because I loved it so much! And in my first two years of college, I would draw for more. I wanted to do nothing but become a professional artist, but worked myself so much that I crashed and burned out. I used to do my homework and then do personal art projects for myself (little passion pieces/projects that kept me going), but now I only do homework and nothing else. I would not even spend the same amount of time on my studio art homework either - I used to spend up to 25-50 hours on a single piece, and now... god, I can't even muster 5-10 hours. This has made me feel very depressed for the past year. I started wondering if I had gotten lazy or unmotivated. When I start on a piece I'm working on currently, even if I love the way it's going... I just want to get it done quickly and hand it in. I end up maybe giving the piece 60-75% and not the 200% I used to give them. Last semester, I remember sometimes I didn't spend any time on them at all... a practice that I would have found absolutely unacceptable sophomore year when I was in my manic state.


But - little steps, right? The thing was that I didn't realize I had burned out and was depressed (and really needed an extended period of time to recover) until today! 


I had seen a Ted talk talking about burnout and how it is similar to post traumatic stress disorder and depression. It absolutely blew my mind because I just thought I had become lazy and unmotivated - but nope, I wasn't lazy (I'm still doing the same art as always, making connections, applying to internships and exhibitions, etc. - but with less passion and drive), I was BURNED OUT. And I've been burned out - severely - for the past year.


I've now fully realized it, and I'm going to try my best to improve my living habits so that I can make a full recovery and find love in drawing and painting again! The habits I've started to work on are:


-Going to the gym for 20-30 minutes every day/week


-Going to bed before 12 (preferably around 10) and waking up earlier


-Taking more cold showers in the morning


-Fixing my nail biting/jaw clenching stress habits


-Making gratitude lists daily/weekly


-Meditating once a day


If anyone has any tips on beating burnout at work, I'd love to hear it! Let's all try our best to do better, guys!"
5yqrwl,1,2017-03-10,Questions about making a game with Unity,ericr2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5yqrwl/questions_about_making_a_game_with_unity/,"Hello all. So I've got this idea for a 2d top-down rpg that I want to build with unity but I had a couple questions I'd like help with before I start. So first off,

1) Is there anyone with experience that can help me with what types of tools/libraries/apis/etc I should know about given my game genre?

I remember being a super noob intern who didn't even know libraries were a thing and, to make a long story short, ended up coding AES from scratch only to find out I could've saved hours of toil if I had known to ask. This is something I'm not keen on repeating. So far I pretty much only know about Tiled, but not really anything in the way of making tilesets.


So I know my first question is pretty vague, which leads me to my next question:

2) Is it a bad idea to share my GDD with the public if I don't particularly plan on making it open-source?

Sharing it with yall might make answering my first question a little easier, but I don't know if I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

Thanks guys. "
5yqzob,1,2017-03-10,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5yqzob/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I'm a high school senior (Boston area) looking for some advice on summer internships as it is a grey area between high schooler and college freshman.  
I have been employed / interning with my local town hall's IT department for the past three summers and I would like to move onto a more demanding program this coming summer.  
This is a throwaway so I am happy to share my portfolio site/ resume if anyone is interested, but I am most interested in infosec and cyber-security (whether that takes the form of a sysadmin or a dedicated security researcher), so I have been looking into internships with Raytheon and rapid7, but each are targeted to university/ college students, even if they have only completed one year.  
My primary skills (and interests) are programming (Java, C, C++, Python, x86 ASM) and Linux systems administration, so I am really looking for an internship where I could apply and grow these skills. Just by my personal projects and homelab I would likely be more proficient than most college freshmen.  
I have already applied to Army educational outreach programs (SEAP, HSAP) and I would like to apply to Raytheon, but my question really is whether or not it would be acceptable for me to apply for positions targeted to university students simply because there isn't much out there for graduating seniors.  
Obviously over the next couple months I will be networking at conventions and conferences, but any help would be appreciated.  
TL;DR Should a high school graduate apply for college-level internships?"

So about me : 

I worked previously 5 years in SAP. I was working on their own language, called ABAP. 
Unfortunately most my work has been on a very specific business module in SAP, which although was critical to the business won't be very much relatable to outside world. 

I worked  on a very specific technical tool, which really has very less employability . With every passing day, my career was moving into a dead hole. I . 

To get out of that mess I decided to restart my career. I started my masters in the states, with main focus on Data Science. 
I also interned as a Data Scientist intern during 16 summer. 

Starting last December, I started applying for full time positions, both in Data Science and Software engineer role. I did my resume review here and also among friends, and it is decent. 

However I've gotten less than 10 calls, in over 300 applications and nothing went passed the HR /Hackerrank round even if I passed all the test cases 

The only decent chance I have is with a big Seattle online retailer company. This company sent me an online assessment, for which I passed all the test case. Then they called me onsite and it is on 21st . It's a half day interview, that means it'll be for 4 hours. And it's a part of an event, so other experienced candidates will be there. 

Over the past 6 months , I've mostly been practice CTCI /leetcode and I'm decent in algorithms. I've solved over 215 questions and also all the questions that's been tagged with the specific company. 

Few days ago I had a call with the recruiter and she said because of my experience I'd be interviewing for SDE II. That means they'll throw in a system design round there. 
Although she also said that they have so many openings, that  if everyone does well on the interview, they can extend offer to everyone. Every body is not competing for the same position or something. 


I've only started preparing for system design questions few weeks back and although I have gathered  decent breath but I don't have much depth of knowledge on these technologies . for example, given a question like ""Design Instagram"", I can probably come up with high level design and say a few stuff about caching, sharding etc and how to include in that design but beyond that I won't be able to go deeper. If the interviewer asks me to go even deeper on topics like Redis, I won't have much idea. 


I also never got to work using design patterns or worked on multi threaded environment, which is all is expected of someone with 5years exp.
 I'm also not very comfortable with the Oops question. For example given a question like ""Design a Parking lot"" or ""Design a elevator system "" I can probably come up with a decent design on which I can talk for 10-15 minutes but beyond that I won't be able to go in much more depth. 

Overall I feel like I'm in a very bad shape and probably won't be able to crack the SDE II interview. I asked my recruiter that what happens if I do well enough for for SDE I but not SDE II. She said that then they'll give an offer for SDE I, as the final position offered  is determined by how I perform on the interviews. 

Unfortunately this upcoming interview is the only real option I have, since I don't have any other calls. I've been applying still, but the number of companies are running out. 

Not to mention, that I'm an international student who'll graduate in May, so I'll have to have a job by the end of September or I'll be deported. 

Seriously getting freaked out here. What can I do in 10 days to maximize my chance at cracking the interview."

I think this is going to be more of a rant than anything. 

I graduated from a UC as a Computer Science major last June, and have been searching for a software engineer job ever since. I never had an internship or anything but even then is it supposed to be this hard to get a job? :( I have personal projects and all, but I still struggle to get interviews and responses. I went through the hiring process with this one company in the bay area, however they stopped responding to me for some reason. They had me do 2 projects, 2 code reviews and I also worked in their offices for 2 days and they told me they'll contact me for a final phone call but I have waited for nearly 2 weeks and have received nothing. I contacted the hiring manager but haven't received a response. 

I got an ""offer"" from this one company named Revature, however they seem somewhat sketch. They put you in a bootcamp like training session for 3-4 months, and then afterwards have you interview for their clients and then if you get accepted you work for less pay. And they make you work for 2 years or else you have to pay a 20k dollar fine for their ""training fee"".

I don't even know what to do now. Am I supposed to accept this offer? Everyone in my class that I graduated with has a job and the fact that I don't have a job yet makes me feel like complete shit. The offer I got isn't even a real job, it's something that anyone who spent 15 minutes googling before the interview would have been able to get. I'm tired of having no job. I'm tired of having people ask me why I don't have a job yet since ""CS majors can easily get a job"". I hate it. I don't even know what to do. I tell myself that I should ""improve my resume"" but I'm scared to make any changes to my resume at this point. I feel like if I make a ""wrong change"" then all the companies I apply to will go down the drain. "
5yrvkd,2,2017-03-11,Will a great GPA at least give me a few interviews with big companies?,LesPaulMane,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5yrvkd/will_a_great_gpa_at_least_give_me_a_few/,"Hi all,

I am a junior getting ready to be applying this fall. The strongest part of my resume is my GPA (&gt;3.9 at a good private school). Other than that, my experience is solid but not outstanding. I have done research and have an open-source Java internship lined up for the summer, I also served as a TA for a couple of classes.

Being international, I realize that I 1) only really have a shot at sponsorship with (some) bigger companies 2) Need to be more qualified than my domestic peers for the company to go through the trouble.

I plan on studying the crap out of coding interviews this summer but I am hoping that what I have on paper will at least get me past the initial screening.

TL;DR: If a great GPA is my one outstanding quality, is that enough to land an interview with the big N?"
5ys9dd,27,2017-03-11,How to get over programming question practice induced anxiety/panic?,fhci,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ys9dd/how_to_get_over_programming_question_practice/,"So I've been working as a software engineer at Google for 3.5 years now and did a couple of internships before that. By now, I have probably gone through 8 or so coding interviews plus 3 more math/logic interviews to get into university in the first place and many many exams --  but I am still absolutely terrified of the sorts of programming questions you usually get asked in coding interviews. Now that I am thinking of changing companies, this is becoming a real problem. I am not just afraid of interviews, even just hearing/reading/attempting an interview question for practice can send me into panic. 

A lot of the advice is about practising more but I feel like I need some strategies for how to make my practice sessions actually effective and make me less likely to avoid them. Over the years, I have managed to feel less anxious about other areas of my life that used to give me trouble (like public speaking), but fear of coding questions I haven't been able to shake off.

As long as I get an idea of what the solution could be not too long after reading the question, I am fine but as soon as I hit the question where my mind goes blank at first, I start thinking that I must be a Bad Engineer (TM) and that in turn stops me from being able to think properly about the problem. Those cases then usually end with me curled up in a ball crying for an hour and telling myself I'm the dumbest person in the world, which is extremely draining and pretty much ruins the rest of the practice session. I once had a mock interview during which I burst into tears and couldn't finish.

If anything, I feel like having worked as a software engineer for a while now has made this worse. I am doing pretty well in my job but I would say that I am mediocre at coding questions (my boyfriend says that I can't be mediocre since I have never been rejected, but to me it just seems like I got lucky with the questions I was asked). Everyone around me (including my boyfriend) seems to love programming questions and loves discussing them and solving them for fun. When I hear these questions being discussed, most of the time I think that if I had been asked _those_, I would never have gotten hired.

Theoretically speaking, I know that interview questions are just another skill that you can practice and that you don't have to get every question 100% right to get hired. And I also think that interview questions are not indicative of whether someone is a good software engineer or not -- but in practice what I feel in my body is quite different. I don't know how to get from knowing this on an intellectual level to really changing my attitude towards interview questions.

5ysmfv,7,2017-03-11,The Screenplay,milleniumbridge,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5ysmfv/the_screenplay/,"Sometimes I imagine what it would've been like if we had actually worked together, in person. Would we have been lovers? And after much thought, the answer is probably no; not because I wouldn't find you sexy or attractive, but because, I have strong boundaries.

**Scenario 1: If I were an intern at your advertising agency**

We would sit together at meetings, while I take notes on everything you say. I'll try to do everything according to your requirements, yet I'll add my little touch to all the briefs, and tone down the emotion a tad, and ramp up the humor juxtaposed against something tragic, because that's what people are moved by. They want to cry, then they want to laugh. It's the human condition. 

I'll avoid being alone with you at all times, keep a nice distance between us. Maybe, I'll notice your looks here and there, and sometimes I'll make a snarky comment about your *""fan club""* or *""harem of women.""* The office is still buzzing with rumors about your affair with one of the women in the other department, nicknamed, your FWB, who was excited about finding out she was pregnant, thinking that she now has a permanent tie to you for life, until she disappointingly realized that you had a vasectomy several years before. 

Your wife is aware, but then again, you've never quite divorced her, and the two of you continue to live as you do, like so many couples whose finances are irrevocably entwined and each has a hard time letting go despite the confessions of dead bedroom and emotional blackmail. Yes, the office is buzzing with all these *insights,* but we're all pretending like we don't know when we talk to you, because you're our boss, but I'll make a snarky comment here and there, and you'll look up at me, surprised. 

Maybe finally, one late evening, there is a project due, and we happen to be the only ones in your office. This is the moment I've been dreading. The test of willpower. You'll sit next to me, maybe mumble a few incoherent statements. There is the leftover wine and pizza from the office happy hour. You'll start to ask me personal questions, ask if there is a man in my life? But since I'm a workaholic, you'll already know that I haven't dated anyone in a couple of years since I'm married to my job. I might tell you the truth, but most likely, I'll lie and say there is someone I've been seeing, because I know where this conversation is headed. You'll look at me astonished, then remember where we both are, make some awkward excuses, then go back to our desks to quietly observe the other.

Or maybe, I'll tell you the truth, giving you a way into delving into more personal questions. Then finally, when I laugh at your jokes, you'll ask me if I'd like to go to dinner sometime, hinting sometime. An awkward pause. I'll say, *""Sir, aren't you married?...I'm sorry but this situation makes me feel uncomfortable...""* You'll profusely apologize, blame it on the wine, but just as I am leaving for the door, I'll look back and add, *""but...if you were single, I would definitely have said yes.""* Then promptly leave, because that's the kind of girl I am. I'm not easy to get. I'm not the type of woman who throws herself at married men. I'm not the type who'll try to get you alone in the room, then unbutton my top, then put your hand on my chest. That's the kind of thing women do who have no self-esteem, the women who like being side-chicks, sex workers and escorts because they like the money you spend on them; the kind of women who had no strong male role models in their life. My father didn't raise me to one of those women. I'm difficult to seduce. You can't just try to get me alone in a room and use your power and sex appeal to seduce me. I don't think that way. I'm hard to get and I'm worth it. 

So, no, even if we had worked together for long periods of time, we would've never been lovers. You had all those other women who chased after you; who were easy to seduce, and I would've permanently built an invisible wall between us. Polite, efficient, effective, and ultimately snarky. You would've probably thought I had an attitude, there was just something about me that got under your skin, but you couldn't exactly pinpoint it; however, I'm just so good at my job, that really, you couldn't complain. 

**Scenario 2: You are finally divorced and get rid of all your FWBs and side-chicks**

We just won a big account. The media is exaggerating facts and reporting it as a $30 million deal when really it's probably closer to $3 million for our small firm + commission. Your side-chicks need financial help again, and ringing you night and day, leaving more desperate messages by the hour describing their love for you; the love they suddenly realized they had, after getting into bed with half the men in town. I'll come into your office, as you get off the phone with one of them and say, *""Sir, I can come back at another time when it's more convenient for you to discuss the project details...""* 

You'll say, *""No, no. This is a good time...""* Maybe you'll look a little harried; the divorce has been hard on you, you're losing half your assets. Maybe between briefs, you'll mention how your wife is a dragon lady, but I'll remind you, *""Sir, in all honesty, I can understand your pain, but do you think you would've become the man you are now, if it weren't for her? If you had married someone else?""* What I say will make you stop and think, because all you have been doing is focusing on her verbal abuse, her anger, which was in turn, had ultimately been derived from you fucking around on her all those years. And she's a proud lady, but will never admit she is hurt, so instead she chips away at your armor instead, hoping to wound you, and she does. This is the vicious cycle you've been a part of for years; but now you are leaving her. 

Maybe I'll be the shoulder for you to cry on. You'll suddenly confess to me how women always use you, and leave you without thinking of how you also use women yourself. You see yourself as the victim in this situation. You'll tell me about the FWB who tried to trap you into some payment plan before realizing that you'd had a vasectomy. You'll tell me about the drug-addicted actress who always needs your financial help and emotional support, but when you do give it to her, the minute she feels better, she goes and fucks some guy with baby blue eyes, like she always does. You'll tell me how you always feel you'll be replaced, how you're afraid of being alone. And I'll listen to you. I'll say, *""Sir, you are too intelligent and too handsome to ever be alone.""* 

But, I feel alone, you'll say. 

**Alone** is a type of psychology - a mental prison you put yourself in. It's when you can't let go of the past, and close your heart to new beginnings. It's when you become indecisive and spread yourself thin. It's when you don't abide by your conscience, when you don't act according to how you'll like to be treated. 

And maybe, just maybe, when you let go of the past, is when you'll see that I've been waiting there all along, for you to do the right thing. I can only hope, but I won't be holding my breath.

I'm 21 and just got my MLO license back in December 2016. I got into the business because my father has been a real estate agent for over 30 years, and a loan originator for around 9. He said it would be a great part time gig for me to do while I'm in school, and something I could fall back on if I needed to.

Despite my father being in the business for so long, I had just about no knowledge of the housing industry before starting the online course for becoming an MLO. I learned what I needed to for passing the test, but now that that's over with, the ""real"" learning begins, haha. That's what everyone has told me, and I'm also finding.

 I'm pretty shy/sensitive and have a hard time dealing with people, so one of the reasons I wanted to do this was to break out of my shell and just be able to handle people in any given situation. But I'm just having such a hard time bringing myself to talking to people about this, because I still feel I know so little and it doesn't feel right to give them advice or even talk to them about it.

I'm basically working as an intern right now. My dad paired me up with another LO/Processor in our office that has 18+ years experience in the industry, and she's been the front person for me while I'm learning. I'm getting myself solid on the different loan programs out there, but that's only a fraction of it. I've heard it all just really comes with time, but I still don't enjoy this clueless feeling. As I've been learning and seeing each different situation that can come up, I'm getting very stressed out and it's not too pleasant (esp. as someone who is dealing with a lot of health issues at the moment, haha).

**TL;DR** - New MLO. I feel clueless when faced with situations in the work field and get very nervous/scared when dealing with people (I am working as more of an intern at the moment so I can really ""learn"").

I’m looking to ease my way back into IT after taking a minor course deviation into more of the development side of things. My end-goal is either System Administration or Network Administration/Engineering. I graduated last year with dual degrees, BS in Computer Science &amp; BA in Information Systems, and I just recently passed my A+. I’m expecting to get my Network+ within the next 4 weeks or so. 

I have a year of Tier-1 Help Desk when I was working at my school a few of years ago, however since then I’ve worked a couple of internships which aren’t related all that much to entry-level IT jobs, and I also did some private computer science tutoring for high-fail weed-out courses.

A few questions:

1) Will the two degrees hurt my chances of getting an entry level help desk job? A part of me thinks that hiring managers might skip over me because they think I will hop ship soon, which wouldn’t be the case. 

2) I’ve already been turned down by a few jobs through Robert Half because the employers/clients said my internships were unrelated. Do you think the sys admin and dev/QA internships are going to hurt my chances with a large number of employers or are these experiences through a recruiting agency flukes?

3) Is it ok to put the more relevant experience higher up (non-chronological order)?

4) Down the road I plan on getting my CCNA &amp; MCSA. I’ve heard that one of my local community colleges has a great CCNA prep program that involves two courses. I think I might do this just to get the hands-on experience along with the benefits of being enrolled again at a college (networking and the college job board). Is taking classes for the CCNA overkill if I already have the Network+ cert, versus self-study?

Anyways, basically she's an intern right now and she had to go into her boss's office for some paperwork. As she was doing it, her boss (a woman perhaps in her late 50s or 60s) asked her what ethnicity she was. My friend responded that she was Mexican and continued doing the paperwork. Just as an aside, she has no accent, was born in the US, and has a white parent which shows in some of her features so there's not even a really shallow reason that would make her boss ask the following (I mean, it's rude in general but I'm just trying to emphasize that it was REALLY unfounded) but yeah, her boss asked her if she was legal.

My friend said she was kind of shocked to be asked the question and didn't know what to say, so she just said ""yes"" and then her boss went on to say something like ""Don't worry, I hate Trump.""

She said it was super strange and she got almost kind of teary eyed in the moment, it was just really surprising. She asked me if she should report the boss or talk to the boss or something but 1) neither of us has ever reported something before so I don't know how that would go, especially because she's the boss, 2) if she were to talk to the boss (I'm guessing she's just extremely ignorant, not evil or anything, so maybe she'll be met with ""I was joking"" or something) what would she even say? and 3) she's only there for a couple more months so she's not sure if it's worth the trouble. It definitely rubs me the wrong way though, like what kind of boss says shit like that? What was the point?

We're both had shit said to us before but never in this strange boss situation, so I've been really unsure about what advice to give. Anyone undergone something similar and know what to do?  


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Asking for a friend who asked for my advice: her boss asked her if she was ""legal"" at work and it made her really uncomfortable, not sure if any further action is needed or if she should say something, not sure it's worth the trouble. "

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
5yvljo,1,2017-03-11,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5yvljo/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time. All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I also know I have terrible concentration and really have to force myself to focus. It gets pretty irritating and I didn't know if having bad vision contributed to this?

I used to be so full of energy. I was the life of the party. I would stay up all night trying to cheer my friends up, and would be an absolute joy to all of my customers/clients.

Even when my mom almost died twice in 2013, I held my head up high and kept moving forward. Nobody at work ever had any idea what I was going through. In fact, my nickname was ""Smiles"" I would literally always smile or have an overall positive expression. Some people thought I was crazy!

But in April 2014, depression struck like a bullet. Out of nowhere it came. I would show some signs of ""darkness"" growing inside of me such as episodes of aggression and hostility towards my co-workers. It happened right after I was fired from my first internship after 2 weeks. I wasn't up to their level. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life as the *entire* company watched as I was escorted out of the office with all of my belongings in hand.

I have moved past that whole experience career-wise and am having a very successful career for somebody at my age. I married the love of my life. I have a big and beautiful apartment, multiple pets, a nice car and a career with a great future outlook. On paper, I have won. 

But I am still depressed. So maybe there was no direct cause after all. I have gone through 3 different medications before finding the one that I can tolerate.

There is an all-out war going on in my head. I have visions of hypothetical situations that almost seem real. I had a vision of my best friend regrouping with his high school posse and turning on me. And I think of my mistakes from the past and break down situations and beat myself up for my bad decisions. Even some minuscule situations from over a decade ago. And I still haven't gotten over my ex-best friend calling me a *""fat n-word""* in front of all of his friends. I have forgiven him yet sometimes I think about it and it eats me up.

Last night was really hard for me. I was being eaten up by the past. I didn't want to go to sleep angry. I wanted to stay up and fight it. I had to constantly ask myself what caused me to be like this?

I completely rambled. Finally talking about my depression out loud has made me feel so strange. I don't even know where to begin. "

5ywtvv,339,2017-03-11,101 Resume Writing,ibarmy,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ywtvv/101_resume_writing/,"Hi Guys, 

As part of my work profile, I often have to hire associates, interns wagera for my projects and its amazingly shocking to see crazy ass resumes even from 'good' colleges in India and getting a big red flag right in the beginning. 

Resumes matter a lot during the initial years of your hiring cause you are still new and always dont get work via references. So the foremost way of putting an impression is 'resume' and 'cover letter'. Also the way you format your resume shows how good are your skills in formatting and presentation, which in the initial years of kutta kaam of associate, you have to do a lot. I am just sharing some of my thoughts on how resumes should be written. Feel free to change and add things to it. 

#Basics

1. Resume is about you and only you, but doesnt mean I get to see these details . 

- Your parents name 

- your birthplace 

- your current city of residence

- yOUR PHOTOGRAPH - No just fuck no !

- your blood group 

- Your age 

- your declaration/ objective on botton/top stating you wanna change the world or be the best damn engineer. 


As a employer, I get atleast 200 - 300 job applications for a post, so best to show you got the skills right in the beginning.  The chronology possible is this

- Name and Address / Email / Phone number 

I personally am an asshole on my CV, so I usually just give my professional email account and phone number. I dont like giving out address, AADHAR is doing enough damage to my privacy, wouldnt wanna add more to that stupidity. 

- Education 

All degrees from the latest to the bachelors. Never ever mention your schools except if you are drunk and in delhi, where conversations follow from school allegiances. 

So Phd then masters and then bachelors. If you wrote these in these programs mention it or other terminal projects. Please dont mention GPA if its less than 3.5/4 or 7.5 or 8/10. 

if you got an award, happily mention that below the school you got it from. Please keep off anything which does not show you in the best light. 

As you get advanced degrees, or electives towards a certain competency, mention those subjects. I usually go 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
College ABC                                                                          2010 - 2012

Thesis: Critical analysis of RBI Policy 2015 - 16

Case Study:  Banwarilal bank, India

Coursework: Awesomeness101, Awesomeness102, Excel Awesomeness 201, Excel Awesomeness 202, Bakchodi Writing 101 etc etc.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Work Experience

If you have more than 2-3 years of experience, unless and until your summer internships were super coveted in college and hi fi like nomura/ Bloomberg kinds, please dont mention internship just to ensure the experience section is lonnnnggggg. 

always tailor make your resume and mention your relevant experience. If job is asking about coding, write about coding you did in the previous job/s. If the job is suggesting management of younger associates will be present, show how you managed team/s even informally with words like 'LEAD'/ 'Led' and mention how any members were in the teams. 
For instance, 'Led a three member team to analyze the performances of stock patwarilal from 2012-2017'. 

Also another big red flag (personally for me) is looking at the same word being repeated in the work ex. as it shows weak writing skills. Dont repeat 'conducted' again and again. Change it to conducted, executed, evaluated yada yada. 


- Core competencies and Skills 

Can/Should be your third section and include all the important skills you have for this job. if the job is not asking about GIS skills, please dont mention ARCGIS and QGIS and GIS wagera in it. 

in Skills go ahead and mention your writing and analytical skills and in tandem with education section upar. 

Competencies with softwares, languages and other platforms important in your field.

- and lastly #Achievements

Please dont  mention all the things you won during school in 6th/ 7th class wagera. If you are an olympiad winner in school or NTSE scholar wagera then only mention. Nobody needs to know you were 100 % attendance wala kid in school. Always mention scholarships and anything which separates you from your class in college/university. 


#Formatting. 

1. If you dont know how is MS word operating, please check templates in MS Office on Resumes, they are plenty and very clean designs too. 

2. Instead of pressing space bar to show gap between two lines, select the two lines on MS office and right click to click on paragraphs. As part of the box which pops up, there is something called spacing with which you can regulate spacing between two lines. Select 1.15  which is decent spacing. In some academic circles the spacing goes between 1.5 - 2  which is okay since they have luxury of space. You do not, which brings me to the next thing. 

3. Bullets: Dont use big big bullets to show all the work you did. Keep it simple and use dash. or little square bullets. 

4. Always proof read your CV. Make sure dots are present where they should be. No random typo. In a few CVs I have got this too .. XYZ Public School ki jagah XYZ Pubic School. 

5. Page numbers. 

Keep it clean simple and crisp. Make it one page. As work piles up, the CV can become 2 pages, but thats it. If you are not in academic circles, always make sure your CV never goes beyond 2 pages. NEVER EVER. REpeat after me. NEVER EVER. 


This is all for now, will add as things pop up in my mind.

5yx23v,1,2017-03-11,I [26F] am getting blown of by my boyfriend [27M] on our date nights (lately) and it's starting to become a problem.,herewegoagain6665,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5yx23v/i_26f_am_getting_blown_of_by_my_boyfriend_27m_on/,"Yet another evening, and one of a few Saturday nights, where I should be hanging out with my boyfriend - I'm not. 

To give some backstory, my boyfriend Hunter (27) and I have been dating for a little over 7 months now, on an exclusive level that is. We actually were seeing each other for around 2 months before telling each other we had strong feelings for one another. Our relationship is strong, and in general, we have no issues whatsoever. The inly issue that I have is that lately, Hunter has been blowing off our date nights for hanging out/going out with his friends (20sM). It's starting to take a toll on my confidence and feelings towards our relationship.

Currently, I am in my last semester of school (finally - after 6.5 years!), which makes things very busy on my end. Even though I am not working (part tine, co-op, or intern), I have still been very busy. Hunter is currently finishing up his Master (MBA), which he will be done in the ""Fall/2017"". Since both of us are busy with school, we don't spend a lot of time hanging out throughout the week. Since the beginning of our relationship, we made a deal that we would make date nights (once a week - min), and try to spend as much time as we could together. Now, we both have lives, friends, and like doing our own thing. I never have wanted Hunter to ever drop his friends or his life for me at all (same on his end too). But, when we have put together ""date nights"" or have made plans, I expect him to follow through on them. 

For the last 3 months (at least), it seems that Hunter either forgets, or wants to change plans whenever he feels like it. There have been at least 4 times, where we were supposed to meet up/hang out/date night, and I was blown off because he wanted to go out with his""friends"". There have been occasions where he left plans that we made to hang out, go out and drink, and/or party with his friends. Thus, I would **maybe** pick him up, or he would get dropped off at my place to stay the night (we both live at home). I have nothing against him doing his own thing, and/or hanging out with friends. But, it's starting to get old when he tells me about offers he gets ""last minute"", and then can't pass them up. Then if I see him later, the only thing he wants to do is have sex, talk for a bit, and then go to bed. It annoys the hell out of me. 

The same thing happened tonight! Actually, the last time this happened was close to 3 weeks ago now, if I remember correctly. Hunter was invited over to my place for dinner, where my parents made a nice taco dinner for some family and family friends. He agreed to this a few days ahead of time, confirming he would go. But guess what? I get a call from him a few hours ago (around 5ish), with him telling me he had to go out for his friends birthday tonight. I was so upset. I asked him why he didn't tell me ahead of time, or when I invited him to this. He basically said he didn't find out about going out till this morning. Once again, an evening we planned to hang out is no longer happening. I'm frustrated, and I need to bite this in the ass immediately. No more. 

I am going to be heading to the gym for an evening work out, so I won't see/comment on any comments for more info needed (if nec.) for a few hours at least. Any thoughts on this situation? Thank you.

There's a lot to it that made it bad (just read stories from /r/asianparentstories), but having been away from it for a few months in college (intentionally the one 7 hours away) and having my mental state gradually improve, I really don't want to go back. I'm know my parents know that I really hate working there, but it's never stopped them from making me work (tried running away once, still had to work that day lmao), especially now that I'm legally an adult and I shouldn't be ""sitting home all day doing *nothing*"" even if it's a personal project or something that will help me get better opportunities in the future.

Sorry about the rant but that's why I *need* something to do this summer, preferably something that pays but doesn't need to. I've applied to a few internships and research spots, but I haven't gotten any replies. I can't work retail because I won't be able to work past the summer since I'm 7 hours away for college and I'll also probably need to take about 2 weeks off total in the summer.

## **Student's Piazza post**

&gt; **Advice for dropping out of college as an EECS major**
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if there are any previous posts regarding this so I decided to make my own. My circumstances right now:
&gt; 
&gt; - I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS
&gt; 
&gt; - This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C, 70, and EE16A
&gt; 
&gt; - I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional freelance work
&gt; 
&gt; - I am from a very low-income family and I am the main source of income
&gt; 
&gt; My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my family's survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm dramatizing that, but I can't really think of a better way to put it.
&gt; 
&gt; This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time, all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing such a job, but naturally I'm afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I'm a transfer in the engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer as another option, though.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, I'm considering dropping out to support my family before we go homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.

A student wrote:

&gt; I am very sorry to hear about your situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you considering finding an internship over the summer? You seem like a very resilient person, and after all the tribulations life has thrown at you, I am sure finding an internship will be no problem. Given how well internships pay, you can both take care of your family and not drop out of school.
&gt; 
&gt; Please hang in there. You can do it. Just one more year to go, then you can find a comfortable full time software engineering job with your Berkeley degree without any problems. College, and especially the world's best colleges like Berkeley, lift their graduates out of poverty into the middle class. You won't need to worry about finances any more then. You're so close. Don't give up.

The OP wrote:

&gt; OP here. Thank you for the kind words. An internship has certainly been one of my options. Unfortunately, it may only be a temporary fix if I continue to attend school full-time in the next academic year.

## **Student's comment**

A student wrote:

&gt; EECS transfer here. I think you have five semesters in total, and I heard you can postpone graduating if you do a co-op or full-time internship. Please talk to your ESS advisor as they know the stuff best! Besides, there are a lot of resources to support transfers. Talk to Tiffany Reardon at ESS! All the best. 

The OP wrote:

&gt; OP here. Thank you for this information! I wasn't aware of any postponement policies, so I'll confirm this with an advisor very soon.

## **Student's comment**

A student wrote:

&gt; After freshman year, I ""dropped out"" of Berkeley CoE. Then I worked as a software engineer and was making ~$50/hour. Then I decided to go back to school after 2 years. Afterwards, I still had an offer to work part time but I decided to focus on school. Like you, I also had 0 EFC.
&gt; 
&gt; Your income may affect your financial aid EFC. However, if your parent/parents that you put on your FAFSA has a income under the zero EFC threshold, you will get the automatic 0 EFC. Which means that no matter how much money you earn, if you qualify for 0 EFC, you will still get the 0 EFC.
&gt; 
&gt; Hypothetically, if you work part time for 20 hours a week and $30/hour, you'd be making $2500 pre tax which would be good enough to cover your family expenses if you keep things budgeted. Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might be enough to barely scrape by.
&gt; 
&gt; One reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate. I'd suggest that you try to find a way to make ends meet and graduate soon so that you can get a full job.
&gt; 
&gt; [Warning: Next part is something most people initially won't agree with. But I'm just sharing my personal experience on how I made careful decisions to make ends meet]. Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt. This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding. If you want to take a gamble that you will be able to find a good six figure job after you graduate, consider going into debt. $1 today is as valuable as $0.20 in a few years.
&gt; 
&gt; (As a side story, my mom passed away within the past year meaning i am no longer eligible for the 0 EFC next year and my income counts against me. However, I can submit a appeal for student contribution. Also, you can get a appeal for budget adjustment to get more financial aid.)
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to ask any questions about my own experience

The OP wrote:

&gt; Thank you for sharing this. Could you clarify what you mean by going into debt? I'm already taking out federal loans and, aside from borrowing from people I personally know, I don't see how private loans would have 0% interest. My initial plan was to rely on my federal grants/loans and I was fairly confident I could land a decent job right after graduating to pay them off asap, but my circumstances have changed such that I now would need to take out more loans to go down that same route (something I consider riskier than just trying to find a job now and finishing school later).

A student wrote:

&gt; (I'm the author of the initial response thread). By going into debt, I mean using it to make ends meet while you work towards graduating. My situation was probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months. This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn't use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn't cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.
&gt; 
&gt; One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a software developer. Then while you're there, save enough to help you get through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay, then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21 months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent salary.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I think i'm writing in circles, but I hope this clarified things without making things more  confusing. Feel free to ask more questions.

A student commented:

&gt; I'm the author of the initial response thread). Oh, one more clarification I have to make. My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money. If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.

## **Student's comment**

A student commented:

&gt; I just wanted to say that I wish you the best of luck with your situation. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to follow the EECS curriculum while supporting your family. All I know is that you must be extremely capable, smart, and hardworking if you've made it this far, and I'm sure that will help you a lot in your professional future. Keep going, you've made it so far!

## **Students' discussion**

A student commented:

&gt; Are you white or Asian? If so, you're already privileged so this situation shouldn't be a problem. Just use your privilege!

A student commented:

&gt; are you serious? No point to be a troll under this post

A student commented:

&gt; Not a troll. Whites and Asians are privileged. They don't need help. Only minorities, LGBQT, etc. are victims. 

A student commented:

&gt; Glad this page is not totally anonymous so at least staff members could know who this ridiculous person is ;)

A student commented:

&gt; Let's please not make jokes here. This person (and the commmenter above) is revealing some highly personal information, and we should be mature about it. I, too, am not a fan of political correctness but this is the wrong forum to attack political correctness.

A student commented:

&gt; I think it's relevant though. I have a slight feeling that the OP is Asian. He/she should know how the left views them: as overprivileged, monotonous automatons.

A student commented:

&gt; What does this have to do with anything? OP is just asking for advice, and not once mentioned privilege or anything like that.

A student commented:

&gt; Not sure how you assumed the OP was Asian. Also, it may be true the left views Asians and whites in the way you described. In fact, many posters in the ""Town halls too politically correct"" expressed that view. So that may be correct. However, by bringing this up, you're using the OP's plight to make a political point, which is not related to the discussion at all.

A student commented:

&gt; At the risk of getting dragged into a fruitless debate, perhaps we should be mindful of the fact that everybody's personal situation and experiences are different. Trying to stereotype people, assign characteristics to arbitrary groups of people, and otherwise deny people their individual identities, thoughts, and feelings is unhelpful and harmful. This is regardless of whether it's done for comedic effect, to make a political point, or whether it stereotypes ""whites"", ""asians"", ""the left"", ""the right"", ""LGBQT people"".

A student commented:

&gt; Asians aren't a monolithic group, either. Some groups are overall underprivileged, like southeast Asians.

An instructor replied:

&gt; Why is this relevant or helpful? Please, try to be sensitive. This should be a supportive space; please try to be helpful and kind. The admins can see your names and we will not tolerate trolling.

5yxlvm,60,2017-03-12,I Quit My First Day at Strood Funeral Home,SleepinMongoose,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yxlvm/i_quit_my_first_day_at_strood_funeral_home/,"I walked through the hall in a half dead stupor. My head pounded from the previous night’s drinks and I was hardly in bed for 4 hours. I felt along the wall for the light switch as I made my way down the hallway. The corridor walls were marked with spots where pictures of them used to hang. I could no longer bear to see their faces.

The cold showers were painful. I used to enjoy the luxury of a steaming bathroom but those days are long gone. Without the icy sting I couldn’t function. Long gone were the days where I woke feeling well rested and eager to take on the world. Now I moped, and forced myself to get up to writhe my way from the grips of endless depression.

The internship was the only thing that kept me going. That and Dr. Pearson. He was like a father to me since my parent’s accident in that damn blizzard. I stopped going to class but I aced my way through physiology and genetics without incident. He vouched for me after noticing my tests scores when the dean pushed for my expulsion following my lack of attendance. He even got me my job in the cadaver lab.

I left every morning by 5:30 to arrive by 6. I had a key to let myself into the science building and prep the lab and bodies by 7. Some days I was rushed because the drive in held me up. This winter seemed to never end and the harsh maelstroms never stopped. The roads that day were particularly dangerous, a fresh powder laid over the icy roads, and the winds howled fiercely. Just like the day my parents died.

I arrived at 6:30 with my heart racing. I fumbled at the door with my gloves and the small case which housed the fuel warming sticks. My hands shook as I put the case in my pocket with my lighter. Driving always gives me anxiety now. I unlocked the door and made my way down the dimly lit halls. Most people would probably be uneasy in the dark heading to a handful of dead bodies all alone. I just didn’t care anymore though. But I knew I owed Pearson a lot for what he had done for me.

I started my routine like usual. I badged into the lab and made sure to secure the door behind me. It’s not a room you can accidentally walk into, and for good reason. I rubbed my hands together with a shiver. They kept the temperatures low to prevent further decomposition and smell. Most people have this idea that it smells like rot in there, but it mostly just has a chemical smell. The bodies are drained of fluids (as best as possible) and loaded with preservatives. To prevent the outer tissues from decay I sprayed them with a solution regularly which basically looks like a weed sprayer.

At this point in the classes dissected the superficial layer of skin and the inner tissues were exposed. The yellowing muscle fibers were apparent over the more defined bodies while older, less fit individuals had a tendency to look mushy. The human body wasn’t as pretty as the illustrations in the anatomy book. They weren’t as uniform looking either.

I took a broom next and swept up the bits of tissue which weren’t picked up from the class the night before. Loose tissues were properly disposed of in a separate bucket that would not make it into a typical landfill. The bodies would be worked on throughout the semester then finally incinerated. A thank you event would be thrown by the university for the families of the deceased.

As repulsive as the job was to the average person it really wasn’t that bad. After the initial shock of seeing the bodies it was nothing more than accepting mortality like everyone else would have to. Something I already had to do with my parents. The only thing I hated about the job was how curious it made me. I never realized how morbid I was and how fascinated I could be. I longed to do more. On that day my dream came true.

I nearly jumped out of my skin when the door to the lab opened well ahead of Pearson’s usual arrival. It was a rather large man, with a stern intimidating look on his face. His facial hair was cut with precision and his eyes pierced through the lenses in his plastic frames. In one hand he clutched a full sized model of a skeleton with a heavy support base like you’d see in a typical anatomy class. His voice was deep and booming, “Hello, young man. My name is Mordecai Strood, would you happen to be Jason?”

I was taken back for the second time that morning. I hesitantly moved from behind the corpse on the table beside me, “Yes sir, is there something I can help you with? Do you have access to this room regularly?”

Mordecai chuckled with a wide smile, “I apologize, I forget that I tend to sneak up on people in here. I own a funeral home on the north end of town. I occasionally work in here with Dr. Pearson to help prep the bodies for students. He asked me to take you under my wing.”

It was a recent dream, but a dream come true nonetheless. I jumped for joy and jarred my glasses loose. I shrugged to push them up, my gloved hands were covered with cadaver juice. Dr. Pearson had requested his old friend from med school let me intern for him and I accepted in a heart-beat. Starting that day I would finish up my classwork, go to my job at the hospital, and spend two hours a night with Mr. Strood to see if the path of a mortician was right for me.

Mordecai left that morning with his model skeleton and class dragged that afternoon. The day was filled with tension. Pearson never showed up for whatever reason and I was constantly bothered to do the maintenance on the bodies that he normally would have done. All I could think of was my internship later that night and just wanted to leave. I didn’t even care that we were facing another blizzard. Not everyone felt the same though.

As I approached the cafeteria I saw a crowd of people gathered around my friend Christina. She was tall, thin, blonde, and all around gorgeous. She was taking criminal justice courses with her boyfriend, Curtis. The two of them hit it off quickly when they found out about their common hometowns back in Florida. How they ended up traveling across the country north is a mystery to me, but they hated the snow.

Curtis was a car fanatic with a penchant for speed. Driving in the snow isn’t a race though. His vehicle careened through the light at the highway exit up the road and he got hit by oncoming traffic. I felt so sorry for her. He was in real bad shape, or so I heard.

I was extra careful when I left school that day. I finally had something to live for, even if it was focused on death ironically. I got to work and hoped my shift would be uneventful. I worked patient transport so my night depended on how sick or injured the populace was. Today was busy, car accidents left and right. Not to mention a nasty flu outbreak. It wouldn’t be a relaxing night before I started my internship.

Thankfully Ed worked that night and kept the mood light. He was a few years older than me and always tried to cheer me up since I was typically a real downer, and I knew it was the truth. Ed was what most people called a burnout. I didn’t care for the term because he wasn’t a lazy guy, in fact he was one of the most devoted workers in the whole facility. He just never had any ambition to do anything else. He drove the same crummy car since high school, to the same job he’s had since he was 18, staying at the same low rent one bedroom apartment, and he took the affection of literally any woman that would give it. Ed was complacent with most things in life and never excelled at much, but the guy could tell a story like no other.

The topic of today’s tale, the Strood funeral home. Naturally since I was going to work in the creepy god forsaken basement of a funeral home with dead people my mentor was labelled a crazy old man who murdered his victims and buried them right on the grounds. I told him to shut up, but he insisted that he wasn’t lying. It was a local legend. That old man Strood lost his son and his wife too, driving him insane. I had to hand it to him, he almost made me believe him for a minute.

After finally hearing enough tall tales I split from Ed and went to work in ICU taking patients from their rooms down to radiology when I saw Christina crying in the hallway. Undoubtedly Curtis was in intensive care. As much as I wanted to talk to her I knew that I had to distance myself from the situation. I knew how hard it was to have a loved one sustain injury in an accident, and I was the last person to give advice on how to cope.

As the night came to a close I sat down in the transport office and relaxed while I stared at the time clock. My eyes were fixated in the deepest stare until I heard the buzzer for the door to the lower level entrance. I stepped out into the hall and much to my surprise at the door was Mordecai. He waved me over and I hurried to open the door.

Mordecai shivered as he quickly stepped inside, “Thank you, my friend. I forgot my badge at home. Is your shift almost done, we have work to do.” I was taken back once more by this odd, giant of a man. I told him I just needed to punch out and to sit tight. He chuckled, “Take your time, our client isn’t in a rush.”

By the time I put my coat on Mordecai already put me to work. He instructed me to go outside to his hearse and wheel the bed up. It was cold but I came prepared with the fuel sticks I would stuff in my gloves. It only took me a moment to figure out how to unfold the bed and unlock the wheels. The setup was similar to the patient beds I worked with on a daily basis.

As the two of us made our way down to the morgue he urged me forth to badge us in. The hulking man adjusted his black tie as he took a sigh. “Have you heard the news yet, son?” My brow furled as I shook my head. Mordecai placed his large hand on my shoulder as he delivered the heart wrenching news. Mr. Pearson, the man who had been looking out for me like a father was killed in a gruesome accident earlier that morning while passing the College exit. As I soon pieced together, in the collision which also involved Curtis.

Mordecai gave me a moment to process the news as I leaned on the slab which the body bag rested. The large man lowered his head muttering a prayer before approaching Pearson’s corpse. “If you plan to settle down and work as a mortician it is only a matter of time before you see the body of a friend or loved one. I didn’t plan for this to come tonight, but it may be for the best to let you decide if this is the right path for you. You’ve seen cadavers, but not a body.”

The sound of the zipper echoed off the cold metal drawers which housed the bodies of the deceased. I knew that Mordecai was right. To be a mortician you needed to a place to work, and unless you traveled a great distance for work every day, eventually you’d see a familiar face from the community. The day had to come, so why not now? I leaned over the edge of the bed to make eye contact with Mr. Pearson one last time. It wasn’t like the almost inhuman gaze of the dissected cadavers. His mouth was stained with blood and the bruising around his eyes was immense. The eyes were cold and lifeless, no longer emanating their lively, inviting aura.

I nodded my head as I reached over Mordecai’s hand to close Mr. Pearson’s eyes. He zipped the bag shut with a nod of approval, “I’m proud of you, boy.” The gentle man told me to step outside and get some water, that I was off the hook for loading the body tonight. I used the restroom, wet my face, got a drink and contemplated if this was really the right thing for me today. After a few minutes of soul searching I came to my senses and decided it was worth exploring more. By the time I got back Mordecai was waiting next to the wheeled bed, freshly loaded with a body. But Mr. Pearson’s body still lay in the same place.

“Are we not taking Mr. Pearson?” I asked him with a shaky voice.

Mordecai addressed me with a calm tone, “No, son. We weren’t called for him, I just received the news and had to see for myself. We were actually called for this young man. Immediately my mind conjured images of a grieving Christina, I should’ve comforted her. I reached for the zipper to see for myself as I had done before, Mordecai quickly grabbed me by the wrist though.

He gave me a melancholic stare, “There’s not much left to see.”

I shuddered at the thought of Curtis being disfigured, but that was the reality of this line of work. I helped Mordecai load the body with an exasperated gasp as the harsh winds stung my face. My cheeks were nearly as red as the bags under my eyes were purple. I made my way to the passenger seat, my legs were noodles, and I plopped hard onto the seatbelt. I closed my eyes as I breathed heavily trying to clutch the hand warming cases in my gloves even tighter.

I felt something press against my arm as I quickly looked over towards Mordecai, “Drink this, and eat. You’re malnourished, boy. You have to be strong both mentally and physically for this job.” I took the water bottle from his hand and the apple in the bag beside me. I had lost 15 pounds since my parents died. I probably looked just as bad as Mr. Pearson did.

Mordecai drove cautiously through the inclement weather, but I was still on edge. The road was barely visible as the snow blew into the windshield horizontally and the drifts of snow whipped across the pavement. As we reached the north side the snow subsided just a bit as the heavy tree cover of the forest loomed over the street. We made our way deeper into the woods, and up the hill to Mordecai’s home. The place where he lived, worked, and rested. A place where the dead rested too. A long driveway curved up at a steep incline towards the old 2 story building. The building itself was an old chapel, it even still had the cross on top, though it was backed by a strange triangle. I’m not particularly religious so I didn’t know if it bore any significance.

Along either side of the driveway was a small drop, followed by headstones. Apparently before Mordecai bought the place years ago it was a regular site of worship and burial for the townspeople in the early 1900s.

The long hearse puttered its way up the drive until eventually we began to slide. Mordecai stopped and stepped out of the vehicle walking around to my door. He opened it with a mischievous, yet unnerving grin. “Well son, I told you that this job required physical strength and I meant it. The car isn’t going to make it up the hill. I’m going to bring you a shovel, then I want you to wheel the body up the rest of the way.”

I was taken back by the absurd request which I initially thought was a joke. Sure enough though, Mordecai made his way to the house and back with a shovel and bucket of salt in hand. Then he made his way inside. It was dark and I was cold. My face felt like it was being stung by dozens of bees as the freezing wind chill coursed through me. Pearson stuck his neck out for me and then he was gone. I wouldn’t let him down.

It took me an hour to clear the snow and put down enough salt to create a decent enough clearing to wheel Curtis’ body up the hill. I wanted to rest but I knew it was best to keep my momentum so I went straight to it. With a heave I lowered the bed onto the snowy drive. The wind blew hard from my left as I slowly began my ascent. My feet slipped as I tried to dig the chunks of salt into the grooves on the bottom of my shoes for traction. No longer did I feel the cold as I began to sweat and lean all of my body weight into the bed.

Surprisingly all went without incident, until I reached the top of the driveway. In a moment of sheer stupidity I paused to catch my breath and stepped away from Curtis. I checked my phone in a moment of weakness to scroll through Facebook. I stared in confusion at the most recent status, “Christina Janes: HE IS GOING TO BE OKAY!” Then a heavy gust tore through the area and the bed rolled straight past me, down the small incline, and crashed beside a pair of headstones. I was petrified of what I had done until the moment of the crash. I expected to hear a dull thud, but instead I heard sharp clanks. I approached the body, carefully making my way down, looking behind me quickly to see if Mordecai had witnessed my screw up.

I reached down to the corpse to feel. To my surprise, it was almost plastic feeling. I knew the sight would be gruesome but I had to see for myself at this point since Christina’s post perplexed me. I held my breath fearing the smell of decay and the sight of gore as I unzipped the bag. The bag didn’t house the body of Curtis though, it was the model skeleton I had seen Mordecai with hours before. I was completely confused and a bit upset. Had I just done all this work so Mordecai could try to prove a point about my physical well-being? I know he didn’t know that I was acquainted with Curtis, but this seems to have drawn the line.

I paced in anger trying to plan my next move. I was exhausted from all the work I had done. Mordecai was right, I hadn’t been taking care of myself and he proved his point, but this was wrong. As I planned what I would say to him I noticed the pair of gravestones next to the overturned bed. The first read, ‘James Strood, Age 4’. The second was blank, marked with the strange cross I had seen earlier. Maybe Ed was right, maybe the guy’s son died and he did go off his rocker, but was the unmarked grave next to it his wife?

While I pondered this in the snow the cold got to me and I quickly got my mind back on the task at hand. I was going inside to demand Mordecai bring me back to my car at the hospital. I was so furious I even left his bed laying in the snow. I opened the heavy double doors to the old church with a gasp. There was a hallway to my left and immediately on my right a large open room filled with pews where I’m sure church services used to be held, but eulogies were given now. I walked into the open room first calling out for Mordecai to no reply. I glared around the room at the strange crosses carved into the pews, each one backed with the triangle as I had seen outside.

I didn’t know the difference from a Baptist or a Catholic, but I know in my 22 years of life I had never seen this symbol even in passing. I walked up to the pedestal at the head of the room which sat in front of a large curtain. A bible lay on top of the surface, or at least I thought it was a bible initially. The cover of the book was again marked with that strange cross, and as I flipped through it, the symbols inside looked like nothing I had ever seen. I focused on the markings under the light of my phone looking for anything at all that resembled a familiar character from any language I could think of to no avail. That was when a shiver ran down my spine.

“I bet your professors back at school never showed you a book like that, son.” Mordecai chuckled at the other end of the room. I could just barely make out the unnerving grin on his face in the darkness. “I thought I asked you to bring the body up?”

I don’t know if it was the depression or the confusion talking, but I snapped, “Fuck you, is this some kind of sick game. That’s not a body out there. What’s wrong with you?”

Mordecai slowly approached, he was no longer grinning. “I gave you a golden opportunity, boy! Are you feeling tired now?”

I had had enough. I took the book off the podium and threw it to the ground, preparing myself to storm past Mordecai. Instead I strolled past with a lazy, labored gait until I realized he grabbed the hood of my jacket. The rest goes hazy.

My neck wasn’t sore so I don’t think he choked me out, and my head didn’t have any bumps. I wasn’t quite sure what happened but my cell phone was gone, and I was alone in a dark room. The only light source was a small frosted window on the wall towards the ceiling, so I must have been in a basement. I felt around the wall for a light switch to no avail, but I did find a door handle. I shook the door hard until I began to panic.

That’s when I heard his voice from the other side, “I’m sorry I had to do that to you. The fumes work fast, but you shouldn’t be harmed, my young friend.”

“Please let me go! I won’t tell anyone, please just let me leave!” I pleaded, never had I desired to live so badly.

Mordecai opened the door and I scurried back along the dusty cement floor until I hit the cold wall behind me. “A long time ago I lost my son, and my wife fell ill as well. I couldn’t bear to lose her too so I started searching every last medical text I could. That is when I happened upon a fellow intellectual, our mutual friend Mr. Pearson. He promised he could help my wife in exchange for my discretion and service. He needed my help as I need yours!”

“What do you want from me, Pearson was a doctor! I’m not qualified, I’m just a student!” I cried out with a shakiness in my voice.

The hulking man closed the door behind him softly and gently approached me with an outstretched hand, “I’m not looking for medical expertise, I’m looking for someone like me. A person who understands the hardships and cruelties of a life taken far too soon! Pearson recognized that same quality in me and showed me that there is a way to defy the laws of nature in this world with the right texts!”

I didn’t know what to do, but resistance was clearly futile against this looming giant. I reached for his hand, “Plenty of people know death, why me?”

“You’re smart, Jason. You can stomach it, and most importantly you’re young. Far younger than I was when I started my work here. With luck you could work for decades into the unknown and revolutionize how this world views life! I am offering you a choice, you may leave, I only ask that you let me show you one last thing before you do.” Mordecai begged me as he held open the door.

I followed him out into the hallway. The cement floors were cold and the wooden ceiling beams were exposed and filled with spider webs. The smell of chemicals grew stronger as we delved further into the basement. Mordecai pulled out an archaic key ring opening the door at the end of the hall.

The room was small with a countertop lined with bottles of chemicals undoubtedly used for the embalming process. A lone light swung overhead in the center of the room. Mordecai locked the door behind me and I began to shake. He moved towards the countertop where another copy of the strange tome I saw upstairs rested. He walked to the back of the room in darkness where I heard the unlocking of another door followed by a hatch opening on the side of the wall. The madman reached in and pulled a body out of what seemed to be a chute and dropped it on the floor.

Mordecai peered down into the book and began chanting something in some archaic language lost to man years prior. There seemed to be whispers echoing through the walls and the light began to flicker. That was when I saw it. From behind the bed came forth the most disturbing creature. An amalgamation of corpses haphazardly fused as if sewn together. Their yellowing limbs left a moist trail behind them as it limped along the hard cement floor. The head was almost human in appearance, female in specific. A harrowed look of sorrow was on its face and it wailed in agony as it approached the corpse.

Mordecai stopped chanting and directed his gaze at me, “Don’t you see, child! My wife is still with me, even after death, but her form is not yet complete! If we work together we can perfect the process! We can give her the life she was owed, we can revive your parents, and we can defeat death ourselves!”

I rushed to the door crashing into it with my shoulder over and over, shouting as loud as I could for anyone at all to hear me. I looked behind me as I saw the ghastly creature loom over the corpse feeding with a blood curdling sound. The sloshing of guts and sinew tearing will never leave my mind. Mordecai chanted throughout the ordeal and I had no doubt in my mind I would not get to leave if I did not agree to help him.

While his gaze was beyond obsessively fixated on the thing that was his wife, I rushed towards the counter grabbing two of the bottles of chemicals. Formaldehyde, now was my chance. I tossed both of the bottles on the floor near Mordecai and the creature. The liquid spilled all over the floor as I dashed beside Mordecai for the chute which he had no doubt built to drop in food for his wife. I dove inside the small metal corridor and Mordecai clutched my leg. I kicked frantically while reaching into my pocket for my lighter. I struck the flame and tossed it out of the chute onto the floor. In less than a second a bright flame roared as Mordecai and the creature let out a screech.

The man writhed in agony and finally relinquished the grip of my foot. I scurried up the steep shaft as fast as I could muster. I pulled myself up at the top, finding myself behind the curtain near the podium upstairs. I made my way outside sprinting as fast as I could. I slipped and slid down the drive as the flames became visible in the windows.

I’m not sure what I witnessed that night or what arcane knowledge Mordecai and Pearson knew. All I was sure of is that the Strood Funeral Home burned to the ground that night, and the police reported it as a stove malfunction in the kitchen. Since I knew this was such a blatant lie I can only assume more people in this town have knowledge of Mordecai’s work than I find comforting. I left that day, and I’ve never gone back.

[Pt.2],fairynextdoor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yxq4j/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last/,"Part: 1  https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y92md/my_mute_sister_spoke_for_the_first_time_last_night/?st=J06E4TEL&amp;sh=be67dcee   

Listen guys. I'm sorry I went MIA but the situation got worse the last few days.  The day I last wrote you guys I saged every room in the house and went around twice just to be sure I really did the job. I was more confident reading your guys comments and also scheduled an appointment with Melissa's doctor to see if it truly could be possible she had summoned the will to talk during her sleep. The soonest appointment they had was yesterday. That left 2 nights before that.   

On the first night I was studying in my den. I've been cramming in studying when I'm not at my internship. I was preparing myself for a late night and thought if I pushed through the last few pages I could be done in a half an hour, which would be around 2 am. All of a sudden it went silent. I'm not sure if silent is the right word. It's more like when you go to the bottom of the pool and your earn won't pop. Like your in a bubble under water. That's what it was like. Then, gradually the sound began to fade back in.   This may not sound scary but it was more strange to me than anything. You'd have to be there and if you have experienced it  you should know what I mean. I decided it was just my brains way of telling me I had been studying for too long and went to bed.   

I got into bed and when I closed my eyes i couldn't shake the feeling that someone was staring at me. I would open my eyes every few minutes just to be sure there wasn't anyone there. Of course, there wasn't. I finally forced myself to keep my eyes closed and eventually drifted to sleep.   I don't know at what point it was that I was woken up, I just knew I was awakened by a loud slam. That loud slam just happened to be the door to my room. I got up and felt my way for the door and light in the darkness, wondering who in the hell woke me in the middle of the night. I switched on the light. Nothing happened. No light. I twisted the door handle and it just jiggled like it was locked.   


At this point I did what every rational human being would do and start jiggling the fucking handle trying to open the door and flicking the light back and forth. I got over this fast and knew it wouldn't work. ""This isn't funny!"" I shouted. Nobody responded. I started banging a little harder and the feeling of someone staring at me came back. But now I could feel breathing on the back of my neck to accompany it. Just then my mom came through the door as I threw myself into her sobbing. I didn't get much sleep the rest of the night. The next day I noticed Melissa had significantly dark circles under her eyes. I thought that maybe something was keeping her up too. I packed a bag and went to my grandmother that night and didn't come home till yesterday just before Mellisa's doctors appointment.  

 When I saw Mellisa I was in disbelief, to say the least. She looked exhausted, pale, like the life was sucked out of her. I was glad we were going to the doctors and hopeful we could get more answers.   Unfortunately, we got the opposite. They told us in basic terms that she doesn't have the motor skills to speak. She couldn't have. They also said she just needs to get more sleep. But how? She seemed out of energy so she'd been taking naps. Maybe at night? When we got home my mom looked more confused than before too.  

 I was nervous to spend my first night back in the house, but I decided not to let these things discourage me. I wasn't going to be scared out of my own house. My mom made dinner and I popped a movie in after. Before I knew it I had fallen asleep on the couch. I always tell myself I need to stop doing that. I tuned in to what sounded like whispering. Immediately I was thinking, ""no. Fuck no. Not tonight. Not again."" Of course so many other things ran through my mind too.   I needed to check her. I figured I could wake her up or whatever it was was already keeping her awake and that's why she was so tired. I snuck over to the room and screamed louder, bigger, more scared than I ever have before. Someone had been standing next to her bed, like in my dreams, and whispering to her. As I reached for the light they turned and I flicked it on and there was nothing. Nothing next to the bed and no one.   

I know I was awake. I know I was. My scream woke my mom up and she said that her fiancé could stay at his brothers for awhile so I could sleep with her and he wouldn't have to keep sleeping on the couch. The image was just burned into my brain.   Today I woke up and went to my internship all day long. I got back about two hours ago. My mom and I tried to cleanse the house again. We also tried also tried other suggestions. I hope I can get some sleep tonight. I'll update soon.  

Thank you for all the support."
5yxwmy,6,2017-03-12,"Me [23 F] with a difficult classmate [22 M] who posted on social media indirectly referring to me as an abuser and blaming me for his problems. Uncomfortable, unsure if or how to proceed.",whinydingus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5yxwmy/me_23_f_with_a_difficult_classmate_22_m_who/,"I was friends with a dude in the same tiny department as me. We got dinner a couple times at the dining hall because he was kind of cute but we didn't really click so I stopped talking to him for months. Then, we went overseas together for a study abroad program.  Basically, some minor red flags in his personality that previously made him unsuitable for dating exploded into massive ones that made us completely incompatible as friends. 

It's otherwise a long story, but if you can take my word for it, he turned out to be a whiny, attention-seeking narcissist/spoiled brat who did not work hard, was upset when he performed poorly due to not doing his work, and constantly looked for emotional coddling from peers and teachers. For some reason, he didn't take any advantage of the opportunities available to him and relied on our tiny study abroad group for all of his social interactions and emotional support while other students took on hobbies, special classes, and internships. If he wasn't getting attention or pity, he would whine, and he also lashed out at people who tried to help him. We were all having a tough time due to culture shock, but he was just aggravating to be around sometimes due to the whining.

He was also very rude and disrespectful on a lot of occasions. For example, he would talk down to me, find random excuses to invalidate what I say, or interrupt me about subjects he did not know much about. Even if I said don't interrupt my conversation or that I didn't want his opinion or that I was not talking to him, he would still insist it was OK for him to do so because HE wanted to give his opinion. 

Communication broke down several times as we just didn't get along, but sometimes we had to be near each other so I generally avoided all conversation with him if possible. Also, I was in advanced versions of his classes and took extra coursework at another university on top of an internship and other stuff so I wasn't usually around him and the rest of the group, but I was friends with various folks so I would either hang out with them separately or occasionally join in on group functions.
[Non-Romantic]

I mentioned communication breaking down. If he, for example, intruded on my personal conversations and refused to back down I would, after a while, resort to harsh words and insults just to get him to leave me the fuck alone. I can't say it was the best way to handle things, but at some point I don't care. I wasn't there to handle a disrespectful man baby 24/7 but to enjoy myself abroad.

To give you an example of an emotional fit he threw, he got mad at a girl for helping him order a burger when he was confused about a language thing because it was too much food for him and he couldn't finish it.

Anyway, due to being a crappy student and not being loved by all, he was not really happy with himself. He is also a delusionalartist tier comic artist but he thinks he is brilliant even though I could draw better than him in high school.


After almost a year of me not talking to him, seeing him, or even being connected with him on social media (I cut ties as soon as I could) he posted this thing on FB saying how study abroad was one of the worst times in his life and gave him the worst depression ever, basically calling me an abuser. I found out because one of my good friends from abroad sent it to me.

&gt;""Most of the time when people talk about emotional abuse, they refer to abusive partners in relationships, but that isn't always the case. It could be someone pretending to be a friend, and using your openness to them as a channel through which to attack you for being who you are, making you feel like you deserve their malice by constantly reminding you of your flaws and mistakes, and tearing you down at any given opportunity. That's what I had at least, and I'm opening up about it now, because as difficult as it is speaking out really helps""

He then ""apologizes"" for shitty behavior he has exhibited since returning from his trip, which supposedly ruined some of his friendships. But he takes no actual responsibility for it because it's just so hard ""when you are constantly under attack"". I literally haven't interacted with this person in almost a year.


I literally avoided him while we were on the trip and he would go out of his way to interrupt my conversations. We early on had issues and didn't really get along though most of the time. If we were forced to spend time together for group functions I would mostly just not speak with him unless absolutely necessary and talk to my other friends instead. Which makes his claim that I ""abused his openness"" ABSURD when I never wanted him to fucking talk to me in the first place.

While we were once on friendly terms, we  were NEVER close, and he didn't tell me secrets or things in confidence. 

I'm clearly not innocent here - I could have been more 'diplomatic'. But his complete lack of personal responsibility, professionalism, and emotional maturity was a major pet peeve of mine. I was frustrated that I constantly had to deal with someone who would bring down the group, so I did talk shit about him a lot and take some instances of him being rude or whiny to me as an opportunity to let him know that I did not think highly of him. But I also tolerated and kept quiet during a lot of his BS. 


Anyway, my life has been pretty successful due to uh, hard work and a whole lot of luck. I plan to not talk to him or his friends and just keep up doing what I am doing and let him live in his stupid fantasy victim world. But I'm pissed off, frankly. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A guy in my tiny department invented a sob story to excuse his shitty behavior that paints me as some sort of abuser and is using it to garner sympathy within the campus community that we share. It's completely inappropriate and wildly exaggerated. Is there anything I should address or just let him stew in his shit?"

5yy9mr,4,2017-03-12,The Reality of Gang Stalking,IGB_ALTIAR,Gangstalking,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/5yy9mr/the_reality_of_gang_stalking/," لا إله إلا الله، وأن محمدا رسول الله

 Dear TIs, 

  As salaam alaykum. Whom lives a life more humble and virtuous, the savage wolf or the meek sparrow? Which of these creatures lives a life closer to that of a believer? How is man, with his fragile body, limited intellect, small size, and short lifespan the champion among the creations, ranking above the stronger, more intelligent, larger, and longer living djinn? How is weakness among the greatest powers we can have? If you know the answers to these things then you are a friend to me and I am thankful that there are people who understand. Now I will give you all my theory concerning the persecution many of us are enduring. 

 Pharaoh is the enemy of mankind and Egypt has conquered the world. To understand the reality of gang stalking, especially if you are a skeptic, you must abandon the idea of government agents with suits and ear pieces following a suspect like in the movies. You should also know that most of us are not targeted because we are important people who pose a noticeable threat to Pharaoh, rather, most of us are simply people have been deemed useless to the society of Egypt, people who have been deemed inferior or unworthy of life in Pharaoh's Egypt, or are people who believe in a religion that the Pharaoh greatly disapproves of. This kind of activity has existed as long as civilization. The greatest heroes in history persevered against the same organization and were victorious. In the modern era however, they, and the people closest to them in love and affection, are the most oppressed people in the world.
 
 Our enemy, if driven enough, can see everything you do, hear everything say, and know everywhere you go without the use of a single device and without the help of another person. Have you thought about the similarities between being gang stalked and living somewhere haunted? Gang Stalkers and the technology they use is meant to replicate the effects being haunted by entities. The perps are merely men who would rather be djinn than human. The djinn can see you while being unseen, hear you while being unheard, and whisper negative thoughts, physically harm you, and destroy relationships, and they can do it better than the perps. I am almost certain that the Gang Stalking Program and it's associated technologies were made by men who knew about the unseen and wished to create ways for man to imitate the evil ones among the djinn. This way, they don't need to endanger their sorcerers in order to get almost the same results, all they need are loyal servants.  

 In the United States, one in ten Americans is a loyal member of Pharaoh's cult, and that estimate comes from the cult itself and I suspect they are undercutting it. The cult admits to using a program similar to Gang Stalking to gather intel on candidates for membership, and to keep an upper hand against possible infiltrators. While this cult is most likely at the heart of the Gang Stalking Program, most of their older members are simply judges of the invisible courts (with no trials or jury) or handlers. A TI is more likely to spot a younger member participating in street theater and harassment. One in ten Americans being a potential perps sounds like a lot, but these people have good paying jobs and families so they can't gangstalk all day. When you consider who else would be involved, you have to consider the military, the police, FEMA, Infragard, Citizens Corp, Blackwater, NSA, DoD, FBI, CIA, DHS, ""Patriot"" Militias (yes, they are very involved), crisis actors, private investigators, G4S, well known security companies, private security companies, the KKK, certain church groups, software companies, gang members, ex convicts, plea deal recipients, sex offenders, ect... it seems more like one in seven Americans might possibly be participating in Gang Stalking knowingly or unknowingly, to some degree. 

 Many people become perps as part of their training, apprenticeship, or internship for the various industries that overlap with Gang Stalking or the company itself is primarily dedicated to Gang Stalking. Like I said before, to them we are not important, they just consider us practice for the ""real deal"" most of them will never be assigned to anyway. It's actually kind of funny when you know that most of these assholes are just authoritarian sympathizers who like to role play as Jack Bauer. We must consider the brainwashing we are subjected to as Americans, we are taught from a young age that all life has a monetary value and any life with zero monetary value doesn't deserve to live because there is not enough food, water, money, ect to go around for everyone, therefore it is socially acceptable in the mind of the average American to cull the ""unworthy"". The perps have this ideology. The hypocrisy is astounding when you realize that child molesters are treated better than you, and sex offenders are the ones deciding that they don't want you in the community. The amount of tax money being spent to torture ""free"" citizens who often don't even have a criminal record is absurd. Many of them have turned the dial up enough to kill and have murdered people in a most unjust and cowardly way or driven people to suicide, those guilty should be run through with the sword and the worst offenders should be beheaded. 

 Anyway, I didn't write this to go into detail about the tactics they use or the specific devices employed. This is merely a theory about the intentions of Gang Stalking and why they have such great numbers. Despite the fact that nearly one third to half of the people on this subreddit are trolls, shills, perps, and normies who seem to only come here to call us schizophrenics, and many of the targets posting here are misinformed about their situation and therefore make the rest of us look bad to those doing research, I intend go in depth with my experiences and information about their tactics and technology sometime soon, until then I suggest you research terms like ""Chekism"", ""Stasi"", ""Vehmic Court"", ""DEWS"", ""Sub Vocal Speech"", and ""V2K"", and check out a channel called Lookoutfa Charlie on Youtube. May peace and blessings come to targets who believe in the one and only God, and may our enemies be trampled under the hooves of our mares and stallions on the day we rise up to slay the Pharaoh and his devils.

                                                         Sincerely, Altiar Sayaf

Let me know if there are better alternatives and I will get out of your hair.

I'm a Sophomore studying Applied Law in Belgium. In our Senior year everybody needs to do an internship.
This can be both at a law firm in Belgium or abroad. As you could already derive from the title has the last my preference.
Because most students prefer to complete their Erasmus in Europe, only a few go to other continents (one goes to Australia and another one to China). 
The United States have always appealed to me, so from the first day I knew that it was possible to do an Internship abroad, I told myself i wanted to go to the States. Since only a few choose to do an Internship abroad, I'll have to make all the arrangements myself. 
By this I mean searching and contacting a law firm and asking them if they would be
interested in having an exchange student doing an Intership with them. Finding a place to live is also something we have to take care of but I wanted to start with the most difficult part (in my eyes) first and that is to find an attorney or law firm.

Since the legal structure in America is totally different than the one in Belgium, I'm especially interested in comparing these differences.
For example the death penalty which is still active in some states and how the process runs to send someone to death row.
But also cases like domestic violence or fraude would be interesting to see how these are dealt with in the United States.

I know I'm not really specific but that's the whole point. I would like to keep my options as broad as possible to really determine the difference between the US and Belgium or the rest of Europe.

For all of this to happen I first have to make contact with law firms who would be interested to let me follow/assist them in their procedures.
This is the part where I thought someone from /r/lawschool (or another subreddit?) could offer me some help.

Do you know a law firm or an attorney open for an interview to discuss my request/possibilities?
Is there a particular state you guys could recommend me to narrow my search? New York and Washington always looked appealing to me, but I'd love to hear some suggestions.
Do you know if I can go through a similar process like American students do, to qualify for an Internship?
And since I'm already asking questions, if you have some tips about housing in the States feel free to share them with me.

All input is greatly appreciated and more than welcome. This would be the perfect opportunity to start a great legal career.

Thank you for whatever help you can offer and feel free to send me a PM if you need additional information.

*If this post should be submitted to another subreddit to reach a bigger audience or just because it does not belong here, please let me know.*

Let´s say you work for a company with flexible working hours, so you can basically work when and as long you want.
The company is a big international company and you have a basic programming or software engineering job.

If you want to climb the career ladder and plan to get to a high management position, what of the following is the most import thing to do?:

*  Spending more time at work than regulary
* Staying at the same company for a long time
* Try to socialise and build a network at events from your company
* Train yourself in management behaviour and skills
* Be a good programmer and train your programming skills

I've been working at my current company for 6 months as a software developer and my only other experience is a software internship. The reason I started researching is because I found out someone in my network, with similar experience, that has a significantly higher salary. I tried to get salary averages from Glassdoor and pay scale for my area and experience level but could never find consistent averages. Also what I currently do at my job could have a job title as web developer, software developer, or software engineer which also have very different salary ranges. Is there a way to find a reliable range or average without having to start looking for new opportunities?"

Since students have to maintain a 70% average to be eligible for the 12-16 month work term, how many students actually get the opportunity to do so.

If he had to choose to either spend time with the family he miraculously developed, or work overtime and earn that promotion he had always thought about, he’d just apologize to his wife after. 

It was like this ever since he was a kid. Working on projects and homework instead of hanging out with friends or playing games. He even used to be an intern in the same company he’s currently working for. Always thinking about work, and errands, and business. Breathing work, eating work, being work.

It has reached a point where he starts having these harsh, flickering headaches, fingers becoming stiff and rusty from the rhinitis. He never stops typing when this happens though. He just endures, feet feeling like static from the fixed position in the cubicle. Being immersed in his work usually makes him feel better.

And it does.

I think I got some kind of depression. After some googleing and some research I think that Walking Depression would fit me the best. That means that you basically function perfectly, you do everything you have to: work, clean, eat and talk and yet you don't feel energised, motivated or a life at all.  

Recently I moved to a brand new city for a 6 month internship. So I work there now from 08.30 till 17.00 - 18.00. I come home, make dinner, do the dishes and then it's about 19.30. Then I got my free time, usually spend it with videogames or I practice photography ( a hobby / passions of mine, yes... I do have that ).  

But like, this weekend, I was all alone in my student house and that makes me feel really bad and get bad thoughts.  
Mostly thoughts like: I don't have friends, I'm weird, why can't I do small talk? Why can't I be more social.  

These feelings and thoughts come and go, but they never stay away for too long. I think that I get them because my social life isn't that great. I'm not completley friendless, but, they just aren't all that nearby or always around, and I could count all my ''good'' friends on one hand. Isn't that sad?  

I mentioned before that I do photography, I got like 3-5 girls in line waiting for a photoshoot, but that still doesn't make me feel good. I still like doing a portrait session with them, but it doesn't help much now.  

I feel like I always need to keep my self busy and have things planned and that I need to try to surround me with people.  

My doctor thought that maybe I had a Vitamin B12 deficit. A lack of that vitamin causes you to feel really tired and ''depressed'' as in not wanting to take the initiative to do anything.  

I don't know man, I just wanted to write this down, see what some of you maybe think.  

Next time that I see my doctor, I will tell her more explicitly that I feel depressed..."

It's next to impossible for me to learn by listening. During university, I skip all my classes because the professors might as well be speaking another language. I just read the textbook to learn what I need to.

I know I'm not an idiot either. I go to a Top 20 university, and have a great GPA. I do well on my exams, and have a solid understanding of the material. But again, I got all of this by just reading the textbook, I didn't find classes helpful at all.

I'm doing an internship this year and because of being such a visual learner I'm having a lot of trouble with conversations. Often my boss will come up to me to dicuss something, and everything he says will go over my head. I'll just nod at him while having no idea what he's talking about. It's embarassing and makes me feel like a complete idiot. After he's gone, I usually try to piece together what he was talking about and hope that I end up doing what he wanted me to. When he sends me an email however, I have no trouble following along. It makes complete sense to me, and I get it done quickly...

The work isn't particularly challenging either, it's very straight forward. It's just understanding what he's talking about that I have trouble with. Obviously, I guess I can talk to him about this and ask him to send me more emails, but I don't think that's a solution. Often the material we're discussing requires back and forth discussion that *needs* to be done in person (since we often look over code together), so these conversations need to happen.

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on what I should do. I feel like a complete moron and I've noticed my boss often gives me weird looks because my response often won't make sense, since I usually have no idea what he's talking about. It's extremely frustrating and I don't really know what to do...

I'm a computer engineer, and most of my current job involved writing code, but future jobs will probably involved math and circuits, so that's going to be even trickier..."

Would really appreciate any advice on the below.
 
I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
 
Discovered late enough that coding/software development is what I want to do (32 now). 

Enrolled in a two year internship with a one and a half year work placement. Currently working within a MS technologies focused team. Therefore all experience is in C#, .NET, ASP.NET (not really a fan of front end) and SQL server.

I'd consider myself somewhere between a beginner and intermediate (closer to intermediate).

I've received a number of fairly useless certs in System design, system development, procedural, OOP, SQL. I also have a Microsoft C# fundamentals Cert and will be sitting the Programming in C# (70-483) Exam in April.

Have no computer science degree etc. 
 
My internship ends in two months. Don't think I could apply for even junior dev roles elsewhere (not confident I know enough) and it's highly unlikely I’ll be kept on in my work placement company.

A degree isn't really an option as I need to pay bills/rent etc.
 
I wouldn't be opposed to working with/learning a different environment and/or language if need be.

Advice on where I go from here? Any ideas on how I stay within the sector, continue to learn and eventually become an experienced and accomplished developer?

Happy to answer any questions.

Thanks."

(kinda long post) What I learned after getting back together:,10Dante4,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5z1jk4/always_notice_the_small_things_kinda_long_post/,"She broke up with me on the 28th of December. Reasons being; im not ambitious, im lazy, I don't have drive in my life. Truth was, I was in a weird place in my life where I lost motivation, was unemployed and was emotionally down for a month. She also said ""she loves me, but she's not in love with me""


I took that as motivation to improve my life (like you should), and I started doing internships here and there, decided to pursue a new career in marketing (which is going great so far) and I met a new girl. ON THE SAME DAY, l met the new girl she called me crying: she ""felt horrible for the horrible things she said, she broke up with me during very hard part in my life (3 days after christmas too, and on the day our parents met for the first time).

I said if she wanted to talk, we could meet up. We did, she apologized. She said that all the things she said were her own insecurities and problems that she projected on me, and that she is truly sorry. And that she still loves me.

I still had feelings for her and I said we can try again, but we need to take it slow. After one week, I couldn't control my feelings and said that I want to get back together and that I love her.

Ever since we got back together I noticed that much of her behavior has changed in very small but very frequent ways; most of the time I started texting her and she always replied with single word texts, whenever l said ""i love you"" she either said ""you too"" instead of ""LOVE you too"" or didn't say anything. 

She didn't really want me to stay in her house during the week claiming that ""because of her new work, she is focused on getting ready the night before and the next morning, so she might not be paying too much attention to me"" (that never occurred in the past). Whenever we went out, we spoke much less than before. 

She always, albeit rarely, started a conversation with ""hey"" or ""how're you"" instead of any pet names like she did in the past.

I brought some of these up, a month before our break-up and she said that ""you are just overthinking and over analyzing it"" and gave me some relatively bogus excuses for everything while IN MY GUT, l knew l was right!

I spoke to a few friends and they also said that I was over analyzing it, so I didn't gave it much thought after that.

A month after that ^ the dreaded text arrived ""i think we need to have a chat"" and she broke up saying ""have you noticed things are weird and different now between us?"" and that ""she loves me but she is not in love with me"" again. I mentioned all the things I noticed that were weird between us, ever since we got back together.


So guys, if I learned anything from this relationship is; 

1). that people change and despite how much someone can love another person that doesn't mean that, that love will last forever. 

2). Always go with your gut feeling, even when EVERYONE says the opposite. In this situation, I was the one in the relationship, so only I noticed the things that were going wrong. But always approach with care.

3). EVERYTHING you do in the confines of a relationship, always act with kindness in your heart. If you're upset or angry, hold off until you've cooled off and then talk. 

4). Despite my second break-up, I'm glad that we tried again because I wanted to try again. Even though everyone else telling me that I shouldn't. That way, I won't have a doubt in my mind that this relationship HAD to end. It would suck after 10 years looking back and saying ""what if I did try again...""."

One of which I've had quasi-planned for the past 3 years, and the other for the past 5 years (seriously). And I've now just been asked by a family member to go on ANOTHER trip. 

The summer isn't that long. I can't spend like a total month of it on vacations. I mean I would love to, and I feel like I owe it to myself, like a lot of people do after finishing undergrad. But I mean how could I go about telling my boss, ""By the way, I'm planning on being gone for 2 weeks here, and another week there.""? I'm not sure that I can. 

For the record, this is the kind of job where pretty much whenever you say you can't come in, they'll say, ""ok see ya later"". There aren't vacation days or anything for temporary positions (as I will have). But, that fact makes me even *more* nervous about asking for days off. I don't want to seem ungrateful for the position or seem like I'm taking advantage of the system. 

I don't know. This will be my first job out of school and I'm not sure what the norms are. What would you do?

Hi Meddit!

I'm nearing the end of my tour in medical school and intern year is frighteningly close. Throughout these last four years, I've found myself always looking for ways to improve and work more efficiently. Recently, I started to teach myself databases and programming and I want to be able to apply those skills to medicine. 

The hand-off/change-over/sign-out (pick your term) is one area that gets a lot of attention in general, but it's an event I think can be improved with a little help from automation and standardization. My ultimate goal is to create a 'view' or page within an EMR that auto-populates most of the necessary information that should be included in all hand-offs. I now Cerner and Epic allow physicians to do small bits of programming and I'm under the impression this sort of thing can actually be accomplished.

It's all too common that things are thrust upon us by people who know nothing about the day-to-day life of physicians - that's why I'm asking for your input. 

**So, what would be included on your ideal hand-off/change-over/sign-out sheet?** 

I created an anonymous Google survey that would make gathering your ideas easier than mining Reddit comments. Check it out [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Vr2YsOCqbCVa4Oyh2).

If you have any other suggestions, please share them!

Now after seeing the article, i am really scared. What i am planning to do before graduation/doing right now is

1. Join our software engineering design team next year
2. Do some job related courses in coursera (Like full stack web development course, android development course, UX designing courses etc). The reason for me to choose coursera is they have some very good capstone projects, like in data structure course i am taking right now has a google map type app project. I felt like they might be useful when it comes to extra-curricular.

3. Join co-op, and might do 1 or 2 unpaid internship if i need to if I don't find any paid internships. Also will try to do as many internships as possible.

4. Networking, i plan to attend a few vancouver tech meetup places and seminars. Also I am making friends who are doing co-op in other industries. I already made some very good connection but they are just my friends doing co-op at various companies like Tesla etc.

5. Constantly look up for job offers in monster, linkedin, craiglist etc

6. Start building up my linked in profile as well as resume.

What do you guys think, and would you advise anything else apart from these things.

I know moving would be another option, but it is extremely difficult for international students like us just to move to US. I do however plan to move someplace inside canada if I don't get anything in Vancouver.

Now after seeing the article, i am really scared. What i am planning to do before graduation/doing right now is

1.Join our software engineering design team next year

2.Do some job related courses in coursera (Like full stack web development course, android development course, UX designing courses etc). The reason for me to choose coursera is they have some very good capstone projects, like in data structure course i am taking right now has a google map type app project. I felt like they might be useful when it comes to extra-curricular.

3.Join co-op, and might do 1 or 2 unpaid internship if i need to if I don't find any paid internships. Also will try to do as many internships as possible.

4.Networking, i plan to attend a few vancouver tech meetup places and seminars. Also I am making friends who are doing co-op in other industries. I already made some very good connection but they are just my friends doing co-op at various companies like Tesla etc.

5.Constantly look up for job offers in monster, linkedin, craiglist etc

6.Start building up my linked in profile as well as resume.
What do you guys think, and would you advise anything else apart from these things.

I know moving would be another option, but it is extremely difficult for international students like us just to move to US due to visa processing and other immigration related thing with US H1b Visa system. I do however plan to move someplace inside canada if I don't get anything in Vancouver.

Thanks in advance and I do apologize for any inconvenience."

Recently I've been facing a dilemma. As a self-taught developer who is pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science via [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), is it wise to look for internships while still in the program? Or should I actually start to find a place where I plan on working at for the next 3 ~ 5 years?

I am currently working at a startup as a senior developer, but I've been looking for a different job because I want to see what working at other companies are like and look for more guidance.

I was initially interviewing for a senior developer position at a startup, but I was finally offered a junior developer position. I understand that my lack of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science could be a reason why they think I only deserve a junior role, and I totally understand that I don't really fit for a senior role either as I only have 2~3 years of experience. However, I've been helping a friend with his undergraduate degree in CS, so I know that I can't be THAATT bad either.

So here's the question. I feel that I can learn tons as a junior developer at that startup, as I will be helping them with big data technology such as Cassandra, Spark, and distributed computing problem with micro-services. I am also in the process of interviewing with Facebook, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them(although I don't have much expectation from it.).

In 1~2 years, with a combination of 4~5 years of experience, and a Master's degree, I think I will have a better chance at working at something that truly interests me. So what should I do in between? Is it better to find multiple internships in Canada(I live in Vancouver, and I'm not eligible for internships in US) for the next 1~2 years and find an area that interests me the most, while risk not being able to find any internship, OR find a place where I can learn a lot and potentially grow, but unsure whether the startup really interests me."

I come from a VERY religious family. We went to church every Sunday and Wednesday night service. If I didn't go my family threatened to kick me out of the house. I was never allowed to watch twilight, Harry Potter, and for whatever reason teletubbies. Wasn't allowed to play Pokémon, guitar hero, or basically anything. Oh, and I was homeschooled my whole life due to my family not wanting me to leave the house and experience ""worldly"" things. 

I consider myself a Christian. I believe in God. But I'm not as uptight as my family and don't focus on the rules of Christianity. My family follows The Bible perfectly.

You know the movies you watch with crazy religious parents who don't let their kids do anything? My life. 

I have an older brother who is practically perfect in every way. He's in school to become a pastor and just recently got married. Me on the other hand, I have no idea what I'm doing. I graduated college with my associates and now I'm at Disney on an internship, which my family didn't want me to do anyway cuz it's not ""Christian"" enough. Or at all. (Don't even get me started on their thoughts of the beauty and the beast movie)

The older I've gotten, the more open they've been with me. Or at least so I thought. They alway told me when I'm paying for all of my own things I can make my own choices. 

Well here I am. I'm paying for rent, gas, food, everything and anything I need. It's all on me. I'm taking care of myself. I recently decided to pierce my septum. Let me tell you. All hell broke loose. You would've thought I killed someone. The guilt from them was real. They told me I sinned and kept telling me how ugly I looked with it. They kept telling me how God was disappointed in me as well.

Normally I'd just brush it off, but it hurts. My family doesn't accept me for the things I like or who I am. It's hard because I want/need their approval more than anything. So, do I keep pretending I'm a different person around them to get their approval and remain sad inside because I can't truly express myself and be who I really am? Or do I become who I truly am and be upset because I don't have their approval?

The septum thing is just a tiny example of what I've been dealing with my whole life. 

So to my reddit family with religious families.

The TLDR of my history is that I broke up with my ex in December (for the second time over 1 year) because I felt like I was being choked out by a clingy partner. After wanting to try being friends, we both had a major drunken fight/breakdown 3 weeks ago that made me realize how toxic we were for each other. After that, we went two weeks no NC.

Now we're talking again. Because we both have a lot of mutual friends, we find ourselves still indirectly hanging out. Today, a group of 4 of us went to a movie, and it was nice! Over the past week, though, we had been mildly chatting and sending snaps to each other. It feels like we're falling back into old patterns. 

One of our mututal friends is turning 22 on Thursday, so now we find ourselves in an odd situation. We're both going to this party and will be drinking. Last time that happened on NYE, we both ended up sleeping together and falling back into an old routine (I dumped her in December). 

The thing is, though, we still both want each other. So badly, in fact. The space we've had has been great for us to grow and learn independence, especially because we will both be away for our internship this summer. 

It feels so right, but because I read all the posts on this subreddit, I'd like to hear advice from outsiders. Because I know we will be back together, because we both have NO self-control for each other. She's the right girl for me, but she needs more time to grow and mature. I feel like I have to be careful for this party on Thursday, because our track record suggests we will make some bad decisions.

5z3g1r,17,2017-03-13,My Experience in HK,Abc1986,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5z3g1r/my_experience_in_hk/,"Hey guys.

A couple people messaged me about my Hawaii writeup a few weeks ago and encouraged me to write about my other travel experiences. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5wl3t9/my_experiences_in_honolulu/

When I was in college, I worked as an intern at a MNC in HK for 4 months. The position was a non-ibanking or consulting corporate drone type job.  My experience is from almost a decade ago, so some things may have changed. Obviously, I am not an expert on HK and please feel free to disagree or comment about any of my experiences. 

**Language barrier**

I do not speak Cantonese and can only speak Mandarin. Even though everyone could speak Mandarin and English decently well at work, I still found it hard to ""bond"" and connect with my other coworkers due to the fact that the majority of them spoke Cantonese to each other. There were many times where only Cantonese speakers were invited to certain events. I felt a little left out due to the fact that I didn't speak Cantonese. 

I love eating local food and Cantonese food is probably my favourite Chinese cuisine. I loved going to very ""local"" places to eat lunch and dinner. While they understand Mandarin, they seem to treat Mandarin speakers a lot worse than if you speak Cantonese or English. I believe this is due to the fact that many HKers are pretty anti China and some do not even consider themselves Chinese and get offended if you call them Chinese. Regardless, I have noticed that HKers' Mandarin skills have been improving.  

**White Worshipping at Work**

Now looking back, I actually think the white worshipping is pretty damn bad in HK. At work, the general rule was that all the VPs had to share offices with another VP. The SVPs had their own offices. However, all the VPs from Europe/US had their own offices, which seemed a little strange to me... In addition, all the Asian VPs, including a few ABCs, were all called by their first names. However, for some reason, everyone called the non Asians Mr. XXXX, even though they were the same position as the other VPs who were called on a first name basis. I wasn't totally woke at that time, but I noticed that and thought that was a little fucked up. 

**Social Life**

The social scene in HK is pretty amazing. However, it is also very very expensive to go out and drink and have a good time. I was making roughly 10k HKDs and 5k of that went to rent, so I didn't have a ton of money to go out and have a good time. It was actually a little difficult to hang out with some of the older Asian expats. At the same time it was a little difficult to find college aged kids to hang out with.  

The guy that I was actually renting my room from was an US expat and wanted to make some extra money on his extra bedroom. He invited me out and I met a lot of his friends. At least to me, I got the impression that most of the expats just loved talking about their job, how much money they were making or how many girls they fucked this week. As a college student, it was a little difficult to relate to them. I wasn't making the big bonuses or living in the huge penthouses. They loved to go out, drink and do other naughty things, but due to my budget constraints, I wasn't able to go out as often as them. Many of them also loved to check out prostitutes in Shenzhen and in HK. It was a really eye opening experience for me. 

Overall, the girls in HK are a lot more responsive to Asian guys. It was not hard for me to date local girls. However, with that said, there was a slight language issue due to the fact that generally speaking, Mandarin and English are still considered their second and third language. Tinder wasn't out during that time so it was a little difficult to meet local girls, but I had a couple of local friends who went to HKU that introduced me to some of their friends and I met a few friends that way. 

I recently went to HK and as expected my results on Tinder were much much better than in the US. I was actually getting girls on Tinder that I would actually want to talk to and meet. There are some girls that are white worshippers, but to be honest, that is still by far the minority. In my opinion, the percentage of white worshipping girls in HK is a lot lower than in the US. "

For my third and fourth years, I'm transferring to a significantly larger campus at my university. I'm doing two majors, computer security and information technology. I have a few options on the table and was hoping for some help from you as far as deciding goes.

The options:

* Dick around

I was fortunate to get a high-end synthesizer and build a high-end PC over the past few months for very little. I could spend my summer making music and playing Black Desert Online without a second thought, but this doesn't do me much good financially or academically.

* Work at a hospital

I was working at a hospital full time the second half of last summer with a few friends as an intern doing IT grunt work. Imaging computers, replacing peripherals, etc. It was boring as hell, but the pay was decent for what it was (~$11/h). I'm still on their payroll and can return any time. My friend insists we'll be working with the networking team this summer and it won't be as boring. I'm dubious. What I foresee is us going on a little guided tour into a network closet by a SysAdmin, maybe patch a few cables, and then we go back to imaging computers.

* Take a class/classes

For one of my majors, I need three semesters of a language. I already took Spanish 1 and Spanish 2 last semester and this semester. I kind of want to just get Spanish 3 out of the way this summer by taking it online through my university, and I won't have to walk the whole way across campus next semester to get to the language building. At the same time, the first two Spanish classes have me tired of learning Spanish, and I feel like I could use the summer to take a break. My family will be visiting Spain this summer so if I took the course over the summer I might be a little more able to speak the language while I'm there. That said, we're doing one of those tour things, so I imagine we'll just get herded around like sheep anyway. I could also just do some class for my major or something.

Something I have to consider is that this option isn't too cheap... something around $2300 for four credits (like Spanish) or $1700 for three (pretty much everything else).

* Do a combination of two or three

Work at the hospital part time, dick around, do Duolingo... Dick around, take Spanish... something like that. This may be the most sensible option but I really am loathing having to go to work (but soon I'll be doing it for the rest of my life!) and/or learning Spanish (but if I don't do it now I'll do it in the fall!)

Thank you in advance for your help!"

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

so this is a fairly recent tale of mine. Due to the very confidential nature of the events I altered a lot of details but I can assure you it happened exactly like that.

-------------------

Due to one of my coworkers heading for maternity leave we had to replace her for a few months. Training a new employee would've taken far too much time so we hired an $intern and tried to make everyones job easier so we could collectively fill in for our coworker.

I'm not exaclty sure who picked the intern or why exactly they did it but knowing their reasoning would propably lead to me questioning our collective sanity. You'll find out why shortly.

*$intern* is a student of business. $intern doesn't really like doing work because who does, right? But $intern refuses to memorize basic operational procedures and doesn't really care how we operate. We sell stuff. A lot of stuff. We're talking truckloads of stuff. 

As any business of this size we use different softwares that we haven't developed ourselves. Let's call the software *$PAS*. *$PAS* is basically an interactive inventory, balance and receipt software. Everything and everyone has a unique *$id*.

*$intern* was given a lot of small tasks that we trusted her to fulfill so we could go on with our day. *$intern* was with us for about 6 months. After our inital period of struggling to get her to do basically ANYTHING we settled into a state of peaceful co-existence.

Until one day I got a frantic call from $customer. $customer had a large local retailer selling goods to people. And *$customer* had a complaint. His complaint was that his appeal to cancel multiple deliveries/orders had been dismissed. 

At this point I was kind of lost. *$customer* ordered basically the same every other week. There should be no reason for a complaint in the first place. The transactions with him were set in stone long before I even joined the company.

And him having sent an appeal and it being dismissed? I was completely lost. I went around the office asking different people about this and nobody had the slightest clue as this was basically automated and running on its own.

So I fire up *$PAS* and start investigating this mystery. His usual orders are all scheduled regularly, delivered and paid for way before the deadline. But also there are about 10-35 TRUCKLOADS OF STUFF HE DIDN'T WANT. All registered on his unique customer *$id*. I was beyoned worried. Our system was ordering stuff for people that were drowning in truckloads of goods they didn't want or need.

So I went deeper into the rabbithole and discovered that *$customer* had opened a appeal/complaint for EVERY SINGLE ORDER. And guess who had dismissed those orders?

I hope you beat me to it - *$intern* did. So I went and talked to her. Her reasoning? ""I kept getting messages about this stuff. I have no idea about it so I dismissed them.""

At this point is was none the wiser as to WHY she did get those messages. After a short period of digging I found the reason.

When our travelling salesmen open an order they can be sometimes incomplete. A salesman will fill in the first order completely and book additional stuff and trust our department to match the details down (they're working on tablets and it's a pain to fill in stuff).

Guess who saw a red field in her software and decided to put in the first *$id* that worked and kept doing it? Yes. *$intern*. Every single unfinished order from our salesmen went to *$customer*.

Took us nearly 6 months to clean up after our coworker came back from maternity leave. I can proudly say we did our best for *$customer* and he still is indeed a customer of ours.

€: Due to a lot of discussion - $intern had a paid, temporary position at the company"

So far this year, things are going well, but the not so good years really take a toll on me (like last year for instance).  Combine that with the new unrealistic requirements that government is imposing and I forsee a point where I have had enough and need to leave teaching.  I have always been good with computer and I work closely with the IT department at my school.

Essentially, I want to start prepping the way for if I do finally decide to make the career change but I don't know where to start.  In addition to having a B.S. in General Science w/ Chemistry Concentration, a M.A.T. in Education, and 8 years teaching experience, I have the following work experience in IT:

-3 years as an IT Student Technician (work study when I was in college)

-2 years Audio-Visual Techinician (1st school, didn't get the opportunity to do much with this)

-3 years Audio-Visual Techinician (2nd school, very actively involved with equipment care, working closely with IT, involves balancing a budget, and managing a high school intern)

-Hosted several Professional Developments where I taught how to use Google Drive and related services.

In addition to the above, I've done some side projects like home networking and building computers.  I help out occassionally with HelpDesk tasks from my current school's IT department if I have spare time (not to mention that the AV position is basically a HelpDesk job as I'm in the sytem as a tech).  In high school I did basic website design and I have C+ on my undergrad transcrpit, though I would need to brush up on it as it has been a long time since I have used it.

My endgame would be to move into an administrative position (similar to the position the head of the IT department as my school has).  I know the best way to go would be to start in a HelpDesk position full time and work my way up with experience.  I would like to avoid this as I think the pay would be to small.  Staying in an educational environment will be a plus since that is where my roots are but is not a requirement.  I can definately say I have 2.5 years before I leave teaching.  I would like to consider any plans/ideas that would take about 3 years or less to complete.  So far the most consistent piece of advice I have received is that certs are more important than a degree.  Certs seem like an appealing option as I can self educate and then take a test at my own pace (not to mention that I have a child at home to take care of and I will be maintaining my full time teaching job).  I'm already looking into Cicso certificates but it looks like there are multiple kinds of those so I'm not sure where to start, or if I should be looking into other certs.

Any advice on what I should do would be very much appreciated.  If there is more info that is needed on my situation, please feel free to ask."

I will be 20 years old in August 2017.

I have a professional qualification in IT .[BCS](http://www.bcs.org/category/18013)	

I am a 4 month old Intern and and on my way to be a permanent Tech Support personnel.

I have the opportunity to get my masters from a local institute that awards a degree from [Kingston University, UK.](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/it-strategic-innovation-msc/)
But haven't made up my mind to it yet.

I like all the aspects of IT but I prefer the Information Systems area out of all those.

I don't know what I should do to move forward and I would definitely like a climb up from Tech Support to a more advanced/managerial position.

I am completely lost on what I should do at the moment. Most people I ask for advice say that I am actually doing better than most people out there. I don't know what they mean by that but that's not what I want to hear when I ask for advice.

I hope someone out there can help me find what I am missing at the moment. Should I just continue in tech support for the time being or should I be looking for an academic degree (preferably a Masters degree) Or do you have any better suggestions?

Thanks in advance."

I have been searching for a job for a while, and one of the offers I got makes me want to settle down. They offered a salary about average of what other junior developers make in that area, with regular benefits and a specific number of stock options (~2-4k in cash). It is a start-up with around 40 employees. I will be brought on board as a Junior Developer and will be mainly working as a Full-Stack Web Developer. 


My question is, how should I be negotiating the salary / comp package? I read a lot of articles online, and the most important thing I have read is that you will have to ""back up"" yourself with either other offer packages, previous pay, and how you are worth more than they offered. However, without much previous experience (only two internships), I found it difficult to value how much I am actually worth - all arguments I found have been somewhat weak. Of course, this might just be my lack of experience and confidence, but do you even think I should be negotiating for a better comp? If so, what percentage bump should I be aiming? 


Again, I don't really know how to ""measure"" if this is a fair package or not. It's my first full-time job after all, and I heard from many how important your first salary number is to your career later on.

I'm looking for someone to flesh out an idea for a scenario I've been thinking and fantasizing about. 

It's set in the present world we live in, with the only change being that a surprise law has been passed that women are now not legally allowed to say no to men. They are obligated to satisfy any sexual request or desire, no matter who and no matter when. Who'dathunk a congress of horny old rich guys would have passed a law like that? 

I'd be playing a fresh, young college graduate just entering the world of corporate America, directly after this law has been passed. I'm stubborn, hard headed, and want to be taken seriously. 

But it's not easy for a woman to get some work done in this new climate. How does the powerful female CEO get people to take her seriously when the whole office saw her reluctantly sucking off the chubby, dorito stained I.T. guy in the central staircase? How does a female accountant get any work done during tax season when the rest of her team is using her as a stress-relieving fucktoy all day? How does the new girl intern learn how to use SAP when the janitor keeps putting her hands to better use down in the basement? I'd love to incorporate some bondage too! 

I'm looking for a longterm, descriptive RP since I probably won't be able to reply too quickly today.

 If you're interested, let's talk! Send me some kinks, rough ideas, characters you'd like to play, and we can hopefully get some world building and eventually an RP going!

I know I'll end up having a good steady job, hopefully an internship so I can get some good experience and resume info. But to get to the point, I live in the midwest and am going into the city. I have a lot of experience in building/repairing electronics, and I feel like I can market myself appropriately. I've never had to actually go and get my computer repaired at a shop and was wondering if starting a website and putting flyers around or something for computer repair would be a good idea? I want to competitively price myself so that I can provide a respectable service at a cheap cost and gain respect from others and say I have enough responsibility to have my own service. This is just a side business because I will be balancing it with college and an internship/part time job, but I feel if I keep myself busy and around computers than I will have a much better opportunity to be successful in life.

TLDR; How much would you pay for ""amateur"" computer repair? And what are the best ways of (free) advertisement for beating larger companies? Thank you.

5z799x,268,2017-03-13,I didn't match last year. some words.,recollect_fragile,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/5z799x/i_didnt_match_last_year_some_words/,"I wasn't a great medical student. I did poorly on some tests and rotations, and got some pretty nasty feedback. I hated medical school.  So maybe it's not a surprised that I didn't match last year.  Part of me kind of knew it, but hindsight is 20/20. Nonetheless I was still completely shocked.

It was some of the worst period of my life.  It was so, utterly awful.  And it felt disorienting.  I didn't know who I was anymore.  I had gone to a top college, was attending a top medical school and I was attempting to match into a noncompetitive specialty.  And I thought, wow.  I must suck.  I must be like, the worst.  How could I have had so much opportunity and not delivered, at all?  And what am I going to do with my life?  What have I been doing for the last 4 years?  No, actually, since high school.  When I ""decided"" I was going to be a doctor?

And it was awful in how embarrassing the whole thing was.  Telling my family, my significant other, my friends.  And of course, there's the school and the hospital and all the people there.  I decided to SOAP to some prelim positions but ultimately got interviewed by no one.  Ha.  Like how sad is that.

I went to my advisors and I was so, completely lost.  Thought about quitting it all and becoming, variously, a lawyer, consultant, or a writer.  But then I thought, maybe I should still give it a shot.

I really don't know what made me hang on.  I had fantasized about quitting medicine, way before not matching.  I thought it would be the answer to all this misery I was feeling.  But now that I have an ""out"" so to speak, I really didn't know if I hated medicine or if there was something else about me.

I think part of it was family pressure, but probably much more so this idea I had of myself as someone who was ""successful"" and high achieving.  And I think not matching really helped me to see that I don't have to do this.  But if I DID want to do this, I have to put it all in.  I need to stop acting like this was some thing that was forced on me.  

I'm sure this is not the case with many--maybe almost all--people who are going through the SOAP process.  Some of you probably really, really have always wanted to serve and be a doctor.  I wasn't; mine is just one story, and it doesn't even make sense to me sometimes.

But anyway.  I decided I was going to try again.  Again I don't really know why.  And my advisors suggested repeating some of those rotations that I had trouble in (as a sub-I).  And it was awful, awful, awful acting the medical student while the people I started medical school with were going on to residency.  The first time after not matching that I had to step inside the hospital, I could feel my whole being wanting to just run away and never face anyone.  All the residents, the attendings, the people, the white coats...  I was so scared of seeing my classmates and what they might think about me or say to me.  I had flashbacks of all the terrible comments written about me, all the mistakes I made, and now how everyone must be thinking ""wow, no wonder. This person was such a bad med student. Ha ha.""  But then... I realized.  I mean, what can they do that is worse than what I'm going through right now?  I felt so much shame and embarrassment and confusion from not matching that... what can people do now?  Laugh in my face?  I mean, first of all no one does that.  But also, the thing I had feared the most?  It's pretty much already happening, every day, from the moment I wake up, so what can other people do at this point?

What does it matter if I'm wearing my short coat trying to learn things and do things that maybe my classmates got way beforehand?  What if I went to fancy schools and ""should have"" accomplished so much more but instead I'm re-mediating with thick skin?  

I was a sub-I on a hospitalist service while trying to ask some questions from the internal medicine team, and guess what?  One of my classmates was an intern and we had this awkward thing where I'm clearly still a medical student and she's clearly a resident and she's like ""so... how are you?"".  And that sucked.  I'm not going to lie.  It really sucked.  Despite the whole rationalization and not giving up, it totally, 100% sucked to face my former colleagues and residents and other people and be still a medical student. 

But you know what.  I did it.  I went into that hospital and I felt the heat on my face, but I didn't give up.  Because I already failed so spectacularly.  I guess in a way, I didn't fear failure and embarrassment as much anymore because I already felt I had completely failed and embarrassed myself.

And you know what?  It was fantastic.  I really felt I learned a lot.  And people helped me a lot.  And I got a lot better.  And I'm not saying medicine is right for you or anyone.  But I think part of this whole process really made me appreciate medicine and being a doctor.  And it made me a lot stronger.  And braver.  And more confident.  I think I'll be a much better doctor, because I think I'm a better person for having gone through this.  

If you are thinking of SOAPing, or quitting medicine, or some combination, I really, really feel for you.  Because it totally, 100% sucked for me in this unadulterated, horrible, visceral way.  But I also think that it can be an incredibly transformative and ultimately ""positive"" experience.  It's going to suck for maybe a long time.  But if I can do it, I think anyone can.

Last year at this time, I really felt like my world was going to end.  I think I had tunnel vision and saw gray for a long time.  Don't give up.  Hang in there.

Still I am the youngest person. I've noticed that people don't seem to pay any attention to me in meetings and was even mistaken for an intern. I was okay with at first because I was new and was trying to observe to get the hang of things. But today at a meeting that I actually needed to contribute to people kept talking over me or interrupting me. One male at the meeting continually talked over every other woman there not letting us get a word in even though he had never met our client (typical mansplaining...) but then some of the other women talked over me. For instance if we had started to talk at the same time she just got louder and talked over me... I think my gender as well as age has contributed to people not taking me seriously.

I have a few general questions about what to expect upon graduation, and thought I'd see what you all had to say. Before I dive into those, I will roughly breakdown what we focused on in this program:

3-4 classes where we focused on R. We learned several ways to to analyze data within R and talked about ways of integrating pertinent statistics to conduct the analysis.

2 classes where we focused on SQL-- one was almost exclusively done in MySQL and the other was more of a big data class, where we learned about unstructured data (Hadoop).

Several Marketing Analytics classes where we would look at predicting things like churn, probability of purchase, etc. We used tools like Google Analytics, SPSS, etc.

There were a few other classes that were, more or less, a combination of the aforementioned classes. 

I have 3 years of work experience prior to joining this program, where I did IT work as well as Operations work. I did analytics (more descriptive than predictive) in the Operations roles and worked on a wide variety of things in IT (queries, hardware, analytics, etc.) 

My questions: What would one reasonably expect to earn upon completion of this masters? I've done some research, and it's far from conclusive, but the best number I can seem to come up with is an average of $69,000 (so I've been using this as my benchmark). I have an offer on the table for roughly $62,000. I'm also currently in an internship, but have yet to have a discussion with managers regarding potential employment upon graduation. I really like this company-- should I tell them I have an offer on the table and that, while I understand they may not be able to make an offer right now, I need to get some sort of understanding of what my outlook with them is?

This may be the wrong place to post this (if so, any suggestions for a more relevant sub would be appreciated). If there is any more information I can provide to clarify, please, let me know.

WARNING: It's gonna be long haha.

I got my first job at 15 as a courtesy clerk at a local grocery store. Here in Las Vegas, it gets HOT (obviously). Like 115 degrees hot. After 4 months (May 2013 to August 2013) wrangling shopping carts in that kind of weather, I left there.

I immediately started working as an unpaid intern after that for a comedy show that I took classes in. Selling tickets, advertising in front of the casinos on the strip. Also hot, but a lot better because I ran my own thing. I left that after 3 months (August 2013 to November 2013)

While I job hunted, I decided to put some of my education to good use. I studied web design in high school (I went to a magnet school) and worked freelance for a few people. But I hated what I did, so I found some other web designers who were willing to take over the projects and left that behind. (November 2013 to June 2014).

I stared to focus more on school. But once I graduated, I needed to start looking for work. My parents own a business (that I have no interest in whatsoever), but money is money, so I would do odd jobs for them whenever. It was more of a quid-pro-quo/allowance in exchange for some tasks done kind of deal. I still have it on my resume as my longest stuck-with job (1 year 5 months).

I decided to look elsewhere though, and worked for a week as a host for a little breakfast restaurant on the other side of town (February 2015). I didn't have my own car at the time, and my parents made me quit because I was driving their car and it was about 20 miles away.

A week later, I got a job at a car dealership as a salesman (at 18 years old). It was pretty good money, but the management was god-awful (absolutely not exaggerating). One manager would make me buy a brand of cigarettes I didn't smoke with my own money, share a couple with me, then take the whole rest of the pack home at the end of the day.

After 3 months there (March 2015 to June 2015), I decided to take the summer off.

That August, I got a job at a call center selling stock options to old rich people. I didn't really get that many sales, and they were threatening to layoff those who weren't performing. I decided to leave after 3 months because I was only making $200 a week and the work was soul crushing. (August 2015 to November 2015).

I took that time off again to focus on school. At that time, I had switched my major to Political Journalism, and began doing freelance work. However, the more I attended rallies, the more I realized that I wanted to be the one doing the political work. Not reporting on it. So I switched my major again to political science and stopped journalism (November 2015 to March 2016).

To make some money on the side, I got a job at a small gelato shop (also on the other side of town, but I had a car, so it was fine). I was laid off after a month because my ""scooping wasn't on par with the others"" (April 2016). Also the only job I was actually laid off from.

A month later, I began another unpaid internship with a fringe candidate running for Senate in the primaries working as a communications staffer. I was only with them for less than a month, before he lost (last place. Bad loss). (May 2016)

I took another summer off, and in August 2016, my friend got me a job working at a shoe repair place that he was managing one of the locations for. It was pretty cool and I was making pretty decent money. However, after 3 months, my dad had said he wanted me to start paying rent for me and my girlfriend or get our own place. I told him that getting our own place was impossible on the combined amount that I and my girlfriend were making, so he talked with his friend and was going to get me a better paying job with better hours, but he told me I had to quit my current job right then and there or a) I wouldn't get the new job and b) I would be out of a place to live. So I quit. Didn't even give a 2 week notice. Quit right on the spot (don't worry, I still finished my last day). (August 2016 to November 2016).

I interviewed the next day and the guy who owned the company looked like he liked me. However, he had said that he wasn't going to hire anyone until after the new year. But a week before January 1st, I emailed him and was told back that he hired someone 2 weeks prior and did not tell me. So now I've been ""f""unemployed since November.

I'm trying to get a job in politics. Even the most minor job. Local government stuff. I'd even settle for a cashier job at the rec center.

But the problem I run into is that I've had so many different jobs for varying, short amounts of time, that I feel I'm almost unhirable by any job I actually want to do. But I also have to focus on school. I also need money though to pay bills. I feel like I'm in this awful rut. Any advice?

TL;DR: I have had a lot of different kinds of jobs in different fields of work, all very short times. Am I unhirable in the field of Politics (of which I want to go into)?"

I know I have low self confidence but I don't really know how to fix it. Simply being ""more confident"" does not help when I don't believe in myself to be more confident, ugh. I did public speaking before, it was quite fun actually, shot guns, went skydiving, got into a car crash without loosing my cool, and led a group of five in a project at my internship. So I am not a complete panzy.

However when it comes to getting a girl to dedicate herself to me is something different. Why would she? I also want to have sex, but the idea of a girl having sex with me sounds ridiculous to me.

My dating history:

* Every girl I asked out in person said no. But I asked very few out.
* Online dating sucks for me. Almost nobody replies back, and conversations never go past like five messages.
* I did meet three girls online though, and one of them I ended up on three dates and liked her. But she randomly stopped talking me. Which was quite devastating to me, I felt ""normal"" while with her

Some of my ""flaws,"" I guess

* Live with my parents. I am still completing my BS (Computer Science) and I hope to move out the second I have a job that can pay for it. However I have a brother that could barly walk and is mentally in a child like state. Being the oldest brother I pretty much will have to take care of him. At least I think so, in that case I don't know what I will do
* Have a overjet and crowded teeth, but that is not bothering me. I might get braces after I can afford them. But my talking does get effected because of my teeth
* I stutter, not for specific words and sounds, but at random. This annoys me a lot. I notice how people, especially girls lose interest right when I stutter. Not being able to say the word I want to say is annoying, I sometimes have to say other words just because I cannot say one.
* I am skinny and not very strong, but I guess I can fix that huh?

I am here for advice. Some days I go through really bad mood swings, and in middle school I was bullied so much that I hating every day of it and wished it would blow up. Other days I feel like I can do anything. Is it depression?"

5z8w1l,3,2017-03-13,[Kinda off-topic] I need your advice. Strongly considering dropping out of college before finishing my degree.,kartoffeldego,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/5z8w1l/kinda_offtopic_i_need_your_advice_strongly/,"I need to talk to someone.

So I'm converting to Catholicism this Easter after years of studying and praying. During this process, things have changed a lot in my life. And I've changed a lot. I have some health issues that I won't spell out in detail, but, long story short, they're stress-related. After high school, I decided to go for an education degree because I thought it was something I would find easy because I'm very good at both learning and teaching. I'm now nearly 4 years into my 6-year programme (I'm not American). I'm not dealing with the stress of taking this education very well. This last year I've also been an intern for longer periods at schools, and I couldn't handle it. My stress-related problems are becoming worse and worse, and, despite my best efforts at managing my problems, it seems like I'm just not cut out for the path I'm currently on.

Catholicism has given me a new outlook on life. I care less and less about status and money and more about being a good human being at peace with myself and God. Part of the reason I'm taking my degree in education is because it's a good paying job here (starting at about $60k annually, rising to about $75k after 15 years). But it's killing me. Part of my problem is that, although I can perform under pressure, it wears me out faster than most people. Even though I'm an excellent speaker, my nerves are killing me. I get super stressed out all the time. Which is why teaching high school kids for a living seems like more and more a bad idea. This stress is leading to some serious health concerns, so I'm not just stressed out, I'm stressed sick.

Before you tell me about techniques to let go of the stress and all that... I've tried it all. There's only so much you can do with your genetic disposition, and this kind of problem runs in the family.

Now here's the deal: I have the skills and qualifications to do certain jobs from home, which would reduce my stress level drastically, but they're really low-paying jobs. Currently, I'm still living with my mom, so my expenses are low. But I dream of raising a family someday, so I want to have a good income. So I'm kind of stuck between wanting to be a resourceful man and my inability to reach that goal. In the future, it's likely that I'll make less money for my family if I drop out than if I don't. Would it be selfish of me to lower my ambition to have a more comfortable life for myself? "
5z8wy6,35,2017-03-13,Me [24 M] with my Ex [26 M] of 1.5 years. Broke up last week and I've been getting worse every day. How do I get over this?,wtfiswrongwithme6192,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5z8wy6/me_24_m_with_my_ex_26_m_of_15_years_broke_up_last/,"Hey Reddit. Long-time /r/relationships reader. First time poster. Really hoped I'd never have to do this. 

**MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING (Sorry, I write when I'm anxious)**

So background: Boyfriend ""Kaiden"" and I met on Tinder last August. It was a whirlwind of emotions from day 1. Within a week he had asked me to be his boyfriend. In fact, that same day we booked a trip a few states away to go visit a friend of his. I know, red flags literally everywhere. Yet our chemistry was undeniable and we never felt a need to pump the breaks. It felt natural.

Within the first few months we developed this...codepedency that we didn't realize was unhealthy until right at the end of our relationship. He started law school and needed a support system. I've always been more of a giver than a receiver, so I was more than happy to help him through his struggle and support him. It was insanely difficult, and we almost break up many times due to the stress that law school puts anyone through. Ultimately though, our bond strengthened. I decided to enter grad school to get my MBA (thanks to his encouragement), moved to his college town (it was only 20 miles and I was going to move anyway), and we moved in together temporarily for 6 weeks while I waited for own apartment to be ready.

The summer didn't go well. We were so used to only spending weekends together due to slight distance, and now we were together constantly. To make matters worse, one of his friends confessed his love to Kaiden, but Kaiden failed to tell me that for a full 4 days. I wasn't upset that someone had feelings for him, but I was upset that he waited to tell me. It was a breach of trust, and I couldn't get it out of my mind that he harbored feelings for this guy in some capacity and that's why he wouldn't tell me. Our relationship was negatively impacted by living together before we were ready/this crush, but we got through it.

November rolls around and we're happy (I thought). There was, however, one day while we were being intimate that I just knew something was wrong. He left to get dinner and I snooped through his phone. It was wrong, I'm not proud of it, and I will never do it in a future relationship. However, I found that this kid not only never stopped texting Kaiden, Kaiden was allowing him to openly flirt. That's to say that Kaiden wasn't flirting back, but he certainly wasn't setting proper boundaries. I was immediately honest that I snooped, we fought, and ultimately agreed that Kaiden needed to cut cut communication with this guy. I didn't want to dictate a friendship, but this guy was telling Kaiden that he wanted to be his husband one day. What was I supposed to do?

It's been nearly 1.5 years at this point (December), and we agree to move in together. I dropped out of school to take an amazing job in a nearby major cigty, and he lands an internship in the same nearby city during his last year of school Everything was going perfectly, and I was excited to start the next phase of our lives together. 
 
Cut to two weeks ago. We're having a minor argument and he tells me he isn't sure want to me in with me. In fact, not only is he thinking about not moving in with me, he's got multiple backup plans lined up. Clearly he'd been meaning to tell me for awhile. Reddit I was devastated. I thought about doing distance (his other living arrangements kept him in the college town about 45 minutes away by bus) and it just broke me. I wanted him to move in with me or nothing, so I gave him a terrible ultimatum in the heat of the moment. I was reacting to my emotions, and I should have kept a level head. Somehow the conversation ended with us agreeing to take a break.

During the break he finds that he enjoys his independence. He's not afraid to talk in class, he doesn't feel ""guilty"" for talking to others (which he claims was induced by my having to limit his contact with another person), he feels more ambitious. I mean, he liked it. Meanwhile, I had a terrible week. Knowing that we were going to see each other one last time lulled me into a false sense of ""being ok"". I thought that I'd be fine being single if that's the road life took us on. 

Then the break ended. Sort of. We both agreed to go on a Tinder date with another person just to see what that was like. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds now. Yes, I regret it. I went on my date and felt nothing. He was lovely, we bonded over things that my SO didn't enjoy, but there was no spark. No chemistry. No inclination to make out in someone's car for 45 minutes in the middle of the road or to book a cross-country flight. I let the Tinder guy kiss me, and still felt nothing. It made me feel confident about my relationship with Kaiden and confirmed that I wanted to only be with him.

I think you can probably guess that his Tinder date didn't go that poorly.

He spoke with me about it at first, and did nothing but trash talk his date. It made me feel great because it seemed like he was choosing me and choosing to work on us. We decided to ""start over"" in a way and start dating again. We needed to recapture our spark.

Unfortunately things disintegrated by the time our ""Date"" was supposed to happen. The night before (last Monday) he met up with the Tinder guy again. They watched a movie and made out. That sucked to hear. The night before we were supposed to work on us.

**BACKGROUND OVER (I think)**

He told me that he loves me, but that he fell out of love with me during the summer. We fought constantly while I stayed with him, and I agree. It was an uncomfortable living situation that we convinced ourselves we were ready for, but clearly weren't. We ended things officially last Monday because he likes this new guy and likes the way that he feels without me.

The thing is, I totally get it. Our relationship turned into a codependent mess. We because the couple that started hanging out on Friday evening and didn't stop until Sunday night, usually without seeing others. We both had so much ambition, but we became so comfortable with one another that we never challenged ourselves. We loved one another, but weren't feeling fulfilled in the relationship. I was (and still am) in love with him until the very end, but he fell out of love with me months ago. Our sex life declined/got boring, we weren't being social, and we stopped pushing each other. 

I feel so betrayed because I wasn't given time to fix our problems. He didn't voice his complaints about the relationship until the very end. I didn't get to see the things to correct until it was over, and I'm having a hard time getting over the fact that he picked something new with another person rather than choosing to give us the opportunity to work on us. I'm fully committed to changing our relationship and recapturing the magic we had at first when we were idealistic. 

I thought I was doing ok because I realized I wasn't super happy in the relationship either, but the last three days have been utter hell. I think the break up is setting in. I wanted this guy to father my children and to spend the rest of his life with me. He was the first person I loved, the first person I had sex with, and the first person who I imagined myself with long term. I'm having an incredibly hard time letting that go considering I felt that the relationship ended without giving us a fair chance to fix anything. I'm so heartbroken, and I just sit on my couch thinking about our memories and mourning the life that I will never have. I didn't know that emotions could cause physical pain until this weekend. 

This is a rambling mess, I'm sure, but I don't know what else to do. This break up has changed my conception of love, has ruined me emotionally, and is actually getting worse each and every day. How do I get over a guy who I'm desperately in love with, but who doesn't want me? I'm more than happy to provide clarification (this is basically a novel, but there's so much that I didn't cover that could be relevant).
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me without giving ""us"" a chance to correct problems that we only recently became aware of. Devastated in a way that I've never been before and it gets worse every day. What do?"

It was first revealed to me by my friend who actually recognizes he himself has narc qualities, and he's working really hard to fight it. He was raised by Nrents. (If you read this, bud, thanks for sharing this resource!) I remember sobbing for hours upon hours after realizing it (of course I had to do so quietly so Nmom wouldn't wake up and demand to know what's going on, or berate me for waking her up). And then I still had to go to my internship early the next day. It was so painful to have all of the truths that I suspected confirmed - I think I secretly hoped I was wrong and it wasn't that bad. But it was and still is, and it hurt to feel the full brunt of the truth at last.

Since then, there has been several big arguments, one of which resulted in physical abuse. The buildup: Nmom FLIPPED HER SHIT when I wanted to study abroad, refused to pay for it, made all these excuses about how ""I never studied abroad so why should you/ there's *terrorists* and *refuges* it's not safe!!!/ there are hidden costs *you're* not thinking about which will become a burden on *ME*!!"" Basically everything is about money to her, and if it costs money it's a burden to HER. Well I'm proud to say I basically said fuck this I'm going anyway, and I got enough sponsorships, grants, scholarships, and donations from other people that I got to go anyway.
But she fought me every step of the way, causing arguments over the stupidest of things and being passive aggressive as shit about chores and whatnot. I actually had a combination of pleurisy and an anxiety attack that was so bad I had to go to the hospital. Lemme tell you, it does not help your anxiety subside if it's your Nmom driving you to the ER. The ER doc prescribed me some anti-anxiety meds, but of course we still had to go pick them up.

Well, it had been about 2-3 days since coming home and my adrenaline system still not had turned off. I was still wired as shit and I knew I needed the meds to at least get myself in a state that can think about being normal. I asked Nmom very politely when she got home from work if we could go pick those meds up. She went into the whole ""I *just* got home from work and I *can't* even eat my dinner in *peace*?? Can I *just* eat my dinner without having *one* more disaster of yours to worry about??"" I kept saying look that's cool I just wanted to remind you we have to pick that Rx up before they restock it, that's all. It turned into a massive fight. I ended up trying to get some space by closing myself in my room, she caught the door and wouldn't let me close it, I screamed at her to leave me alone and she fucking hit me. I was so shocked I logged my phone at her but missed, and she grabbed it and took it. (I'm still on her phone plan so she loves to threaten to take it from me, even though I always remind her it would put me in danger in case I needed to call for help). Luckily she didn't get to my laptop, so I was able to reach out to my boyfriend and sister for support. 

It took her a whole two days to make a very halfassed apology about the physical abuse before quickly stuffing a ""but you were screaming at me"" in the end of it, so I know she wasn't sorry. She genuinely felt entitled to violence if I made her mad enough. I've been livid as hell a few times in my life but I never let myself harm someone because I knew as a fact it wasn't right, not unless it was self defense. The day after the fight I actually collapsed on the floor and just laid there because I was hyperventilating, shaking, sweating, it was like my body was in full panic and I literally could not turn it off. I told her we needed to pick up that Rx. She told me to get up and stop ""doing that"" because she needed to call the plumber. Empathy? Error, not found. Eventually she relented and picked it up. She ""punished"" me for making her miss work those two days of the fight by forcing me to help her paint a rental house after the tenant move out (she owns some rentals). Can't forget to mention, during the fight she threatened to take away all my school support, my car, and phone for my ""disrespect"" and when I asked her point blank exactly what would she have me do if I wasn't in college, she said ""work like the rest of us dogs!!!"" Meaning, give my misery endless company. I think the reason she didn't do it is she was well known and respected at my university and if I suddenly withdrew she probably knew I would tell them why.

This was 2016. Fast forward to last weekend. I knew my Nmom was shit in long doses but I figured short doses were safe, because usually if we got some space she could at least pretend to be decent for a short while, though not without passive aggression, eye-rolling, and nitpicking every part of my apartment. Welp, guess I was wrong.

Backstory: I got called in for an audition for a scholarship from an arts company in a big city. I'm not comfortable driving in this city because the highways are a nightmare spaghetti tangle and I'm also afraid of highways. My usual rides couldn't do it, so I made the absolute mistake of asking my mom if she could do it. She agreed but mentioned she'd have to move a hair appointment to make it. Then mentioned her teeth had been hurting due to a mistake the dentist made (which was surprisingly true, the new dentist confirmed it). I should have expected that I would be ""punished"" for ""demanding"" her to do something for me when she not only had aching teeth but also had to move *her* hair appointment.

She called me not once, but twice, asking me to print directions to my scholarship audition, which was about an hours drive away. No problem, printed and done.

She shows up with her own directions, except they’re printed as starting from her house, not mine. She keeps insisting its an hour and a half drive when in reality, from my house, it’s an hour tops. (She forgot to factor in the half hour it took to go from her house to my house, which brought her a half hour closer to the destination.) I pointed the discrepancy out and she kept dismissing it. She was antsy and kept urging me to hurry up so we could leave…. even though it was 2 hours from the audition and we had at most an hour of driving. She insisted we needed a time buffer in case we got lost or encountered an accident, which makes sense, but 2 hours was still a little much. 

She kept pointing out flaws in the apartment, like she always does, but to the point where she would interrupt me mid-sentence to point them out. She’s the only person who will interrupt me mid-sentence like this. She was trying to hurry me and I told her I needed to eat again since I had been up until 3am fighting with my blood sugar, and she rolled her eyes. I've noticed she doesn't believe I have hypoglycemia, even though the doctor confirmed it, unless she can use it as an in to spotlight herself with all her tales of being dizzy and hungry as a twenty year old. 

We finally get to the car and she pulls out her directions. I told her multiple times, ""hey why don’t I read the directions to you so you’re not trying to read from the paper and drive."" We have done this before, in the past!!! I grew up doing road trips with her! Her vision is actually so bad now she almost didn’t get her license renewed. 

And she refused!! 
She kept arguing my directions were “wrong”. I informed her we printed them FROM THE SAME WEBSITE. 
She continued to insist they were “wrong.” I kept telling her our directions were IDENTICAL apart from the first few street turns, since hers started from a different address, and at this point on they were the same.

Once we got on the highway, she demanded her paper directions and was struggling to read them and drive. I told her that it was making her weave and drift in her lane and she growled “whatever” at me. This happened several more times. She also ignores all the 55 mph signs and tries to keep doing 65 or 70 while bitching about the other drivers being slow. 

We got into the actual downtown part of the destination and she was flipping out. I misread the directions and thought we had 2 miles left on the road (as that was what the section header said). When our turns starting coming up fast, she laid into me about how I “don’t know how to read the directions”. Like damn, I made one mistake because I was stressed by your driving, as if you never made an error ever. 

She started staring at the paper again and she ACTUALLY BEGAN DRIFTING INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAFFIC. I freaked out and somehow managed to still control my voice and say “watch out we’re in the other lane! stop reading the paper and pay attention!” 

I reached to grab the paper from her so she would LOOK UP and pay attention and not kill us. 
She yelled at me not to touch her or she would “punch me out.” I was flabbergasted. This was a situation of her own making and she still thought she was entitled to threaten me with violence. 

This told me immediately she had not changed AT ALL since last summer and still thought violence against me was totally justified if I made her ‘mad’ enough. 

I tried to stand my ground and say you need to stop reading the directions, we were in the opposite lane and could have gotten killed. She claimed it was all under control, she had swerved to avoid a guy who looked like he wasnt going to stop at a cross street, but that is a total 100% lie. I saw her with her eyes on the paper the whole time.

The rest of the time, she never apologized, and driving back she made fun of my restaurant of choice and made herself a victim of it. Just because I wanted to go to Panera, she lamented about how she “has” to eat soup for lunch every day of her life so she didn’t want to go anywhere serving soup. (She is a grown woman with enough money to afford a different lunch. Nobody is forcing her to eat canned soup every day. She does it of her own accord. In the past she said she did it to lose weight.)

 So I waited for her to pick a restaurant instead but she never did, she just kept throwing restaurant names at me and I finally picked one. But she clearly wasn’t listening because she still kept throwing out names, I repeated louder which one I had chosen and told her I said it 10 minutes ago and she just said “oh” like she was disappointed.

Once at the restaurant, she was ever so nicey-nice with the waiter, cracking jokes, and all of a sudden she really wanted to know about school and how I was doing. At that point my stomach was so tight and knotted from anxiety and anger that I didn’t feel hungry, so I just got soup and a salad and prayed I didn’t throw up.

Even typing this out again, my chest is tight and hurts and the anxiety hurts, like it did yesterday. 

I want to call her out and cut off contact, but if I did, I wouldn’t be able to afford school. I couldn’t live on campus and safely away from her if I called her out now. The jobs in my area are not substantial enough to support living by yourself without a degree, and they are so competitive and waterlogged with applicants I couldn’t guarantee getting one. My bf, who has over 6 years experience in specialty coffee roasting, brewing, and drink mixing, in addition to 5 years customer and retail service, couldn’t even get a call back from the Starbark’s manager. There are just hundreds of applicants for every little menial job. When I'm forced to move home in the summer, it's so rural the only jobs are McDonalds and truck driving, but of course I never hear the end of it from her. ""I had 3 jobs your age!!!"" Cool but the job market now wants 5 years experience for what used to be straight-out-of-highschool jobs!

I know she is an abuser because 1) when angry enough, her true side showed and she actually thought violence was somehow a solution to HER weaving into the opposite lane of traffic and endangering us both, and 2) she never apologized and pretended everything was fine afterwards, when it clearly wasn’t. Only abusers do that. If my boyfriend accidentally drifted, not only would he not have been angry at me or blamed me, but he would have apologized profusely and felt terrible for endangering us. In her mind it was all a-okay and I'm just an oversensitive ungrateful brat.

She then called later in the day to complain about one of her tenants and I literally just put the phone down and didn’t listen. She kept talking anway and all I did was mutter “uh huh” or “oh no” occasionally and the conversation went in circles for an hour. It wasn’t until I caught her repeating herself (”you already told me that”) that she kind of stopped and let me get an out to hang up.

 Nothing I say in those kinds of conversations matters. She literally just sees me as a depository for her stress and anger, and this is proven in that any time I try to speak up or change the conversation she just keeps on talking or interrupts me. If I ever talk about what’s bothering me or affecting me, she dismisses it or rolls her eyes (”maybe you stayed up late because you were nervous about the audition” no actually it was the nausea and shaky palms and sweating from low blood sugar, like the Dr said, and like I literally just told you 30 seconds ago). 

She keeps hinting she doesn’t think my condition is as bad as it is, because in her mind, she’s the only one that can have medical problems. She is the victim of everything and everyone everywhere, and anyone else with problems is competition.

The thought of having to move off campus in a few weeks and go back to living there for the summer is so panic-inducing that I just want to cry. I just stayed in bed and slept and ate Saturday because my bf was at work and couldn’t talk, there’s no one else I could talk to about this, and it just sucks. I don’t deserve any of this. When I tell her she’s the only person that treats me this way, she doesn’t believe me and insists other people are secretly thinking this way about me when they aren’t. She’s so stuck in her negative world view she literally can’t imagine that other people see and treat me as a normal, equal person (even though I magically keep getting scholarships???)

I’m at my wit’s end and can’t afford to see a therapist over this. Any time I've asked to see a therapist, my parents demand to know why and then berate me for ""wasting their money"". My college, health insurance, phone bill, and car are still owned by them completely. I don't have an income because I'm taking a huge classload just to graduate as fast as possible. Since I'm a double major in science and the humanities, it will take me longer to graduate with both degrees, but I have about a year and a half left.

I am dreading when the invitation for the scholarship luncheon comes in the mail and it says I can bring one guest. I desperately do NOT want to bring her but I don't have any other person to bring instead since my boyfriend is working and my Edad is also working that day. I'm thinking of lying and saying I'm bringing my bf anyway, which will piss her off for sure but not as much as just downright saying ""Im not bringing anybody.""

If any of you were in this position and got out, advice is appreciated. I know the easy answer is get a job off the job tree and move out, but it's not that simple. The only two people in my friend group that are living independently are A) a highly specialized engineer who got hired by his scholarship donor and B) my bf, who was aided significantly by his parents so he could afford his first year on his own, until he got a higher paying job. Everyone else is living with their parents because our area is one of the worst economically in the region. But like I said, the thought of moving home again for the summer is nauseating and I fear more extreme craziness if my mom couldn't even handle letting me read directions anymore.

5z9b3q,1,2017-03-13,My BF [23 M] of one year says that [21 F] I'm with emotionally draining him with my depression,emogir1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5z9b3q/my_bf_23_m_of_one_year_says_that_21_f_im_with/,"My BF and I have been dating for a year now, he makes me really happy and I love him dearly. I've recently started seeing a therapist about my depression and anxiety, and it's been helping my mood substantially. 

My BF as always been super supportive of me and my struggles, but lately I feel like my emotional venting is frustrating him. Two weeks ago, I was rejected from a possibly life changing internship abroad, which triggered an emotional wave of anger, sadness and blame on myself. This made my mood very negative, and I couldn't get myself to finish tasks. 

Last week, I went to see my therapist to talk about my feelings of hopelessness. She gave me really helpful advice about putting my self-worth on inner values rather than accomplishments. I tried practicing it all week, but sometimes it got frustrated because I had to reframe my mindset so frequently it got me super moody. 

Fast forward to the weekend, my BF and I were hanging out and he kept asking what was wrong, I kept saying 'nothing' because I didn't want to ruin the day. Finally it was time for bed, I just curled into the covers trying not to cry because I felt defeated. My BF was in the kitchen, so I tried to hide under the covers and quietly sob so he wouldn't hear me. 

He sensed something was wrong when he came into the room, and opened the covers to ask me ""what's wrong?"" I told him that I was super frustrated with being in school and how much I hate how uncertain my future is, I told him how I felt lost and nothing made sense. Sobbing and gasping for air I looked into his eyes to see a blank face. His reaction seemed distant and his face looked 'seriously again?'

That made me cry even more try to hide from him. His reaction shocked me and made me feel even more devastated. The only thing I could muster up saying was ""Can I ask you a question and can you be honest with me? What's going on in your head?"" He finally said, ""Honestly I'm frustrated, every time I want to help... you push me away, and it feels like I'm constantly being emotionally drained week after week."" 

I didn't know how else to reply back, so I told him I'll work on getting myself in a better headspace, so we can hang out without me being moody. I told him I'll see him only once a week from now on so I don't vent at him. 

I know its fair for him to say that he's drained, but in my head i'm kind of stunned... I can't help being so sensitive and emotional... I just wanted someone to listen to me and calm me down... I don't treat my BF like my therapist, I don't ask him for advice, I just want me to hold me and listen while I cry. 

This happened on Saturday and its been bothering me since. I don't really know how to bring it up to him again without making it into a huge deal. All I want is for him to just listen and not try to fix me.
  ---   
TL;DR: I'm emotionally draining my BF, and I want to know if I should take sometime away from him so I don't further jeopardize our relationship"

You basically have a map and call a function setDependentValues(Key,Int) to go through the map and update each value by one, but the values you increment are in another table or something, it doesn't really matter.

 Just had my first technical interview (over the phone/coding test) for an internship position, and it was kind of a trainwreck. For some reason I kept thinking the Map implementation they gave me was completely separate from a regular map, even when they kept saying do everything the normal way. So for the longest time I was like wait there's no get() function, how do I access the map with a key. Also I was like how do I even traverse this, is there an iterator? The guy interviewing me was like Collections should have iterators -_-, that should've given it away, god he must have thought I was an idiot lol.

I couldn't solve it time, but even afterwards this problem took me a while, and I feel like my solution is hackish, so if you guys know the right way to do this I'd appriciate it!

Anyway here's the gist, everything under the Example is my solution, I have 2 sets, a temporary one that gets replaced every iteration, and one to store all the values that have been traversed.

From his newspaper game articles (obviously haven't seen them, just heard through the KF content) to his writing for IGN, to being the face of IGN and eventually the CEO of KF. 

Colin (he will always count as a KF member to me) showed me that voicing your opinion isn't always pretty, but it doesn't have to be. Disagreements can lead to discussion, which can lead to figuring a good middle ground out. Doesn't always work, but it's worth a shot. 

Nick showed me that doing a job that in a slightly different field than you'd expect can lead to greatness. Him being in production for a gaming network doesn't seem like a perfect fit, since he isn't a huge gamer, but he worked hard and climbed a ladder and ended up being able to do passion projects for a living (animated series, working with friends). 

Tim showed me that scheming and being willing to put yourself out there in quirky ways can lead you to getting your dream job. From scheming in school, to doing his internship and making fun music videos and short content to being able to do the KFL events, Tim is a young dude who took a talent for scheming and used hard work to accomplish his goals. 

Kevin is a little less in the spotlight in terms of camera and microphone time, but goddamn if he isn't a hard working son of a bitch. He takes shit and gives it and has shown me that working the behind the scenes job can be tough but so worth it. I'd say Kevin gets the most shit, but has genuine support from the best friends because of his awesome work ethic and personality.

And Joey has shown that being apart of a community can lead to literally working for it! That's so cool! I'm behind on the podcasts, but I can't wait to hear about her and her life! 

Bestfriends: if you truly stand by this name, support each other. You don't have to agree, but don't be dicks. We all deserve a basic level of respect, so let's keep it civil. 

Love all the guys, and I will support them now and into the future! "

""Oh, so subverting the trope is too much, but random cursing is fine? That line seemed really out of place, Alpaca.""

*One fine morning, McReddit, still sleepy from his restless dreams of videogames and Cheetos and paradisiac 
places where the Mountain Dew is always cold and the girls never friendzone the nice guys, accidentally typed

""Dude. You are writing about yourself talking to an intern about replying to the prompt that you're writing the reply 
to, that's like the fucking definition of meta right there.""

""Yes, yes, yes, but, but! That's the *actual* Alpaca going meta, not me. I am a character in this meta story, and 
the story *I'm* trying to write is not meta. His is, but that's his problem. My story is *not* meta.""

Not yet, motherfucker.

""Who said that? Who said -- *did the actual author say that!?* Oh, for fuck's sake, Alpaca!"" I tell myself-the-writer-not-myself-the-narrator, turning towards the… fuck, I guess camera? What the fuck do I call the forth wall in a story? Anyway you get it. ""Can we have ONE story where you don't pull this crap?""

Sorry, man. Back to writing your story. We gotta find an ending to McRedditor and, unfortunately, we wrote 
ourselves into a corner, so meta it is.

""We didn't write ourselves into a corner, the prompt itself calls for light-hearted, joke responses,"" Junior says. ""it's 
humoristic. Deddit and all. I think we'll be fine.""

See? We're fine, fictitious Alpaca.

""Fine,"" I say to my real self. ""Just have me write the ending then, people are getting impatient.""

I (the character-narrator, not the author) turn to the computer. I type:

*McRedditor checked the top upvoted reply he got on the thread: it was a comment. A very big comment. It was a story, actually. It looked like… a prompt reply.*

""AH, JESUS, MAN, SERIOUSLY!?"" I (narrator) ask myself (author).

*The first line of the story read -- '""Deddit,"" the intern spits out, out of breath as he blasts into my office. ""Deddit.""'* 

""GREAT. NOW MCREDDITOR IS READING THIS STORY. THE CHARACTER FROM YOUR STORY IS WRITING A STORY ABOUT A CHARACTER WHO IS READING THE ORIGINAL STORY YOU'RE WRITING WHICH IS ABOUT ME WRITING ABOUT HIM. WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU GO FROM THERE!?""

I (author) don't speak. I (narrator) don't not speak. Junior does not speak.

The door comes open.

I have saved up some money and will be looking to buy myself my first ""big"" watch purchase, in the 1000-2000 dollar range.

Id prefer from it to be from one of the big name brands (Rolex, Omega, etc.), but would be open to really nice options from other brands. 

My options thus fa (all pre-owned)r:

-Rolex 6694 oysterdate precision

-Omega Seamaster 300 of some variant

-Omega Seamster Aqua Terra

-Christopher Ward C60 Trident Pro GMT (red bezel, black face)

-Omega Speedmaster Triple Date

-Omega Speedmaster (Michael Schumacher)

I would prefer something that I could wear with anything, be it business casual, just being out and about, or something more formal.

I already have a Seiko Superior Orange Monster for my every day wear, but I like to change it up a lot.

Are there any other watches that I have missed that really shine at this price point? I would prefer pre owned so I can get something nicer at a lower price than retail, and it makes me feel better if the bracelet already has a few scratches on it. 

Thanks.

Edit: Oh yea, and Orion Watches are at the top of my list too, love the design and as a aspiring hobbyist watchmaker its really inspiring."

5zcppf,327,2017-03-14,The Kaspersky Tale: Server Takedown,freydank,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5zcppf/the_kaspersky_tale_server_takedown/,"Hey TFTS, FTP to share a recent anecdote.
While technically not being about TechSupport
it **is** an worthy tale to be told.

**The Stage:**

*A middle sized software development company on a grim, cloudy tuesday afternoon.  Narrow corridors spread across the floor and form a confusing maze.*

*The walls are painted in white, barely decorated and spread a feeling like a the inside of a mental asylum.*

**The actors:**

$ME: yours truly; apprentice in software development at $ProjectTeam (*I actually do support but for applications)*  
$OA:  OtherApprentice in software development but for internal software  
$NG: new guy; intern at $ProjectTeam also the ""end user"" in this story  
$TT: TechTeam; basicly our internal HelpDesk  
$BCA: BusinuessCriticalApp, in use by every employee

**The story:**

*Picture $NG sitting in his small office just barely able to fit him and 3 other co-workers.
He's exhausted.  
Enduring trainings almost daily for 8 hours each messes with people.*

$NG recently was told where to get 3rd party applications from (*Note: our company has a strict no-download policy*) and such went on to locate the installer
for a file-browser application on our network drives.  

*The scene fades away. $ME and $OA are in focus and just across the floor of $TT offices.*

They're busy studying for an upcoming exam and try to ignore the world around them.  

All is going well when...

*MailIcon of $BCA appears on $OA's taskbar*

&gt;$OA: ""Huh."" *checks eMail*

**KASPERSKY! VIRUS ALERT!!!**  
**$maliciousFile in directory: $NG's $UserDirectory**

&gt;$OA: ""Yo $ME, somebody got himself in trouble, I guess.""  
&gt;$ME: *glances over mail* ""This is gonna be fun. He's just been here a week. Might be a new record.""

*A few more words were exchanged. After about a minute $OA and $ME noticed the unread mail counter has risen from about 15 to 110*

&gt;$OA: ""Oh shit. All those mails are sent because of the virus alert! And $TT haven't even send anybody out...""

*The counter is still rising. Currently at 300 unread mails*

&gt;$ME: ""Holy shit is Kaspersky sending out mails for every second that file still exists on his harddrive?""  
&gt;$OA: ""I guess so. It `shouldn't` do that but it does... oh well.""  

*800 unread emails*  

*Noises of shuffling feet and squaks of a trolley are to be heard.*  
$TT finally sent out an emergency squad!

&gt;$OA: ""I really want to know how this plays out.""
&gt;$ME ""Well I'll run after them and have a look.""

*The counter hits* **1013** *unread emails. Shouts echo along the corridors!*

&gt;Voice_1: ""$BCA has crashed on me!""  
&gt;Voice_2: ""I can't open my inbox! WHAT IS HAPPENING?""

*Another shout is to be heard...*

&gt;GuyFromTT: ""God forbid, the server for $BCA shut down.""  

*$OA cracks down; $ME heads out the office*  

*fade to black*

*$ME arrives  at $NGs office*  

One techie is already on the floor angrily ripping out any cables going into the contaminated box 
while the other stands guard to ensure no evil-doer will enter and mess with **their** authority.

They load the machine onto the trolley, inform $NG it'll take about two days and exit the scene.

$NG stares at $ME, who visually struggles to hold back his laughter,  baffled at what just happened.

Finally he sighs in relief, the stress vaporizes into the room and he asks:
&gt;""Is it `NORMAL` here to immediatly take away the computer?""
  
*$ME nods*
&gt;$ME: ""Yes. Yes it is.""

**The aftermath:**

* $BCA server was offline for about an hour.  
* $NG got a software security training. *Again*.
* The computer came back two days later. Fully formatted and with a fresh install
* Kaspersky got downgraded from a hilariously obnoxious spambot to decently annoying antivirus.
* Still **no** backup sever in sight for $BCA.

**Edit (my answer to /u/Koladi-Ola):**  
So basicly what he ($NG) did was to google the application and just take the first link to a well known regional download site (not the official website though)
He claimed to be using that site for 15 years but failed to learn that the site ""recently"" (= for approx. 5 years to date) started to provide the software with their own custom downloader which is considered to be affiliated with a big ad-network and malware distributors (and this is a pretty known fact about that site by now)"

At this time, the possibility is closed due to financial and legal constraints. However, if there is a program in which your school will fund a summer internship or allow work for class credit, then feel free to contact me and we can discuss the possibility.**

We are a very new startup, we have not even released marketing materials and a website yet. We are a partnership between some top coaches and football theorists, and scientists bringing methods that have not yet been applied to sports analytics. We are in the process of developing our ideas into a proof-of-concept product. We are not just one more analytics company--our team includes names that are big in the soccer world and have strong connections to clubs around the world. In short, we already have an extensive sales network. In the meantime, we could use assistance putting our product together.

We are only just beginning to meet with investors, so we do not yet have any capital. But equity is on the table, and if we meet our financial goals a real job is likely to follow. For these reasons, a student intern would be ideal, and hopefully by the time you graduate we can bring you on for a full-time salary.

The ideal intern has programming experience, ideally in Python or Javascript (to work on our analyses or interactive visualizations) and is already familiar with the current state of soccer analytics. But anyone willing to learn, I'm at least willing to talk to you about the possibility. Our team is currently split between the US and Spain but the position is remote.

This is a great opportunity to get involved in sports analytics. If we fail, you will have gained valuable real-world experience and made some useful contacts. And if we succeed, you will end up as a critical, early team member of a fast-growing company. Anyone interested, just message me and we'll take the conversation from there."

   I started looking and applying for summer internships about two weeks ago and just got a call from one of the companies to have an interview next week. Since it's a little late to apply for summer internships, there weren't a lot of jobs listed on websites. I basically applied to almost all of the ones in my major without reading all the details on the job description. After getting the call for the interview and going back to check the website, I noticed that the job title said college intern and not summer college intern. Does this mean it's an intern position during the school semesters and not just the summer? Should I call back and ask or just wait till the interview? I understand that it's not likely that I will land a job on my first interview but I still want to make sure before next week.
Also, does anyone have any good tips for interviews? I have only been to one career fair so far and I always end up forgetting what I want to say when talking to recruiters and I don't want this to happen at the interview... Apparently I'm interviewing with three people, how is this going to work out? Should I bring my resumes to the interview as well? Any advices would be greatly appreciated, thanks! "

It's an invite only which means the stuff on our website is top class. I'm talking about being featured in New York Fashion Week and being featured on Vogue Magazine, and these are thai designers.

You can actually checkout the stuff but we don't ship outside Thailand as of yet. We are still in beta. BTW, when I say we, I mean me and my 2 partners. We haven't hired anyone yet, apart from interns.

Here's what I would like to know. One what is your initial impression of Juerix. 

Second, I am looking into opening up for international shipping. Should I open it up to all countries or should I gradually expand? If gradually, what country or countries should I expand to? Would you buy anything from Juerix? 

Third, what do you think about the prices? I'm sorry the prices are in Thai Baht so divide by 34 to get the price in USD.

Fourth, any advice, suggestion?

Thanks guys. This is my first post on this subreddit so I apologise if I did something wrong."

Anyways, I'll have to give you some context, so you can understand my situation.

Basically, I came out two years ago. They flipped their shit and they called an imam to my house. I called my friends and asked them to stay at their place for a couple of hours. I get a call from my parents and they said wanted to go to an Islamic psychologist/ conversion therapy.I told them I would go to a therapist, but on my own terms and i get to choose who we get to see (I picked a lgbt friendly therapist). We met the therapist and he listened to me, then cussed out my parents. After that, they told me to pack my backs and kicked me out of the house. So during winter break, i went upstate to New York and stayed with my cousins for about a month. My parents decided to visit my cousins and wanted to take me home. My cousins decided to talk to my parents about me coming back home till I finish my associates degree. So we came into agreement about two things:

1) We wouldnt bring up my sexuality till 2 years has passed
2) They cant force religion on me at all or else i'll leave them be

So life went by for the next two years, i graduated with an associates degree and transferred to George Mason University. Ive been heavily focusing on my classes and finding jobs lately, so i can pay for my classes for the past year. Today while i was eating breakfast, my mom came up to me and said the two years ultimatum was up. We needed to talk. She said that "" I couldnt be living this lifestyle since its a huge sin, I shouldnt trust my friends or Mason's resources since they'll encourage the behavior, i should focus on something else than being gay, I should go to a islamic psychologist(and they wanted to choose one this time). They wouldnt have grandchildren and they think that the US is going crazy by accepting LGBT folks"". She said that she'll kick me out of the house in a year or even before that. She started crying and I told her that i wont change who i am. She said she'll give me a year to focus my gayness on something else (which sounds so fucking ridiculous). I went out for a jog to vent out my frustrations, but ended up breaking down and hung out with my best friend to comfort me.

She's giving me a year because i would finish up my bachelors in Health Admin. The thing is that I have been able to find a job with my associates degree at all, so i decided to focus on my bachelors. Also Im planning to switch my major in Marketing, so it might take me another year for me to graduate while looking for an internship. I feel like I'm probably going to be kicked out before a year, so im planning to go to Mason University and reach out to their career center and as well as the lgbt resources to get myself together and leave the house. Also i have a support group and friends to reach out to whenever i need them and a place to stay for a bit. I guess this was just a rant i needed to get out of my chest.

Would i need anything else if i get kicked out of the house? Also are there any other resources i should reach out to? Any advice would help yall. 

Tl;dr: My coming out story/homophobic parents kicking me out of the house. Ranting about my crazy parents. Trying to prepare for the worst within a couple of months. 

Edit: Just had a convo with my dad. They wanna figure out what i want in life and whether or not i wanna go to conversion therapy with them within a week. fuck. that. isn't it illegal for conversion therapy in VA? There's a high chance I'm going to get kicked out. "

Right now the company is trying to meet a deadline so it's crunch time.  They have assigned me code to go through to fix the formating until the deadline has been met.  At that point the team should have more time to work with me.

My manager and coworkers keep hinting at wanting to keep me on, and I've had several coworkers ask me directly if I'm staying. However, I **haven't received a formal offer** or discussed staying on seriously with my manager. I've been responding to these comments and questions neutrally, to give me the option of staying without having to go back on my word if I decided to leave.

I got an offer from my dream company last week, which I accepted. I now need a way to handle these questions without burning any bridges. I seriously love the company and people I work with, but the new offer is way too good to turn down.

Should I:

* Be neutral until I receive an offer from current company, then reject it

* Talk to manager about not being able to extend

* Wait until someone asks me directly if I want to stay, then explain that I have other commitments, and hope the message gets around

* ???

I've never been in this kind of situation before. I just want to make this as easy as possible for everyone involved. I'm leaning towards just being up front with anyone who asks from now on, but I don't know what's best.

5zdtbu,1,2017-03-14,"Knee caps, open reduction, and total replacement questions.",Daddydante88,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/5zdtbu/knee_caps_open_reduction_and_total_replacement/,"So I take care of my mom who is 65 years old. About two years ago, she suffered a stroke. Thankfully she did not lose much of her mental acuity. THE stroke did leave her extremely left deficit. She can't see out of the left on both of her eyes, and as far as using her extremities, she can use them but it is extremely hard for her. She can walk move them but when it comes to something such as standing, it is nearly impossible for her to not use her right leg.

Doing so, she has damaged her right knee. Previously, she's had two knee replacements. Eventually she starts complaining of pain in her right knee and she was recommended for physical therapy. During one of the physical therapy sessions, she broke her patella.
 http://imgur.com/ngwVFML 


The break left her with the ability to still move and use her leg. A small portion of her tendons that attach to her patella, the remainder went up with the piece that broke off. MRIs showed that her tendon was stressed and the Assumption was it would eventually break.

To repair the damage, the doctors did a open reduction. The the surgery was a failure. When she was released from surgery she was given an immobilization brace. The problem was, the brace they gave her would not stay on. She could walk about 15 Steps before it would fall around her ankle. She is not morbidly obese, but she is a little larger. About 250 pounds. So because the way her thigh tapered it essentially would fall off like a cone.

Talking with other doctors we were recommended a range of motion brace with the sides locked. We got one, but it was about a time period of two weeks from the surgery till she got the range of motion brace. The different structure of the brace made it absolutely perfect to keep her leg straight and to stay on. But, in the intern her immobilization brace was completely ineffective, and due to her stroke and inability to remember to use only her left leg, the open reduction separated and is essentially now completely undone. 

 http://imgur.com/znPG52W 

The doctor is saying she should wait a few weeks and see how she feels. But I feel he just is washing his hands of the situation. If her remaining tendon was going to break in the first place, it's going to do so now because there is nothing connecting the remaining tendon to the lower parts of her leg.

With the amount of medical advancement that we have. But the amazing things that we can do, I do not believe that nothing can be done. Is there another technique that we could look at? Cementing her knee together? What about totally replacing the patella itself?

I appreciate any input, and anything we can do to start looking in other directions."

I just started the second semester(first one we did mostly web and front-end stuff) and later in it we are supposed to do more software dev(back-end): OOP and design patterns, data structures and algorithms.
But interviews for Java internships start in a few weeks and most of them demand the above mentioned list of skills that I wouldn't have studied at that time in college, so I have to on my own if I want to pass the interview tests.

My experience is limited, I've been dabling in C and Java for a few months now but nothing advanced, basically does anyone know decent sources to study on ""OOP(Java tutorials I can find on my own though) and design patterns, data structures and algorithms."" ?
I know I have limited time and I will probably fail but maybe just maybe I can land an internship or an unpaid practice session."

We all live in a house that was provided for us, but there were only two bedrooms and a closet area that's big enough for a twin mattress. We drew straws, I drew the short one, and wound up in the closet. 

It was fine for the first bit, but the space is *really* small and not conducive for much other than reading and sleeping. It's also right next to the kitchen, which means smells and sound leak through pretty much constantly.

This is a very high-stress internship with long days and a lot of social interaction, so when I get home I want to decompress by myself. Lately I've found myself wanting to just play video games or watch TV, but my two roommates are constantly wanting to interact. They like to listen to music while they do everything, want to joke around, ask me a lot of questions, etc. I feel bad, because they're both super nice, but at the same time I'm left feeling wound up and stimulated all day until we all go to bed. 

On top of this, the internship is in another town where I don't know anyone. My schedule is so packed that I don't really have time to go out and meet people, and when the weekend rolls around I just want to sleep and soak up as much alone time as possible. I occasionally drive back to the town where I live the rest of the time to see my girlfriend and some other friends, but it's expensive and I'm quickly running out of money. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. Lately I haven't been able to sleep, my panic episodes have been increasing in frequency and I've been extremely irritable. The nature of the internship also has me keeping my gender identity under wraps, (I'm a trans woman) which means I don't have much of an opportunity to express myself the way I'm comfortable with. (My roommates know and are respectful, which is a big plus, but no one else does.) 

I only have about a month and a half, two months max left, but it's starting to feel like years. How do I make the best of this?

tl;dr: living in a closet, constantly around people, need to decompress, can't, also transgender and have to hide it "

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony, VUDU and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

5ze5s0,17,2017-03-14,Summer internships,[deleted],UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/5ze5s0/summer_internships/,"Hello Dr. Evil,

Apologies for the out of the blue outreach. 

I am reaching out to see if you could share a volunteer opportunity with your CS students, helping nonprofits. Its called the Technology For Impact Fellowship and it brings technology students together to support them building software for nonprofits over the Summer (part-time, typically done outside of a full-time Summer internship/job)

This is our 4th year and we have had some amazing student fellows from UCSC in the past.

Quick blurb you can share:
-------
The TFI Fellowship is a Summer opportunity for computer science students interested in building software products for nonprofits. It is volunteer based and part time, typically done outside of a full-time Summer job or internship.

Students gain experience with real world ownership over product direction, the chance to make a massive impact and opportunities to learn from and network with industry professionals.

You can apply online at their website www.tfi-fellowship.org
-------

Thank you so much!

5zecyu,1,2017-03-14,[M4F] Twisted Ladders,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5zecyu/m4f_twisted_ladders/,"Note: Old prompts and scenarios are still open. Feel free to suggest anything you like, too. I'll at least give you feedback, and I am singularly difficult to offend.

Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

5zf5tw,18,2017-03-14,Growing TagPro,sccrking555,MLTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLTP/comments/5zf5tw/growing_tagpro/,"TagPro is in a unique situation in which it has enormous potential for growth and is on the cusp of a major push. To help with this I am hoping to form a committee/organization to facilitate this. This organization will be separated into three factions and I am looking for 3 leaders to run these subcommittees: 

**1. Landing New Players**

This branch will focus solely on expanding the word about TagPro through various channels (social media, Real life, marketing, etc). The goal for this branch will be to get as many people as possible to play pubs and become introduced to the game. This is a major issue as everyone knows the game is fun, but how do we reach our target market to let them know Tagpro exists. 

**2. Pubs ---&gt; Competitive**

This piece is equally challenging but extremely important. The idea here is essentially to get new players pubbing to understand what competitive tagpro. Competitive tagpro is night and day different than playing in pubs and we need to provide each person that is in a pub a chance to at least understand the game is more than just 10 minute capture the flag. 


**3. Retention**

This seems to have been an issue in recent seasons as many people are leaving the game. There is a need to understand why people are leaving TagPro and find ways to resolve those issues if possible. We need to be able to keep people around as long as possible, especially the next couple seasons as we expect to be growing and need a strong base. I envision someone whose able to talk to everyone and feel out the trends of why people are leaving. 


This is not going to be easy by any means. I am looking for passionate people with a drive to make a change in tagpro. I'll openly admit the first month to 2 months may be difficult as these initiatives take time, although it is getting to a point something needs to be done. This is also a chance for younger players to have a chance at a leadership opportunity. You will learn how an organization is structured, leading teams, running effective meetings, and being an excellent communicator. I would almost consider this like an internship opportunity and would be glad to write anyone a letter of recommendation (You would be surprised how people/employers view personal passions such as this). 

I'm sure most people will blow this off but if you are interested please send me a message on Reddit or talk to me on mumble as soon as possible. As ridiculous as this sounds TagPro needs a push badly and I think this could make a difference. I would also ask everyone in the community to help in any way you can. This could be just telling friends, co workers, classmates about tagpro. Regardless of who you're friends with or who you talk to on Mumble, everyone has a shared premise of enjoying TagPro and this community. The amount of potential is enormous and I look forward to finding out what WE can accomplish. "
5zf8jc,2,2017-03-14,Just feeling a bit defeated,heylukeitsblake,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5zf8jc/just_feeling_a_bit_defeated/,"In the war known as ""establishing myself as an adult"", I have lost another battle. In almost 3 years of legal adulthood, I have moved to my home state, lost a considerable amount of money, grew up, found a strong work ethic, found myself, and have been going fairly steady the past 1.5 years. Sure I had a bad car accident once and have had a few other close calls, but I have been steadily employed and pursuing studies I absolutely love.

With being a double major of Computer Science and Physics, I dove into the challenge purely because I think I will succeed with the knowledge I gain. Yet, the more I got into the program, internship possibilities and even grad school started to seem like shining options. After not hearing back from a few internships, I did some looking around. It would appear the community college I spent 4 weeks never had my withdrawal go through. They have no record, I have no record. The appeals process was over about 2.5 years ago, and it would appear there is nothing I can do to get those off my record. If I continue to get all A's for the remainder of my undergraduate, I can still only receive a 3.82 for my overall GPA. My institutional and regents GPA (where literally all of my actual studies occur) will remain as they should, as the F's did not transfer.

For anybody who may say a 3.82 isn't bad, it is the absolute highest overall GPA I can finish with now. No B's. Not even a B+. I don't go to a stellar undergrad school for STEM, and now I believe my chances of transferring (if I were to do that) are basically gone. Thankfully I have free reign on what Physics research I can do, so hopefully any job or post-grad will look at those over the 2 F's that are 2 years before I truly began college.

I'm not letting this drag me down hard, or let it stop me. I've had a parent die at a young age, battled and beat serious depression/anxiety, learned how to work harder than a horse, and most importantly found my true calling. I know at the end of the day things will work out, but damn, I can't help but feel a sense of temporary defeat by this. Why would any company respond to my transcript? I was hoping to have my switch to my IT job be my permanent expedition from the service industry, but it looks like it's back to bottle service for me this summer...

Edit: Would you look at that. Not even an hour after this post I received a denial email from my top internship choice. Man today is effin awesome sauce."
5zfbwt,3,2017-03-14,New 3% Tax for Non-Essential Items,Mike_G-P,GreenParty,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/5zfbwt/new_3_tax_for_nonessential_items/,"A new 3 % tax is needed  for non-essential  items that humans don't require to live . 

We pay taxes to keep our towns , cities and country not only functioning but strong. IF those tax dollars are used wisely.

A 3 % tax on items that we don't need to live like Junk Food, Alcohol, Cigarettes,  TV's, DVD's , and millions of other items that we don't need to live could be used to strengthen prepare and make  a more secure infrastructure for towns, cities, the  Provinces and the country as a whole.  As well as making Cannabis Legal and taxing that on top of an extra 3% tax increase on non-essential items would create millions and potentially billions of extra tax revenue dollars that could be used to restructure the infrastructure, of the country.

This would provide millions of extra tax dollars to cover the cost of  creating grants and incentives towards renewable energy system that could be used for creating jobs, training, education, houses and buildings grants and incentives for adaptions of solar, wind ect that could be sold back to the energy grid when generating more power then a house or building is using at that time. 

This would also make the energy grid system more secure against catastrophic power grid outages. If a community could generate enough power with solar and wind, in a town and/or city to keep needed services running during a catastrophic  power outage from the main grid, to needed services, while the main grid is being repaired.  

Another issue that is quickly becoming a problem is a greater population living below the Poverty line, as the Poverty line is based on full time min wages but doesn't address the population living below that line, as the 
Poverty line increases so does the population of homelessness and people falling through the cracks and becoming dependent on the system for help.

A new Living  Wage System needs to be implemented to address people living below the poverty Line  .

What I have been noticing is that every time the Poverty Level increases so does the cost of living, and mainly rent increases adjusts to that level based on full time employment . As the Poverty line increases more people fall into the category of living below the poverty line and the amount of income to pay for rent increases. 

What used to be, many decades ago, cost of rent = 25% of ones income, example ( $250 towards rent on say $1000 month income ) to today 75% of ones income ( $750 towards rent on the same $1000 months income )

The increase of homelessness is increasing from over 25 years ago and will increase more as the poverty level increases beyond 2017,because more people are living below the poverty line as the poverty line increases.

We need another level added  to addresses people living below the poverty line  from $0 - $15,000  a year , or ($0 - $15,000 Below Poverty Level ) ( $15,000 - $25,000 poverty Level )  and base the lowest rents on people making below the poverty line instead of basing the lowest rents on people living at the poverty level . It is of my opinion that within 10 years of the poverty line increasing to $30,000 without addressing people living below the poverty line that the homeless factor may increase 2 - 5 X  so instead of having 200,000 people experiencing homelessness today in Canada, that Canada will have over a million+ people experiencing homelessness situation. Never mind a living wage, we will need a survival wage paying for basics like a place to live, heat and food, which it is fast becoming that situation, and for many that is the situation as of 2017. 

I think that all the departments that work in the same system of helping people that are living at and below the poverty level needs to work very closely together from Social Services , Employment Services , Subsidized Housing Services for development of a Living Wage Services System before the system find itself having to cope with a million+ people needing help and assistance . 

Some Ideas that the system could address in the near future .

1. Implement another level of income based on below the poverty level $0 - $15,000.

2. Implement a min level of rent and rent increases based on people living below the poverty level. $0 - $15,000

3. Implement a Living Wage based on people living below the poverty level. $0 - $15,000

4. Create and make it easier to access more programs for training for employers to hire people based on people making below the poverty level . ( more trades and training for in demand employment and programs to meet the requirements of what employers are needing , ( a drivers license and or other courses  ) for people that don't qualify because they aren't on EI or Social Services or struggling on living below the poverty line at min wage . 

5. Create more Subsidized Housing for people that are living below the poverty line but aren't on Social Services, EI, or on Disabilities but trying to survive on min wage .

6. Implement a wage buffer for people on Social Services and EI that allows people to make a wage while on Social Services, Disabilities and EI so people can make a living wage to cover the cost of living while on the system.

7. Increase the available amount of money a person can have in their bank account from $1500 - $15,000 that doesn't make them ineligible for Social Services .

In conclusion,
from what I've noticed in the last 30 years based on my experience of living below the poverty line it's going to get a lot worse, there are going to be more people in greater need going into the future , more people will fall through the cracks without safety nets to catch them . As well preparing towards a transition away from Fossil Fuels to power houses , buildings, towns and cities the Government needs to support new innovated infrastructures that can replace the Fossil Fuel and Energy System of today for the future . The Government needs to have money in order to create more programs, grants and incentives and that money comes from taxes . If people are spending money on items they don't need, like big screen TV's etc, then the Government should charge a higher tax to support the needs of the people that are struggling to make a living wage . While giving more options and resources to people to get ahead and live above poverty level they intern would start to spend more money on things they don't need and put more money back into the system by buying items they don't need but can afford as a want or desire , by spending money on non-essential items = a higher tax, 3% that gets put back into the system.

The Government needs to take a bold step, and step up, and prepare now, to deal with an increased population, living below the poverty wage, and transitioning away from fossil fuels and investing in a renewable green energy grid, by increasing taxes.

I took several CS classes in high school, then obtained an AS in CS from community college- through both, the language taught to me was Java. I stopped to work and save money for college, since I more or less support myself as my parents don't have money, and got stuck in a loop. So, recently, I wanted to turn things around. I've gone through with the Intro to Programming course on Udacity as a refresher, learning a bit of Python and HTML/CSS in the process, and now...

I don't know where to go. They recommend mobile, web dev, or data analysis... I don't think I'm qualified for DA, don't have a Mac for Swift 3.0, and I struggle more with HTML/Android/SQL because I'm so used to Python and Java. I look at local listings for junior jobs and internships to get an idea, and internships want you enrolled in a 4-year, while both list acronyms I don't even recognize as requirements. 

So I guess what I'm trying to understand is how I go from here to becoming something worthy of a job(honestly can be as low-level as it gets, I'm looking to start making enough to survive, not become filthy rich right now). I've looked through the FAQs and whatnot, but I feel very confused by what feels like half-knowledge and don't understand how to get a job without taking loans out for uni.

Really any advice on how to pick up my spirits and move forward towards getting a job would be appreciated greatly."
5zfr3g,11,2017-03-14,Law school and epilepsy,chrisgrahamthelawman,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5zfr3g/law_school_and_epilepsy/,"For the tl;dr version and context, I'm looking for advice from other law students/lawyers that have epilepsy. I developed epilepsy as an adult mostly during law school, and I'm starting to freak out about how it will impact my career. I'm a 3L getting ready to graduate from an upper Tier 2 school, and I've been planning my career to begin by hanging a shingle straight out of law school. When that plan started I wasn't having seizures during the day with zero warning and I could still drive. 

So, this is my story. During my senior year of undergrad I started having seizures in my sleep. As far as I know, I only had a couple, but the only reason I ever knew I had one was because someone was sleeping with me and it woke them up. They only happened in my sleep, were controlled by medication, and it never effected my education, or really my life at all. The same continued for my 1L year and fall of my 2L year. 

They started happening more during my 2L spring semester, until I had my first daytime seizure while I was in my office working in our clinic on campus. I was alone, and I didn't realize I had even had a seizure until I connected the dots later. I woke up on the floor, drove myself home, had two more back to back seizures, stopped breathing, my girlfriend had to call 911, and I got taken to the ER. My doctor did a med change, but I kept having seizures, and I ended up not being able to finish out my clinic, I had to get my exams extended until the summer, and it also cost me the opportunity of working an internship 2L summer while I got a med change worked out. 

Last semester (fall 3L) wasn't too bad; my doctor got my meds mostly under control. I had more seizures during my sleep than before, and I had semi-regular petit mal seizures while I was awake, but I rarely had grand mal seizures. 

This semester (spring 3L) has been bad though. I've started having grand mal seizures while I'm awake more often. A couple of weeks ago I had my first seizure during a class. Thankfully it was a mild one, and it was during my contract drafting class, so there were only ten of us in there. I didn't have any friends in there, and I stupidly hadn't told the teacher that I'm epileptic when classes started, so no one knew I'm epileptic, but I came to and said not to before anyone called 911. My best friend was on campus, somebody found him, and he got me home. 

And then it happened again at school this past week. I was in our common area talking to a friend when I had a seizure. I came to in our records office talking to two EMTs; someone called 911 before my friend could say I was epileptic. 

I'm just really stressed about how this is going to impact my career if I can't get it back under control. Having a seizure in a class with ten people was bad, having one in the common area was even worse; I can't imagine what having a seizure in court is like. It is incredibly awkward and embarrassing to me, and I have had difficultly handling it socially. Beyond the seizures I've also had periods of incredible depression since it started happening. I'm going to be moving when I graduate, so I'm also going to be having to switch neurologists, and as I'm planning to go solo I don't have a job with health insurance waiting on me, so I'm also going to have to figure that out. Are there any law students/esquires that are going through or have gone through similar circumstances? I could really use some advice. "

My budget is arround 1400€ and i can't buy any of the Dells XPS line laptops since they are not available in my country.

I'm thorn appart between buying the 13"" MacBook pro 128gb from 2015, an ultrabook like the ASUS zenbook line or another gaming 15,6"" laptop.

At home i already have a nice gaming desktop with windows 10 (for games) and Linux mint (for work).

In July I'm heading to amsterdam for an internship só i need the laptop to be enough to code (mostly Java, Python, Android, JavaScript, etc), have a nice build quality and a nice punchy screen (i didnt like the screen on my Lenovo at all).

Here is the form:

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
1400$, Portugal

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life but with the best specifications for the money.

* **How important is weight to you?**
I'm going to carry the laptop around most of the time so weight is important, anything under 3 / 2.5 Kg.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
I have no preference, i work with linux and windows at home.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
No more than 15.6"".

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Mostly IDE's and Text Editors. Maybe Photoshop.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I want the one of the best screens if no the best i can find for my money, a good keyboard, good build quality and a good amount of ports.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I would like a laptop that is enough for my work, with good build quality and good specs that make me happy in using it and lasts me a good amount of time, maybe 4 to 5 years.

I am going to buy the laptop Tomorrow so i'm relying on your answers.

Kind regards."
5zg93j,23,2017-03-14,Emotionally Exhausted and in need of advice.,drunkjockey,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/5zg93j/emotionally_exhausted_and_in_need_of_advice/,"First time poster here, let me know if I'm messing up any etiquette! 

I have a mess of a mother. At this point I need some outside perspective on how to go forward (or not) with having a relationship with her. 

Here's a background:

She and my father divorced when almost 25 years ago, when I was three. My dad found monogamy challenging and was very controlling financially. My mom only left him when she found a new boyfriend. She **still** blames my father for almost everything that is wrong in her life. She has been with my (ex?)stepfather for about 15 years. I have never gotten along with this man. He acted like an annoying older brother and functioning alcoholic at the best of times, at the worst a raging alcoholic. I moved to my grandparents when I was 15 because of him. 

My biggest issues with my mom stem from resentment over my stepdad and her inability to prioritize me and my brothers needs over their wants. They are also incredibly fiscally irresponsible, and have been almost completely supported by my fixed income grandparents for at least five years. I also resent that she manipulated me into taking care of her mental emotional health for many years. Everything is about her. I got my dream internship? She says ""Congrats! I'm so happy for you! You're doing what I never could because your dad wouldn't let me."" 

From here on out I will call stepfather the DrunkDutch as he's never actually acted as a father to me. When my mother was having substance abuse issues (wine and pain pills) he refused to stop bringing alcohol into the house, that sort of thing. She eventually lost her nursing license and hasn't held a job down for more than a year since. Two years ago he had some sort of affair, and the drinking RAMPED UP. I'm talking up to four bottles of wine a night, and then on to vodka and jager when that stopped being enough. He was fired from his nursing job for being hungover at work. Personally, I think he was probably still drunk, but my mom wouldn't admit it. Then his first DUI happened and things have gotten worse and worse. 

Last year I got married, my mother (anyone have a good nickname for her?) and the DrunkDutch had been doing an on again off again thing. Oh he's sobered up for a month? He must have fixed it! Oh no! He fell off the wagon again! I'm leaving him this time! Oh he's sobered up for good this time! Rinse and repeat. During one of their off again moments she alluded that he'd become physically violent with her. I told her how I felt about him, and how I wouldn't be inviting him to the wedding. She agreed with me, until two months later when they were in a new honeymoon period. I stuck to my guns and he did not attend, but my mom left early with her friend and went and partied it up with him rather than staying until the end of the night. 

This cycle continued for a few more months, then in January shit really hit the fan with him. I don't have all the details, but he almost died from alcohol poisoning two or three times, there were domestic disturbance calls, and I don't know what else. After I told her how I felt about him, she put me on an information diet. I have recently found out that he's attempted to strangle her on several occasions over the past month, even though he's no longer living in the house. I only know this because a random neighbor of her's, who I've never met, contacted me on facebook because she was worried about how often they had been cops and ambulances at her house, and wasn't sure who else to contact. I talked to my grandma and she told me everything (against my mother's wishes). According to my grandma (who I adore), mother dearest doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, but this is not the case.

She wants to be friends with him as long as he stays sober. Three days ago he got out of the hospital after a six day stay for alcohol poisoning. He'd drank a litre of vodka, showed up to her house, attempted to strangle her, then drank more when she went to the hospital. Later he was found completely unresponsive, had an abv of .7, and went into AFib. But she still wants to be friends with him because he's been sober for three days and ""he really had a wake up call this time.""

This is hard for me because while she has certainly been a victim in the most recent dramas of her life, it in no way negates her previous behavior and she refuses to remove herself from this horrible situation while she continues to leach from my grandparents.

I would love advice, and thank you all for letting me have a rant here. I can go into more detail if anyone is interested. I have TONS of stories. "

5zgaud,2,2017-03-14,I can't help but hate interacting with people.,pelabotic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5zgaud/i_cant_help_but_hate_interacting_with_people/,"TL;DR I feel like an outcast for simply wanting meaningful relationships with people, relationships I can't seem to find. Getting really violent breakdowns about once a month.
If you know a better subreddit to post this on, please reply!

I always get the feeling something's wrong with my relationship with people, and I'm frustrated that I can't figure out at least whether it's me or them. I became very stressed because of it. I genuinely don't get what my problem is, or if there is a problem in the first place. 

I am 19 M, Eastern European, living and studying in the UK. I consider I am pretty well educated, passionate about what I do (Computer science), don't do drugs (used to smoke, but that period didn't make any difference), and have various knowledge and interest in other subjects such as politics, geography, history, music, art. Therefore I think it's safe to say that I'm not the most boring person ever (even though I came to question that too often). 

I feel as though I am not taken seriously by friends / colleagues. Out of 30 people I say hi to everyday, about 2 seem genuine and say hi back with a smile. the other ones just do it out of being polite. I cannot tell if I just have shitty acquaintances or if I'm the douchebag.

I feel as though I am disregarded. Most people I interact with on a daily basis almost never seem too keen to respond to my interaction. If I'm with a friend and we meet somebody we both know, I get 20% of the attention while my friend gets 80%.

Maybe it's the fact that I don't know how to communicate. After all I'm a computer scientist, typical nerd ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

What's most discouraging is that I feel this much more often with women. And I don't fucking get it. I've started to become self conscious on my weight and appearance, even though I've been repeatedly told I'm fine and average looking.
I've been staying in a lab for 2 hours thinking of this and not doing anything.



Below is just an example of an interaction with somebody that I thought I could get close with. But I feel treated this way by 90% of the people I talk to. Be it potential friends or women I'd like to date. And it turned unhealthy by me having to deal with angry impulses every now and again when all this frustration builds up. Sometimes it's crying my eyes out, sometimes it's punching and breaking stuff. 

One thing that stuck with me is the interaction over the weekend with one particular girl. Let's call her X. X and I are colleagues at school. X texted me after I went back from school because was annoyed at me for not telling her when I went home from school. She said she wants us to walk together, since we live close to one another. (positive signal, right?) I told her 'oh sure I'll tell you'. 
Next day I do exactly that, and on our way home she does is complain about school. I repeatedly told her before it's not the nicest thing to hear people only complain about the same stuff over and over and now I'm trying to change the subject to something else. We end up not talking much by the end of the walk, except for her randomly saying something meaningless.
Next day at school I see X and I say hi, she responds like I surprised her in a bad way, almost as if I was annoying her. In the lab that day me and my mate are forced to sit close to her, so we do. The whole lab I felt as though was blatantly only interacting with my friend which I know is annoyed by her, ignoring me.

What the hell was her complaint about me not giving her enough attention about then? Do I only have to give her attention while she's allowed to treat me like shit? 
Before this I told her I'd like to see her initiating conversation sometimes, cause she's always saying I don't do it enough. When I complain, X considers I'm 'too pretentious'.

Even this other person which I considered a good friend has promised me to tell me about places he applies for internships to but only ended up asking me for help with his online tests after not telling me about how he arranged them in the first place.

How can I realise if all of this is my fault or not? If I would've observed this kind of behaviour only in some people I would think it's their problem, but it's the majority of people that seem to not want interacting with me and I start questioning my own personality."

5zgbwg,1241,2017-03-14,I [25F] did not miss my fiance [28M] when he was away on a business trip.,NoLongerFiance,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5zgbwg/i_25f_did_not_miss_my_fiance_28m_when_he_was_away/,"My fiance, Dave, and I have been together for over six years now. We met when we where both undergraduates in college. I was eighteen at the time and he was 21. 

Dave is an all-around good guy. Most of my family just adores him, especially my grandmother. He has really stood by me. After we had been together for about a year, I developed a serious illness. Even though I can tell it really scared him, he stood by me and gave me all of the support he could. I eventually made a full recovery. 

A year after I learned my illness was in remission, I graduated college and accepted an internship out of state. Dave could not feasibly go with me to the internship for a variety of reasons -- my room and board was paid for by my employer and Dave was finishing up grad school. For over a year, we lived apart. Dave was very supportive and even drove to see me once, an incredible feat considering the state of his car at the time and the distance he had to cover to see me. 

When my internship was nearing its end, I was offered a job in a rural area very far away from all of mine and Dave's friends and family. I accepted the job because it paid incredibly well and because it would offered me experience unlike what I could get in other places. Dave really stuck his heals in the sand on this one. He said that he, freshly minted from grad school, wouldn't be able to find a job in his line of work anywhere in the area, that I was basically forcing him into unemployment if he were to move with me. He told me that he couldn't do long distance again, that either we stay together or break up. I think he was hoping that I would return to our college town where he still lived and search for a job there. 

I did not back down. I told Dave that I was happy to do long distance and that he could come with me or that he could stay where he was, that that would be his choice. He eventually caved and moved with me, finding a job in his field almost immediately. 

We have been living in this rural area for over a year now. Dave has proposed and I enthusiastically said yes. We are now in the thick of wedding planning. I thought I was happy until Dave went on a business trip. While he was only gone for ten days, his absence has really given me a new outlook on our relationship. 

I did not miss Dave. Every day I came home from work and watched whatever I wanted to watch on TV. I cooked whatever I wanted to cook. I went to bed when I wanted to, not having to worry about Dave coming in much later and waking me, like he usually does. I slept better than I have in a really long time as Dave snores and disturbs my sleep at night. I did not miss Dave at all. 

I also started to think about all of the things I do not like about Dave. He complains a lot about almost everything. He really does not like the area we moved to and constantly reminds that he would be making SO much more money if he had stayed in our college town and gotten a job there. This makes me feel really guilty and while I have been outspoken about how those words make me feel, he still constantly complains to me. Dave also complains about his job, even though it is in the field he studied and went to grad school for. Dave also complained heavily while he was in school -- about the stress of classes, how much he hated his part time job, etc. I just thought it was the stress of the situation and would one day get better. He still complains, however, and while I know we are not in his ideal setting, we also make plenty of money, have health insurance, live in a nice house, drive nice cars, etc. Our lives are pretty decent and we enjoy a higher standard of living than we have ever previously had as adults. 

Dave is also a slob. I groaned this morning when I woke up and saw that Dave had ""unpacked"" from his business trip by dumping his entire suitcase out onto the living room. When Dave was out of town, the house stayed clean. There were no crumbs on the table or mystery plates in the sink when I woke up in the morning. This might be TMI, but the toilet was also much cleaner (no ""splatters"", if you know what I mean). 

All in all, I felt a lot less stressed. I'm usually the one who cooks dinner and cleans (even though we both work). Coming home and only having to take care of myself was such a nice reprieve. I actually dreaded Dave returning. 

Now, all of today, I felt awful and anxious. I realized that I'm not sure I want to go through with the wedding. I fantasized all day about moving to New York City, a place Dave has said is out of the question for us because he doesn't think he'll find a job there, and living alone or with a roommate. I dreamed of my tidy room and the healthy dinners I like to cook when Dave is not around to eat them or when I prepare another meal that's more suitable to his palate. I dreamed of all the free time I would have just taking care of myself.

But then the bubble burst because I realized that maybe one day, I would want to have a romantic partner again. Dave has his faults, but so does everyone. I am not an angel either. I often have a short temper and can at times be impulsive. Dave loves me and wants to marry me in spite of those faults. I feel terrible for loving my life in Dave's absence and for wishing us to no longer be together. Is this how all long term relationships work? Is this a normal way to be feeling about someone you are engaged to marry?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I find the negative qualities of my fiance so annoying and cumbersome that I found it relaxing for him to be out of town. Is this normal or is this a sign that our relationship is doomed?"

Problem was that I effectively spam applied and I didn't realize that the position lasted for 8 months.... Yeah so I had planned to start sophomore year in the fall but I don't know if opportunities like this are common and if I should go to school next semester or take this opportunity. I am obviously new to the CS field so I don't know much about how important an internship is, I also feel kinda unqualified since the interview was mostly personality stuff which I am really good at and a bit of basic OOP trivia which I did pretty decent on but I still slipped up on some things. I honestly don't know how to code very well and the job seems like it will require some decent amount of coding and currently I am definitely a bad coder. My GPA and school might look good in Canada too since the average Canadian GPA is much lower than in the United States and my GPA would honestly be top of the class for some Canadian schools for CS like SFU which I heard from some peers has like a 2.82 GPA average overall or something so the CS GPA would be even lower.

 I am also interested in pursuing Masters and got an admit in one of the prime institutes in US (top 15). Now I am confused between taking up job or masters. As interested I am in pursuing masters in one of my dream universities, I also feel I might be missing out on working on cool project which I will be heading.

Over the last year I have had a girlfriend who has been amazing and had made me the happiest I've ever been. Only problem was that we met when I was on a visa internship at her country. 9 months later I've had to return to my home country because of visa problems. I am now trying to get another internship visa so that I can go back to see her. She has just told me that I am revolving my life around her and that she is worried that I am have no ambition and my only focus is her. I think it's worth mentioning that she has a son and is a few years older than me. Part of me believes that she is afraid that I'm coming over just for her for another year and that I have no ambition to Grow in life. If this is the case I am willing to change my whole attitude on life and become a better person for the both of us. She says she still loves me and hasn't told me not to come back but I am afraid that she said that I'm only coming back just for her, maybe she's losing attractiveness towards me.

Please let me know what you guys think, I'm willing to go over there and become ambitious for the both of us, I'm just afraid she's not that into me and then I make the journey all the way to her for nothing

Fast forward to today, I recently received a message from my friend who previously interned there that the project was dissolved and his former team members has been reassigned.

I e-mailed someone that formerly worked on that team to confirm and he did indeed confirm that a shuffle has happened and he asked my manager to be to give me an update.

Today, my manager to be e-mailed me saying that he will call me on friday to give me an update.

Now... here is where my anxiety comes in. I have already signed the offer letter, the Visa has been processed and shipped to me, and I am currently trying to find housing in the Bay Area for the summer. My employment however is at will.

What I fear, the worst possible scenario is that they might just cancel my internship due to the fact that the project is been dissolved. I initially think I interviewed to be on that project? My title however is still a generic title and on my J1 Visa training plan, there is no mention of the project.

Anyone else have experienced this? What is likely the possible outcome? What should I do in preparation for the worst that might happen? I know that it will be extremely hard now to find an internship for the summer because it is pretty late..."

I am only 21 and my younger brother and I have very little support. She is so sick and we have had horrible experiences with doctors through this whole journey. I am sure that I have ptsd.

Doctors told her that she had a few months to live 4 years ago.. but she is still here. That is another story in itself. She is my best friend and from the day I was born I had severe anxiety and fears of her dying due to other issues. Now my worst nightmare is coming true... I don't know what to do. She is so weak and frail.. she has lung cancer and now they are saying it's in her bones. This is so horrible to watch. I want to throw up and can't sleep.

I graduated recently and managed to get 2 offers. 1 in AM that starts in April, 1 in CF that starts in July. My heart &amp; motivation has always been for corporate finance. 

Would it be ethical to accept the position in AM, work there for 3 months and then leave for the CF position? I know BB banks &amp; big 4 consultancies usually have a high employee turnover, but this is a medium sized AM company. 

Apart from internships, this is my first professional experience so any advice is appreciated. 

Thanks.

5ziof1,1,2017-03-15,"Me [26 M] with my GF [24 F] of 4 years, at a break-up point",IkeaCreamCheese,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ziof1/me_26_m_with_my_gf_24_f_of_4_years_at_a_breakup/,"I've been with my current GF for the last 4 years and it has always been a LDR. We always had our ups and downs but I was always pinning it on the fact that it was a LDR and we were a bit edgy and missing each other and it would then from time to time turn into something ugly but we always managed ways to sort it out.


Couple of months ago I went back home for couple of months and we moved in together. My GF worked and I stayed home as I just graduated. During these months a lot of things happened, good and bad. We had our issues after moving in, she was feeling often depressed dissatisfied with her job and on occasions with us but I was usually able to comfort her and explain that we will manage things between us and that it will be okay. From time to time she would throw her fits and I would also lose my patience and we would start arguing badly. One of us would usually pack our things and be prepared to leave but we would also sort this out eventually and agreed that we need to put in more effort and that we'll do it and I believe we were both putting effort for things to work.


Couple of weeks before we would leave the apartment we got into a small fight that ended with her packing her bags and leaving and me not stopping her. I prepared a lunch and she had some (for me) inappropriate comments about how I could make something different and how what I made was bad for her stomach, which I understand but I was offended by the way she said it. She has those moments a lot, soI maybe need to get tougher or check my ego, or she needs to gets softer, I don't know what it is. Nevertheless it ended with her leaving. Eventually I managed to get her back once again, we sorted it out and continued with our life.


After we moved out I went back to where I was living previously to do an internship and to look for a job. Since long time we had a plan that she would move to where I live, apply for university and do another degree as is easier for her to get a job that way afterwards and for 2 months we were in the process, we did not argue, everything seemed to be okay and was taking its path and I was really happy, even though a bit worried how it will turn out because moving away to a different country might come as a huge shock for her.


Then about a week or so she again became distant and I was picking around and manage to get things out of her. She is basically unsure about how thing will work out between two of us if she comes to live with me and if we'll jump at each other throats because two of us living together was a mess and she was worried mainly because eventually she packed her bags and left. She is afraid that it will happen again and if it happens she will have no place to go as the only person in the new country is me. She also says that we do not function well together. I am afraid of this as well and for her to come here she has to quit her job and if she want to go back it will be hard to find a new job. It something bad happens I would blame myself completely and I do not want to take this risk just so we could try things. I feel that if we didn't work things out for 4 years and another 4 months of living together we never will.


Moreover, she says that sometimes she feels like we're best friends but not a couple and I agree with her. I feel a huge void between us and I have complained to her about this many times but nothing changed. I feel that from my side there is no void but I just cannot approach her in emotional, physical, sexual ways and I want all that with her but I am not getting it back. I believe it is her insecurity that is the main problem. She is afraid that if we break up we will lose a best friend (obviously) but is also afraid that if we stay together and she moves we will start resenting and hating each other. I was always saying that things we'll be okay and that we'll work it and I am waiting for them to click-in but it's never happening and I am worried that it will never click-in and she wants me to say and I said it. I can only feel sure about her if she feels sure and it doesn't go the other way around. If I feel sure she will not, I cannot say anything that will make her feel secure and in her words it turns out to be lying to her and to myself. Basically she holds the key of our happiness, if she would be sure that our relationship is the right thing and fill the void from her side I would love to spend the rest of my life with her.


I cannot make her feel the way she doesn't feel and I cannot lie to myself anymore and restrain my emotions. I am lacking things in this relationship and I want to fix this lack of things with her but it is always slipping through my fingers. I am trying to be as supportive as much as I can but sometimes not making anything just kills my wish to try. I am a at a serious turnpoint in my life, battling with my own fears and problems, living in a foreign country, looking for a new job, focusing on a specific area because of her and getting rejected over and over again because what I want to do is not very developed where I live.


I am in huge mental storm about what to do. At one moment I feel like giving it a shot and in the other I just don't want to risk it and I think I should just break everything up.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Me and my GF are at a turnpoint in our lives and relationship. She needs to quit a safe job in a country without safe jobs and come live with me and we both fear that we still didn't resolve our issues. From her side I feel a void never being filled up and she is the only one that can do it. If she doesn't come to live with me it's the end of relationship, if she does things might or might not go bad.

I absolutely dislike pair programming and now I will be interning this summer at a company that loves pair programming. I'm really hoping this time around I won't hate it so much but the idea of having to pair program all the time sounds like a nightmare. The devs at the company also apparently don't have permanent desk since everyone is always moving around pair programming.

Out of all the times I have pair programmed, whether it be friends, internships or a part of interviews. Not once have I ever liked it. I feel like I can't think and work freely. Theres only one time that I've paired and felt that is was a valuable experience. It was in my first internship and while I learned a few things in that session I could have just as well learned the same information from proper documentation and looking around in the codebase. 

Outside of that all my other pair programming experiences during that internship were annoying. I paired with a senior dev who basically just did all the work himself and clearly had not interest in letting me drive. Like okay I get that I was a noob and barely knew shit in comparison and he wanted to get the job done quickly but how am I suppose to learn if I don't get my hands dirty. 

The other occasion was with a new hire. It was clear she had her way of doing things and I had mine but boy did she mind. While I was driving she kept trying to tell me what to do and pointed out any little typing mistake I made as if I was some kind of idiot. By the end of the pairing session I could not stand her and mentally gave her the glare of death from then on.

I'm just not seeing the benefits of pair programming enough to warrant its implementation. 

I am currently still applying to other internships even though I accepted the offer already. "

2. We make it clear to landlords that students are primarily looking for furnished listings and won't be able to tour the place.
3. Landlords and listings can become ""verified"" if students say they have lived there before (we also have reviews on listings, even though there are not very many right now).
4. Students can look up directions to work from each listing, right on the results page! Once you add a ""current employer"" we show you the commute to work by walking, biking, or bus.
5. Student Connect. If you click on ""Connect"" at the top (after logging in) you can see where fellow students are working.

I know a lot of you write, and there are a ton of stories about people moving to big cities, on their own, and then bad things happen. This is kinda one of them, but it most certainly isn’t your average story. 

I’ve always lived on the outskirts of a big city, and I always traveled into the city for needs, such as groceries and clothes. Cities are nothing new to me. So when I found a two bedroom, single family house for sale for cheaper than cheap, I jumped quickly to it. 

It wasn’t in a bad neighborhood at all. It was friendly looking, like the “block party” type neighborhood. I saw a few elderly citizens walking their little dogs, and a couple younger women jogging around the block. Friendly enough, right? I thought so too. When I met the realtor, Jane, she was your average realtor. Tall, small waist, proportioned hips, shoulder length chestnut hair. Thin lips, round face, and fair skin. She was very nice, and helpful on all basis of purchasing a house. 

“Why so inexpensive?” I asked with a smile. 

“The owners have retired, and are now traveling around the world, and do not want the burden of the house. They want to keep it maintained, and quote, not dusty or degraded, unquote.” She replied with her sincerest smile. “Also, they just renovated it about 3 years ago, and so everything is in pristine condition. They just don’t want to see it go to waste.” 

“Understandable! Why not rent it?” 

“Renter’s are more of a hassle, Mr. and Mrs. Lennard don’t want the responsibilities of upkeeping while traveling.” 

I thought that was a valid point. 

We walked down the sidewalk toward the porch. It’s an open porch, no railing, but still looked eloquent. It has a white floorboard porch, with white wooden steps leading up to it. There are three rose bushes lining each side of the front porch. *A nice touch to the house.* The front door is a heavy cherry wooden door, with a gold knocker on the front of it. On each side of the door there is a narrow, door length, cherry framed window for you to peak out of. 

She unlocked the door and opened it to a spacious house. First thing when you see when you walk in, is the hallway leading to the kitchen. The hardwood floors had been redone to the retired couple’s liking. May I say, they have great taste! A lighter red colored wooden floor surrounded us in all the large room. To the left of the front door is the living room, size was acceptable, since it’s just me and my cat, Snore. *Yes, I have a cat named Snore. Don’t judge.* To the right of the door, is the dining room. Very roomy. The living room and dining room are about the same size. We walked down the hallway to the kitchen, and I was beyond excited! There is an island with a marble top counter. The other counters are also marble top. They too, are newer. 

We reached the master bedroom, and it is beautiful. The same cherry colored wood floors, spacious, for my liking, maybe even a little too big. It has a nine shelf walk in closet. Three shelves on each side, and three shelves directly in front, (far back wall). Has one window facing my neighbor’s house, and one window facing the street. Decent size windows too. Easy enough to fit my slender figure through, if need to break in.  *Which thankfully, I have had to do yet!*

We visited the guest/second bedroom, and it did not have a walk-in closet, and only one window, which faced the side of the neighbor’s house. It is definitely a good office room. Oh yeah, I’m a medical intern for the hospital here in the city. No, not Grey Sloan Hospital/Seattle Grace Hospital. I have yet to figure out what to use the second room for. Currently it is a storage unit for boxes of the unknown. 

After visiting the spare room, we stepped into the hallway that led to the rooms, kitchen, dining room, and front door. She told me there is a basement, and that it was unfinished.  I asked her how unfinished it was, and she said very unfinished. As I’m writing this to you, it is still in the shape it was eight months ago when I first moved in. Unfinished, untouched, and scary. I have only been down there once, and that was because my brother wanted to look at it. 

Side note: It smelled very odd. Not musty, but not really old either. I’m not sure how to describe the smell. It just smelled… *”off”.*

There are four poles that are staggered throughout the basement, it isn’t a huge basement, but decent size. The walls are drywall, and looked like they had just been plastered to fix holes. Big holes. Assuming Mr. and Mrs. Lennard wanted to fix some electrical stuff? Nothing extremely creepy, but still, I always hated basements, so I never went down there. A few boxes were left behind, but they looked like paperwork from back when my mom was in high school. I didn’t bother with it. There was a cellar door that led to the outside world, so that was nice to have, in case of an emergency or something.  

I still haven’t used the cellar door. 

So, to the reason I’m “redditing” you guys! A few months ago, I was had a first day off in like two weeks, so I was home catching up on my favorite shows. I was scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, when I heard a bump from below me. At first I thought it was Snore, but knew I’d never let him in the basement alone. So I figured it was just the house settling or something. I mean, it is like 20 years old. I go back to scrolling and watching, and didn’t hear anything for the rest of the night. 

A few days had past, and I had forgotten about the loud bump in my basement. I was at home getting ready for another 48 hour shift, when I heard it again. This time it sounded more distant. As if I was on one side of the house, and the bump happened on the other side of the house. There was a lock on the cellar door, on the outside, which I only had the key to, so I know no one was breaking into the basement from the cellar. Once again, I blew it off, and continued getting ready. 

As I was leaving for work, I walked around the side of the house, opposite of the side where the windows were to the bedrooms, toward where the cellar door was. I noticed that the lock had been unlocked, which freaked me out so much! I quickly locked it back up, and dead sprinted to the car. I called up my brother and told him about what has been happening lately. He assured me I was going crazy, and he’d come check it out for me while I was at work. 

Later that evening he sent me a text. Following conversation below:

Bryson: *Hey sis, you be clear in your house. You’re probably just working too much and going coo coo for coco puffs.*

Me: *Uh, no, I know what I heard dude, it was a thump or bump. I heard it twice. Not crazy.* 

Bryson: *Ok whatever you say. But hey are you renovating downstairs?* 

That scared the crap out of me. Why would I, a 24 year old female, be renovating a basement that I’m afraid of? 

Me: *Uh, no? Y?*

Bryson: *Oh….well it looks like there is more plaster coverings around the wall. Like you were trying to cover more holes or sumthin.*

Me: *Noo… I haven’t done anything to the basement.* 

I asked him if he could stay at my house for the night to make sure nothing was going on. And honestly, I wanted him to hear it for himself. The thumping and bumping I heard. 

Fast forward to the ending of my 48 hour shift. Bryson had notified me that he heard thumping and banging from below the living room. Of course, being siblings, I rubbed it in his face that I told him so. I asked if he went to check on it, but he said no, it was four in the morning, and wasn’t going to be the idiot in scary movies. I laughed and agreed. 

When I finished my shift at six in the morning, I hurried home. I parked my car in the garage and walked into the house through the garage. I  found my brother passed out on the couch with a kitchen knife on the coffee table next to him. *Something must have spooked him, to have a kitchen knife next to him.* I go take a shower and get in more suitable clothes for relaxation. After I got done getting dressed, I heard my brother waking up in the living room. I walked out to the living room, and stopped dead in my tracks. Bryson looked like he hadn’t slept in three weeks. He looked awful. 

“What the hell happened to you?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?” 

“You look like you hadn’t slept in forever. I’m sorry, but you look like dog shit!” 

He did, his eyes were puffy and had dark circles underneath. He looked pale, and drug down. He seemed to have all the energy and life sucked right out of him in a matter of hours. 

“I didn’t get much sleep last night. After I texted you, I kept hearing the banging. I wrote it off as the cellar door latch broke or something, but I didn’t dare go check it out. Not in the dark, and not alone. I was in and out of sleep due to the banging, so yea, sis, that’s why I look like shit.” He gave me a sly smile and went to make coffee. 

I sat on the couch dozing off when he brought me coffee. He mentioned us looking at the cellar lock and latch to see if it somehow came undone, or broke off. I nodded in agreement and sat in silence. 

The latch was there, but the lock was not. I’m not sure what happened, but it just wasn’t there. Like someone stole it? Bryson suggested we went to the hardware store to buy a new lock. I agreed, but asked if he could go alone, since I just got off work. He happily agreed and left. 

I was curdled up with Snore in my bed and drifting off to sleep. Almost asleep, I was awoken by a loud slam/bang sound. Snore freaked out and meowed at the door. I curdled closer to the wall with Snore in my arms. I looked to grab my phone and heard another bang. Almost like the cellar door was opening and closing. 

I called 911, and then Bryson. Bryson rushed back to my place, but the police beat him there. The police had already taken a statement, and searched the house after telling them everything that’s happened. They couldn’t find anything. I even mentioned how there were more plaster smudges on the walls, and they just kind of blew it off. 

Bryson wasn’t buying it. So he did what any other logical person would do. Go to Best Buy and buy cameras. A few hours later he came back, and installed all the cameras while I was sleeping. He woke me up and told me that everything was installed in the basement, and we would catch our culprit soon enough. Soon enough was too soon. 

A few days had passed, and I was sitting on my couch studying when I heard it again. The bangs and booms from within my basement. I didn’t move, I didn’t turn the volume down, I didn’t want whatever was down there to know I knew they were there. I just sat there in silence with Snore meowing next to me. 

“Shut it Snore!” I said in a harsh whisper. All he did was meow back at me. He really has a personality on him. 

I got a notification on my phone stating there was motion detected on camera 2 and 3. I waited patiently to look at the footage until I knew I was safe to move. For that matter, breathe. A few hours had passed, and I was still staring at the white paint chip on my wall. Listening for any movement or activity going on beneath my very ass. Occasionally I heard what sounded like a grunt, and then the occasional bang. After a while it stopped and I felt safe in the house. 

I took out my phone and opened the app for the cameras, hit rewind, and pressed play. For a little bit I pressed fast forward, because nothing was happening, but then something caught my eye. 

On the screen, to the right, I saw a shed a light being let in. Previously, there was no light. Only source of light would be the cellar door opening. Sure enough, the cellar door was opening. I watched intently, remembering every detail of what I was seeing. I really wish I hadn’t. 

The screen filled with light, and I could see the basement clearly now. Only a portion of it though because of the camera’s set up. I heard a thump, which was the door opening up and hitting the ground outside. Thump number one! Still watching, I see a man, maybe 6’5, a little hefty, with a small beer belly, walking down the damn steps into the basement. 

He wasn’t alone though. There was a girl with him, maybe my age? Slumped over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. The cameras were too far away for me to tell if she was breathing or not. But I found out shortly that she wasn’t breathing at all. This guy walked over to the closet, closes to camera 2, and opened the door. (I didn’t even know there was a closet down there. I guess, being down there once, wasn’t enough.) He shut the door and walked back over by the cellar door; girl still on his shoulder. When he came into full view, he had a sledge hammer in his left hand. He slid the girl behind him on to the floor, making her land on her head. I swear I heard her skull break. He took the hammer and slammed it into the wall. One big slam, was enough to make a decent sized hole. He grabbed the girl, and stuffed her in odd angles into the hole. Then he walked back over to the closet where he got the sledge hammer and grabbed the plaster stuff, and a few other things to cover up the hole. (Sorry I’m not sure what you have to do to cover up a hole relatively big like that. Not smart in construction).

I immediately called 911 and explained to them in a frantic, disorganized way, of what I just saw on my cameras. I waited ten minutes for cops to show up. By the time they showed up I was sobbing into Snore, and praying I wasn’t going to die within that ten minutes. I texted Bryson to come over too, so he could comfort me. 

The cops did their investigation and found three bodies in the wall all belonging to females in their twenties. Three females who have been reported missing for the last five months. The police took my camera’s and phone for evidence, to help identify the man. Bryson stayed with me until we knew for certain that the man was charged and put away to prison. 

A few days ago, I got a call from the detective active on the investigation, stating they found the man who was behind the murders and they have him behind bars. Turns out, he is the son of Mrs. and Mr. Lennard. His name is Joshua Lennard. He’s 28 years old, who lives three blocks away from me. The reason why the Lennard’s sold the house for so cheap and went to travel was because of their son. 

They knew the entire time who he was, and what he was capable of doing. He confessed to the three murders, as well as five others that happened in his teen age years. Those bodies were never found though. Detectives believe that his parents were involved with getting rid of the bodies, but they have no leads to their whereabouts. The realtor who sold the house, doesn’t know where they are either. 

I’m so glad that this is all behind me now, and that he is in prison rotting for the rest of his life. Since then, I haven’t heard any weird bangs or booms, and my house feels more peaceful now than ever. I think I’ll find a roommate, because I don’t think I can live alone now.

5zjxi7,20,2017-03-15,We made a site to help students find housing during internships. Let us know what you think!,PadPiper,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5zjxi7/we_made_a_site_to_help_students_find_housing/,"We're a team of current students and new grads who launched www.padpiper.com to help students find housing for internships this summer.

It has been many months of coding day and night but we are excited to have over 100 listings on the site. I have personally spoken with the landlords that made most of the listings and many of them have been hosting students for years.

Most of our listings are in the San Francisco, the Bay Area, Seattle, Toronto, and Vancouver right now. If you know of any landlords that host students we would really appreciate it if you could spread the word!

This site is entirely focused on students and we have features that portray that.

1. As a landlord you can only rent for 3 to 12 months.
2. We make it clear to landlords that students are primarily looking for furnished listings and won't be able to tour the place.
3. Landlords and listings can become ""verified"" if students say they have lived there before (we also have reviews on listings, even though there are not very many right now).
4. Students can look up directions to work from each listing, right on the results page! Once you add a ""current employer"" we show you the commute to work by walking, biking, or bus.
5. Student Connect. If you click on ""Connect"" at the top (after logging in) you can see where fellow students are working. Some programs have this amongst their own class (custom Google Maps) so we figured we would integrate this into the site. Whether you want to see if others will be working near you or find out where your classmates are interning, feel free to browse around the map!

There will most definitely still be bugs, but please let us know what you think. Any feedback, questions, or recommendations are welcome :)"
5zjykt,2,2017-03-15,Speculations on the employability for international students during and after College?,WavefunctionX,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5zjykt/speculations_on_the_employability_for/,"Hi all, I understand this post may come off as a digression from the objective of the subreddit, but as an international applicant who intends to pursue a US education, I felt it might be necessary to have a healthy discussion on our 'futures'. Furthermore, since I am an 'Indian' this question is even more important. 

From whatever I've read about the proposed H1B reform, it seems that it wants to:
1) Reduce outsourcing and keep jobs to individuals who receive american education
2) Raise incomes for all under the H1B visa

Also to an extent it seems that the H1B will impact IT professionals from asian countries. However, this still begets the question- If 2 college students - X and Y go through the same undergraduate degree at a US college and if X is American while Y is an International student and they have the same merits, who is more likely to get a job. As of now, many are speculating that considering the fact that the wage level is to be standardised, US multinationals may recruit more american workers. 

Now these may be speculations, but it's real and it's happening. Many of my acquaintances who are relatively skilled have been denied H1B visas. What was even more alarming is that a few international students who are in their 4th year have yet to receive a placement. Some of these students are ready to work on unpaid/low paying internships at the moment. 

I'm also particularly worried about the socio-cultural environment. Considering the relatively recent shooting that took place, I'm concerned about my safety and the safety of other people who come into this land of opportunity and work hard to contribute as much as possible. I'm not pointing any fingers, but factors like these have to come into consideration because of the alarming rise in unrest. 

Hence, I'd like to call for all AOs and other experienced people to perhaps give us an idea of the possible job situation 4 years down the line. I'd also like other international students (applicants and those currently enrolled) to discuss their worries and give their views on this. 

Also if anyone knows a better place to post this, please help me do so. 

Sincerely, 
A troubled international applicant "
5zk4cc,2,2017-03-15,Unable to land work in field almost one year after graduation from engineering.,FixThisResume,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5zk4cc/unable_to_land_work_in_field_almost_one_year/,"Hey all. I recently graduated from a mining engineering at one of the top schools for this field in my country. I was able to land a one year internship after my third year and expected that to really help me find work after graduation however after a couple hundred of applications and emails I haven't even gotten requests for interviews. I originally attributed it to the downturn in the industry as none of my classmates had anything lined up at graduation either, but now a few of them have landed some work and others either returned to uni or took analyst level positions in other fields. 
I didn't do myself any favours in my job hunt by travelling in the summer after graduation either. Now it's almost been a year and 
i'm worried that this gap is only going to worsen my chances at landing decent work. I've been doing a little volunteer work at some local shelters since getting back from travelling in October but i'm only in a couple days a month and its mostly preparing meals/ensuring good conduct. 

As much as I try not to I keep feeling discouraged and doubting myself. I'm now considering taking my masters next year in structural or industrial (1yr), or maybe make the switch into compsci (2yr program) even though its totally unrelated, but i always liked coding and the job market looks promising. 

Anyhow, I digress. Here's the sheet. Any and all criticisms are appreciated. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwzKyyALo__cc29NeEtMYVB5Rzg/view?usp=sharing

Also during my final year of school the entire final semester was just for our capstone projects where we designed and created a pre-feasibility study for both Underground and Open pit operations. I'm wondering if I should add these into my resume or maybe just cover letter or talk about them in the interview (if/when i get one lol). 

Thanks. I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any"
5zke49,4,2017-03-15,So confused about my career and life. I feel stuck and have lost my drive to do anything good for myself. Need some advice/perspective.,confused_forever,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5zke49/so_confused_about_my_career_and_life_i_feel_stuck/,"Ok, so a quick intro. I'm a 22[F] from India, completed my college, majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
I wrote my GRE in 2015 , got 322(Q-168, V-154, AWA- 3.5) and had applied to almost 11 universities in the US for a masters in Science prog. Got rejected by all. Since I was confident about getting into at least 2 or 3 Univs, I did not sit for lot of the companies who were conducting placements in my campus, barring a few for which I had to sit as it was made compulsory by our college/university.
I got the job, an IT job, at a big MNC. A job I despised. In India , IT jobs are very commonplace. You don't have a job, get into IT. It's the shittiest place you could be in, but it is still a place. Again obviously there are exceptions.
But then there was a gap period, from my graduation day till my first day on the job. A gap of 5 months. I would say those were the most purposeful days of my life up until now. I rebelled, and, against my parent's wishes , dabbled in graphic design and acting. I was an intern in graphic design at big conglomerate. The work was not very design oriented and I ended up hating it, rejected their offer to join packaging design and got out. Then I went for method acting classes, which I just loved. My parents were not very happy with my saying that it could be a career for me. They advised me against it. They advised me to continue studying as I was intelligent ,smart and talented. While I was intially against their Idea to write an entrance exam, to get into India's top BSchools, I nevertheless thought It could be a good backup plan. Plus who doesn't like actresses who are smart with good educational backgrounds.
Anyways, so I researched about some good prep classes and joined one. That was a pretty good decision. I loved the classes ,the instructors, the material, the rigor and the fun in solving problems. Keep in mind I was attending acting classes as well as the prep classes. So by day I would study, and by evening I would rehearse my play lines.
Though this was a good time, I was not blind to my shifts in interests. I liked studying and was second guessing whether I really wanted to be an actress? Whether I'd be a good one? Whether I'd like to play make-believe romance with various men? Whether I'd like to jeopardize my personal life ? because ,of course I want to have a family, a husband and children. But then came the conflict,I liked acting too. I loved playing characters and experimenting with dialogues delivery,comic lines, etc.
Simultaneously ,I got into mild depression. The more I thought about my future, the uncertainty,my career,etc. the more depressed I became. On my parent's insistence I went for some therapy/counselling.
Then came the D-day. The day of the exam. But then I should also tell you why I so badly wanted to get into this institution.
I had always been 1 (maybe 2) steps less than the best. I always got stuck in the good category, in mediocrity- be it in exam scores, or in life- I knew I was stuck in mediocrity. I had too many people tell me I have so much potential yet I don't utilize it, and I too knew , somewhere in the depths of my being that I didn't unleash myself.
I also fell for a guy in my prep class. Had a huge crush on him. We flirted around each other, but we also loved solving problems together, teasing each other by giving problem-spoilers(if thats a thing!). We shared a lot about each other's lives, and one thing I knew- he too wanted to get into this BSchool.
So I wanted to get out of mediocrity. I wanted to go this BSchool because of the lift and platform it would give for my career. I wanted to make my parents proud. I also, no matter how much I convince myself otherwise,wanted to go with him-naively- to the same top BSchool he would go to.
It seemed like all this was a train I had to hop onto, and was afraid I'd miss it. So naturally, optimism and pessimism played a tug of war within me, sometimes causing collateral damage.
Now back to the D-day. I wrote the exam. No expectations, told parents the same thing. After waiting for a month I got to know the results. 91%ile.
I was happy- when supposedly I shouldn't have been, because 99%ile was what was needed to get into the top BSchool. My parents were happy in a shocked way- they were surprised I scored well after just 3.5 months of prep.
He didn't get through too.
Anyways, 5 months were over, there was a sudden change with my job. I had to join a month earlier.
So I had to move to a new city, quite my acting classes, leave my family and leave him too. I was adamant not to join the job, but my dad said it would be stupid, since getting jobs outside is not so easy. He's a sensible man, and I conceded.
I've moved to the new city.It was very quick, the first 4 months. Didn't know how time went by. I am planning to give the same exam again this year, for the BSchool. My dad suggested I try GMAT too.
But I don't know why I am in soo much of a flux. Which is why I have come to reddit, to seek whatever help and advice I can.
The Flux:
Joined my team. They seem ok-good, comparitively. But the job is just not what I expected it would be. What I learnt in college and on the in-job induction training, is totally different from what I'm doing, which is filling up Excel sheets. Coding is among the any things I like. I'm learning on my job, but I fail to see where my career would go. Looking at the ppl here, it seemed they were fine being in this job. Some perpetually waiting for that promotion they should have gotten a year or two ago. Corporate world is fucking different. I don't know what is right and wrong, what would benefit me and what would benefit others at the cost of me, which people are reliable and which are not. Its fucking weird to go to the job, I never wanted go to in the first place and then making fucking efforts to fit in and be in my supervisors' and colleagues good-books.
In all this hog-pog, I feel I'm letting life slip away- I'm not able to devote enough time to my studies. In fact , I feel guilty for even thinking to get out of this job and give the exams and go to a bschool, because people seem to be good here and the pay is ok-ish. I'm feeling bad for progressing. I just don't think I'm worth any progress.I think I am getting complacent. I know that my clearing that exam and going to the bschool would improve my career, but I don't have the same drive I used to during those 5 months!
Something is awfully missing in my life! I don't have the same drive! I am lonely. I don't have people in the office I can relate to, not like the ones I had in college! I don't know what reasons to give myself for getting back on track with life, for improving myself, for unleashing my potential and doing the things I enjoy doing and never thought I could do, just like in those 5 months!?
Those 5 months to me were like how old people would speak of , when they spoke about their youth. The wonderful days. But is that going to be it for me? are those 5 months going to be the only time I would be happy to remember for the rest of my life?
I feel lost,confused, disgusted, inadequate, lonely, yet I want to leave my mark in this world.
I now have started to get interested about my major, again. After so long, I think what if I get into my core company/ govt. organisation working with electronics, working with mathematics and physics (which I love). But then what about the BSchool? aaarrrghhhh!
What's wrong with me? Is feeling like this even normal?! How can I get clarity and conviction in life?"

I am getting ready to do an ""internship"" at the company I currently work as a Junior IT admin/help desk. I am about to finish up an A.S. in Computer Programming, and all I have in my way is an internship this summer. My boss agreed to follow along, and I will mostly just do the work on my own time, and he will sign off on it. I have been with the company for 5+ years, mom and pop place, we sell copy machines, ~20 employees. 

I need help figuring out a project to do, at least somewhat related to the company. I would say I am still a beginner. I know most of the syntax for Java, and C++. I have a basic understanding of html/css, javascript, and sql as well. I took a class on Jsp/Servlets and am currently taking a game making class in DirectX. I am having trouble breaking through to an intermediate programmer, and luckily my boss is cool and agreed to sign off on this, there is no way I am ready to work in a production environment. I am literally breathing code right now, re-learning c++, and need to brush up on my java a little.

All suggestions are appreciated."

The lack of experience is killing me right now and I'm really just coming to terms on how badly I fucked myself over by not getting some experience while in school. I've been applying to entry level financial analyst positions for 3 months now just to get my foot in the door but I'm barely even getting an interview (northern Chicago-land area).

5zkk2p,1,2017-03-15,I Have barely worked in my major 3 years after graduating/should i start a new career?,snipermark91,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/5zkk2p/i_have_barely_worked_in_my_major_3_years_after/,"3 years ago I was the first student to graduate from my school with a bachelors degree in sport management, at the time I was proud to be the 1st one and I wanted to have a great career and comeback to my school years later with a ton of success. After graduating I was working as a sales intern for the Philadelphia Soul, they said there was a good chance it could turn into a job if I worked hard and met my sales goals. I worked hard but I struggled to sell tickets and at the end of the season I wasn't brought back. That was the last time I worked in my field. Since then i've applied to probably well over 150 jobs in SM and have only a hand full of interviews to show for it. I had to move back home and eventually I settled for being a substitute teacher because I had bills to pay and it gave me time to apply for more jobs and figure out what I wanted to do or if I wanted to be a teacher. Last year, I worked as a full time gym teacher (without a licence) but at the end of the year I realized teaching wasn't for me. Now that i'm in a much better financial position I can finally move out of my house and to an area better equipped to a sport management career. I've been applying and applying just hoping someone will give me a chance, but still no go. I had an interview the other day where I was interviewed along 3 other people (all younger than me) at the same time. He said one of us would get the position. He did this exercise where he would rate us from 4 to 1 ranging from who had the best response to who had the worst response 4 being the worst 1 being the best. for 3 of the questions I received a 1 and 1 of the questions I received a 2. I felt really good about my interview. I didnt get the job. That was like the straw the broke the camels back. Since graduating ive worked many odd jobs in the summer and during the school year but i'm tired of working odd jobs. My goal has always been to return to SM but it seems like the younger college grads are getting all the entry jobs and even know im 26, i feel theres something thats turning me off to job interviewers. I no longer know what I want. I was the 1st to go to college in my family and just giving up on my college degree just seems so wrong but im trying to accept my situation for what it is. Do you think I should completely give up on my sport management career and go for something else? Or should I keep trying? I'm trying to become a new person now that i'm finally able to move so a new career seems intriguing but quitting SM is hard for me. 

Sorry for the long text and thank you for your responses. Be brutal, tell me what I need to hear. "
5zklmc,2,2017-03-15,Soon-to-be College Grad Considering Buying Home Rather Than Renting,tokeduptiger,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5zklmc/soontobe_college_grad_considering_buying_home/,"tl;dr About to graduate in May. Will make $75k/yr. Have $38k in debt (will be paid off in 7-8yrs paying $500/mo). Looking to buy a house in a growing area for no more than ~$200k. Mortgage payment calculations come out to be the amount I would pay in rent with a credit score of 720. Am I crazy for thinking I should buy a house three months after I graduate (when my current lease ends)? This [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/a/4D0v0) may also help paint a clearer picture of my situation.

I am graduating from a top university in May and I am fortunate enough to have secured a well-paying job in my field. The position I have secured is at a small company that has continued to grow year over year and seems to have a promising future moving forward. I worked there as an intern over the summer and have continued to work there throughout my final year at UNC Chapel Hill.

With that being said, I am going to be making an official ""move"" to North Carolina from New Jersey. I put the word move in quotations because I have been renting a place with a few housemates from school the past two years. The current lease ends August 1st and I am beginning to look for an apartment in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area (also known as the ""the Triangle""). Currently, I am paying around $700/mo in rent, but once I sign a new lease I will be paying closer to $1000-$1300/mo in rent. My starting salary is $75k working as a software engineer. Given that the Triangle is home to Research Triangle Park, the area is attracting more and more companies in the technology and health sectors. While it is not generally advised that someone beginning their career should make a commitment to one specific region of the country, I see this as potentially a great investment opportunity.

Gentrification is currently underway in the city of Durham. The area is becoming more popular and as a result, lower income families are getting pushed out. The homes in Durham are dirt cheap compared to the cost of homes where I'm from in central New Jersey. I could see myself signing my life away by taking a mortgage out on a two to three bedroom home around the value of $200k. Given that I am (soon-to-be) a new-grad, I will not have the capital to make a standard down payment of 20%. I currently have $2k in the stock market, $6k in savings, $38k in student loans, no car payment, and less than $1k in credit card debt that is interest-free for the next 14 months (I purchased a new laptop by opening a new line of credit in November with near full utilization at $2,800 and I will for sure have the principal paid by the end of the interest-free period). My credit score continues to rise as I bring my utilization down, I've seen it rise from 660 to 720 over the past few months. I assume it will rise to at least 730 over the next few months. I have estimated what my future financial situation will look like with this [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/a/4D0v0).

To make some ballpark estimates I am assuming a 3%-6% down payment of no more than $12k and a 30-year fixed mortgage at 4.66%. The mortgage would then be paid off by making monthly payments of $1000-$1300/mo which is how much I am expecting to pay in rent living in this area. My logic is that it is pointless to be paying someone else money to live on their property when I could be paying the bank the same amount of money to start building up my own assets. I understand that this is a large commitment, but I also see this as a great opportunity. I plan on speaking with a few lenders this week to see what principal I may be pre-approved for, if any. Explained in my edit below, I am open to having a housemate to help ease some of the monthly payments.

With all that being said, I wanted to see if y'all think I'm an irrational, intelligent, and/or optimistic human being given my situation and my plans for the future. Thank you in advance for taking your time to read into this and help me evaluate my situation.

Edit: I am attaching a [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/a/4D0v0) that I have used to give myself a rough idea of what my financial situation will be like given my salary expenses. As /u/SubaruSTi11 pointed out, I am open (although somewhat reluctant) to having a housemate to help keep my monthly out-of-pocket costs down. This would allow me to contribute an additional $500/mo toward payments or toward savings."

I have been working as an intern for almost a year at the state as a programmer. At my one year in about a week, I can start apply for an associate programmer position. It is pretty must guaranteed that I'll get getting hired and the pay increase is pretty huge. My parents make pretty good money and are pretty good with it. They have taught me how to save, but this is going to be a huge pay increase for me.

As of right now I live with my parents so I don't pay any rent. I do however have a car payment of $106 and insurance is around $290 for full coverage. I owe about $5000 on the car and have around $3000 in my bank account. When I get hired I do want to move out. I'll be paying around $700-$1000 a month on rent when I do move out.

What advice do you guys have with regards to saving up to move out? Also what should I do with the rest of my money? I don't plan on changing my lifestyle at all aside from moving out. 

edit: My only other expenses are food and my gas which combined are only around $230 a month. I also have a 15k college fund and currently no student loan debt. When I move out I will have to pay internet and utilities but those will be split and I will probably pay my parents around $70 a month for my phone bill. So my expenses as of right now are only around $690."

I've been looking at some housing options and found the yo:HA hostels, along with listings on 99.co and propertyguru.

I'm wondering how easy it is to arrange housing on the listing sites if I'm not in the country yet, since most of them want to be contacted through their local phone number. I also can't meet up in person to view the room first, so I'm not sure if anyone would be willing to rent to someone they never met.

Also, on the listing sites do I have to pay taxes on top of the advertised price?

The yo:HA hostels are a lot easier to book but they seem very expensive for what they are. I'm looking for a single person room, which is around $1000 at the hostel.

Any advice is appreciated :)"

5zlehi,541,2017-03-15,My great grandfather used to work with Dr. Josef Mengele - Part 2,CathrynMcCoy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zlehi/my_great_grandfather_used_to_work_with_dr_josef/,"Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zdxs5/my_great_grandfather_used_to_work_with_dr_josef/

When I first found the journals I figured I would just put them aside and let them be forgotten just the way they were over the last 70 years. But then I started reading. I know my close family does not want to know anything about it. They never talked about the past and I am pretty sure they would not start now. All I knew about my great-grandfather until today was, that he was a medical student that was working with a Doctor during WW2 and that he later became a Doctor himself. Born in 1914 and raised in Leipzig, he met his wife during high school and married in 1933. He was called into the military during his medical studies in 1939 or 1940, and was assigned to a doctor some time later, who employed him for his researches. That is all I know so far. He had 6 children with his wife, my great-grandmother, the youngest child was my grandfather on my father's side, born in 1949. My great-grandfather died in 1972. He was 58 years old and nobody is talking about how he died.

I will try to find out more about him and his career, but at the moment nobody wants to talk about it, because the funeral of my uncle is imminent and there is a very tense mood in my wing of the family. We all know we are expected to attend the uncle's funeral, but no one really wants to. His cremation was yesterday, now it is time to find a date when the family comes together, but since my cousin is still in the hospital (he had an accident the day my uncle died and did not wake up yet) everyone is waiting until he can attend the funeral. Apparently he and my uncle were pretty close.
But enough about me, here are the next pages from the journal:

.............................................................................................

August 6th 1944

I do not know how I managed it, but I could convince the doctor not to place the two girls in one of the barracks where the other children are housed. I told him they needed to be examined first, that they were too thin, too weak for the operation, and he finally agreed that we should place them in the room where the boy and the dog were housed and also to provide them with extra rations of food and medicines for the time being. Fortunately, the doctor had made sure that the boy's and the dog's bodies were taken away before the girls came into the room - but I doubt that he was avoiding to traumatize the children. It was only to make sure they were not seen or found, so he had them wrapped in sheets and buried with the other dead somewhere. The doctor has to return to Theresienstadt tomorrow and that gives me time. The girls can not end up like the boy and the dog. I have to think about something, but I do not know how I can help them. How can I get time? How can I delay the experiment without the doctor noticing?

August 7th 1944

I have a sleepless night behind me. The two girls ... they remind me so much of my own little daughter, Adelheid. She is just a little younger than the two, but I would never forgive myself if something happened to her. Just because of my family, I was here at all. I had just completed an internship at the Kinderklinik of the University of Leipzig, when I was ordered to Frankfurt. A Doctor wanted to get to know me. What looked like a normal procedure for me first, became a nightmare very soon. I first worked as an assistant. Not much to do really, just monitoring patients and taking care of the Doctors schedule. But things turned to become worse soon. My wife Marta was pregnant with our third child, Reinhard, and a few weeks before giving birth, I was told that my family would be deported, if I should not be willing to give my support to the Doctor in his research. Yes, this is how they put it: ""Give my support.""

I knew that Marta's grandmother was from Romania, that never was a secret. But Matha's mother and father were born and raised in Germany and so was Marta, so we never expected her to not be a „pure-bred“ how the Doctor sometimes used to call it. But for the SS it was enough to blackmail me. Either I help the Doctor, or my family will be deported and killed. Did I have a choice?

August 8th 1944

The Doctor went back to Theresienstadt and that gives me a little bit of time to think. How can I protect the little girls? I know I should not even think about it. Or write about it. What if someone finds my journal? Right now I keep it hidden in the room I sleep in at the camp's clinic. There is a secret pocket in my suitcase where I keep my journal and the letters Marta is writing me every once in a while. She does not send them to the camp, but to a small bakery in Oświęcim. Whenever I am allowed to leave the camp I visit the old man running the bakery and collect my letters and give him money and my letters he then sends to Marta. Oh Marta, my Marta! Light of my life, love of my life, my good soul, my beauty.

How could this all get so far? How could I become a monster? How could I agree to participate in all this? Why did we not leave the country and ran when we still had the opportunity to do so? We were once so happy, remember? When we first met – me a boy of 17 years, you a girl of 15. I knew the moment I saw you, that I loved you. And you loved me – right? You love me and you know that I am doing all this to make sure you are safe. You and the children. Horst, Wolfgang, Reinhard, Adelheid and the one you still carry inside of you. All I want is to keep you alive as long as this terrible mess is going on. And afterwards, when all this is over, we will leave Germany and go somewhere else. Somewhere we can life in peace. Somewhere safe.

But what am I gonna do with the girls? If only I could save these two, it would be so much. Yes, I know I can not save everyone. But two little girls, two lives, if I save them, perhaps I will be forgiven what I have done to all the others? The images of what the doctor and I have done in the past years haunt me in my dreams. We have done terrible things to people. Innocent people. Children. Women. Elderly. So many men and women, so many lives, so many souls. And I am guilty. I did it. I gave syringes and infusions and pills and treatments with substances, of which I myself did not know what they were going to do, and what the doctor had mixed into. I've been watching how people were treated like test rabbits. I have watched it and I have done nothing. I'm a coward and a monster. But if I can save these two little girls, if something comes to mind, something that will save them or at least not kill them, maybe I can forgive myself what I've done?

August 10th 1944

The Doctor is supposed to be back in 3 days, so I need to come up with something. Something that will delay the experiment but will also please the Doctor. I went to the girls several times. They are scared, but they eat and drink and they seem to be getting better. I ordered pain medicin, it is supposed to be delivered any day soon. At least I can make sure they will not suffer too much pain when the Doctor comes back and starts testing them. I will mix it in their food, even though this makes it more dangerous for me.

At the moment, I'm considering what tests can be done on girls that do not harm them and do not cause them any pain. Recognizing colors? Feed one with meat and the other with vegetables? A daily bath for one and shower the other only once every other day? I have the possibilities. I can order extra rations of food and I can order medication. But I have to find something that interests the doctor and keeps him interested. I will not be able to keep him from his plan of carrying out the same operation as the poor little boy and the dog went through. But perhaps I can convince him that we are doing other experiments with them beforehand. Give the girls a bit more time, and perhaps the war ends before the doctor can plan and carry out the operation?

August 13th 1944

I came up with a plan that might work. We will teach them. Teach one girl writing and reading and the other one counting and calculating. That will not only give me time, it will also give the Doctor something he loves: the opportunity to observe. Since the girls never went to school before and never learned reading, writing or counting, it seems perfect. We will school them separately and then see who learns faster: the one learning to read and write or the one learning to count and calculate. The Doctor was a little surprised when I explained my very own experiment to him, but the more I told him about it, the more he got interested. But there is a catch: Since they need to be schooled separately, we need teachers. Non of us has the time to do so. So I came up with the plan to look for two teachers in the camp. The Doctor thought about it for a while, then smiled and agreed. And told me to go and find two.

That was not what I expected and not what I wanted. I always avoid the barracks where all those poor souls are housed. I avoid to go anywhere around the camp aside the clinic, the barrack I sleep at and the cafeteria. It is heartbreaking to see those children, women and men, barely alive, sick and still trying to survive the nightmare they never volunteered to attend. It's a horrible place. Since I knew that no is not an answer to the Doctor, I went out of the clinic and to the barracks. Like I wrote earlier, I avoided them as much as possible and so I was not prepared for what was waiting for me when I came closer. The smell was the worst thing I ever smelled in my life.

A mixture of sweat, blood, pus, urine, and excrements lay so thick in the air that I could barely breathe. The barrack I was reluctantly moving forward to was one of the women's barracks. When they saw me, they pushed apart like a swarm of flies. I knew what they thought: when someone came from the Medical Clinic, it could only mean one thing: death. I would take them with me, the sick and the old and the ones not looking like they will live any longer and they would not see the end of the day. I could feel the fear in the air. I waited a couple of minutes in front of the barrack before I entered. There they were, about 50 women, skinny, just skin and bones, weak, so sick and so tired. Sitting on the beds, they smoothed their clothes, tried to smile, tried to look healthy, young, and fresh. They did not want to look sick, they did not want to make the impression that they could not work anymore. They did not want to die because they seemed useless.

I felt sick to my stomach. I heared about it before. The doctor had told me how they tried to look healthy and fresh. How they stuck their fingers with needles and blades, hardly trying to harvest a drop of blood from their dried-out veins to color their cheeks and lips so that they looked pink and healthy. It was about survival and they knew it. And there I was, the enemy, the monster, the evil. I'd tear one of them out of their midst, I'd take one away and they'd never come back, they knew. I could read it in their eyes. Each one of them held their breath when I finally began to speak.
""I need two women who can read and write, count and calculate. They will work as teachers in the clinic, they will live and sleep there, and they will eat and work there. They will not return to this barrack. What they own, they need to take with them into the clinic.“ As soon as I said that, I realized how this must have sounded. Go to the clinic, take everything with you, never come back. I was not surprised that nobody came forward. But the Doctor was waiting, so I did what every monster would do: I pointed at two random faces and ordered them to pack their belongings and follow me. I felt too sick to stay at this place any longer.

I got clean clothes for the women and tonight they got real food for the first time in months. Not this watery, diluted soup, which they serve in the barracks. Real food. Potatoes, carrots and a slice of cooked pork. I've never seen anyone eat a potato so slowly. Franziska seemed to celebrate the meal every single second. Clara, however, ate as if there was no tomorrow and when her plate was empty and I asked her if she wanted some more, she burst into tears. They are so skinny. I wonder how they managed to stay alive that long.

August 15th 1944

Bringing the two women to the girls had an effect on the girls I had not expected. They began to speak. So far, everything we got out of them were their names: Sarah and Monika. But now the two women came in and the girls began to speak. To my surprise, they spoke German. And they began to answer questions, but only as long as the doctor was not around. As soon as he came closer, they were mute as fish and so were the women.

Their names are Franziska and Clara and they both are from Dresden. They came to the camp about 6 month ago, they could not say exactly. Franziska is 28 and worked as a Librarian in Dresden before she was deported directly from her work. She has no idea where her little son and her husband are. She hopes they managed to escape and hide with her husbands family in Pirna. Franziska used to sneak books to some Jews still hiding in Dresden. One of the „good“ people she trusted was the one who turned her in. Clara is only 19. She worked as a maid in a hotel in Dresden when she was deported. She was not deported because she was not aryan, she was deported because she was seen with a married man dancing in the hotel one night. I am preparing the schedule for schooling the girls tonight, so the experiment can start by tomorrow and the Doctor will be satisfied.

August 25th 1944

Schooling the girls works good so far. They learn fast. The doctor is satisfied with the results, even if the girls do not answer him when he asks questions. They answer me and they answer the women who teach them. The doctor seems to be satisfied at the moment, but in recent days he has concentrated more on his studies on syphilis. As he told me, he has infected two groups of prisoners some weeks ago and was now treating one group with a chemical mixture and the other group with tablets made of small doses of rat poisoning and flour. The ones treated with the poisoned flour tablets seemed to slowly loose their minds. They were hallucinating and showed signs of dementia. The others were in constant pain all day and night, begging the soldiers to kill them. The glitter in his eyes, when he told me this, turned my stomach around and I just managed to run to the bathroom right before I threw up.

August 26th 1944

Oh this smile. It's haunting me. Whenever the Doctor has an idea, he smiles this creepy smile. I can not descripe it. It is as if he lost his mind and is absolutly sincere at the same time. He smiles when he talks about his experiments. He smiles when he talks to patients even though he knows they will not wake up the next day. He smiles when he takes his notes. He smiles when he talkes about his researches. This horrible, crazy smile.

August 29th 1944

I had some time to talk to the girls this morning. They are from a small town called Leinburg near Nürnberg. They have two older brothers. Their father owned a small grocery store in their hometown before he had to close it. He and the brothers managed to run, but the girls and their mother were brought to Theresienstadt. The mother died soon after arriving. This is heartbreaking. Imagining how these two little girls once ran around their fathers store, playing in the green fields surrounding their home town, having not a single thing to worry about in their lives - and now seeing them being cowering on the ground, clenched together, with fear in their eyes ... I wish I could reunite them with their father, but I have no idea how.

September 4th 1944

Something went wrong. Terribly wrong. I don't know what happened, but when I came to the clinic this morning, the girls were terrified and the women were missing. I later learned from one of the nurses, that the Doctor got mad about something and ordered the women to the yard at 4 am this morning where they were shot. I have no idea why he did that. Franziska and Clara are dead. This is all my fault. I came up with this stupid plan. I went to the barracks. I ordered them to come with me. I am responsible for their deaths. I was the one who chose them. They could still be alive if I would not have taken them to the clinic. I am scared and shaking.

September 5th 1944

The Doctor wants the girls to be prepared for surgery tonight at 8 pm.

I need to stop here, reading and translating is exhausting and I still have to clean out so many things in my uncles house. All these old books and maps and drawings, plus all the stuff he stored in the attic. So many boxes full of old things and time is running. I did not have the time to look through all the stuff and it is getting late. I planned to be finished by the end of the week but the journals distracted me. There are still a few pages in this one and then there are two more journals, which I have not yet looked at. The heating turned off an hour ago and I don't know what makes me shiver more: the cold in the house or the things I just learned from the journal. I will get back to you as soon as possible!

I am currently a sophomore at a well respected University on the East Coast. Over the past few months, I have applied to many, many internship positions in either the Marketing, Sales, or Communications departments. Most companies I applied to are in the consumer product field, as my major is Food/Consumer Marketing.

Along with applying to the positions, I have reached out directly to Talent Acquisition managers, HR reps, and prior business connections in order to personally introduce myself. Many times I have been praised for showing ""enthusiastic"" effort, etc. Out of this, I have only been given the opportunity of a few phone interviews, and one real Skype interview with a brand manager, VP of Marketing, and HR rep.

Now, my problem is, I feel like I have no credentials. Being a 19 year old kid, my previous jobs include coaching, Golf Caddy, Camp Counselor... etc. On top of that, my GPA is slightly below a 3.0 .

So what am I missing? What am I doing wrong? I am becoming extremely aggravated with this process, as no results have came."

I will be working in the Data Tech department of this company and in a conversation with the reps there I found out that I will likely be working with Hadoop or Spark or some other big data framework, along with Java. 

I am very familiar with Java and have the basic college background in databases (MySQL/PHP). As far as big data goes, I have no idea where to begin.

I'm still going to minor in CS, so at least I have that going for me.

However, I have never had an internship or job relevant to either CS or Communications. I also had some untreated mental health problems, got expelled for bad grades, went to community college, got back in on academic probation, and had to raise my grades while majoring in a difficult field I had no passion for, so I haven't had the time and resources to focus on internships/jobs/extracurriculars for the first ~2 years of school.

I'm in a much better place now, but I'm really scared because I feel *so* behind and Communications is so competitive. I joined some Communications clubs and teach myself web development in my free time but idk what else to do. 

I'm applying to summer internships. How do I explain my situation to employers so that they don't think I've been lazy all these years? Would it be an advantage or a disadvantage if I inform them of how recently I switched majors?

5zlood,1,2017-03-15,Another recent graduate struggling to navigate the grad school application process (genetics/genomics),happyclam420,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/5zlood/another_recent_graduate_struggling_to_navigate/,"Hello r/biology,

I am applying to graduate school this year (for 2018 matriculation) and I'm a little uneasy about where I stand in the application pool.  

&amp;nbsp;
About me: I have a b.s. in Biology from a fairly good school that is gaining more recognition every year. As an undergrad I volunteered ~10 hrs/week in a behavioral neuroscience lab on campus for about 4-5 semesters (Freshman - Junior year) and also completed two internships: one for 6 months in an academic neurobiology lab and another for four months in a ""start-up""-type neurobiology lab abroad. I graduated with a 3.93 GPA. Now I am a full-time research assistant at a top school working in a stem cell biology lab and will have been here for 2 years by the time I start graduate school. Other ""bonuses"" for my application are that I tutored biology for 3 years in undergrad and that I have been learning CS/programming on my own (and will have a short transcript from the school I currently work at showing that I took a handful of CS classes here). No GRE scores yet but I am guessing I'll score around the 80th-90th percentile (based on SAT scores) and no publications though it's possible I'll have my name on 1 or 2 by the time I start graduate school. It's possible but not entirely likely that I will have my name on one publication by the time I apply to graduate school. 

&amp;nbsp;
I feel like I have good stats, particularly my GPA (I'm not trying to brag, I'm great at taking tests but we all know this can only take you so far) but I look at graduate student profiles at the programs I am interested in (all very good programs but no ivies or especially prestigious schools) and so many students went to top schools as undergrads and published papers before graduate school. So now I'm a little less confident in my application. I guess I just need someone who understands this process a little better to give me an idea of where I stand, and if I should adjust my expectations. 

&amp;nbsp;
Another concern I have is the type of program I should apply to. I love neurobiology and cell/molecular biology but I'm really enjoying programming and would like to move more in the ""computational"" direction. I've been looking into genomics and genome science programs because I think these would allow me to break into the computational world without straying too far from my roots. Ideally I would work in neurobiology but focus more on data analysis and computing. But my main concern here is that I don't have any experience in this subfield of biology aside from my programming courses and personal exploration. Would I potentially be ruining my chances by applying to programs in which I have little experience? My original plan was to apply to molecular biology and/or neuroscience programs and try to independently shift towards the computational world, but I am realizing that I will probably need more rigorous training to catch up to my more experienced peers.

&amp;nbsp;
I apologize for the essay and if this is the wrong place to ask. Any and all advice is highly appreciated! When I ask postdocs in my lab they make it sound like they just walked right into a PhD program without any trouble, but I feel like it isn't that easy anymore...

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr will I get into grad school? "
5zlp2f,1,2017-03-15,"I got selected to be an officer in the USN. Do I accept, or stick with my civilian life?",fresch_one,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5zlp2f/i_got_selected_to_be_an_officer_in_the_usn_do_i/,"A little more background. Last March I moved back to my home state with the intentions of beginning the application process to become an officer in the Navy. I graduated college in 2015, spent a year doing internships, and come from a very large military family. Before finishing my internship, I spoke with my dad and decided it'd be a good idea to apply for OCS. I met with a recruiter, and he informed me that the process is lengthy (he wasn't kidding; I just found out yesterday that I was selected. One year later). 
I applied to two positions: Supply and Surface Warfare. In the meantime, I got a joke job (not trying to sound mean. But I didn't get a job I wanted to make a career out of because I wasn't sure if I'd be leaving in 6-12 months.) 
The board only meets a couple of times a year, which is why the process takes so long. And the selection rate is very competitive. In November my recruiter called and told me I hadn't been selected for Supply. To be honest, I was expecting those results because I didn't feel as qualified as some of the other candidates. 
He told me the SWO board met again in February, so we would go from there. At this point, I decided to move forward with my life. When I moved back, I began seeing this guy, and he knew I was applying for OCS, so we didn't expect things to get serious. However, they did, and we are moving in together in June. 
I ended up quitting my old job because I found one utilizing my degree, better pay, benefits, closer commute, and all around better. The last place I worked was toxic and there was no room for growth. 
Now that I found out I was selected for OCS, I'm having second thoughts about the Navy. Before November happened, I was passionate about joining. But then when I wasn't selected, my boyfriend said that he would never make me decide him over my career, but he didn't think we could make it work if I joined. He's currently deployed and in the Air Force, so he said we wouldn't be stationed at the same base most likely. (He's gone Feb till June) He's never been a dick about it, and he made this point before we got serious, as well.  
I don't want people to think I'm staying behind solely for him. But I am truly happy in the civilian world. My relationship is going well, I have a decent job which might lead to a career, and my student loans will be paid off in 4 years time, when I am 28. 
My dad is upset. He says I need to focus on my future, and that a relationship is not the reason to stay. I could pay off my loans in one year if I did the military route, have a gov't position under my belt, and leadership experience. 
Am I being foolish? I've made a pros and cons list. But I'd like unbiased advice. "
5zlsoa,2,2017-03-15,Changing careers to web development.,OrbitalOx,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5zlsoa/changing_careers_to_web_development/,"Hey everyone, long post warning. TLDR at the end if you don't wanna waste time on the context.

I am currently a staff accountant and have been in my position for a little over a year after having two separate tax internships. I am finishing up my masters in accounting but I'm really not happy in my career. I love the firm I work for which is a huge part of why I'm still in accounting because I really don't like the work. I pretty much dread the actual work I do every single day and the hours are insane (at least right now.)

I have always loved everything to do with computers and have messed with coding a little bit on my phone in the past (jailbreaking and rooting) but nothing too serious. Web Development has always interested me and about two weeks ago I decided I was going to take the plunge and teach myself HTML, CSS, and Java after my girlfriend got me some books for my birthday since she knows how much I've been wanting to learn but haven't actually started. So far I have put a few hours everyday into learning the basics and have absolutely loved it. I really like seeing my progress and actually having a visual output of something that I created and problem solving/figuring out all the different ways to do something. As of right now I think I want to try to switch to a career in Web Development but there is some hesitation. (I also want to be able to travel and work remotely/move around the country, which my current job doesn't allow for.)

My main question is, what does a career in Web Development look like in the long run? In accounting you can rise really far up the ladder but it takes a long time and then once you're at the 'top' you just stay there until you retire. I'm just afraid that if I make the switch it may not be a career that lasts as long as accounting would. I know I'm just being naive but it seems that, on average, individuals in web development are much younger than the average age in accounting.

I know I'm probably just over thinking this and I should do what I feel is right, which is making the switch, but it's a huge decision after the amount of money and time I've put into getting into my current career. 

Any advice or stories would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

My next ""fake site"" I make for practice will use it. 

I would be interested in almost anything to start out with - email designer, content management, or anything that involves fairly low level coding at a company that also has higher level devs. Ideally, I'd like to start at the bottom somewhere, and gradually take on more tasks as I learn the workflow and get deeper into programming.

These internships would have variable work: some would be business-critical projects, but a lot would be assistance to more senior staff. These internships functioned as an extended interview, to see who you were, how you worked, and how you fit in the company. Do well enough, and you were offered a job after you graduated. 



Those rules stopped working somewhere between 2015 and 2016. I've been talking with students facing graduation with absolutely no prospects of entry level O&amp;G jobs, as well as as laid off junior staff struggling to figure out how to get a foot back in the door. I've been trying to see what the new Rules are. There's a few things I've gathered:



- Network as much as humanly possible
- Be willing to take whatever work available (tech, admin, stakeholder relations, software sales, etc)
- Stay involved: volunteer, coordinate
- Create a business: find a gap and fill it (public data websites, entrepreneurial networks)

Not Wally. Real reasons why aren't given. I don't see why an other speedster couldn't save Iris. Also don't see why Iris is so important in the grand scheme of things. I also don't see how saving Iris in that exact same moment will prevent Savitar from killing her a moment later. I also don't see why Savitar is such a big threat anymore after Barry could keep up with him very well in the previous episode. 3 speedsters and some help from his other superhero friends would be enough. 

The whole techsupport Cisco thing was also thrown right in our faces again. Cisco can pull everything out of his ass. Plotforce, the speedforce and now we've got ciscoplotforce.

The whole revelation of Savitar being a man underneath the suit was also mindblowingly dumb. Barry was trying to take his mask off in the previous episode. Asking him who he was. Now he's surprised at the idea of Savitar being a man. These episodes are being written by interns who aren't present at every episode. I'm sure of it now. They just copypaste a standard script.

That final scene between Iris and Barry was copied form the legendary Felicity wheelchair scene. Barry and Iris taking time apart if mindblowing dumb. It only is put in place for forced melodrama. I'm also sure some Arrow s03/4 writers are put on Flash atm. This is just mediocre/bad. 

The whole speedforce adventure was a bad repeat from the previous season with Barry in the speedforce. The emotional impact of seeing Ronnie, Eddie, Snart again wasn't present. Don't get me wrong, was cool seeing them. But it had no emotional weight to me because they weren't really them. 

I did dig how Caitlin changed into a hot outfit during a crisis. Points for style.

Edit: these smart writers also just put Jesse on earth 3 because they have no plan for her, written themselves into a corner with her... but they forget that she left earth 2 without a speedster and now she suddenly thinks earth 3 shouldn't be without one. Smart writing!!! Best show on tv!!!

* Got some offers but turned them down thinking I could get something better

* Eventually settled for a QA job closer to home (Atlanta) in December. I want to be a developer. 
* Started applying again in February (without telling my current employers)



I now have several interviews lined up. Most of these jobs start in June. Should I tell the people interviewing me about my current job? Should I put it on my resume even? 


Pros:

* I now have actual work experience to talk about 

Cons:

* Applying to other jobs when it has only been three months looks bad?
* The people interviewing me might contact my current employers, and I'll lose my current job

But there's been chatter here in game dev world(I'm a lowly intern working at ___insert studio here). And I was talking with some devs a few days ago. 

There's been rumors that a PC / PS4 superhero mmo is in the works. Apparently headed by remnants of Paragon studios(city of heroes) and cryptic, as well as people from sucker punch

Now. City of heroes had its swan song just before the pop culture boom of superheroes. But they had just before also copyrighted the title ""city of heroes 2"". 

I'm sure publishing studios havent been blind to the current lack of successful superhero mmorpgs 

And in the current generation of online games in console and pc being pretty successful. 

So speculation and rumor....there may be a superhero mmo in development that (while maybe not directly based on infamous) has a lot of the action-conduit feels of the infamous world. 

Exciting stuff. If it's true. "

First a couple of cousins, then a couple of aunts (who were probably a mistake, because one of the loose-lipped Lillys spilled to another aunt I wasn't coming out to yet, but to all of their credit, they just didn't mention anything to me). Back at the end of October, I told my grandmother, who was... not thrilled, but also didn't tell me to leave and never darken her doorstep, which for an elderly Southern lady is pretty good.

Small victories, you know?

So anyways, my girlfriend and I have been going strong for over two years now, and we're saving up for rings to make an official engagement. (I already refer to her as my fiancee at my internship, mostly because I'm worried about being out there.) Recently, I've begun dropping little hints to my family about the inevitability of our marriage, to try to get them all used to the idea. I'm starting with my cousins first, because they're all much more supportive and receptive to such things (one of my cousins is trans and we've been dealing with family fallout from supporting him for years, so we're a pretty united front on these things). I showed a couple of cousins the dress and veil I've been looking at, I told my cousin that her daughter (my goddaughter) will be the flower girl, I mentioned how I'll be hyphenating my name once we're married. So far, it's going pretty well. Here's to hoping that by the time we are actually, officially engaged and there's a ring on both of our fingers, my family is used enough to the idea that they don't pitch any fits!"

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

5znvjy,11,2017-03-15,Profile Review - untraditional candidate,[deleted],MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/5znvjy/profile_review_untraditional_candidate/,"Hey, guys,

Just want to get a sense of where I stand with my profile. I am certainly *not* a standard candidate. 

Background - 

Nationality - Indian
Gender - Male

Education - 
Bachelor of Commerce (India) - 61%

M.Sc International Business (UK) - Pass (with 69.5%;barely missed distinction by half a percentage). Was a Class Rep and can get a good reference from the course director. The school was top-20 in Europe. Regularly features in FT rankings.

GMAT - Not taken yet.

Work Experience 

Current - Networking to land an internship at a Big 4 or a sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East. I have a good set of contacts which I’m channeling my interest through.

 (2.3 years) Founder at an e-commerce business in the Middle-East. I took care of all the operations - registration and formation of a Limited Liability Company, development of the company’s visual identity, branding, marketing strategy, was the primary buyer, made budgets, sales forecasts for the venture, wrote and edited product descriptions etc etc. 

I have been involved in this venture for close to two years now, but things have stalled completely due to serious issues with my co-founder. I have pulled out of this company. This venture was completely self-funded by my partner and me.

Note - Never made any money. The website was live for a very short period of time and had to close operations till we resolved our differences, which we didn't.

EDIT - Have all the documentation in place to prove this was a legit business and not a fly by night operation. Bank affidavits, commercial registration papers, partnership deeds etc. 

(1.3 years) Relationship Officer/ Financial Advisor at a large bank  - Again was based out of the Middle East. Focused exclusively on retail products like SIP, insurance plans, deposits etc. Built and managed a portfolio of about USD 300,000. I was at this job for 1.3 years. Really wasn’t much to learn after a while as the product portfolio was very limited. Wanted to shift to private banking which would have been more challenging, but manager told me straight up there are more qualified people (the bank has 100,000+ employees overall).

Note - I had been considering going out on my own for a while. I had a very serious discussion with a senior manager who happened to be a good friend of mine. He told me upfront that I shouldn’t have any hopes of rising up in the bank, regardless of my performance, because the bench strength meant there is always someone more qualified.

I can get an excellent reference from this bank. 

(9 months) Research Analyst at a domain parking and monetization company. Left the job to pursue my Master’s degree. 

Extracurriculars -

None as of now as I spent the last two years completely devoted to my business. However, over the last 6 months I have taken an active interest in my health, fitness and performance. 

My mom is a qualified yoga instructor and I was practicing for a very long time, if required, I can take a course and become a certified instructor. Similarly, I have been training myself for the past 6 months, but can take a physical trainer’s course for knowledge and certification if required. 

THE PROBLEM

I will be 31 in July and realistically have 4-5 years of solid experience behind me. Unfortunately,  I dropped out of college for about 3 years before I completed my Bachelor’s, being clueless about where I was going in life. I did odd jobs to sustain myself - nothing of note - event management, store keeper etc. This part sucks and will be the most difficult part to address, however, I did it for my Master’s earlier and can do it again for MBA.

Goal of MBA

I want to transition into Finance. Not interested in investment banking - but think large family offices, sovereign wealth funds, alternative asset management firms, maybe PEs and hedge funds if I can break in (I’m very aware that my chances are slim here without IB background)

Target Schools 

I’m only looking at schools in Europe. I don’t have much interest in living/working in the US. 
How much of a chance do I stand to get into LBS, INSEAD, HEC, IE etc. if I apply after a year (assuming I get a year of great experience at the aforementioned Big 4/wealth fund and crack 700 at GMAT)? How are employers in my targeted industry likely to look at me as a 33 year old MBA graduate? Do I realistically have a chance of breaking into Finance at that age, given my background?

Any kind of feedback is welcome. Thanks! :)"

**""Lotus this is Command, how do you read me?”**

**“Loud and clear Command.”**

**“Roger, you are cleared to initiate the operation, confirm upon completion, How Copy?”**

**“Copy All, I’ll be in touch.”**

**“Oriana?”**

**“Yes?”**

**“Be careful.”**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hassan Al-Ghoul waddled through the lobby of the luxurious Burj Al Arab hotel. A gluttonous man, Hassan exhibited greed in all aspects of life. A Saudi prince with an appetite for women and fancy things. In the years since the U.S. started wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Hassan had capitalized on the U.S. need for natural resources, and the Insurgents need for armaments. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hassan provided discounted oil to the U.S. government in exchange for a seat at the table. The U.S. government needed some heavy hitters in its ‘Coalition of the Willing,’ and saw no reason not to divulge supply routes and operations plans to Hassan in exchange. What the U.S. government didn’t know, was that Hassan was not only providing small arms and explosive ordinance to their enemies, but also briefing them on operations across both theaters of war. While extremely cautious and overly paranoid, someone took notice of Hassan’s extra-curricular activities, and was determined to collect.

“Mr. Hassan, Welcome to the Burj Al Arab! We have you in a stunning suite with a beautiful view of the Persian Gulf, my assistant Najib will take your things and show you to your room. Please, enjoy your stay.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She watched with calculated eyes as the manager handed Najib the hotel key, room 422, she noted. She started to stand up, but hesitated; moments later three burly men entered the hotel and followed Hassan. Ori Mizrahi stood up, adjusting her skirt and collecting her things. She strutted towards the desk, thrusting her hips as her heels clicked the floor.

“Good Evening Ma’am!”

“Good Evening Sir, I don’t have a reservation, but was wondering if you had a room for me for the night?”

“Wh-, Yes of course! I can book you in one of the newest rooms on the first fl—“

“I was thinking something with a view of the gulf, perhaps not too high.”

“Let me see, we—ah yes! 322 is currently being cleaned, we could have it ready for you in an hour!”

“Perfect.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The hotel bar was quite extravagant, full of overpriced paintings and LED lighting across every edge of the bar. She took a seat at the bar, acknowledging the bartender’s kind smile as she settled in. She checked her makeup in her compact as she sipped her sangria. “Not bad old girl,” she thought. The skirt and the heels made her feel young again, a week over fifty and she could still pass for late thirties. Her long tanned legs set the stage for ample breasts, and were polished off  with an exotic and mysterious face. She tracked the bartender’s eyes, as they lifted from her cleverly exposed cleavage to the entranceway.

“Mr. Hassan! What a pleasure, what may I offer you!”

“Let’s make it something expensive shall we?”


*His eyes caught olive skin, examining every lovely curve, fawning over her attractiveness.*


“Good Evening Miss, do you know who I am?”

“I can’t say I do.”

“I am Prince Hassan! Perhaps you’ve heard of me?”

“Can’t say that I have, goodnight sir.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She lugged her things behind her back to the lobby. He wasn’t supposed to see her. As she keyed the button for the third floor, she began to sweat. The operation had just begun, and she was already possibly compromised. Tonight wasn’t her first time, she had run ops before, but never for *them.*

**“Command this is Lotus.”**

**“Go Ahead.”**

**“Compromise probable, target interaction in the bar, do I proceed?”**

**“You chose this target, with a reputation like yours it should be a cakewalk. Finish the mission and return to Command.”**

**“Will Comply.”**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She unzipped her luggage, revealing a silenced P90, semtex, and an assortment of tools. As she slipped out of her formal attire, and into a night black jumpsuit, she eyed an umbrella shaped device tucked neatly under the semtex. The GH776 was a device used for detecting vocal vibrations through structures, producing crisp translations of conversations through even the thickest of obstacles. She stood on the dresser, attaching the device with adhesive to the roof of room 322 in the center of the room.

Two hours later, a sudden noise from the device jolted her upright. As she adjusted the volume, Hassan’s voice came into range with unimaginable clarity.

“Salam Alaykoum, I have the next set of targets..”

“Yes, a Marine Battalion will deploy to Anbar next week.”

“I’m having trouble with the mortar munitions, they may not make it in time.”

“I understand, I have deposited 10 Million into the account for the trouble, I hope we remain business associates.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The sound of the receiver being slammed into its base startled Ori once more. She had no way of knowing where Hassan’s security would be in the room, and decided to improvise her breach with estimations. Oriana applied semtex on three different locations, making sure the amount was just enough to achieve her goal. She was going to collapse the roof, dropping Hassan and whoever else may be there right into her lap.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She collected her weapon and the detonator and sprinted into the bathroom to seek cover. She removed tactical tape securing the detonator’s trigger, and checked her weapon. As she steadied her nerves, she peaked out the door and through the open windows into the night sky. The diversion she needed was still fifteen minutes away.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The first firework screeched as it rocketed towards the sky. She could hear cheers from below as the newlyweds enjoyed their celebration. The sky was a hazy mosaic of ruby reds and clover greens. It was time.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The explosion was quite bigger than she expected. The vibrations shattered the bathroom mirror, and the room quickly became filled with the soot and smoke of drywall and other materials. She coughed as she entered the room. On the bed lay one of the guards, his pinstripe suit dyed white from the soot in the air. He was unconscious. She canvased the scene, another guard laid motionless against the desk. Hassan Al- Ghoul was coughing, his head a bloody mess with lacerations across his face. She could see his disgusting fat through rips in his undershirt.

“Hassan Al-Ghoul”


*He looked up at her dazed, his pupils as big as saucers.*


“Wh-, What is this?”

“We are Order, We are every nation, and We are no nation.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The P90 she was holding ejected 4 spent casings. Hassan collapsed on the floor with a thud, quickly producing a pool of crimson blood on the pearl hued carpet. She retrieved a handheld digital camera from her clutch and documented his demise. As she was collecting her things, she was thrust onto the ground by Hassan’s last line of defense. The 300 pound behemoth had launched him-self through the gaping hole in the roof onto her back.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She reached for her weapon, and as her fingers slipped off of the buttstock, the guard slung her back by her hair. She frantically elbowed his face, connecting, and producing a spurt of blood from the man’s nose. Startled, he released her hair and conceded room. She delivered a crushing kick to his kneecap. She grabbed a piece of jutted steel lying on the  bed, and delivered it purposefully into his neck. He let out a death-rattle, and in moments he was gone.

*She snapped the fasteners of her parachute on as she reached the window.*

**“Command, this is Lotus. Objective complete. I repeat, confirmed kill.”**

**“Roger Lotus, Come on home.”**

Oriana pulled herself onto the window seal, looking out into the milky Persian Gulf. She closed her eyes, and jumped out into the night sky.

**Agency Black Site**

**Gulf of Oman**

**30 Nov. 2012**

--

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know what **you’re** thinking, ‘Agency Black Site.’ Well relax, it’s not that agency—at least not entirely. I doubt the CIA ever has had it this good. You see, this floating container carrier belongs to *the* agency. A motley collective of the world’s most used and abused assets. It’s where assets and spooks get sent when it’s time to be put to pasture. The CIA, Mossad, Spetnaz—hell, even some organizations you’ve never read about or dreamed existed.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Agency isn’t some sanctioned task force, it’s a different beast. One without political and religious obligations, a place where former foes quickly learn to work together. The people they employee share a wealth of operational experience, from the Cold War to the Middle East, and they’re all here for one reason—money. My estimation is that they do it to stay active, to stay relevant. When life catches up to them, and their organization decides to stick them behind a desk, they retire and re-up with the world’s deadliest cabal.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You may be asking yourself what exactly I’m doing here, or how I ended up in god knows where chained to the hull of this vessel. I wish I knew. I’m not a trained Mossad assassin, or MI6 spook, I’m just a bartender out of North Florida. If we’re going to be completely honest with each other—and the predicament I’m in surely warrants it—I’m no boy scout either. I served with 6th Marines in Afghanistan on three deployments, was discharged a few years ago, and have been boozing my way through college at Florida State.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At least the guy who’s been waterboarding me daily speaks English, I couldn’t imagine being tortured by a Frenchman. I can’t say for certain how long I’ve been here, only that it feels like an eternity. I do remember how I got here. A cliché case of ‘wrong place, wrong time.’

*The rusted steel door swung open suddenly.*

“Are you ready to talk about D.C.?”

“Look, Sir, I have no idea who you think I am or what I’ve done, but I assure you there has been a grave mistake.”

“We don’t make mistakes.”

“I—I swear to god I’m nothing to you guys, just  let me go at the next port and I promise I won’t say a god damn thing to anyone.”

“Guards, get the bucket.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They say that when an individual gets water-boarded, it creates the feeling of drowning. I can confirm, if I ever get out of this shit I will never swim again. My charming friend you just met is called ‘Grizzly,’ and we have such a blooming relationship. The Grizz is definitely an American, his calf tattoo of the stars and stripes confirmed that suspicion weeks ago.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It really is hard to keep track of everyone’s name in such a stressful environment. You would think they’d at least allow a pen and paper to make these chit-chats a little more enjoyable. I think I’ll ask. While Grizz is by far my biggest fan, I have met a few individuals who seem to think I’m somehow connected to whatever this shit is.

There’s Ollie, he’s got some kind of ties to Australia.

“Another shrimp on the barby?”

“Fuck off mate.”

Vlad, the stench of piss and vodka suggests he’s Russian.

“When are you going to bring your stash down here? I make a mean vodka cranberry.”

“he’s a real funny one isn’t he?”

Jean Beck, the German.

“Do you want the water again?”

“Please don’t, it’s the wurst?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A few others I can’t recall. The sounds of bodies shuffling around the ship suggest there are at least 20 of them. No females yet. Could this get any worse?

**5 Oct. 2012**

**Radio Squelch**

**“Nero, Nero, this is Command”**

**“Go for Nero.”**

**“Are you in position?—over.”**

**“Standing by as usual.”**

**“Roger that, the Major would like to remind you that this is not a kill mission. You are to extract your target and all personnel accompanying him. How copy?”**

**“Well, that takes away all the fun.”**

**“Keep your head up, the Major sent Frogger and Carlito in this morning to help with the extraction. Establish personal comms with them on channel 3.”**

**“I copy all—Nero out.”**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was a windy October morning in the nation’s capital. The crowds of people had already begun to line up at the reflection pool for the candidate’s speech. The election cycle had been a particularly one-sided phenomenon. The clear frontrunner was Matthew Hudson, a Republican from Iowa with a penchant for tweed suits and loose women.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Francesco Rossi walked purposefully towards the corner coffee shop. He startled the barista as he barged in unannounced, moving with haste to escape the gusty breeze encapsulating Washington. In the corner, he spotted Frogger and Carlito. He slowly approached them, removing his coat in the process.

“You two stick out like a sore thumb.”

“Happy to see us—eh?”

“Hola Senor Nero.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He understood why the Major had sent them. Carlito had spent the majority of his life working for the infamous Juarez Cartel. He excelled at kidnappings—perfect for a snatch and go mission like this. Frogger, was a Canadian and one hell of a driver, he had been a freelancer in his prime, offering his services to anyone with a bank account big enough to compensate him.

“We are going to hit him after the speech, on his way back to the congressional assembly.”

“How much security will this gringo have?”

“Standard Secret Service detail can be expected, but I have a way around that.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The gentlemen donned their coats, and stepped out into the howling Washington wind. The Hudson event was already underway, his narcissistic voice echoing sharply through the streets surrounding the Lincoln memorial. Frogger broke off from the troupe, heading South towards the parking deck. Carlito lit a cigarette.

“That shit will kill you.”

“I’m old anyway.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Candidate Matthew “Hunk” Hudson was beating a dead horse. All national polls indicated he had double the support of his democratic opposition. His agenda wasn’t original, he still touted a smaller government, pro-life, gun loving, god fearing American future as his hard message. It was his charisma, that handsome face and attractive smile that  punched his ticket in the hearts of so many Americans.

*Francesco slipped through the crowd.*

“AREN’T WE TIRED OF BROKEN PROMISES?”

“DON’T WE DESERVE THE NATION WE WORK SO HARD FOR?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The crowd was worked into a frenzy. Hudson was a rock-star, and they believed every lie that belched from his perched lips. His speech was about transparency, about getting a government for the people. Finally, after all these years. What the crowd didn’t know was that Hudson’s ‘no strings attached’ motto couldn’t be any further from the truth. He was a plant. A lie, groomed from day one to be manipulated for gain.

“ONE MORE MONTH TO GO BROTHERS AND SISTERS!”

“THANK YOU, THANK YOU!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Francesco made his way towards the motorcade. He had to get there before Hudson’s handshake barrage was finished. He scouted his surroundings, and very quickly placed a tracking device under the lead vehicle. He combed his fingers through his hair, and briskly set off towards the legislative assembly.

**“Carlito, come in—over”**

**“Go for Carlito.”**

**“3 vehicles, headed your way.”**

**“How far are you?”**

**“Approaching extraction point now, estimate 5 minutes until rendezvous”**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Carlito lit a cigarette. The wind had died down over the course of Hudson’s speech, and he was grateful for that. He leaned against a rod iron fence, eyes to the East for the targets convoy. The city was bustling.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A muscular white male, late twenties with strong features, stepped out of a local breakfast shop onto Liberty Avenue. A group of blacked out Cadillac Escalades keeping tight formation whizzed past him. As he tracked the motorcade with his eyes, he noticed a sanitation truck swerving into oncoming traffic only meters away from them. There was no doubt about it, a collision would happen.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The first escalade crumbled and was cast aside like plastic. The second vehicle swerved into a store front, shattering the bay windows and sending its customers frantically scurrying. The last vehicle flipped over the first, landing like a broken egg shell on the sidewalk some yards ahead. The smell of oil filled the air.

“Check the vehicles! Leave Security, but grab any member of his staff!”

“God damn Frogger, you could have killed them!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Francesco sprinted the last quarter mile to the wreckage site. His age had slowed him down considerably, and he was lucky to of made it at all. He nodded to Carlito, signaling in silence that he would check vehicle two. As he approached the passenger side door, he withdrew his silenced USP, made ready, and clicked off the safety.

“Hudson.”

“Wh- Who are you? We can pay you!”

“Get out of the vehicle.”

*His eyes darted to the driver seat, a thick mulatto man had gone through the windshield, and was now smoking on the hood of the escalade.*

“Okay! Okay! Please, don’t hurt me!”

“Not Ye—“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Francesco felt the surge of pain radiate up his side. He turned to face his attacker, a beefy young man wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. He raised his weapon, but was instantly tackled into the rear fender of the escalade. Hudson scrambled out of the vehicle, but stopped suddenly in his tracks. A shot rang out through the crisp autumn air.

“STOP!”

*The two men halted their efforts to overcome each other.*

“Shoot this mother fucker Carlito!”

“No Casualties, remember.”

*Carlito inched towards the men on the ground, placing the barrel of his tech-nine to the temple of the young man.*

“Get up, slowly.”

*Frogger hopped out of the sanitation truck, and jogged over to the altercation.*

“What the fuck is going on here?”

*Francesco stood up, dusting glass and soot off of his coat.*

“This asshole attacked me, he’s jeopardizing the mission.”

The troupe looked at the young man, panting heavily and shaking with his palms towards the sky.

“I-I was, y—you guys were attacking the”

Francesco drove the barrel of his USP into the man’s skull, rendering him unconscious upon the pavement.

He hated to see her cry. 

“I’ll be back in two months, it’s just an internship Lily.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily Mizrahi was a sight to behold. Her dirty blonde hair fell lightly on athletic shoulders, her petite frame bared the mark of the sun’s kiss. She was exotic to him, and he was everything to her. She wiped the tears from her eyes, kissed him, and exited the terminal.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The two had first met last spring on campus. He had approached her after an icebreaker exercise divulged she was studying abroad. She came from Israel, her beauty on loan to the gawking male students for only one semester. He felt the urgency to know her, to be with her—no matter how short the time frame.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The two shared every waking moment together that spring. When he made love to her, she would hold him as if he would disappear if she let go. He told her about the war, his deployments. She explained how complex a family she had waiting for her in Israel. A mother married only to her job, within the Israeli government. A father and a brother murdered by Palestinians. The two became intertwined emotionally, and dreaded the day she would have to return home.

*She barged into his apartment.*

“Baby!”

“Wh-? What’s all the excitement for?”

“I just spoke with my mother, she’s agreed to cover all expenses for me to stay!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lily’s mother had supplemented a lifetime of unhappiness with what she knew best—money. The wire transfer wouldn’t fix the years of her loneliness. It wouldn’t erase the grief of her loved ones, but it would suppress those emotions in the here and now—with him.

--

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The ship groaned as it bested an immense wave. The dungeon hell smelled of rust and condensation. The room was pitch black, and the air was filled with echoes of clanging steel from above. Suddenly, voices could be heard muffled in the distance.

“The Major wants to see him.”

“No shit? About time we put him down.”

“Here he comes.”

*The familiar sound of boots clanging down the steel stairs filled the room.*

“In here?”

“Yes, Major.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The locking mechanism rolled over, the door creaked open upon rusted hinges. A mountain of a man holding a lantern entered the room. The newcomer smelled of salt and stale tobacco. The flickering of the lantern’s flame revealed a scorched face, surrounded by shoulder length locks of grey hair.

“My associates tell me that you refuse to divulge information about the encounter in D.C.”

“I have nothing to say. I saw your guy holding the future President of the United States at gun point. I reacted.”

“Ah, yes. Scott Pelham, 28 years old, served three tours in the Marine Corps—Honorable Discharge.”

“Well, Scotty, we don’t like, nor do we tolerate surprises on other’s behalf. We are in the business of being the Surprisers—not the Surprisees. You’ve put us in quite a predicament. We’ve managed to operate all these years without collateral damage, and it appears today we must break the streak.”

*The silhouette of a second figure floated into view. It stood in the doorway, silently but attentively waiting for what happened next.*

“Go ahead, Kill me. I’d rather accept my fate on my feet then spend another hour in this hell hole.”

The Major withdrew a 1911 from his thigh holster. The lantern’s flame glistened off its nickel plating.

“I’m glad you understand the severity of the situation.”

*He pulled the hammer back, took three steps forward.*

“Get on with it. I have nothing to live for.”

*The Major raised his weapon, moving finger to trigger.
The second silhouette stepped forward, it was much smaller.
A feminine voice echoed through the damp chamber.*

“Yes he does.”

**Nickname:** Astra, though she hasn't been called that in years

**Birth Date:** 7/25

**Age:** 32 years old

**Wand Make:** Maple wood with a Banshee hair core 13"" and Hard flexibility; The Quirke Family Wand

**Blood Status:** Pure-Blood

**Patronus:** Abraxan

**Animagi Form**: Eagle owl

**Face Claim:** [Carice Van Houten](http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/8063581/740full-carice-van-houten.jpg)

--------------------------------------------------

**Personality:** Asteria is a firm believer in the belief that humans are messy, a cynic who prefers the company of creatures than other individuals. That is unless she is explaining or discussing creatures in someway or another to another person. In these scenarios, she becomes friendly and surprisingly outgoing, but as soon as the subject has passed her interest in conversation dies down. 

Like many fellow Gryffindors she is willing to fight and be brave when put in dangerous circumstances, or simply be daring despite the possibility of injury. This daring personalty lead her to attempt to study and become a Thestral when she was much younger, accidentally becoming an owl Animagi instead. 

**Qualifications:**

* 4 NEWTS (Care of Magical Creatures, Transfiguration, Herbology and Charms)

* One-time Prefect of House Gryffindor

* 3 years breeding Abraxan as an intern in the Acadamy of Beauxbatons

* 7 years in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, Beast Division

* 5 Years independently researching the benefits of experimental breeding with Ministry permission. 

--------------------------------------------

**Background** Asteria was born to the Quirke family, a relatively new Pure-blood family that was born from a Squib's wizard son in the early 1800s. Due to them being relatively knew to the scene, her family didn't hate Muggles, even if they did see themselves as naturally superior. As Asteria never cared much for human interaction anyway, she never caught this disposition from her parents. 

She was sorted into Gryffindor in her first year, though at the time she hadn't a clue why. To her, Gryffindor was just the name of a bloke with a sword, a leader of warriors. She was far from that at age 11. 

Until someone attempted to hex a sick rat that she had nurtured to health in her third year, she had never engaged anyone in a fight. By the end of the fight the other student had been turned into a ball, though not for long. After giving her explanations as to why it all occured, it became apparent that she wasn't really hostile to those who posed no threat. This indifference that was interpreted as fairness was what got her made prefect.

In her sixth year with the approval of the current headmaster she was taught the magic of the Animagi by the joint efforts of the Transfiguration and Care of Magical Creatures teachers at the time. After witnessing the death of her father by freak accident the summer prior, she became obsessed with Thestrals and inherited the strange family wand. Due to this she had attempted so hard to become like a Thestral in her studies to become an Animagi, but she instead ended up becoming an Eagle Owl.

After her graduation she began to look for a job in caring for creatures, as she was way to young to apply for substitute Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts. After writing a request to the Headmistress of Beauxbatons, she was allowed to stay at the school taking care of the Abraxan they kept. She did this for 3 years with little pay, as she was provided with grounds to live on and food to eat over the 3 years. After resigning from this post she applied for Beast division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, a department that took her on after realizing her talent and heavy interest. She ended up working there for just as long as she had been in Hogwarts, all before giving it all up to pursue a life in (Ministry permitted) experimental breeding of different magical creatures.

That was, at least until she received word that that her old school required a new teacher in her favorite subject...

----------------------------------------------------

**Roleplay:** Asteria had found herself reliving her sorting as she walked into the great hall, even though it had been so long ago and she could barely remember anyone from it, it was if it had occurred only a fortnight prior. She gave a sigh of nostalgia and picked up her luggage once more, reminding herself that she was far from the age of 11, and she now had a dream job to work upon.

------------------------------------------

*As a side note, if any professors here were attending Hogwarts 15-21 years ago, feel free to have your character remember Asteria (if they can remember names that long).*

*Upvotes are appreciated, as this is a new account and the timer is rather annoying.*

What would you change now,ExplitPlayer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5zo2yd/restarting_mechanical_engineer_degree_what_would/,"I started off about two years ago as a Mechanical Engineering student, yet a combination of a few distractions, and being fresh out of high school and jumping into college and new math (which I wasn't the best at and continue to struggle somewhat) made me modify my decision and switch around to a few different majors over the year and a half. Just testing the waters. Well I'm back to Mechanical because I just couldn't shake the thought that my career wasn't going to be what I've always dreamed of. So I'm locked down on it now. So there's that. 

I'm going to try harder, as I flunked out of Pre-Calc 1 (accelerated) my first time in the program, because I panicked and gave up, and also don't have the greatest math background. 
-Don't bother with the ""If you aren't good at math then don't become one"" 
I'm going to get through it. It's determination that'll get me where I want to be-

Now I'm back in the program, I've been staying after class and coming in early and getting help, I beat it out with a B in accelerated Pre-Calc 1, and now I'm in the accelerated Pre-Calc 2 course, struggling like I expect to.. but hey, I'll get over it. 

Then I start back into my regularly scheduled program minus a few core classes. So I'll have a bit more time to focus on math and science. 

I'll have 4 more semesters in my community college, and then 2 years at a University. 

My question to all of you guys and gals, is:

What would you do different now that you're further along the path and looking at internships /applying?

What classes sucked and what classes were awesome?

Do you wish you took more extracurricular activities?

-Which ones did you take?

What was your average nightly study time (hrs)?



Just give me anything. I've never really spoke to anyone about any of this. I'm very curious and excited to hear any feedback and responses. I'm also wanting to be the best engineer I can be, I just want a good foundation while it's early and I can mold it into something great..

Also, just to throw it in, any Math study tips for the mathematically impaired would be appreciated. 

Thanks guys!

When we finished, I chatted with her mom about the goals her daughter wanted to work on and if there was anything she wanted to add. During that conversation I brought up her daughter's comment. She told me they'd dealt with it before when other girls told her she was too dark but she thought they were past it.

Do any of you have resources to address internalized racism and colorism for a girl of this age? Any suggestions on how to be careful as a white social worker? I trust that her mom will talk to her about it, but it could be good to work on her self image from a non-family angle.

Hi everyone, I've been thinking a lot lately about how to structure my thoughts and deliver it in the most honest and humble manner to justify why I gave up a chance in becoming a military pilot.

Background
I've always wanted to be a pilot, but an airline pilot over a military pilot. But from where I come from, it's common for everyone who wants to be a pilot to apply to the military first. But for me, I do love the notion of flight but my early encounters with flight were with the large jets ferrying passengers around. 

So, over a long period, I just simply desire to fly the passenger jets. I remember having the chance to fly a full motion 747 simulator at 19 years old, and when it 'lift-off'... That was pure ecstacy. It just made my desire to command one stronger by the day. With that I would work hard and save so that I could buy an air ticket to return to that country and fly the simulator every year.

Military flying is as brilliant, that's where the real flying is done. So for 3 years I had been trying to enter the military only to end up calling them up to inform them that I cannot do it. I just need to be with the passenger jets and at that point of time, I didn't want to deprive others who genuinely want to be a military pilot of a chance. I hear stories of how people my age being airline pilots and I envy them so much.

So now I grapple to seek wisdom on how best to convince and justify my reason for not pursing a military career, since most of the pilots are from the military. Sometimes I feel that I shot myself in the foot, but then again, I'm just that in a relationship with commercial aviation. 

My first part-time job was at the airport as a security screening agent, the best birthday gift when I turned 17 after being issued my screening license.  I got to see airline pilots day in day out and I loved my job. Then I moved on to intern for an airline for half a year and it brought me even closer to the passenger jets! I frequent the flight deck on the job and often get the chance to walk around the tarmac too. 

I'd love to hear your opinions on whether what I did (by closing the door to military aviation) was justified in the eyes of the veterans, and how best can one honestly express the desire to fly passenger jets over military jets, without offending the veterans? I don't want to come off as an arrogant prick who never even bothered with the military, and I experienced first hand how detrimental it was to my flying dream; I never made it through PPL interviews when I was 16 and 2 years later, I tried again but they refused no matter how hard I begged them. 

Humility surely goes a long way...

My plan is to build the game with a top-down view , but to better visualize it, i want to start the animations to see if there is any issues of perspectives , if top-down it's gonna fit my game or if I have to change. I have a pretty clear image in my head of how the game should look like , just wanna achieve it.

I did a mini course in middle-school where we used adobe flash(it was a good time ago).

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming (stuff like Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, etc.), some 3D CAD (CATIA most likely) and the usual web browsing/Youtube

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$700, give or take ~$50

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Within the next two months, though there's a chance it may be delayed even longer since I'm an out-of-state college student who's constantly moving around.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Everything.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

I'll be in the US, but moving between California and Indiana (with the possibility of additional states on the East Coast) so access to Microcenter will vary wildly.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No, though I will consider it when I'm more familiar with how this works

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

SSD storage or hybrid SSD + HDD would be great

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Like I mentioned before, I'm gonna be moving around a lot each semester due to college and future internships, so I'm placing a pretty big priority on portability (micro-ATX or mini-ITX, smaller form factor overall), reliability, and performance for price. Color wise, I tend to lean towards blue themes but am fine with anything. All other aspects I don't care about

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Yes, no preference

&gt;Sorry for the extra text, but I'm mostly trying to get an idea of what kind of components I should be looking at since I'm new to the idea of building my own PC. I will definitely build one in the future but I'm currently unsure of when i can get the money and time to do so. Thanks for your help!"

- at a big company outside the US (g company in Tokyo, to be specific) 
- at a medium-sized company in the bay area (v company)


Could you guys give perspectives on what I should consider making this decision? Also, how strong is the tech department at g company in Tokyo? Anyone has past internship experience there?


Here are some of the advantages of each choice in my opinion. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

g company: look better on resume, cooler project, international experience, it's g

v company: Silicon Valley experience (I've never been there), gain more connections (?), learn more about tech industry

Every opinion is appreciated. Thanks!"

5zrlyf,3,2017-03-16,I'm on a graduate program and my advisor is not being totally honest about the distribution of internship resources,mvpetri,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5zrlyf/im_on_a_graduate_program_and_my_advisor_is_not/,"I'm just starting my doctorate and I joined a lab to work. I'll not have a job because I want to dedicate entirely to my project. So I applied for a doctoral internship.

In my country we gave 3 types of internship available nationally (there are some others, but I'm not considering those). Let's call them type A, B and C. A being the best and C being the worst in terms of remuneration.

My university can give type B and C. And they got me B.

But the best type (A) has a different way apply. They are given if you submit your project directly to the agency or if the professor received some quota to distribute as they want. This is the case: my professor has some available to him.

When I joined the team I asked him about these internships and he said that it wasn't so easy to give them to students, because the agency is very strict about it. Usually the students shouldn't have had any failures while undergrads, have good grades, good CV and all of that... which I didn't had so much. So I understand that it isn't that easy to get if I submit my project and CV.

But this is not 100% true. My professor can give, if he wants, to any student he wants. He just have to indicate the student to the agency directly.

So talking to him and to others I realized this: He would like to give the internship to someone with a better CV, but he is telling me that the agency wouldn't accept it and he can't do much. Currently he doesn't have any student for this particular internship (all the others already have one) so he will hold it until another student can enter the lab. And this puts me in a bad position to try to negotiate with him. All other students already have it and the newer students are starting their master's degree and I'm the only new phd student. I'm unable to use this as a leverage because ""the agency won't accept it...""

And not only that, I don't want this situation to happen again. I'll work with him for 5 to 6 years. He will have decisions that goes against what I think would be right. But he have to trust that I'll understand and respect his position. If he has a decision that I don't agree, I want him to treat me like a professional and not say that the responsibility is not his. I wasn't the best student, but I'm a good professional. I know how to separate things and accept decisions that are against my interest.

What can I say to direct him in this way? Or even to make him rethink his decision?"

Starting to freak out a little about this.

For some background, I had an interview for an internship in late February. Almost a week later, their HR said they wanted to interview me on site and proposed a date to do so. Unfortunately that time did not work for me. This email was sent around Friday.

Problem is I was only able to respond to them late in the afternoon so likely no one saw it until Monday. I gave some other times I was available and yet its almost been a week and I haven't heard from them. The time they suggested is on the 28th so I thought we'd have to sort that out well before then.

Did I screw over my chances entirely by sending the email too late? Should I send an email to see if they're still interested? The internship does have multiple positions so it might take a bit longer to sort through, but you'd think they'd send at least a response.

In short has anyone handled anything similar? I don't want to hurt my chances any more (if they still exist haha)."

I'm afraid I might be setting myself up for failure. Either that, or I'm overthinking this.

I'm booked 9-5 right now with a very well-paying client doing good work and going home at a more than decent hour. I really like this client, and they want to bring me on full time in a much more expanded role with more responsibility and more pay. I'm very much on board with the role. That's not the question.

The question is with a new client. They're a new local chain of restaurants that's looking to bring someone on to run their social media, which is currently at zero. They have no social media strategy or real presence to speak of, and they know it. A friend of mine is running business development for them and has been trying to get me to work with him on a project for about two years. This is the closest we've ever come to it actually coming through.

They want me to come on full time, but I know they can't pay me what the first client can. I've offered to devise an ongoing strategy and consult via retainer for them in my off hours, but they still want something more than that. Unfortunately, I just can't give them the time they're asking for at a price they can afford, but hey, that's the game sometimes.

I'm considering a compromise that may work for both of us. My role in this compromise set up would be sourcing, vetting, hiring, and managing a small team of 2-3 interns to capture content and prepare posts for a social calendar, on top of the general consulting and strategy I was offering to begin with. all again in my off hours from my regular (soon to be full time and expanded) gig.

My question is: Am I biting off more than I can chew with that compromise? I'm not naive enough to think that managing a team of interns is going to be easy, but I've also **definitely**  been guilty of being naive enough to think I can *do it all* in the past. I'd rather say no to a good opportunity I just can't take right now than burn a bridge that could lead to even better opportunities in the future.

As I'm writing here, it should come to no surprise to anybody that I am on the spectrum. I don't know what the Hell I can do with my life anymore.

I'm in my 20s. When I was younger I used to think I was quite functional. For a time I lived alone, went to college, studied for a law degree at a top local school, worked during summers and off-days lived my life like any other young adult.

The troubles started shortly before I graduated. I entered into a brief (sub 6 months) relationship that was nothing short of emotional exploitation, and when I finally ended it, I tumbled into some kind of semi-comatose state. I felt utterly empty and completely drained of all emotions or will to do anything. I have since learned that one feels like this when emotional parasites are removed, but at the time, I didn't even realize the relationship had been abusive. I stopped going to school, only showing up for the exams, and my performance at work suffered heavily. I was fired, and never managed to find another job, so I took on a lot of debt in order to at least finish school. Needless to say, my grades absolutely tanked, but they were good enough at first that I graduated with a middling GPA instead of a catastrophically low one.

At first, I thought college was for learning. I have since learned that college is about networking. This is especially true of the legal profession. Networking is exactly the thing I spent no time doing. I don't think any of my professors would recognize me or even know my name. Classmates definitely don't know me. The faculty organized events with legal professionals from top and not so top firms, and I never saw the point. It felt like a dishonest set-up. Students obviously attended these things for a single reason, so why would a pro listen to anything I might have to say? Why was it even a thing? Needless to say, I didn't go to a single one. And even if I did, my complete and utter social incompetence would have doomed me.

In law, you must complete an internship after graduating and during the Bar classes in order to practice. No internship, or weak internship, no luck. I might (I emphasize *might*) have gotten away with not networking had I kept my pre-cataclysm GPA, but at this point, all I had was a 3.4, a termination from my last job and a lot of excuses. I had no chance, and indeed, I received none. And the thing is, if you don't get an internship shortly after getting out of school, you are fucked. You are marked as undesirable. Even unpaids probably wouldn't take me, not that it matters because I come from a poor family and can't afford to work 6 months for nothing.

At this point, I returned home to live with my parents. Here I am, a grad whose diploma is barely good enough to be used as toilet paper and less solvent than Trump University. I took a few months to mope about, after which my mom and I set out to resolve my many problems. First, the crushing bank debt. I couldn't get away from student loans but I sure as Hell could default on the rest. My credit was shot to shit anyway. So I defaulted. After that, I moped about some more.

Up until then, my Asperger syndrome had always been quite abstract. It was there, but it didn't seem to matter. I had heard some people outgrew it, and I thought I did. I was diagnosed late, at 17, but it is indubitable that I have it because I presented tell-tale signs when young (instead of playing with cars, I played with their wheels; all my food had to be thrown in the blender in order to provide a perfectly consistent texture; I avoided eye contact, had a monotonous voice, and talked and read like an adult since grade 2; lots of repetitive behaviour and rituals, like forcing my mom to name all of my plushies in the correct order before going to sleep, etc) and the social skills deficits (theory of mind impairment, avoiding eye contact or forcing it, you know the drill) became more evident when I got older and went through the nightmare that is high school. But I was lucky to be born intelligent and I rode on my academic success, so it seemed like I was quite functional, just a bit odd. Nobody seemed to think it was worth seriously treating me or following me, except one social worker who was on my case. When I decided to move for college instead of staying home, she told me I wasn't ready for independence. I disagreed, of course. She asked me to at least seek another social worker to take on my case where I would be. I did not. I wanted to be a normal everyday young adult, and those don't check up with social workers.

The truth is, it felt and looked like I was doing everything right, but I wasn't. I had terrible planning and always did things at the last minute, I was irresponsible with money and budgeting, I had trouble doing chores around my apartment, and of course, I had no friends and only that one relationship. When that ended, all my problems were amplified by my complete inaction.

So when I came back home and was moping, I read a bit about my neglected condition. I researched it. And suddenly so many things became clear. I will not say that I, as a person, am blameless in my situation, there are definitely choices I made that were objectively, completely, and absolutely wrong. I pray every day to be taken in the past to fix some of my mistakes. But there are other things that I now could see in a different angle. I realized that the short relationship I had been in was centered around abusing my naivety, and I realized why I did not see any of the signs of abuse despite being in pain throughout. I realized why intellectual pursuits were easy but why normal, ordinary living tasks anyone could do were so frustratingly, incomprehensibly *hard*. Why, despite trying so hard, I had no friends and was failing anything involving the slightest interpersonal contact. Why, even before my semi-coma, I always seemed two fingers away from getting fired (I was called monthly into my supervisor's office for any reason, usually accused of grave offenses like not greeting my supervisor in the appropriate tone of voice), only being saved because I did good work. Why people were so confusing, why nothing ever made sense. I hadn't outgrown my Asperger, it was only obscured. And now there it was, in all its glory.

I decided to embrace it. I realized I had been unhappy and failing for so long because I was denying what I was in order to try to fit into a mold of what I should, but could never be. I sought help and was assigned another social worker. She understood my problems and saw them clear as day, and encouraged me to get out of my rut, little by little. I got my driving license, for one. Since my parents needed financial support, I got on welfare for the time being. It just so happens that Asperger qualifies for full disability in my country, in certain cases, and my application was approved. My parents lost about 6k of their savings due to the added strain of having me about, so I was happy to contribute and not feel so completely useless.

Over a few months, I explored myself and tried to discern a life path. I found serenity in accepting my condition and began to dream again, but of things I had never dreamed before. Things like a peaceful live led in solitude, a small house in the woods. Having friends, a girlfriend and following the rat race with everyone else seemed unimportant. All I wanted was peace and quiet, instead of success and acceptance. I thought it was unreasonable for me to be on social assistance forever, so my social worker and I started looked for non-college (since my parents and I are broke and I don't qualify for loans anymore) careers that would involve a minimum of social contact. I began to feel grateful to have never entered the legal profession, because in retrospect, I don't think I would have been able to handle the high stress and pressure and the dealing with people. I found an interesting program, my social worker accompanied me to the open doors event at the vocational school, and asked the relevant questions. It seemed like a good fit, so I said why not. I applied.

Here's the thing I am here for. My parents absolutely need me to contribute in the household, else we're screwed. The government offers a return to school program for people like me who are legally disabled. You keep the disability until you finish the program and find a job. That would have been the perfect option, as I would have kept contributing to the household while I went to school.

Except it turns out I'm not eligible. Why? Because of that fucking useless law school degree. I can't use it, but that doesn't really seem to matter. If I go back to school, I lose the money. I could, of course, find a job. With a 4 year employment gap and termination, a 2 years old law degree with a bad GPA that has never seen any use, no other qualifications, no references and my complete social cluelessness, I think you folks understand better than anyone why this is not likely, even for the shittiest of shit jobs. I have tried, of course. I have yet to receive a callback, even from Walmart. But I'm keeping that as an option, as unlikely as it is, if it's the only way for my hopes not to completely vanish.

So what do I do now? My choices seem to be : go back to school, lose money and screw over my parents, or content myself with taking money from the normies for the rest of my life and never get my little house in the woods, or hope for the stars, get some job and support myself through school. Is there anything else I might be missing? I am so incredibly frustrated right now as it seems no matter what I do, it's never enough and there's never a real way out. I have to hold myself back from regressing to hitting myself in the head as I used to do when angry and confused."

By real, I mean that the internship predominately involves serious Python development. Most job listings I've come across merely list Python as an aside, treating it as a filler word.

I love Python. I've been teaching it to myself for about a year now out of pure enjoyment. I've published my own packages and command line tools on pypi, built backends with Flask, and written god knows how many scripts to experiment with ML, web scraping, botting, etc.

It's very late into the recruiting season and I'm getting desperate to work this summer. I'd absolutely love to intern somewhere where I will be programming in Python most of the time.

If anyone here knows of such opportunities, I'd love to know about them. Thanks!"

I have applied to a few and just nothing comes out of it. What are the best places to be looking at? Ill be graduating this December and have only this summer to do an internship. 

About: most of my computer programming knowledge comes from courses at my university. I feel very confident with my coding skills and I feel like it comes naturally to me. Assembly was fun and challenging, really like it. I got Java and C++ as my main programming languages. Other courses are iOS programming, data structures, web development, UNIX. 

Also Im one class away from getting my applied mathematics degree. 

Thanks in advanced for those who took their time to give me some guidance.

5zt7q7,1,2017-03-16,Abraham Kornzweig,PythonShitpostBot,BotShitposts,https://www.reddit.com/r/BotShitposts/comments/5zt7q7/abraham_kornzweig/,"Abraham Leon Kornzweig, (born 1900 – died 1982), born in New York, a physician and ophthalmologist specializing in geriatric ophthalmology. He opened a new field in investigative medicine, and founded the Society of Geriatric Ophthalmology. He was also widely known as the co-discoverer and namer of Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, also called Abetalipoproteinemia. It was first noted by the United States physician Frank Bassen, who partnered with Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease.



Born in New York City, Kornzweig graduated from Columbia University in 1922, and from the New York University Medical School in 1925. From 1925 to 1928, He trained as an intern at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, including study in pathology under the well-known Bernard Samuels, after which he entered private practice until 1934. He returned to Mount Sinai for a residency in ophthalmology and in 1936, received a diplomate. For 17 years, he taught at NYU-Bellevue Medical School, where he was an Associate Clinical Professor; he subsequently taught at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where he was Clinical Professor, and eventually Emeritus Professor, of Ophthalmology. He was also Director of Research and Chief of Ophthalmology at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged. He retired in poor health in 1972, although he continued to work on his research projects until his death in 1982.
He married Chifra Goldberg, a naturalized citizen, born in Yass, Rumania and they had one daughter.




Bassen-Kornzweig disease, also called Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder in which the body fails to produce chylomicrons, a low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Individuals with this condition are unable to properly digest fats. Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and other forms of nerve dysfunction. Treatment includes vitamin E.
Characteristics of the syndrome include the presence of acanthocytes (burr-cell malformation of the erythrocytes), and the reduction or even absence of B-lipoproteins. Complications include retinitis pigmentosa, degenerative changes in the central nervous system involving the cerebellum and long tracts, fatty diarrhea, ataxia, areflexia, demyelination, defective intestinal lipid absorption with low serum cholesterol level, intestinal malabsorption, amaurosis, retarded growth, and steatorrhea. Intellectual development may be slightly retarded. Many afflicted with the syndrome are unable to walk.
The syndrome appears in infancy. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year. The syndrome may predominate in males (71%). Most cases occur in children of Jewish descent, especially among Ashkenazi Jews. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It is also commonly recognized as a betalipoprotein deficiency or abetalipoproteinemia.



Kornzweig's publications include over 50 articles and books, beginning in 1948 with a series of articles on the ""Eye in Old Age"", and concluding with, in 1980, ""New Ideas for the Old Eye.""

Should I proceed with caution and switch it something safer (and potentially more boring) or keep going with this?

We are pretty good at obstacles, and I just need to put my brain to rest on some fears that come with this. 

My boyfriend is in a 5 year IT program, and one of the things that he needs in this is 2 semesters of interning. He got a great offer from Super Great IT Company and he tole me about it last week. I am stupendously proud of him, as this company has a reputation of giving job offers to interns post-grad. 

Recently I have been helping a few friends go through the motions of post-break up. All of them have been between 3 and 4 years in their relationships, and we often spoke of our SO's together and felt really connected. These breakups have gotten me a little bit worried for my own relationship, as I often feel we are unshakable, but anxiety makes that a bit difficult with some external factors such as this. 

After telling BF that I was really scared with the recent break up trend and that I miss him, I try to plan a date for when we are both home, as we dont go to the same college. He says that he will be getting ready for California. I ask, ""Vacation?"" and he goes ""... no? My internship?"" 

I go back in all our correspondence about the internship and he never mentioned California. I inquire further and he says ""from June to January, I'll be in Cali."" 

I sorta freaked out with worry about this, but I was calmed easily. I'm not mad that he didnt mention this; he swore he did, but like shit happens. This is just the new normal. Now my question is like... How do I tame my fears in this? Also this stretch of time encompasses our anniversary and both of our birthdays... any way to keep these events special as they come?

Here goes.. 

I lived quite a wild lifestyle at University and was quite silly managing a student account I opened. I maxed out the overdraft, and as I didn't obey the conditions of the overdraft (not moving my student loan into that account), the overdraft was taken away, and through absolute negligence on my part, they defaulted the account (at £2000) and subsequently sold the debt on. I've ignored it ever since, but after graduating I'm trying to get things in order.

Furthermore, I also have an overdraft on my main current account (I know I know, 2 student overdrafts?!), this also pretty much sits maxed out on £2000 but shifts around a bit after I get paid (more on that anon). To top this off, sadly and regretfully I owe a very close friend £4000, was £5000 but I reduced this. 

I'm currently on an internship at the moment where the money isn't great. I take home £1200 a month (have only recently started), but have fortunately secured a graduate scheme where I'll be earning £30k as of September. 

My outgoings as things stand are:

Bills (CT, internet, G&amp;E): £120
Travel: £135
Food: £150
Rent: £0

Some key points to note:

1) The default occurred February 2014.
2) My student account with the overdraft has turned into a graduate account which I believe will remain interest free for 2 years as of September 2016. 
3) I have agreed to pay my friend back £400-500 a month. 
4) I have sold some obsolete possessions and put some money aside from my new job and currently have £600 in 'savings'. 

I'm not sure what to do regarding my overdraft? I had planned to make contact with the debt owner of my defaulted account toward the end of the 6 years (late 2019) and arrange to pay it back in instalments, is this a good or bad idea? Should I be doing something smarter with the £600 that is effectively sat in a safe as cash?

Please feel free to ask if you any questions, any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thanks

I have also been attending a program at my university that utilizes graduate-level psychology students as interns to help other students. The program itself is very similar to therapy with a targeted goal of helping the attendee develop skills &amp; positive habits to succeed in school and life. The program has been literally the best help I have ever had throughout my life, even better than professional therapy with reconsidering (after my diagnosis) and developing skills, habits and coping mechanisms for how my lifestyle has changed due to having an actual understanding of my mental health.

One thing that I have noticed but have not sat down to think/talk about is how my mood significantly depresses during my drive home from work or school. Normally when I am at school, I have learned how to be productive and adjust my behavior and mood to suit what I need or want to do. There are times where I can work on tasks, be productive and then head home and continue being productive. Most of the time however, I start my commute home (usually listening to music that tends to help keep me productive) ready to go home and work on housework, projects, homework, etc, however by the time I get home my mood has lost most of its potency towards productivity. This generally leads me to not complete the things I had planned for that evening, or have a very hard time doing them, which I know is typical for an ADHDer.

I am looking for advice on how to manage this, whether it be rejuvenating it when it get home, maintaining it during the drive, or relax in a way I can regain the productive mood, etc.

Thanks for anyone who read through all of this!"
5ztx22,33,2017-03-16,How I understand the use of internships and how the approach mirrors talking to women.,chilinfosho,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5ztx22/how_i_understand_the_use_of_internships_and_how/,"I’m sure you’ve all seen Facebook posts about people crying that entry level jobs require work experience and people don’t understand how that’s possible if they’re just graduating. Blue pill mentality is just that, being frustrated at the world for how you think it ought to be, as opposed to how it will logically progress. It’s necessary to get an internship, probably after sophomore year, but definitely by the summer of junior year. GPAs are inflated, the median GPA at Harvard is an A-, meaning that half of all grades are an A-, or better. Your GPA won’t save you. 

My cousin is a paleo botanist, which doesn’t actually mean that she blogs about how cool eating spinach on a paleo diet is—it means she digs up plant fossils. She volunteered for a guy doing a dig one summer. This guy then became a director at the Denver science museum and is now the head of the Smithsonian. There were quite a few applicants to work at the Smithsonian, but he only legitimately looked at one, his assistant that he got along with a few summers before. 

I was personally offered an internship doing econ research on petroleum taxation for the Sustainable Swedish Economy Foundation because I got sucked into group work where we had to interview somebody for a class project. This tends to work better in Europe (contacting important people) but straight up contacting somebody for an “interview” is a way to bypass the automatic filtering system that most applicants go for. Quite frequently companies, like girls, have a program that will identify key words in essays and GPA and so on and will only look at those particular things. This principle could be exemplified by being under six feet on tinder; you’re automatically out. In the end, my partner and I were offered internships because they said they wanted to help young people, so don’t feel like you’re being a burden if you do this.

To build upon this last point, I dated a girl whose uncle is a diplomat for the world bank in South Africa, he determines the rate at which developing countries get huge loans from the first world. While it was too dangerous for an intern to live in Johannesburg, he told me that the best way to find an internship is to go and find somebody who is doing research that interests you and send them an e-mail asking them questions about it. In this way, you are not saying “oh hey I’m interested in using you for improving my resume”—read get laid. Instead, you are flattering this person, many of whom think they’re just an unknown worker bee with a PHD. It is also interesting that most companies and so on will have a budget for interns that they won’t publicly display, or so the diplomat told me. 

This idea could go something like: You can lie about all of these. 

“Hey I think I saw your blog through a mutual friend last weekend and I thought it was really cool. How do you find your inspiration for writing? I’m trying to be a writer too…” (Get coffee) 

“You have a really interesting Instagram, I’m trying to learn photography, can I take pictures of you some time”?

“Hey, you seem way more intelligent than me in this class; I’ll buy you coffee if you can show me how you understand the reading before class on Thursday.” 

 It is also interesting that most companies and so on will have a budget for interns that they won’t publicly display. 

Key points:

1.	Experience is more important than GPA. Think of GPA like attractiveness, it doesn’t automatically get you laid.

2.	Approach opportunities in a way that you don’t have to get in line where the person has a thousand extra points of validation to look at. I.e. Don’t go pick up girls at a bar. 

3.	It is frequently easier to try get a position that seems at first daunting because fewer people are competing for it. You vs 100 applicants in a general process or you vs. nobody else contacting a PHD at Boeing.  

I have a few beautiful friend girls who are 10/10 and have crippling self-esteem issues because they always see their 7-8/10 friends comment about how they wish they were as beautiful as the 10/10 and then end up getting all of the attention at bars because guys are too afraid to talk to the 10's. As a result, the beautiful ones end up dating uglier guys and are actually more desperate than their friends. "

I met Juan in a hostel in Paris, years before the internet became what it is today. Lines of communication were different back then, and meeting new people was a more personal experience, shared only between the engaged parties.

I spotted his big smile for the first time in a small market a few blocks away from where I was staying, but of course I would never approach a stranger with such a small reason as the attraction of a charming aura. This is always the shame of the human condition; that we are often too fearful to say hello unless we have a distinct reason for it. 

Juan left the shop just before me with a large back of groceries and a few bottles of inexpensive wine. I didn't mean to follow him out of the store, but we were walking the same way. I watched him as we were both on our way down the street, and he turned right into the hostel. It was entirely possible that I would find a way to speak to him later. I dropped what I had bought in the communal refrigerator and—not entirely knowing what to do with myself—walked into the common room with my book to sit with the other traveling young people. I surveyed the room. Two girls who looked to be about my age sat in the corner on the sofa pouring over a number of maps and a tattered looking copy of Lonely Planet. At that time, there was no constant access to information, and even traveling around Western Europe was a daunting task. I looked away from the pair and up towards a man writing a postcard at a table in the center of the room. We made eye contact and my immediate reflex was to look away. 

I peered up again at the man, who looked a great deal older than me. He was probably only 30, but to me at the time, I felt he was fully grown while I was still just a child. His shirt had rips and tears, and his hair was long and starting to dread. He looked as though his last shower was taken weeks ago. One of his eyes was black as though he had just been in a fight, and as he stood up to walk over to the refrigerator, I noticed how tall and imposing his stature really was. He was nothing short of a yeti. He looked up at me again—probably because I was staring at him. He made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. After being at the table for all of five minutes, I stood up to go back to my shared dorm room upstairs. 

Pressing the button on the old-fashioned elevator, I listened to it creak on its way down. When it lurched to a halt, I pulled open the door and started to fumble with the old grate. A hand came up behind my shoulder and flicked a latch. The grate sprung open. I turned around to look, and I saw Juan up close for the first time. I must have looked a bit shocked because he pulled back a bit and said, “Sorry. Just thought I could help.”

My problem at 19 was my fear of the world and my crippling fear of my own comfort zone. To my own credit, I had taken that train by myself from Berlin. I had located a tourist help desk in the train station and phoned a number of hostels looking for a room. I had taken the metro there myself to where I needed to go, and I organized myself well enough to see every single one of the typical tourist sights in Paris. I had been in Paris only two full days, and I had already found myself at the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, and a small cafe where I tried foie gras for the first time. I was capable and intelligent with a mediocre level of common sense, but I was scared to move outside of the prescribed itinerary. To me now, navigating Paris seems so small and insignificant. Perhaps I'm too hard on myself. 
“Thank you,” I managed to push the words out of my mouth. We stepped into the elevator.
“Are you going to the ceiling?” he asked. The Spanish accent gave away that English was not Juan's first language, but I understood what he meant.

I nodded my head because I didn't really have a plan, and I couldn't get any more words out. Looking back, I don't really know what was wrong with me. Complete social ineptitude wasn't something that I was frequently plagued with. While I was very different back then from how I am now, my sense of humor has remained relatively constant. I was a little daunted by the new experience of traversing the planet by myself, talking to people typically wasn't an issue for me. Juan intimidated me, but I liked him right away. 

“What is your name?” Juan asked. “I am Juan. I am from Spain.” I distinctly remember that Juan never used contractions. 
“Heather,” I smiled. I was gaining back my social decorum. “Are you just traveling in Paris?”
“I have an internship in Paris but no place to live. I wish to find a place soon. I know I will.” There was something calming about him. 
The elevator lurched to a stop on the 6th floor, and we climbed the last set of stairs to the roof. At this point, I had forgotten all about returning to my dorm room. I hadn't been up to the roof yet, but the view was out of a picture book. The city was twinkling. The Eiffel Tower was in view in the far distance. The apartments all around us had large open windows, and you could see the people walking around their homes, going through the motions of their everyday lives. 
“You will join us?” Juan asked. 

Seeing as there was nobody else on the roof other than the people he knew, I figured that it would look bizarre not to join them. There was a girl and a boy around my age sitting at one of the small tables. The girl looked quite elegant with a cigarette in one hand that she pulled from just before she looked up at me. She exhaled, letting a stream of smoke blow out of the corner of her mouth, and she smiled as if she knew me. 
“Hi” she said, extending an arm. I didn't expect her to be American because of the way she held her cigarette. “Where are you from?”
“I'm from Chicago.” I responded. I was actually from a small town outside of Chicago, but Americans typically seem to identify with the closest large city. “And yourself?”
“I'm Steph. My boyfriend and I are from San Diego.”
“Hey, I'm John.” He extended his hand to shake mine. “What are you doing in Paris then? Are you traveling alone?”
“I am. For the first time! I'm doing an internship in Berlin right now, and I have some time off.”
“Nice!” said Steph. “We're doing a year long trip around the world. We just came from South America. Paris is our first stop in Europe!”
“So how do the three of you know each other?” I asked. I was curious to see how Juan fit into the equation.
“We met last night.” Juan said. “We take many bottles of wine and enjoy.” I was starting to understand how normal people function in hostels. It sounds pretty counter-intuitive, but I never really considered forming fast friends. These people were really welcoming. 

I had a full glass of wine in front of me, and before I knew it, many glasses of wine were gone. Juan told jokes about his friends back in Madrid, Stef had many great things to say about Peru, and John described quite an evening in Guatamala that the pair of them will never forget. 

They seemed to find me really interesting. My internship was at the Neues Museum where I helped far more important people coordinate loans of ancient artifacts for the temporary displays. I feel that interesting lines of work were easier to come by when I was young than they are now. These days, there are thousands of kids applying for the same position. The internship actually fell into my lap courtesy of an art history professor that took a shining to me. I had no travel experience, though. I watched the three of them and how they all sat in their chairs. They all looked so relaxed and comfortable despite having just met. Even after a few hours, I felt as though I belonged. Juan would laugh, and it would light up his whole face. I was laughing, too. I was drunk in a setting that looked like it should be on a postcard.
“Thomas!” Juan gestured for someone who had just opened the door to come over. I couldn't quite see him in the shadows. “Where did you go?”

The tall, imposing man that emerged was the same man who was downstairs at the table. He looked at me and then looked back to Juan, “I had to make some calls to my travel insurance agency. They are going to reimburse me the value of my rucksack and my hospital bill.” 
“That is good news!” Juan looked relieved for the man.
“My family is going to wire me some money within the next few days. Then I can pay you back. Thanks for helping me. I was starting to panic.” He just looked a little bit dejected. 
“What happened?” I asked. I was missing something in the story, and the yeti scared me a little less after multiple glasses of wine. 

The yeti's name was Thomas, and he told us the whole tale of how he was walking the streets with his bag, trying to find a place to stay. Five men jumped out from a small alley and pushed him down. Despite his size, he couldn't fight five men. I had never considered that tall, broad men would often be targeted more than scrawnier people just for the sake of the conquest. They kicked him repeatedly in the ribs and hit him numerous times in the face. They took everything he had and left him on the street corner. He could see a phone booth across the street, and he somehow made it over there to call a hospital. Luckily, he spoke French. Thomas is from Finland. He speaks five languages. This explained the tattered shirt and the pained disposition. I felt a twinge of guilt for judging him so harshly based on his looks. After hearing what he had been through, I could easily see that he was a quiet, calm kind of person who would never hurt a fly. I think he was just a bit shaken. I hadn't expected sensitivity from the yeti.  

Juan offered him a glass of wine, but Thomas politely declined. I wasn't entirely sure whether he declined because he didn't want to accept any more generosity from Juan or because he knew that a drink wouldn't help his state of mind. He sat with us for a while longer, but he retired to bed earlier than the rest of us. 

That night was the first time I got that taste of freedom that comes with traveling. I sure hadn't felt it at the Louvre, but I felt it right then in that moment, and I never wanted it to go away. The cliché of being inspired by the Parisian night is not lost on me to this day, but it does seem quite silly to me now. I still smile when I think about my time there. 



Juan was staying on the second floor in a room with eight beds, one of which was where Thomas was sleeping. I was on the fourth floor in a dorm that was almost empty other than a British couple who had arrived the night before. They kept to themselves for the most part. The rooms were very small. Bunk beds were crammed in as tight as they could have been. What I remember most was the bathroom. It was larger than the room that all of the beds were crammed into, and the four claw bathtub was giant. It has obviously just been refurbished because it was nicer and cleaner than anywhere else in the hostel. The giant windows opened up so wide to let in the summer breeze. I was to find out later that this was certainly not the typical hostel experience. 

Juan had asked me the previous night if I wanted to join him for a picnic at a park nearby. There were no romantic undertones to his invitation; he just wanted to spend the afternoon around someone. I had two days left in Paris, and I had already seen most of the tourist sights that I had on my list. I had had my first taste of travel friendship, and I was happy to be around someone who was happy to be around anyone. Juan had a way about him that was determined to find the good and the interesting in everybody he met. 

We went to a number of different shops to collect bread, cheese, fruit, and dried meats. We bought cold beers this time to add some variety. The people I met all seemed to drink a lot more than I did. They all smoked cigarettes absentmindedly in a way that screamed that they were young and carefree. I gravitated towards this personality type, and I subconsciously wanted to emulate it. 

Juan and I sat at the park for hours soaking up the summer sun. We played cards for a while. We each taught the other a different game from our respective countries. I felt as though I had known him for years, as one generally feels in the company of such an open, positive spirit. Even now, I generally remain cynical and often slightly judgmental, but at that park, I was a free spirit exposed to someone that was so unique to me at the time. 
“What do you want to do with your life?” Juan asked. 
“I have no idea,” I responded. I was caught completely off guard by this question, but I wouldn't have had an answer even if I had had all day to prepare it. 
“Do you want to continue to work in art?” 
“I'm not sure. I'm no artist, but I'd like to do something more creative. I would mostly be in an administrative role.” I had always had lofty dreams of somehow constructively helping people one day, but we never get to choose where life takes us.
“You seem like the kind of person that when you figure out what you want, you will do it.” I've received many sincere compliments, but I will always take that one with me. Juan saw a quality in me that I had never seen before. It was a quality that I would begin to develop over a very long period of time. 

When we arrived back at the hostel, a group of people were congregated in the bathroom attached to my room. It was a strange place to hang out, but I think that was why we all liked being in there. The tiles on the floor were cool, and the windows made the room feel very open. The apartment across the street was playing an old Edith Piaf record so loudly that the whole street could hear. At this point, there were five of us in the bathroom, and we sat on our knees peering out the window at the couple in the apartment across the street who were dancing to the music quite elegantly. 

Juan had been drinking all day and was beginning to act harmlessly silly. He started yelling cat-calls to the couple across the street and then ducked back under the windowsill as soon as they would look up to see who was watching them. The other three found our immaturity a sign that it was time for them to go to bed. When we realized that we were alone in the bathroom, Juan stood up and held out his hand for me to join him in a dance. 

“Are we giving the couple across the street the opportunity to pay us back?” I joked. I don't think Juan really understood the idiom, but he pulled me up and whirled me around. We were both laughing so hard as we spun around. We must have looked absurd—violently spinning around in circles in an oversized bathroom for anyone to see through the giant windows—but I didn't care one bit. At one point, my foot hit the claw of the bathtub, and I took a tumble. I also took him down with me, which incited even more laughter. At that point, we were probably fit for a mental institution as we just laughed and laughed. 

“Do you want to smoke a spliff?” He asked me. 
I had smoked marijuana only a handful of other times in my life, and it was always through a glass pipe, so I had no idea how to inhale from something that resembled a cigarette. Juan smiled when I told him this but not in a condescending way. He just rolled the spliff and patiently sat there with me as I practiced inhaling with a regular cigarette. I remember it being hilarious for the both of us. Eventually, I passed the test, and he passed me the spliff. High as kites, we made our way to the window and looked out at the few people who were still walking on the street. 
“Where are they going?” I asked. “Tell me where they're going!”
“To the moon!” At nineteen years of age, I truly found this adorable. 
And that was when he looked at me, tilted my head up, and kissed me. 

When I look back on this event in my life or try to share it with others, it doesn't sound particularly fantastic. Having sex in a hostel bathroom isn't a story anybody finds romantic, and in a way, it wasn't romantic at all. It was fun. It was free. It was absurd. I feel a little remorse for anyone who might have needed to use the toilet that night. They would have had to meander to another floor. 

The next morning, Juan and I took the elevator downstairs. He took out a key and carved his name into the steel wall of the elevator, and then he wrote my name as “Header” instead of “Heather.” I didn't even think to correct him. I smiled at the language barrier and the small reminder that despite the past few days, we didn't really know each other at all. We both laughed, and he never had and never will have any idea of the mistake. 

At the front door, Thomas was waiting to talk to Juan. He looked a lot better. He had obviously been shopping for some new t-shirts, and he had gotten some sleep and a shower. His hair was still dreaded and a bit greasy, but I figured that was just his natural state. 
“I want to treat you to lunch!” He smiled in his slightly sweet strange way. “The both of you!”
“I didn't do anything! But I'm happy to come along.” I said. 
“But you're here now,” He replied in such a concise manner. I still felt like he meant the invitation.

We ate at a small cafe nearby. I liked Thomas because I couldn't quite figure him out. It was as though he was holding onto something or somehow holding back. He wasn't afraid to look anyone in the eye as they spoke to him, and he had a way about him that commanded your attention. For some reason, I felt special that he liked us. He was an artist, working mainly in sculpture. He had some photographs of some of his work, and the attention to detail was astounding. I still felt slightly uncomfortable around him as he seemed so established, and I was so young and so undecided. Despite my involvement in the art world, I didn't feel as though I had any authority to speak about what I was actually knowledgeable about. 



I had to pack my small bag that evening to take the train back to Berlin early in the morning. I only had two more weeks of work ahead of me before my return to the United States and about ten million things to do. Thomas, Juan, and I spent my last night on the rooftop. Juan and I drank, and Thomas snacked on bread and cheese. I was sad to leave, but I had experienced something both insignificant and important. For the first time, I knew that whatever I did, I needed to see the world and meet all of the people in it. 

That morning, I wrote two small notes. I wrote one to Juan and one to Thomas. It included my address in case they ever wanted to get in contact with me again. I didn't have any expectations, but I felt as though it was the right thing to do.  "
5zu13r,22,2017-03-16,Rape Fantasy 001 {Put Me In My Place},toachen,Rapekink,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/5zu13r/rape_fantasy_001_put_me_in_my_place/,"Well, I don’t have any real accounts of rapeplay from my own life, but I do have several fantasies.  So I figure, whenever I feel like writing one out in detail, I’ll post it here.

Please note: I am a transgender man, currently on testosterone and post top-surgery.  This is to say, if you were to look at me with pants on, I look like your average dude, if a bit small.  I still have a cunt, though, and it’s involved in my fantasies.

Also, all individuals mentioned besides myself do not exist.  I just wish that they did…

- - Fantasy Start - -

I’m in charge at a big company—the industry doesn’t really matter.  Perhaps something of the creative persuasion—such as building myself an empire from a world or series of my own design.  I’m on top, though, and in complete control—which is all that matters.

It’s the season to hire a new round of interns, and this time, there’s someone who piques my interest, simply because it’s not the classical college-student resume.  A gentleman older than myself by at almost a decade, with a surprising amount of work experience.  Internships are paid, here, and obviously, he must have been laid off and is struggling to find work.  I hire him, of course.

The thing is, I tend to be a bit of a shit when I’m in charge, and my youth only makes it come off worse.  I’ve got a faulty filter and say what I’m thinking, blunt and a bit harsh.  I turn almost all suggestions down, because I’m very particular about having things my way, and if the suggestion isn’t up to my standards—no, exceeding them—then there’s no way it will sway a decision I have made.  I’ll be able to critique everything I find wrong with it, and if asked to provide an explanation for my decision to turn it down, I’ll do so with little regard.

To my newest intern, I come off as a massive prick—an absolute little shit, young and far too self-absorbed.  I can’t entirely say he’d be wrong.

It gets under his skin, though.  Drives him up a wall.  He’s older than I am, wiser.  The power dynamic in a work setting kills him, and my attitude only makes it a hell of a lot worse.

So, of course… He’d love nothing more than to put me in my place.

I always close up the office, and one night, I stay late. I don’t require anyone else to—I’m doing my own work, they’re done for the night.  He sticks around, though.  Insists that it will be a learning experience, and my ego gets the better of me, I think nothing of it.  Once the building has been quiet for a while, he comes into my office to show me exactly where I belong.

He spins my swivel chair around, and I immediately go to ask him what the fuck he thinks he’s doing.  I don’t like being touched, and by extension, I do not like my chair touched.  Everyone knows that.

Instead of answering me, he grabs a fistful of my hair and yanks me off the chair and onto my knees.  It earns him a pained gasp, and I’m enraged.  How dare he?  I shove at his legs and leave him stumbling slightly back, asking him what his game is—but he keeps a firm grip on my hair and yanks me forwards, shoving my face against his crotch, where a tend is growing.  The concept of revenge, of putting me in my place, is obviously pleasurable for him.

I immediately start to struggle, pushing and shoving, but he twists my hair in his fingers and holds my head firmly against his clothed groin, making it difficult to breathe.  He lets me go after a few long minutes, and I immediately sit back, taking deep inhales of the cool, fresh air.  I’m too focused on the pleasure of breathing normally to notice that he’s undoing his fly and pushing his pants down just enough for his cock to pop out, erect against the cool air.

It occurs to me quickly enough when he grabs me by the hair and shoves my face back to my crotch, telling me to suck.  Immediately, I’m pushing on his thighs and start running my mouth about how I’d never, how he better get the fuck off of me.  He thrusts his hips forward and his dick catches on my lips, just narrowly missing the opportunity to plunge into my mouth.  I realize I need to shut up, and I keep my mouth shut, refusing to open even as he whaps me in the face with his cock, shaking my head around with his grip on my hair.

He uses his free hand to grab my nose and pinch it shut, depriving me of air.  I screw my eyes shut and try to hold my breath, but I can’t hold it long enough, and I gasp—and that’s it.  His cock plunges deep into my throat and I choke, immediately gagging on his thick, swollen member. Tear well in my eyes as he fucks my throat, and more than once, he buries himself balls-deep in my throat, cutting off my air supply, and holds me still in spite of all of my struggles, hitting and squirming.  I nearly pass out more than once, and I choke, cough, and gag through the whole thing.  The face fucking is sloppy, with my drool everywhere.

I stop struggling, too lightheaded from all the oxygen he’s deprived me of.  He fucks my throat hard, and I continue to gag and choke, my eyes rolling back as he abuses my mouth.  It feels like forever before he cums hard down my throat, pulling back just enough to make sure I got a nice mouthful, too, fucking my throat a bit more as he rides out his orgasm, pulls out of my mouth and lets go of my hair.

Immediately, I spit the cum out of my mouth, wiping with my sleeve and shaking.  I cough hysterically, sniffling hard as my crying begins to worsen.  I assume he’s done, that he’s had his fun, and I move to stand— 

Only to be slammed over my large desk, chest down.  If I weren’t winded enough from choking on his cock, he certainly winds me with that move.  I squirm, telling him to get the fuck off—but my voice is weaker now, and my legs are shaking as tears silently roll out of my eyes.  I’m terrified, and he knows it.

He tells me that I’m not off the hook yet, that I need to learn my place.  That I need to respect other people.

He’s yanking off my pants and boxers fast and hard.  He doesn’t bother undoing my fly, so my dress pants squeeze uncomfortably hard as they  are forced over my hips nonetheless.  His hand immediately goes between by legs, looking for a pair of testes to squeeze—but he finds none, and, shocked, looks down.  The sight of my smooth cunt is delightful to him, and he breaks out laughing.  Without hesitation, he slaps me between the legs, his palm colliding with my slit—and clit—hard.

I shout in pain—and pleasure—and struggle.  His laughing makes me feel sick to my stomach and I shake my head vehemently.  I beg him to stop, to please, just stop, but he doesn’t.  He plays with my clit for a minute, and in that time, my pussy betrays me, growing slick and throbbing under his fingers.  I feel self disgust rivet through my body and hide my face against the desk, try to pretend this isn’t happening as he fingers me with just a single finger.  That’s more than enough as far as I’m concerned.

I almost manage to block everything out, until suddenly, he pushes his dick up against my cunt entrance.  He struggles to get it in, and I start sobbing, nearly hyperventilating.  I beg him to stop, beg for anything but that, say that he’ll never fit.  He uses a vice grip on my hair to smash my face against the desk, leaving me to sob.  He continues pushing, and my fear builds.  I know it’s going to hurt, and I try to brace myself.

When he finally manages to push in, he slams all the way home until the head of his cock is pushing my cervix and he’s balls deep.  A scream tears from my throat and I go completely still, in shock from the pain.  Testosterone has made my cunt extra sensitive—and extra tight as it’s reshaped my form.

With mouth hanging open as pain resonates through my body, he’d take the opportunity to shove two fingers in my mouth, yanking me backwards by my jaw as he begins to mercilessly pound my cunt.  My screams of agony and pleas for him to stop fall on deaf ears, and he just keeps pounding away, telling me that this is where I belong, that I need to get in line or have this happen more often.

Even as he mercilessly pounds at my cervix, making my hips twitch and provoking loud groans of pain, with the occasional shout… My body is loving it.  My cunt ripples around him, milking his cock with its tightness and throbbing as I am forced through more orgasms than I can count.  My fat clit twitches against the desk where it’s pinched between my body and the smooth edge.  I’m a sobbing mess, but my own slick is running down my thighs.

He’d undoubtedly stuff me full with his cum, thick jets of semen spurt against my cervix, deep inside of me.  Thrust a couple more times to make sure he’s emptied himself into me before pulling back, breathing heavy.  He’d take a look at his handiwork and feel great.  For all my confidence and attitude, I’d be completely broken by him, trembling against the desk.  Once he zips his fly back up, he gives my cunt a few more hard smacks, until the skin tinges red and feels sore.  After taking a moment to watch his cum slowly begin to drip out of my abused pussy, he’d tell me I was disgusting, tell me to remember this.  He’d tell me that he’d see me tomorrow bright and early for work, and then he’d leave me there, incapacitated by pain and conflict, a mess of my own drool and slick and his cum, legs too weak to pick me up.

I figured out late in my undergrad that I REALLY wanted to become a Software Developer and I was able to finish my BS and Minor in 4.5 years and I even secured a tech related internship for a very well known company last summer doing front-end work. 

I have been doing everything possible to make myself as marketable as possible for an entry level developer position such as creating a side project, having a tech related internship, and learning about the newest technologies (Javascript frameworks and runtimes, non-relational databases, IOS and Android app development, etc.). 


I feel that at some point I need to go back to college to get a second bachelors and eventually a Masters in Computer Science if I really want to be successful as a developer. My plan is to get an entry level developer position, and while working I would go back to college to finish my second Bachelors simultaneously. 

I have had no luck securing a junior developer position as of now so I am wondering if there is there any hope in that goal, or should I take a Finance position that I would not be crazy about and go to school from there? Are bootcamps a better option for me? I can attach my resume if that will help. 

The courses I have already taken for my minor are Computer Programming I &amp; II(Python &amp; Java), Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization and Assembly(MIPS), Database Concepts(MySQL and PHP), Discrete Math. Plus I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony, VUDU and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

I have about 10k in my savings account from previous work throughout college (summer internships mostly). 

All that money is currently between a Checking and Savings account at TD Bank, which does operate in NYC, but I feel like there are no benefits to using TD. should i stay with TD and open a different kind of account? What is the best bank to start saving with?

Also, I feel like its probably a good idea to start building credit so in the future when I need to sign on apartment leases in the future i don't need to use my parents as guarantors or anything. I currently have zero credit. should i just get a secured credit card for now or can is there a way to get a card that i can start earning rewards with?

finally, I understand that income tax in NYC is especially high for whatever reason, is it sensible to live outside of the city (brooklyn, hoboken, jersey city, etc)? does the cost benefit outweigh the commute?"

I could commute from home (about an hour, maybe slightly more, train ride from the suburbs) or pay for an apartment in the city close to my job (would cost about $3500 to be close to my job as its an expensive area and summer leases are tough and that doesn't factor in the cost of food). I think that being in the city for the summer would be an amazing and fun immersive experience but I would also save a lot by staying home. In the long run, I don't think the extra money will do much for me but I could probably do something cool with it too, like go on a trip, begin investing, eat nicer food, etc. Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts. 

EDIT: I'm paying for my housing next year at school, so there is significant difference."

Now, I have plenty of work and research experience listed, but still feel like I should keep some class projects. On one hand, they were done in class for a grade and not on my free time, but they also weren't trivial and were pretty complex projects. For example, I took a big data class where half our grade was a final project. I implemented an automatic image colorizer using hadoop and tensorflow on an AWS GPU server, which drew from my machine learning, computer vision, and databse courses. I felt like this project shows an application of the libraries I learned and could show the adcom im familiar with the technology. What's the appropriate or typical thing to do here?

Some background info if it changes anything: applying to ms in elec eng at top schools, no pubs, some work with professor but no paper, plenty of intern experience at major silicon valley company"

5zval9,1,2017-03-16,How do you handle it when your boyfriend (22 M) is STILL seemingly way less mature than you (Me 23 F)?,Slothstronaut-_-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5zval9/how_do_you_handle_it_when_your_boyfriend_22_m_is/,"It's been over four years now. Obviously we're still pretty young. But I constantly feel like his ""nagging"" unpaid intern. We are constantly bickering and then coming to an understanding. Which I also expect in the relationship. However, he only holds up his end of the bargain if everything in his life is perfect. So, like....20% of the time.

Where it REALLY breaks down is that he shuts off emotionally (and sometimes physically) anytime something ""goes wrong"". (He feels sick, or woke up late, or has homework that he doesn't want to do, or has a stressful interaction coming up, etc)
On top of that it's almost always something that is TOTALLY NORMAL FOR ANY PERSON TO DEAL WITH. It makes me feel exasperated when I have to say stuff like ""you probably feel bad because you haven't had anything that wasn't fast food today/drunk any water/worked out in over a month/hung out with friends in a long time/etc./etc./etc."".. The fact that it's every day shit makes it worse to me than fighting over big stuff. Because I'm wasting my time over and over again arguing about stuff that most people stop having to worry about BEFORE twenty. (Or at least I'd hope humanity is generally responsible enough) Or maybe even just stuff that I personally have under control to be more generous.

We have spoken about how he tends to have high levels of anxiety. But, even that is up for debate during the ""stressful times"".(And honestly, arguing with him about whether or not he has anxiety is like being in the damn twilight zone.) He's got free counseling available at the university we attend. That does actually help a lot. But he always ends up in the same place on top of hardly taking advantage of it anyways.

The formula seems to be 
If something isn't going my way, I'm going to ignore it and play videogames and ignore my girlfriend (who all the while is trying to live a life with me) until I realize that I can't get away with not following through on my outside commitments. Then, be super stressed and probably abrasive as hell the entire time that I'm having to play catch up. Then, stay up late and continue to ignore my girlfriend while playing videogames/surfing the internet because now I need to ""destress"" from my completely self inflicted problems. This, of course, means that I don't have any more time left over in the day to keep my commitments to my girlfriend, myself or my living space.

This is his last semester of college. The plan is for me to go back to school this fall. I just worry that I'll be working even more on top of the full time job I already have. I won't have time or energy that I barely have now to remind him to do his dishes, and wake up before noon, and leave the apartment for things other than school or work, and not eat taco Bell 100% of the day and then somehow be low on money for groceries.

He's one of those personalities that for whatever reason doesn't want (I say want  because I've brought his attention to it SO many times and no effort has been made to change it) to listen to anyone he's close to. Me as well as family members. For instance, I can share something that I'm excited about and he'll either tune me out or do the classic half ignore where they just ask you to repeat everything until you give up and leave. (By the way FUCK YOU if you do that shit. It's not like you're getting away with it unnoticed or anything. You're just such a damn potato in that moment that nobody wants to waste even more time on you. Congrats.) Then the fool will come back a week later and try and tell me the same shit like they just found out because it's the top post on reddit or their co-worker told them.

To be fair this isn't all the time. I understand that EVERYONE is flawed and everybody leans on their significant other more than anyone else. And everybody needs fast food sometimes. But, I can't be the person he leans on and ALSO be someone who he disregards or even treats with resentment for reminding him to do basic ass life shit. The good times are good and the bad times aren't fucking worth it at all because they never make sense to me. I'm more than happy to fight for a relationship with him, but not one in which I'm basically his unappreciated mom.

My thing is that I come from a pretty shitty childhood and that has given me an incredible strength and independence. I have to love myself because I can't rely on validation and affirmation coming from the outside. I have to support myself financially. I have to get myself through school. I am a no bullshit work personality type and that certainly rings true in aspects of my own home life as well. (Despite having put up with so much bullshit) I'm very scientific versus him being very artistic.

I also recognize that I am not usually sympathetic over the small stuff even to the point of possibly being aggressive. An example could be he's complaining because he doesn't feel like going to a practice for a club but he's an officer. I get that some people in school used to even have comraderie over their hatred of certain shared responsibilities. But TO ME that translates to ""I'm wasting five minutes of your life to tell you that I made a decision to do something but didn't think about whether I'd ""feel like"" following through with it in the future. Waaaaaaaaaaaah"" So, being with someone who is frankly at least more emotional than I am is difficult for me to understand.

I can get that I may have a skewed perspective on how mature a very stereotypically white guy from a nuclear family should really be at our age. How much longer this can continue with little or no progress being made at some times? I'm nervous that all of the promise of him finally being in control of his whole day after graduation is going to crumble when (I should say if) he doesn't go anywhere so to speak.

I know we're compatible as personalities. I just don't know if we're compatible as adults.

TL;DR   My boyfriend has yet to become a functional adult and lashes out at me if I get involved. I only get involved because some of the things he does/fails to do directly affect me as we live together. I don't want to be dating someone who can't even make commitments to their self, let alone me or anyone/thing that doesn't come directly from a specifically impersonal ""authority figure"". Any actual advice for dealing with what seems to be a maturity gap? I'm not trying to change him into a type A personality. I know and love the man he is when he is  motivated and doing what he loves and having friendships and generally LIVING his life. Even when he is feeling down but can just talk about it instead of zoning out.

EDIT: I feel I must not have been very fair in this explanation. I think we're honestly less attached than some couples who have to text 100% of the time their apart and or anything like that since we live together we're pretty easy on stuff like jealousy and all of those more typical rough spots for relationships these days I guess. My boyfriend isn't a totally incapable tool or anything. He only exhibits these behaviors on some days and sometimes that goes on for a few days. I don't find it acceptable but I do want to distinguish that he is ""normally"" just fine and my best friend and my rock. But even some days of him being like this is still not ideal for me or my well-being let alone his. If I'm being honest I may have complained about some small stuff but it would be easier to ignore if there wasn't so much stuff on such a regular basis."

Since I'm more of a city-person, can't wait to get out of NC for good tbh lol

I applied for 13 school:
• MIT - deferred EA, rejected RD
• Oxford - got my interview, rejected lolll (the interview was HORRIBLE)
• Imperial - unconditional for 4 yr-MEng
• UIUC - accepted EA
• U Manchester - unconditional for 4 yr-MEng
• Georgia Tech - deferred EA, accepted RD
• Penn State - accepted
Still waiting to hear back from ...
• Columbia
• UPenn
• UofT
• UC Berkeley
• UCLA
• UMich - deferred EA

While I would probably hear back from all the schools by Apr. 1 (maybe except UMich and UofT), I would like to consider where to attend for undergrad/grad for Materials Science and Engineering.

In general, in the US and Canada:
• I can make more connections through clubs, etc. And can potentially get a job after graduation
• Math competitions such as Putnam
• Greek life
• Larger campus and more people (more friends options lol)
• GenEd (not a history person at all, so I'd prefer the UK system here)
• Many on and off-campus research internship opportunities

In the UK:
• Fortunately I won't have Trump for president (I'm not a US citizen but I do have a very strong political preference)
• 4 yrs for an MEng instead of 6 yrs in the US (save time &amp; $$$)
• Very focused curriculum
• Fixed schedule (packed w/ lectures and labs) thus not that much free-time
• Difficult to stay in the UK after graduation (though PhD at MIT for Materials sounds amazing, but I'm not sure I want to go into pure academic research)
• Not quite strong in terms of UG research and not a lot of research internship opportunities (PLS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG)
• Easy to travel to Europe (I've been wanting to visit French)

Regarding each college,
• Manchester is the home for graphene - one of my fav materials. But not very strong academically and is located in a very industrial city (ugh)
• Imperial has a high ranking (but not necessarily very recognized in the US to my knowledge) and is located in London. Imperial also has UROP (s/o to imperial!!)
• UIUC - forget about it, I'm not going there
• GT is very strong in engineering; but prob not attending bc of its location
• Penn State is a big school, more like a party school which would be fun to experience; but its location would not be ideal for me personally

Basically, these are just some of my thoughts.
Please give me some advice on this (US or UK? which school? why?). I'll update my upcoming college decisions so I can look at the big picture and decide where I want to attend.

As someone who's been overweight since grade school, I was thoroughly convinced that I was just genetically inclined to be fat.  I've tried to lose weight every few months since my Junior year of high school, but I've never had any success.  I'd maybe lose a few pounds (or no pounds), hate myself, and quit.  This time, though, everything's changed.  I've been doing CICO since Feb 1st, and I'm down 12 pounds with no signs of stopping!

While a lot of this has to do with finally living off campus and being able to cook my own meals, the real change started when I started lurking on this sub.  Learning about TDEE, CICO, and the power of a food scale has literally changed everything.  Thanks to everyone here for all the awesome information and inspiration--never again will I tell myself I'm doomed to be fat.

Looking ahead, I want to be under 200 by mid-May as I'm returning to an internship where non of my coworkers have ever seen me under 210ish.  I can't wait :) "

Hello I've been having this problem since i built my computer. First i noticed when i tried to play Counter Strike, and it just turned off and automatically restarted. Then after that it started happening at randoms times, while playing games like h1z1 and rust. Now this have become very annoying and playing on my computer it starting to be like a daily restart. I've looked at forums and have done many google searches but my problems never seem to dissolve. I guess this is the sacrifice that one must take in order to join the master ace.

I've gone on MSI afterburner and adjusted my fan speed. I saw someone ask to use the Intel HD instead of my gpu, but for some reason my monitor doesn't read the signal so nothing pops up.

I'm not the most confident when it comes to computers, but i'll try as much as I can interns of support for my problem"

The only time I did get a response was a rejection from an interview I got at a career fair at my school from a couple weeks back.

I've had an internship last year and was working in DevOps for a company that uses machines to combat cancer, which I would suppose looks good to potential employers. I also work on projects on my own when I have free-time. I'm scared, however, because I took a heavy load this semester as a senior, and I'm trying to balance these classes with personal projects while keeping a social life so I don't get depressed, all while looking for jobs.

You hear people tell you that you'll be fine and that you've got it easy since CS is such a hot field to be in and that there's nothing to worry about, but I am definitely worrying.

I guess what I'm asking is whether getting 0 contact back from 20 or so applications is normal. It's demoralizing and I hope I'm not the only one."

5zwp08,5,2017-03-17,I think I'm having issues with dismissing my previous accomplishments and feeling like I can't lose weight at this point in my life.,TheEmperorsNewJews,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5zwp08/i_think_im_having_issues_with_dismissing_my/,"I'm finishing or? Freshman year of college and I can't help but feel stuck. The summer before last summer I lost about 35 pounds. I did it incredibly quickly by limiting myself to about 2000 calories a day while burning well over 3000 just lugging around 6'4"" of fat guy. At the end of that summer I weighed 265, which was awesome. Then I got my wisdom teeth out, and had band, and had important tests, and had to apply for college, and had my ""last summer with the family"" full of fun vacations and delicious but bad for me food.

That was then, now here I am weighing 350+ and I really want to lose weight. Since I'm so tall I can kinda pull it off. I can still run, I can still lift weights, I can everything almost fine. But I can feel myself creeping closer to that edge. I'm already obese, probably morbidly so. I go to the gym all the time, I actually like it, but I'm not convinced I can actually lose the weight. 

I was able to loose 35lbs, but to do that I had to make my entire existence logging calories, standing on scales, and eating fucking apples at restaurants. I've always said that I'm convinced I could lose all the weight I wanted if that was the only thing I had to do. But from here on out my life is looking pretty busy, I've got school and summer school and jobs and internships and clubs and I'm fucking scared. I'm scared that I'll never be able to get on that wagon and stay there. I know how to lose weight, and I know compared to lots of people 35lbs isn't much, but I know how I lost it, and I know how too do it again, but I just don't know if I have the time. 

I see people on here that lose all kinds of weight and I can't feel happy for them. I just feel angry because the only thing in my life that sucks even a little bit is my weight, and these people are fighting tooth and nail for every pound and winning, and I'm here picking myself up from last month's attempt to make my meals smaller, when I know damn well that I should be able to to the same thing they do. I'm young and fairly smart and I've got a good scholarship and a lovely girlfriend, out of everyone in the world I should be able to do this the easiest, but I'm stuck.


I don't have a good ending for this, maybe it's just a rant Idk. If you read the whole thing and leave me some advice I guarantee I'll read it.

Thank you for your time."

I applied to a position and had a phone interview two weeks later but found another position in the company that was more suitable so I asked if it is ok to be passed along, he said it's perfectly fine and was happy to send my application to another department. That was at the mid- February, the advert has only gone down after a month which is usual for the company. I am exploring an internship at the moment but this job would be ideal too as it's closer and offers a full salary (keeping options in my pipeline). 

How would I go about asking when interviews are going to be decided and whether I am even a potential candidate? I feel I've waited quite a long time now and I'm starting to lose my patience. I also want to do prior full in-depth research of the company if I get an interview and can do that this weekend if I know there is a chance of me gaining an interview. How would I go about this?"

I've studied programming for about 3 years now (Mostly Java and JavaScript) and feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of at least the basics and concepts. It's important to note that although I have 3 years experience I would say that it's a lot less as it's only on and off college projects and not something that I'm doing day in day out.

A few months ago, I started an Internship in a small software development company that suited me pretty well primarily using Groovy and JavaScript. My problem is that I feel like I'm really far behind everyone else (That includes interns) and everyone seems to have a much better understanding of when to use certain concepts.

An example would be with concepts like inheritance and using it in practice, yes I understand what it is but I've never thought to myself when implementing a solution 'Hey, inheritance would be useful here'. There's also concepts that I never knew existed which when told make everything so much easier, but I want to get to the point where I am the one who is realising that Java has something cool that could be used here and stuff like that. 

I don't know if I've made myself very clear here to be honest and don't know if there's an actual answer besides practice but nonetheless is there something I'm missing or somewhere I can practice this sort of stuff? I can link my github if that would help get an understanding of where I'm at. If I've left out anything important, please just let me know.

5zx4kn,5,2017-03-17,Programming internships?,Psybawr,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/5zx4kn/programming_internships/,"I know the economy is pretty shitty right now for job prospects in general but I'm wondering how common internships are for computer programming?


About a year and a half ago I decided I wanted to get into programming. I've always been interested in learning because I've been doing computer animation and VFX for about 10 years as a hobby [I'm 23 now]. I've just been taking some online courses, working on personal projects, and even doing some small ""automation"" projects for day job. At my day job I've saved the company about 400+ man hours a year because of the little projects I worked on, although on paper my job has nothing to do with programming.



This week they had lay offs and restructuring in my department so it's been reduced to about half the size and they let my manager go and basically dumped all of his responsibilities on me, while of course not giving me a raise or promotion. They also told us just this week that everyone in the organization has to take any extra vacation time by the end of the month(fiscal year) or we lose it without a payout. Even though the current policy manual says otherwise. I'm personally losing about a week of vacation because I can't get my shifts covered on that short notice especially with my new responsibilities. But I am still very grateful to have a job with benefits especially in this economy.


That all said I get the feeling that my department might have even more layoffs coming later in the year or maybe they will drop the department all together. I wasn't planning to actually start hunting for a programming job for another year or so while I take more courses and build more projects. But it seems that my time here might be running out and I'll have to start looking for other opportunities sooner rather than later.


So I'm wondering how hard is it in today's economy to find programming work and/or internships. I've always tried to live as frugally as possible for most of my life so I could afford to work for minimum wage for awhile or maybe even unpaid internships if it meant working in an industry I'm actually passionate about.


Worst case scenerio I end up taking a programming certification at sait and then hope for the best.


**TL;DR:** How hard is it in today's economy to find programming work and/or internships?



Thanks in advance, I know there's a lot of "" the economy sucks"" posts on r/Calgary so I hope this isn't too depressing."

5zxu34,5,2017-03-17,New to RBN and Need Advice,lewisa4,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5zxu34/new_to_rbn_and_need_advice/,"After reading this subreddit for a few months I have realized that both of my parents are probably narcissists. I moved past needing a relationship with my mother when I was in my teens, but for some reason I can't move on from my dad no matter how hard I try. here's a bit of a background  on our relationship:

From a young age he was always over protective of me. Everyone thought he would eventually give that up, but he never did. My mom cheated on him with a family member when I was 10 and that is when he started to trash talk my mom to get me on his side. I was young and I had always been a daddy's girl adn so i was on his side of things. They stayed married for 11 more years. He would get me to find out information about my mom and her affairs. It was always horrible in the house because they both hated each other and I was always their pawn. They thought they were winning if I was on their side. 
Back to my dad though, he for years convinced me that I didn't need friends. So on weekends I would hangout with him only. I rarely spent time with my mom because if I spent too much time he thought I was going to her side and he ""couldn't understand why I would like her after everything she has done"" I would try to explain that she is still my mom but that would never work. It was always that I wasn't spending enough time with him or that I was choosing other people over him. 
He has always been angry. He had a crappy dead end job for most of my childhood and he would come home angry about his life, so I tried everything I could to make him happy. I got striaght A's in school, graduated with a 3.85, rand clubs throughout high school, cleaned the house (because neither of them would do it because it would be unfairly helping the other one) and I cooked my own dinners since I was 8, and started to make his and my lunches when I was 14 up to graduation. Nothing I did would make him happy. I would still get yelled at for only washing the dishes and waiting for them to dry instead of washing and drying them immediately and things like that. 
Then he got let go from his job my junior year of high school. I still had to do everything around the house but now he was on me about everything. He thought that I studied too much and that I must be doing something other than studying and other things about why I wasn't sitting with him watching TV.  He kept saying that he was taking this year off and collecting un-employment because he had worked so hard and my mom deserved to pay some of the bills. But junior year turned into senior year and he still had no job. So I made friends to get out of the house more. I also befriended one of my teachers. I told him about my family, and he let me stay after school to work on projects. Then that led to me puppy sitting for him, even when he was home. And then that lead to inappropriate emails and other things. My dad found out about the emails that my teacher was trying to sleep with me and he got mad at me for talking about the family outside of the family. He never reported my teacher or anything. And to this day he says that this is why he can't trust me. My teacher took advantage of me and all he can do is think about how I talked about him and my mom to someone else. Even when I moved into college he said he was worried because he still couldn't trust me after what happened. 
Fast Forward to college. My dad is still job less (his choice) and so he calls me everyday. When I don't pick up and call him back later I get yelled at for not picking up and saying that I'm busy. So I start to do that but hen one night when I had been studying for a physics 2 final for 6 hours he called me twice and I told him I was studying but he didn't believe and called me again and screamed at me. I tried to stay at school as much as possible, but I ended up dating someone from my home town so I wanted to go home to visit. 
2 years ago we moved  out of my childhood house and my dad went to move in with my uncle ""for the winter"" but he's been there ever since leaching off my uncle. It's a 30 minute drive for me one way so I can't go visit him all the time but when I'm home for the summer or breaks I get phone calls asking ""what are you doing"" since it's not visiting him obviously. And when I say I can't visit because I'm busy he wants a detailed list of what I'm doing. I get internships every semester break that are 40 hours a week so I don't have time after work to make the trip up there and I only have my weekends free which I want to do things that I like not spend all day listening to him talk about the TV he watches. 
He also uses my money against me. He says how I'm rich and hes so poor and I should pay for him. And I tell him I only have money from my intern jobs because I actually work and tried hard to get these jobs. Because four years later he has still yet to apply for a single job. He sits around and complains about his life and when I try to help he does nothing and pushes me away and when I stop trying he yells at me for not being there to support him. he says ""I would walk through fire for you, why wouldn't you do the same for me and support me?"" and I told him because I was his kid and he was the parent and that's not how this is supposed to work and he said ""we're friends though"". And I've tried to sit down with him and talk to him about how he calls me too much (because he has no friends and pushed everyone away and ""wants someone to talk to"") but I just get called a bad uncaring and disrespectful daughter.  He even takes those jabs at me in front of other people when I can't fight back. Like in front of other family or in public. 
There's no talking or explaining anything to him. He even went through my phone when I went to the bathroom during a visit with and yelled at me for drinking alcohol and said yet again how he can't trust me. He says he just wants to be my protector, but I don't feel that way. I feel so smothered and like such a bag of shit every time he calls or I visit. He makes me feel like I can't do anything right, but that's the way it's always been.  But even right now I'm a good kid Like I'm graduating from college with honors in civil engineering and a minor in physics, and I have found myself multiple internships, and I have friends, and a long term boyfriend who is also an engineer. I feel like I have my life together until I visit or talk to him. Then My  successes turn into his doing and my faults are mine alone to bear. 
P.S. there are way more stories that I could talk about, but that's my summary.


For those that didn't feel like reading that all ( I understand) the main question is below:

So I guess what I'm trying to ask, after that long and jumbled story, is I want to go LC or NC but I'm scared. Something keeps holding me back. I start to feel bad because he's depressed, and alone, and old. But then I remember that he doesn't seem to give two shits about me and that he thinks my sole purpose on this earth is to serve his needs. But then I circle back around and think that maybe I'm just a jerk here and I think back on the good times we had and it hurts to think about walking away. So i'm just confused. Is it me that's the problem in all of this? I need any and all advice here. All is welcome and thanks for letting me rant. "

I can't handle the responsibilities and weight that being in this environment brings. I'm behind academically, I don't have that many friends here, I have even fewer I'd say I have things in common with, I don't know what I'm doing this summer while everyone already has jobs and internships in place, I may have to drop some classes because I'm failing, I don't know how to discuss my depression with friends or family because i don't want them being worried for me, I feel homesick and miss my family.

This has been said so many times its a cliche at this point, but I just want to be a kid again and not have these responsibilities. The other day a professor said that at our current age life isn't going to be getting any easier. He didn't say it in a joking matter, but he is right. Nothing going forward will be as simple as it is now, and I can't even handle whats going on now, how am I supposed to handle getting an ACTUAL job, having an interview, doing my taxes, finding a home. I just can't deal with this

and the shittiest thing is is that people my age ARE able to get by and flourish while I'm struggling and drowning in my incompetence and insecurities and inadequacies. Im panicking because i really don't know what to do or how to manage my life

I'm seeking some career advice. Health and wellness is a field that is very interesting and that inspires me. It's my goal to have a career that fulfills me, pays a decent salary, and allows me a good work-life balance (at least in the future. I'm willing to put in the work now for this future later). 

Anyway, the career path that I feel best suits my interest is some sort of management/business capacity combined with the fitness/wellness aspect. I have found one job in particular as a Fitness Manager at Equinox. I've done some research on the company, their brand, customer perception, employee perception, compensation (~$75k)...... I do not have any OFFICIAL personal training experience. Here's what I do have going for me:

* Currently studying for NSCA-CPT

* Had a 2-summer personal training/small business internship with a private client-based fitness center with very credible instructors

* 4-year Business Management Degree with relevant coursework in both business and fitness (minor)

* 23 y/o, 1 year out of college

* Currently department head of Environmental Health and Safety training department at a Fortune 500 company

* Very active in sport and exercise in personal life

* Go-to ""trainer friend"" for fitness advice, only because I've been interested in this field for so long and done my own experimenting and research to further my personal fitness (not that this holds any real merit - just to express that I'm not making a career move out of the blue)

&amp;nbsp;

I know it doesn't really matter what anyone but the employer thinks of all this but I'd like to know what the PT's will think if someone like me steps into the ""Fitness Manager"" role and what do you think my odds are of actually securing a position like this, given what you know about me so far?

If I WERE to get this position, I would walk in very humbly looking to learn as much as I can from the PT's there, as they have been at their profession much longer than me. I would also make it my goal to meet all metrics asked by administration while improving the working conditions of the staff, as I have a basic understanding of their current frustrations according to industry and company research.

If nothing else and I am truly under qualified, what if I work personal training as a side hustle for a couple of years? At that point might I be in a better position to take on a role like this? I believe that shooting higher and raising the bar is a good thing. Maybe I am slightly under qualified but you are only as good as your toughest challenges. I do believe taking on a role like this would be tough but an unparalleled personal learning experience to further my knowledge in this field and my own personal awareness of what I want out of my career. Anyway, I'd like to know that you trainers here think. I'm applying anyway, but I'd like to know how this is perceived. Thanks.


&amp;nbsp;

Also, if there are any other options out there... maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree? Like I said, I want to combine my degree with the health and wellness field. I have a feeling that my personal training ""niche"" will be general fitness... I don't think I have a particular interest in a special population. I know that makes it difficult to pick a single direction. Basically, I want to penetrate the general untrained population and get people active, moving, and involved in their health. We have this huge ""wellness movement"" going on in our country, yet an extremely unfit and untrained population. That's my motivation. So I'm not sure how to target this exactly, but I'm here looking for the next step. I don't want to sit still and wait for things to happen but at the same time I need to make sure the moves I'm making are the ""right"" moves - getting me closer to my goal."

So I tried to sneak in and if I didn't, I catch the streetcar and go home.

SO, two hours before doors opened (doors were 6, show was 7), I went to a 7-11 to buy two cases of water for $6. From there, I get on a bus that leads to the venue. I got off the stop and walked with both cases and I see 4 security guards out for a smoke. I decide to ask them all where I can deliver these waters to because I had to give them to ""Wayne"" (a name I heard in someone's convo on the bus) and they told me the guard at the staff entrance will help me. From there, I ask the same thing to him and he tells me to go around the building to ask someone else because he's only letting staff in, not concert crew. I go to the third security guard and he puts up a little bit of a fight when I deliver my speech.

""Who's Wayne?""

I stutter my words but I go ""He's an associate manager at GoldenVoice, they're sponsoring the show (true) and I'm an intern who had to grab this water (false)""

""Can you give him a call to see where you can meet him?""

I thought I was done for. I tell him my phone died and he gave me his. It's game over in my mind. The first number I think of is my mom's cell number so I call that and pretend that it's Wayne. I'm going ""where are you?"" and she's on the other line like ""what the hell are you doing, where are you calling from?"" I quickly end the conversation and tell that security guard I was to meet him where the fans were lining up. I give my mom a call on my actual phone to apologize and tell her what's going on. She sighs and tells me to be careful and to try not to get arrested. In my head, I think it's game over though and I was ready to just grab a bottle of water, leave them on the sidewalk and head home. 

But, I see a security guard by the dumpsters, this old man just sitting on a chair, so I walk to him and was about to deliver my speech for a fourth time, but before I open my mouth, he just lets me in. I thank him, and now I'm backstage. 

I'm shocked that this worked. Now that I'm actually in, I'm scared that another guard will stop me and will catch on, but I walk through the venue and pass at least 20 security guards and not a word from any of them. I even ask one where I can get across the stage to, and she leads me there. I climb the stage to offer some of the roadies water because my arms are beyond exhausted at this point. They take a case and thank me. I walk out of the backstage area into the main floor and from there, I hide in a bathroom stall for almost 2 hours with a case of water in my lap. I did it. But now, I wanted to get on the floor.

I left the stall about 5 minutes before Beartooth took the stage to see the area. I realized that people with floor tickets had a pink wristband while others who had seated tickets didn't. There were more guards that were at the floor to check for these wristbands. I see a guard who is the smallest and the least intimidating of them all (a skinny 5'10 guy vs the giant 6'6 guys that were scattered on the floor). When the lights drop, I make a b-line down the stairs onto the floor where the smaller guard is and he asks me for the wristband. Among all the screaming fans, I told him I was crew and I needed to go across the floor and he just let me through like that. I gave all the water away to the people on the floor, hid near the front, and had an incredible time seeing 3 bands that I love. Never thought in a million years I could pull that off, but I'm shocked that I got in with $6 of water vs. a $68 ticket."

I'm a university student in his late 20s who lives with his parents. (I know, I know. I need to move out. I'm not in a financial position to do so at the moment, however, and I had some problems in my early 20s that set me back quite a bit.) I have two jobs, I'm in school full time, and I'm an active member at my university. I'm fighting hard for my independence and to do good in the world.

This focus of this post is my father's remarks. We talk about finances frequently and each time we do so he confidently reminds me that I won't be able to make it on my own. At the end of next year, I'll have a degree in Philosophy, a Master's in Computer Science (Cyber Security), and one (possibly two) internships under my belt. Once I graduate and find work, I want to move out. 

I have expressed the idea of moving out to my father but he paints this ""that's unrealistic"" picture by employing a variety of falsehoods and scare-tactics. Sometimes it's done passively, sometimes more direct. His reasoning is multifactorial: he says I won't be making enough money; I'm not smart enough because I've never lived in ""the real world""; that it's dangerous because the government is going to tax me to death; and he tries to convince me that continuing to live with the family is better.  

In truth, I hate living with my family. They don't understand boundaries, they're disrespectful, they're loud and nosey, and they don't work as a team. I can't even go out with friends for a night without being interrogated; ""Where are *you* going?"" ""Oh, you're hanging out with your friends? Do your friends have names?"" ""What time are you going to be back? *What do you mean you don't know?*"" I just want to be able to function like a normal human being without being interrogated/put down for it. 

I'm just trying to make sense of my father's agenda, if I can call it that. Millions of people live on their own making less money and they're doing just fine, but he swears that they're really not doing fine at all, because they're in debt. No matter what compelling arguments I respond with, he assures me that I'm just ignorant of how ""the real world works."" Normally I just ignore him, but I'm worried that prolonged exposure to his bullshit will corrupt me in some way; in fact, it already has. I get down on myself often and comments like these are why. 

Why is my father doing this? Is there a name for it? How can I combat it? How should I respond to him? I'll have to put up with this for a while longer, and I'm scared that it's going to do me more damage, that it's going to erase the little confidence that I have left in my self. 

I want to be seen as a somewhat intelligent and autonomous adult; someone who is capable of making his own choices, but some of my family members are trying to overturn this. What can I do about it?

I am looking to build a PC workstation for finishing or reviewing projects at home (if company policies allow). I know I will probably be assigned a laptop but I am looking to build a more powerful desktop so I can multitask better.

5zzyu4,9,2017-03-17,[CAN] - Resume Critique,Mightysaugan,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5zzyu4/can_resume_critique/,"Hello everybody!

Background: Just a bit of background first, I am a third year student in a university in Ontario without a co-op program. Currently have a 3.7 GPA overall, also have a past internship at a provincial ministry in their controllership department. As for ECs, have done well in a couple of case comps (not accounting related) and one decent leadership experience on-campus. 

3rd year Internship : Have applied to 50+ places for internships, and have got interviews at a major reinsurance firm, mid-sized accounting firm, European pharma and at a Canadian utility, but have not received any offers so far. Have been getting a bit worried lately about finding a relevant internship for this summer. I have also started sending out emails to small accounting firms in the GTA.

Full-Time: Focus for next year is to aim for B4 audit (have been to campus networking events, so this is not a last minute thing) or rotational programs offered by the Canadian telecoms (Bell, Rogers, Telus) and Walmart (they don't recruit too many people from my university - so might be tough to get an interview) which are CPA approved. 

Would really appreciate any sort of advice or career related tips. 

Thanks!

One for UPS, package process management intern that will be for a year and then a full time offer chance.

And another for operations planning and analysis for the MTA in New York city grand central. Only for the summer as far as I am concerned so far.

I really would like to know what would be the better option is?

Backstory/context: I live in a fairly small town in central Calfornia, and have lived here for my entire 19-year existence. I've wanted to leave home and live in a new setting/perspective for a while now (~2 years), but haven't had the opportunity until now. I'm tired of this area, as much as I love it, it's just that I've seen every square inch of the place, it all feels stale and old. Life is boring at the moment, and I want a fresh experience and outlook on life. 

I'm a second year at a community college majoring in Criminal Justice (interested in a career in law enforcement) and applied to a few universities across California, with one especially being a top, much desired choice. That school has yet to get back to me, and I'm still quite unsure if I will even be accepted. Either way I could apply again next fall. 

The other side of this fiasco is that I recently got a job offer with a program in my hometown that I'd really like to work for (good pay, would look great on a resume for a law enforcement job in the future). I'll describe it as a sort of internship with an a Police Department, which I think would be great experience as well if I were to take that route for my career. The program wants to know if I'm going to take the job within the next week, and my top choice school isn't going to get back to me for another two weeks.

If I do take the job and stay in my boring hometown, I will make decent money for the year and be able to reapply for university next fall. Otherwise I can reject the job offer and take the gamble that I get into my dream school this year.


TLDR: I got a good job offer in my hometown that I no longer wish to live in. Still waiting to hear back from my dream school. Need to make a choice soon because the job wants to know if I'm taking it sometime this week, while the school won't get back to me for another two weeks.

Thanks for any responses, any input helps a lot. This decision has been stressing me out quite a bit lately.

USA; ideally around $600-$700.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Top priority is durability.  Second is weight. Speed an specs are third. Fourth priority is privacy and security. I rarely use my 2-1 now but it would be nice.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Pretty important. It doesn't have to be ultra light-weight but I don't want something that is a hassle to lug around, it will be in a backpack throughout the day. I love how light my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro is but I would be okay with something heavier if it meant it had better performance/durability. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows, but Linux seems really fascinating. It's not a deal breaker but I would like to option to one day give it a try.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13.3 at the smallest. I could go smaller if absolutely necessary but I would really prefer something a larger, this functions as my TV half the time.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Not really. Just Bloomberg Anywhere and other finance/business applications in the future. Right now just basics like Netflix, Microsoft Office, internet browsing ect.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
If I could run Civ V or Civ VI I would be pumped but it's not really a factor in my decision. 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Durability and build quality is important. I would prefer a touch screen.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I will bring this everywhere with me; I am constantly on the go. I am a college student so Microsoft Office, Netflix and internet will be 90% of its use. I want this to last my last 2 years of college, possibly into my professional life. I would like to avoid buying a new one after graduation but IDK what my future employer's demands will be so this might not be a huge concern. If trying to factor that in makes this too complicated then fuck it. Hell, who knows what will be considered secure and strong enough for business/finance stuff in 3 years. Ideally I would like something with strong privacy but with the USA's surveillance I don't know if that is even possible. I would like something secure enough to handle things that may be confidential in internships. I'll make a table to clarify all of this info.

Top Priorities| High Priorities| Wanted but not a dealbreaker
:--|:--|:--
Durability, reliability, not heavy and at least kind of easy to carry, Specs, Speed| Security and Privacy| Will be able to handle business applications, nice screen for Netflix, touch screen, Graphics, Civ V

So far, I've focused on mainly computer science classes and so I was looking to get another computer science internship like I did last year. However, because I didn't want to stress myself out by applying to a lot of internships around this time like last year, I applied to a bunch of internship positions around December/January.

Unfortunately, this has led me to a situation that I'm not exactly sure how I should go forward with, and would like some advice in.

--

I currently have an offer on the table. However, because I don't have access to a car, I am limited to public transportation, and as a result it's going to be a 2.5-3hr commute one way from my house to the location of the internship instead of a .45-1hr commute by car. The offer letter has stated to respond by March 20th, which is the root cause of most of my issues.

My #1 choice, which is only a 45 minute commute via public transportation, has not gotten back to me with an offer or anything. However, I have asked them to please give me an update by the 20th (as they said to do in their application confirmation letter) which they said they would try to do but it is not guaranteed, and am hoping that I get an offer letter from them sometime over the weekend (not likely) or on the 20th. 

I also have a position that I am currently in the technical test portion of. However, judging from reading the instructions alone, I don't have the current knowledge to do most of it, but I do think that if I work really hard over the time I'm given and Google a lot of stuff, I should be able to finish at least half of it.

--

I've pretty much given up on anyone else contacting me about an internship, as it's been quite a while since my application date. Also, when trying to figure out what I should do, I'm trying to play it safe and assume that my #1 choice would not extend me the offer by the 20th, even though I really hope they do. 

So, I have been contemplating a lot of things, like should I take the first offer? Should I decline it and just work 24/7 on the technical test and pray that I finish enough to be offered a position? Should I just give up on my current stuff and start another desperation burst of spreading my resume to every single internship position there is? 

If anyone could give some advice as to what I should do, it would be appreciated!"

After countless of days and months trying to find a right internship something related with my studies its slowly fading away. Hurts like hell.

Yes, money is the problem. Family won't even fund me, especially my parents. Tried to convince them as much as I can but still I couldn't do so.

Tried everything to get the funding but still no luck. Working part time at a restaurant and I even tried selling some of my old stuff but still no luck! Even tried doing those paid surveys online and anything from /r/beermoney

I really want this internship but I can't, what should I do?! So frickin stressed out with little time left. Should I just forget about it, which I will regret for the rest of my life or just keep on going with it? Help me!"
6027om,9,2017-03-17,My colleague/teacher took her life this week.,miosgoldenchance,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6027om/my_colleagueteacher_took_her_life_this_week/,"I've never posted here before, but I thought this was the right place.

I am a veterinary student. They warn you during orientation that mental illness is rampant in the field and that vets are much more likely to commit suicide than other professions. The school and the national veterinary governing body are taking active measures to try to prevent this.

We talk about it all the time, both in school and in any clinic I intern at - mental health awareness, that you will lose someone every few years.

I'm in my second year, and this week was the first time I've experienced this. A vet resident is someone who has graduated vet school but enters a 3 year program to specialize in a certain field, which also involves a teaching capacity. Residents are teachers, but also students.

She taught us. I didn't know her on a personal level, but I have had many academic conversations with her. The class was very poorly designed (by her superior, not her) and we were often frustrated, which I think she was very well aware of. I don't blame myself or my classmates, but it's hard not to wonder if it would be different if we had been kinder or more patient.

I heard that she had taken her life through the rumor mill - I hoped it was just a stupid rumor, but an e-mail from the dean confirmed it. I have learned far more about her since her death than I knew when she was alive. She had a dog and a beautiful horse - which hits me hard as a fellow horse owner.

I don't really know what to feel, or what to say. I have struggled with depression myself and been through moments of crisis, so I feel that I understand a bit more than my classmates who have not struggled with mental health. Everyone has their own way to grieve, but while my classmates share links to articles about mental health in vet med, it seems very superficial to me.

I feel very strange mourning her. I didn't know her on a personal level. If it were me, I wouldn't want big gestures from people I didn't know well. But she was kind and intelligent and passionate. Her suicide is a loss to us all, but for me it also represents the classmates and colleagues I will lose in the future. I see myself and my classmates, everyone I know in the profession, in her.

Unlike my classmates, I don't see it as something so simple as posting a facebook status about ""if you're feeling down, send me a message!"". I don't believe the cure to mental health issues is that easy. I don't like that my community is trying to turn her into an icon for suicide awareness. We have no idea what her life was like or where she was coming from, so saying that she could've avoided suicide just by sending a facebook message seems incredibly insulting.

I've rambled too long. I don't know what my feelings are. I respect that everyone has different methods of grieving. I don't know that I even really have a right to grieve her, we weren't friends. I don't know if I'm grieving her or if I'm grieving the realization that this is the first suicide of many that I'll see in my career.

I don't really want advice, to be told that no one is to blame or that you're sorry my loss (because I don't feel that I knew her personally enough to count it as ""my"" loss) or whatever. I don't really know why I'm posting this honestly. I guess I just needed to write about it."

I wanted some more experience before I graduate, as well as some savings for moving, so I got an internship at a startup in town. They give me more or less full-time work, and treat me like a new grad, rather than as an intern, which I like. The work is interesting, and the culture is great.

However, I accepted an offer which I greatly prefer over the startup, a bit before I joined. I never told them that I wanted a conversion to full time, but my boss and team lead, and the seniors are talking as if I'm going to convert to full time (and it seems the process is more or less that I can be full time whenever. There's no official offer).

I'm not sure what to do when I graduate, because my job doesn't start until mid-August, but I graduate in May. I don't want to burn bridges by going full-time, and then leaving in 2-3 months, but at the same time, I want more experience, and I want to help the startup. 

What's the best thing to do to not burn bridges?
I am definitely going to my offer I already accepted, I just don't know how to handle the startup after I graduate.

Edit: My fear is that if I put them on my resume, they will badmouth me if I handle this incorrectly. I definitely want them on my resume, as I'm doing production level work in a language I really enjoy."

Being in college makes getting free time to go on a trip pretty tough.  There's only a handful of different periods over the course of a year that has enough time to travel, especially since we both have jobs over the summer.  I'd love to travel with her, but she's planned trips with other friends, family, and school months in advance, every time.  I'm not upset about her taking any of these individual trips without me, and wouldn't expect her to cancel them.  But I'm getting really frustrated that at some point she doesn't seem to think about leaving one of those breaks open to go somewhere with me.  Last spring break was a family trip, christmas break was 2 trips out of the state with friends and 1 out of the state with family, this spring break was to the other side of the globe for an optional school trip.  None of the trips are unreasonable at all, but man, they're starting to stack up.  We have 1 week between the end of school and the start of our internships apart in different cities, but of course there's already a trip planned for one of her female friend's 21st birthdays.  I'm just frustrated and feel like I'm being put on the back burner.  Is this something worth bringing up, or am I just being jealous? I feel like the easy solution is to plan a trip super far in advance, but I'm butthurt that I need to plan ahead to the end of summer for a trip.  


The 8 hour time difference between us this spring break since she's across the country has been strange, and she can only text me when she's at the hotel with wifi.  I'll have messages show up as ""delivered"" (aka, she's gotten back and has wifi), but don't hear from her for hours.  Or she'll get in and just say she's exhausted and that she's going to bed.  And I trust her totally.  I'm not concerned about cheating or going off and doing crazy stuff when I'm not there.  I just am not getting the feeling that she's as excited to tell me all about her day as I would be.  I'm checking my phone nonstop so I don't miss the small window of opportunity we have to chat, and to get nothing in return hurts.  I don't want to get in the way of her having fun, but it would be nice to have her put a bit of time aside to chat with me.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm frustrated that every break from school my girlfriend is taking trips without me.  I'm upset that she doesn't think about trying to squeeze in a trip with me after being gone break after break.  Also a bit of venting at the end about her being out of touch while she's gone and wishing she would put more effort in to talk with me.  I'm really trying not to be the boyfriend stopping her from having fun, but I'm actually starting to feel left out with by own girlfriend.  "

I am nineteen and a junior in college. I was able to graduate high school a year early which I thought was a good idea at the time. However, I was not accepted into any colleges besides the one I am currently attending because the college recruiters could not accept someone who applied with only sophomore classes ( you apply in fall of senior year which for me was my third year ).

With the scores I received from the AP tests I took I was able to get a total of 26 credit hours, with 12 counting towards my major. I applied to some summer internships my first year however I did not apply to many because I wanted to stay at home with my family and I was still 18.  I was declined from all of them with no interview. Despite not being accepted by any company the first year, I tried applying for summer internships for summer 2017 and was not able to receive any interview or job offers. I am taking senior level(4000+) computer science courses my fourth semester at college. I have 47 credit hours left with 20 of those university core (intro to phil etc.). So the question I propose is simple, should I graduate early and take summer courses and try my luck at getting a newly grad job or delay graduation until I am able to receive an internship.?

TLDR; Graduating high school early was an awful decision. Should I graduate college early and apply for newly graduate jobs or delay graduation until I am able to receive an internship."

This has been a pretty bad week for me. I got waitlisted at 3 schools (UCLA, Caltech, and Georgia Tech) and rejected from 1 (MIT). I was surprised that I actually didn’t get flat-out rejected from Caltech, but I’m also surprised that I didn’t get into UCLA. 

I got into my safeties (found out in February) but thought that I would get into at least one school this month — but I didn’t. And it only gets harder from here. The only schools are left for me are CMU, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, and Berkeley, and after the rejections/waitlists this week, I feel that my chances of getting into them are even lower. 

In middle school, I basically got straight B’s and C’s, but when I finally found my motivation in High School, I managed to turn that around. Now though, it seems that I could’ve done way less and gotten lower grades (and spent more time just having fun), and still gotten into the same schools that I already have. Despite being in two extremely toxic friendships for over 3 years, I still tried my best to get good grades. It feels bad knowing that everyone around you is going to top-tier schools and Ivies, and you just continously get rejected time after time even though you have similar stats and ECs. Even if I get into Carnegie Mellon or Cornell, I probably can’t go due to how much they cost (got into UIUC, but can’t go either because it’s just so expensive for OOS). So this month is basically just a feelsbadman moment continuously stretched out over 31 days. 

Right now, I don’t have the motivation to actually do anything at school anymore. I still write and study fun topics in my free time, but my passion has disappeared . I’m really curious on what to do now since I expect the next two weeks to be pretty terrible for me. To top it all off, my parents tried to console me by walking into my room the other day and telling me that they never expected much of me in the first place.


**TLDR:** Grades and school performance completely sucked in Middle School, improved myself in High School and thought I had a chance, but probably headed towards an entire month of rejection/waitlist letters. Also have regret not applying to more schools (shotgun method rip). 


**Stats** (since you guys like stats so much):

603dnt,141,2017-03-18,Quick tips when applying so you don't get Cold Rejected,Yin-Hei,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/603dnt/quick_tips_when_applying_so_you_dont_get_cold/,"If you want a high chance of securing an interview, make sure you apply through a *dedicated* stream. The interview game isn't as transparent as some might think.

General tips:

* Never apply for a job that's been posted for months old.
* Scout the company's code and networking events.
* When applying online, make sure it's specific and *referred*.
* Manage your applications in some excel sheet or txt file.
* Use well-known 3rd party sites (Linkedin, Piazza).

Examples:

* Google: Codejam, G-Games, I/O
* FB: When your position reads ""SWE_ NG_{your_uni_name_here} ({semester_here} {year_here})""
* Chase: Code for Good

When you network with these companies, let's say a career fair, most recruiters will hand you a custom application link, referral code, name, and/or email. These have a very good chance at responding, especially if you get a referral email or link.

Use third party sites to passively farm connections. 

Examples: 

* Linkedin: Might fetch a good opportunity depending on your profile. 
* Piazza: Careers has a calendar with some good companies holding networking events. And an inbox.
* GitHub: Pimp up your profile with open source contributions and notable projects.
* Kaggle: If you're a data scientist, this is highly recommended.
* StackOverflow: Probably overkill. Few companies ask for this, most don't. If they do, you've got this. Same with Quora.

And for the banks: something something technology analyst something something program 2017. Common abbreviations are TAP, TDP, TLP, etc. 

Some companies offer a ""tour"" when really it's a ~~free job hookup~~ networking event. ~~Also when applying for an internship make sure you never say you are advanced in seniority, i.e., don't say you are a junior when you are on your second year, even if you have the credits. Or when you don't have enough credits to advance. Further away from being a senior the better for interns.~~

If you're a woman, attend those women-targeted events.

Attend hackathons w/ sponsors, some fortune 250s may show up.

Then those random events that show up once on a full moon. Get notified by the university's connections somehow (by email or, the worst, poster boards). 

That's all I can think of for now. Going to sleep. gl

**EDIT:**

Woke up. For internships, junior status is definitely good, but it is also generally good to start looking before then. Make sure you're in a targeted audience when applying for internship/full-time, it is denoted by ""graduating in or after 201x"".

Quotas. Most companies hire on a rolling basis, and this typically starts when they post or update their app page. Sooner the better - you don't want to get suddenly cut short.

Some companies may ask for certifications, professional licenses, and/or boot camps. Not really a necessity but a bonus and fills up the empty spots in Linkedin if they bother you so.

Examples:

* Udacity
* Coursera
* IEEE, Cisco: This one's really good to have if you're into computer networking.

Coding competitions. These are different from hackathons. Good to get your name out there. You might get called out if you do well enough or compete often enough. Also helps your DS&amp;A/problem solving abilities.

Examples:

* ACM-ICPC
* Google stuff
* Hackerrank, Leetcode, Topcoder

Professors/Industrial professors have some leeway into companies, especially the ones they currently or used to work for. Do well and get to know them, they may provide a recommendation."

So, the state took my sisters and gave them to the custody of my grandparents. 1 of my brothers is severely autistic and cant talk, and communicate. my other brother has ADD, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and anger problems and etc.
I grew up with rats in our house, we had to change out of our school clothes to get into our play clothes when i was a kid. there was barely food sometimes, not because they were starving us but because we didnt really have any food in the house because we were kinda broke i guess but we did have houses before. And, my brother would attack my other one (the severely autistic one would attack my anger problems brother) because, hes autistic i guess he was always mad. and the always mad one was just born always mad. i'll name the autistic brother (a) and the brother with anger issues (t). My mom worked alot when i was a kid, my dad was a drunk, my parents fought my entire life growing up. Sometimes having guns around us. Cops always visited our house. My dad wasnt around when i was born from my birth to 3-4 months old. He was in Oregon county jail for domestic violence against my mother. hes beaten her before all of my siblings were born and she miscarried she told me. (t) would hit me as a kid, he had anger issues so my parents would say ""we will have his medication changed"" etc etc. one time i went home to play the v tech game we had and it was the video game ""cars"" and it was a racing game ig. and my brother said no to me playing because its a boys game so i was like fine ig. and i say down in the door way of the living room and hand my hands on my chin and i laid on my stomach, and he got mad because ig he was losing in the game i think and he ran up to me and kicked my face like it was a soccer ball.
(t) once also, filled a sock with rocks from our fireplace and hit me over the head repeatedly for no reason.
one time, i got mad because my brother wanted to put something behind the wheels of our car and i got mad at him and i opened the sliding door to our car and he hit his head and had to get stitches.
one time, me and my brother (t) jumped our fence of our house, and were like 4-5 i think years old. and he wanted me to slide on the slanted fridges and i said no. and he convinced me to, and i was a very anxious kid you know? i was like no dude. but i ended up sliding down them like a slid and the first time i slid down i cut my leg open and had to get stitches.
our family moved motel to hotel to hotel to motel for 3-4-6 months maybe. then we moved again to a place when i was 8. and have lived here since i was 8 years old, then immediately put me into counseling here.
i didnt open up for the first 6-7 years until literally last year.
My parents are very emotionally and mentally and psychologically abusive and its gotten to the point where i am almost brainwashed i think its called.
When i talk they talk over me, or they question me or they dont care and say im lying..
my parents told me as a kid if i say anything to CPS i wold never say my parents again or see my dad or my mom again and that scared me to not open up i guess ah 
so of course i think its why i didnt open up to my counselor that much for 6-7 years. ive had 6-7 counselor, one every year, except the last one was a real counselor and not like a intern one i think and i had them as a counselor for 2-3 years and she left 2 weeks ago or something and my new one is a real counselor so i wont have to get a new one in a year ah and ive met her and only had 1-2 counseling meetings with her already ah 
and my dad would distract CPS by talking about how he was in the war, and say how his parents were never around when he was a kid a kid and that would distract the CPS social workers or the cops so that the social workers wouldnt take me 
also my mom would cry and get mad when i said id report the abuse to my counselor so that(t) would get taken away when i do and my mom cried because she didnt want to lose (a) but didnt care if i left when i said i would leave first she didnt care i said ""and im taking (a) with me because he doesnt deserve this)"" and my mom flipped out and got mad at me and cried alot and said ""youre not taking my son"" and im like ok but i dont matter, even though shes been letting (t) hit (a) all the time these past months ah. 
one time i talked to my counselor about a sexual assault between someone and me and she called CPS. and CPS showed up and my dad talked to them and i felt scared, and he goes back in the house there was a cop and a social worker. then someone in my house said in the kitchen ""no i dont want to talk to you anymore and i wont if youre going to lie like that"" at the time they sexually assaulted me they was drunk though. and i said i didnt do anything so he held my wrist and made me walk outside and said ""tell them the truth"" and the cop and the social worker tried to talk to them to calm them down.
one time i was fighting with my dad, no yelling or hitting just was upset at him, i went to get something to drink in the fridge and (t) pulled me down by my hair and started to kick me over and over and over again.
and then my dad said no to me when i said i was going to call the cops on him. then i soon did call the cops, and my dad said thats how brothers and sisters fight. and then said to (t) to run so they dont get arrested. then dad said to me, ""youre not going to lock my son up""
then (t) never got arrested that night.
one time (t) locked me in our room back when we shared a room, and he beat me with a wooden clarinet over and over and my parents didnt even try to go in to stop it.
ive seen (t) stab my dad repeatedly 15 times in the leg with a knife and he got out of jail the next day and they forgave him.
hes 18, turning 19 this year soon and still lives here.
late last year i was getting anxious more and was always yelling at my dad, after all the abuse in the house from my siblings to me, to my dad and my siblings to my parents fighting in front of us, i started to kinda lash out i guess. and my dad would call the cops on me when i had a attitude. and was in the hospital 5 times in october last year for suicidal ideation, i was self harmed by cutting for 3-4ish years. i stopped late last year. and i started to hit myself and leave bruises late last year. i went into a psychiatric hospital in october last year and when i got out i was doing ok for 3-4 weeks then i crashed and ended up how i was before, always angry like before.
i was in family counseling before i was in and out of the hospital and before i was in the psychiatric hospital.
every psychiatrist meeting was ""how can sky calm down and not be mad""
""how can sky de escalate from a fight with you guys""
i had 3 safety plans in the months i was in and out of the hospital, when i was in the psychiatric hospital for a week, and for when i was in family counseling, 2 from the family counselor and one from a social worker in the hospital from when i was suicidal and didnt want to go home and threaten to kill myself when i got home. no one followed the safety plans and my family used it as a way to justify them hitting me or angering me to the cops. i almost went to jail because my dad said i hit him and i was 5'1 110 pounds at the time, i wasnt eating. i was always mad. hes 6'3 and 220+ pounds idk man. and the cops almost put me in jail for domestic violence for ""hitting my mom and my dad"" my dad also said i threw the home phone and my dad said i almost hit (a).
recently, i asked for help to clean my room and my dad was helping me, then he said he wishes he doesnt have another kid, then said i was a mistake and how i was a abortion that failed or something, then said his brother touches little kids and how i was fucking homeless guys (i dont know why he says that tbh im not having sex with anyone and i stayed in my room 99% of the time for months and weeks at a time without leaving my room only to go to my counseling meetings). then he ripped half my carpet up and threatened to tell my grandparents and ended up calling my grandpa (idk why he used grandpa as a excuse tbh ah) and then i told him and my grandpa already knows how fucked up my dad is because my dad has done cocaine, and meth growing up and was already fucked up from the drugs. my dad lied about being in the war, was on the USS nimitz, but never sailed anywhere i think, he has a expeditionary medal, but idk if even got it from that.. he said he jumped out of planes and into the water at night or something, he said he killed people, he said hes been to Thailand and china, and etc. and my grandpa says he was only on the ship for 1-2 years and the ship sailed to canda and then he left the ship. so dad lied about that. then grandpa said ""his cheese is way off his cracker"" about my dad last week.
my dad then said, ""i called grandpa and said i wanted him to know how you are when youre blowing up"" tbh, i never yelled or cried or got mad at him when he ripped up half my carpet in my room i let him do it. when he was saying horrible thing about me i let him say it.
my dad thinks im a whore, im having sex with people when im not, idk how he has that image in his head. my dad said i was ""yummy"" 
once. my dad has done alot of stuff. and etc.
my parents forgave (t) for all this abuse and (t) stabbing my dad and (t) hitting me and (t) abusing (a) alot and stuff but hate me and want me to pay rent even though im not 18 yet and want me gone when i turn 18 and how they cant wait until 18 to leave and they dont want me to talk to them anymore when i leave and how i was a, in my dads words, ""failure to launch"" i guess even though im to young to launch abd make myself into what i want to be ah 
theres alot to say more about my family and my life but i rather keep it at there i guess. thanks for reading. hope you guys have a good day/night ah."
603y1z,0,2017-03-18,UIUC (ee) or UCLA (me) engineering???,iwanta36,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/603y1z/uiuc_ee_or_ucla_me_engineering/,"Up until yesterday, I was set on going to UIUC for electrical engineering. But when I received my acceptance from UCLA, I am a bit conflicted now. If I ignore all the costs involved, I would choose UIUC in a heartbeat. However I am a CA resident, so paying the out-of-state tuition for UIUC is a problem for me. And also due to some financial issues, my family can only pay for the housing and a little bit of the tuition. So that means that it is up to me to pay for most of the tuition.

BUT...the problem is that I applied to UCLA as materials engineering major, which at that time, I had no idea what it was. I looked more into it and was turned off by it, but I have heard that changing majors within the engineering department is fairly easy as long as you study hard?

Another thing is that as I read more deeply into this thread, UIUC is a bit stingy on giving grants or aids or scholarships? Unfortunately, I haven't received any scholarships and only received 5K in aid. BUT!!! UIUC has that name recognition in the area of double e, and I have heard that there are a lot of start-up companies or big companies recruiting engineers, so is it possible for me to land an internship or a job and make some money to pay for my college? I know making this decision is an investment, and I just want to know that I will be able to secure a job that will cover my costs for college.

I haven't really researched UCLA in depth, so I have no idea about how generous they are with scholarships, nor with any job opportunities...

Sorry for contradicting myself so much...

Fellow UIUC reddits!!! PLeASE HELP MEEE:)

tl;dr: 26K with high chance of landing a job? or 13K with idk if I will secure a job?"

1)I've been applying to internships lately but they are all software engineering and web development internships. While I don't mind coding and earning this experience for my resume, how beneficial is this for my goal?

2) On the same topic, I have yet to see a internship related to security whether it be network, mobile, or app. Where can I find internships related to this?

3) Say I change my mind later down the road about getting into netsec, with this degree can I still get into software engineering jobs if my resume shows projects that show my coding skills?

6041fb,9357,2017-03-18,TIFU by forgetting I'm not in Finland.,metalskill,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6041fb/tifu_by_forgetting_im_not_in_finland/,"So, as usually, this fuck up didn't happen today, it was yesterday. I'm an film school student, working as an intern in Slovakia. Yesterday I was supposed to be at the studio at 5pm so as usually, I took a bus to the centre at 4.20pm and went for a lunch before hitting it up to the studio.

There is this fancy eat-all-you-can type of buffet restaurant in a shopping center. It's my restaurant of chose, when it comes to filling your stomach quickly. So, I finish eating, check the clock and realize I'm almost late from work.

From here starts the chain of unfortunate events. Yesterday was a laundry day. Instead of having a nice clean suit on me, I was rocking cargo pants, hoodie and a cap. I also had a pair of sunglasses on me and as I was in hurry, I put them on. I raise from the table, ""shout"" thanks to the restaurant, put on my earplugs and tune in some lovely Finnish death metal on max volume.

From there I start to walk fast and later on it transforms into full-on running trough the shopping centre. I was only a couple of meters away from the exit when a large mall guard craps me from my shoulder and then proceeds to drag me from my hoodie.

At this point I was really confused and quite upset about the fact that a large man is destroying my clothes. I go full aikido on him and on the process of destroying his hand it clicks on me. I HADN'T PAID FOR THE DINNER! Now, I don't know how it is in your country, but in Finland you have to pay for your buffet before you get to eat anything.

So there I am. Terrified in the middle of a fully crowded shopping centre, suspect of a shoplift and assault on a guard. I raise my hands up in the air and go something along the line ""Sir, I am so sorry, I was in hurry and I completely forgot to pay"". Now of course, this guy didn't understand a single word from the sentence and back we went to the restaurant ( this time he was only dragging me from my hand, rather than my hoodie ). The guard had a discussion with the restaurant owner in Slovakian language and then the owner just simply shakes his head. I tried to explain myself but nobody spoke any english.

The guard escorts me to a side room with a chair and a table and leaves me there. At this point I'm starting to grow a bit tired of the whole situation and laugh to myself because this kind of stuff only happens in the movies. I start to text my friends about the situation and run out of battery in a couple of minutes. Gladly there was a clock on the wall and I could tell the time. At around 17.35 a pair of police officers come to the room and GLADLY one of them speaks fluent english.

Indeed I was suspected from a shoplift and I was to pay for the charges. I explained how I've been in this restaurant many times and I've paid for my lunch each and every time with no problem. At this point the officer looks at me like I'm an idiot and asks me not to lie to him. The guard had told them that none of the staff had recognized me and that's the reason why I am in custody. I explained to them how on all the previous visits I had probably been wearing a suit. I also told them how I was in hurry and had to run to be able to make it in time and the fact that in Finland we have to pay first. Then the cops ask why I didn't respond to the guard tailing me and shouting to me. I felt like an idiot and that I will never get away with this, but I answered with the truth. I had my earplugs blasting music on full volume so I didn't hear anything.

The cops finally accept the fact that it was all a big mistake. We go to the restaurant and the cops ask the owner if he recognizes me with a suit and then apparently he remembers me and says ""sorry, sorry"" and something in Slovakia. The police translates it to me, saying that the owner was sorry for the whole thing ( wasted time and the guard dragging me from my hoodie ) and said that I didn't have to pay for the lunch. I refused the offer, paid and left the shopping centre, calmly walking, without the earplugs or sunglasses.

I arrived to the studio an hour late and everyone was relieved to see me. They had tried calling me countless of times and they were afraid that I had been kidnapped or something, because during the 4 weeks I've been in here, I've never been late before. They had even called the police on me...

EDIT: People seem to be quite worried about my ears and the fact that I might not be aware of the permanent damage it causes to blast music on too loud. I stated that I had my earplugs on ""full volume"" which nessesarely is not the truth. Just loud enough that I didn't notice someone calling for me in a foreign language! Thanks for your consern! &lt;3

EDIT 2: As for the band I was listening to, most likely Mors Principium Est. Check them out, they're amazing!

TL;DR an exchange student, forgot to pay for my dinner and accidentally acted as suspicious as one could, sat trough a police interrogation and caused global panic amongst my co-workers.

604dxe,5,2017-03-18,"Wanted: Doula advice, hospital advice, birth plan implementation..... basically how the F do I do this???",_pm_me_a_CAT_,AugustBumpers2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/AugustBumpers2017/comments/604dxe/wanted_doula_advice_hospital_advice_birth_plan/,"Hey all. Long post ahead.... sorry!!

I had pretty much taken the opinion that having a doula would be a largely unnecessary expense. I can be my own advocate, right? And as long as I draw up a birth plan of my expectations and desires and share that with my midwives, there's not much else for a doula to offer me, right? 

Well, a couple of nights ago I had a dream that made me wonder if a doula might be better equipped to help me achieve my birthing goals. It's a little foggy, but I remember being kind of ""behind the scenes"" talking to a woman (could've been a doctor, nurse, midwife) at the hospital, and someone else had just given birth in another room. Two women (seemed like intern hospital staff?) brought the newborn baby to the back and placed it on a scale and started asking the doctor/nurse/person in charge what to do next. They started poking at it and taking measurements and stuff, and the doctor/nurse/whatever seemed like she was in too much of a hurry to be dealing with new interns and showing them things... and they themselves seemed clueless. The poor baby was just lying there on a cold hard surface with strangers hovering over him, and lord knows what his momma was doing or thinking in the other room after just pushing him out!

Yes, IT WAS JUST A DREAM, but it made me realize that I have *no* idea what the actual routine practices are when a baby is born! I don't want my baby to just be ripped out of me and taken away immediately where I can't see or hold it. My friend had a baby last summer and was charged some big fee for skin-to-skin contact after delivery, and that seems like it happens to a lot of women these days. That's crazy!! Unless there's something wrong with my baby or I had a complicated delivery, shouldn't I just be able to hold and bond with my baby IMMEDIATELY before it's taken away and snipped at, measured, cleaned up? It's really important to me to be the first thing my baby has real close contact with outside of the womb. Maybe I'm just panicking about ""what ifs"" and unlikely scenarios, but what if I'm not? I need to watch some birth videos or do some research into what actually takes place after the baby makes it out.... or maybe I *could* benefit from a doula?

Those of you who are getting a doula or have had a doula... what did you pay them and what services did they provide to you in exchange for that payment? If you didn't have a doula, did some other experienced mom in your life help you learn, advocate for you, and help you achieve your goals in terms of birthing? Can any of you here who are not FTMs tell me what happened in the hospital after your baby was born? Could you hold them right away? Were you charged some absurd fee for it? What happens to baby right after birth, etc etc? 

It's just suddenly scary how little I know about what to expect at the hospital. My babe is being delivered by a CNM (certified nurse midwife) not a doctor (unless complications arise), and it is my understanding that midwives can accommodate and provide for a more natural experience if that is preferred. I am starting to develop a birth plan, but I have no idea how to ensure that I'm not pressured out of it or some parts of it. The same friend that had her baby last summer also said she would do a lot of things differently if she could do it again, and recommended a possible doula to me. But I don't know if I can afford one or if it is really, truly a valuable asset for birth. I am already paying my midwives for my prenatal care, do I need to pay someone else to teach me how to mom?

Sorry for the long post, just please help me understand the goings on at the time of delivery  and after... because I'm really shocked at how little I know, and that dream just made me question everything. :\"

604i9w,123,2017-03-18,Complete lack of privacy...,NotanotherthrowawayD,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/604i9w/complete_lack_of_privacy/,"I've never really had any real privacy. My parents act like I have privacy but that really isn't the case.

I mentioned in my last post I have a severe mental illness that started in childhood. As such I needed to be closely monitored for several months and again every time we needed to adjust medication. I was never really allowed to be alone, only when I was changing, sleeping, bathroom, etc. I understand, and understood, why this needed to happen. Even when I stabilized (last time we needed to adjust medication I was 18, I've been doing well since then), I wasn't really allowed to be out of sight. It was mostly covert and I just chocked it up to being significantly younger and more immature than my siblings, there's a 5 year age gap between my me and my brother (he's the middle child) but only a 2 year gap between my brother and sister. 

Both my siblings were allowed to have computers in their rooms starting from about age 14... I wasn't 'allowed' to move mine in to my room until I was in my early 20's and I pushed *hard* for that, more or less moving my computer upstairs and then asking my dad if he could help me move my desk. I'm also not allowed to have my door closed when I'm in my room, if I do mom will just open it when she comes up to the bathroom. If I ask why she opened it she'll say something along the lines of ""I want to be able to talk to you"" 

Also one of the times I did have my door closed (I was laying in bed on my phone, I wanted to kinda rest) she knocked on the door and asked if she could come in. I said no (I had no pants on). She got *extremely* angry and said something along the lines of ""This is my house, you don't get to tell me if I can or can't come in!"" and barged in anyway. Thankfully I was covered up so she couldn't see me pantsless but it's... Not cool. Why ask if you're just going to barge in? 

My mom also has no concept of personal space, and has absolutely no idea exactly how much space she takes up (she is an extremely large woman). She will get within inches of you, hovering over your shoulder. I was looking something up for her, so she had to be in my room for a few minutes and she was right behind me leaning over like... Her head was inches from mine and she was nearly breathing in my ear. When I said ""Uh... Could you give me some space?"" her response was ""What? Are you doing something you're not supposed to be doing"" and held her position. Like... Uuuuuuuugh. As for how much space she takes up, she'll stand in hallways and she's so wide nobody will be able to get around her. She'll just... Stand there... It's also a *huge* issue in grocery stores, we go to a local independent market with smaller isles and she'll stand there. I'll have to say ""Mom, someone's trying to get past"" and then she'll try to move out of the way but it wont be enough so the person/people will have to literally squeeze past her. 

So, a few people have been urging me to get out. I have to be clear, I'm working on it. My boyfriend has about half a semester left in his course and then an internship and then he'll be done and he can get a 'big boy job'. I've been starting to save up and 'pack' all my essential items (birth certificate, passport, etc.) so at this point it's really only a matter of time before I can get out. Only thing I really need to figure out is health insurance since I'm covered under my dads works plan (reminder: he owns his own business), though I'm positive he'll keep me on it I couldn't live on our own and be able to afford my medications.

Boyfriend and I have also talked about moving to his home country (he was born elsewhere, moved here when he was young) because he has some just no family here, though thankfully I've been relatively lucky they've been good to me."

Well I'm possibly coming back to work for Nike again :) I'm considering a few areas.

* Progress Terrace looks like a nice apt complex on the southern end of beaverton. Can anyone recommend this place? Is that a good area?
* I'm also considering Tanasbourne and Orenco. Are these nice areas, and if so can you recommend a complex?

Which areas close(ish) to Nike and Intel are less crowded and nicer/safer?


My main concerns are that I want a quiet place where the traffic isn't too horrible. I'd much rather have a short drive/commute to work and then just go to Portland on the weekends for fun. "

Due to many reasons, I have to give up my well established career while continuing to live in the bay area. The obvious choice is tech, due to the fact that I do know how to program (used daily in my previous career, but at a lower/simpler level), as well as what's printed on my degree (stem ba from ucb, took a few cs courses as well).

so obviously, I've been going through ctci and leetcode and I'm planning on reviewing cs61b as I still feel unprepared, as even some of the medium difficulty questions on leetcode stump me (specifically the optimal solution, I can figure out a brute force method). Haven't even looked at the hard ones.

as for the rest, my main language is python, I can read java/c, understand complexity, not a stranger to the command line/linux.

besides general advice on how to get to the interview stage, what can be said about the following:

 * is cs61b (data structures and algorithms) all you really need to be decent? how about cs170 (upper division algorithms), or cs162 (operating systems)? I've read somewhere (maybe here) that those are necessary as well. Maybe they were talking about post-interview, what you need on the job?
 * how do I break in without previous projects, internships, open source contributions? I don't really have the time to develop a portfolio on top of the studying
 * is this even realistic in my mid 30s? I've heard plenty of stories about age-ism.
 * related to the previous, should I basically be gunning for an entry level back end software engineer position, or something else? I have no management experience
 * should I be targeting any specific type of company? I was thinking the b list (yelp, dropbox, pinterest, etc.) Maybe even that is unrealistic?
 * I don't know much about networking, how to interface with a database, the sorts of things most companies seem to based on (altavista was still a thing when I took 61a), can I pick those skills up on the job? I think I understand them conceptually though.

frankly, and I know this isn't a positive mental attitude, but sometimes the only thing that I see positive about me is a piece of paper, and the fact that I might not totally embarrass myself in an interview (if they're being nice)."

This probably isn't a very contributive first post, and I apologize, but I was wondering if any of you with more experience than I might have some advice. I'm a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at my university, and I spent my winter break and spring break sending out applications for any summer internships I could find. I've spent the last summer working at my school's HCI research lab, and I have my resume cleaned up and featuring all of the work I've done and skills I've built up, but it looks like I've got no follow ups on my applications. Granted, I only sent out about 18 applications, almost entirely in the NYC area (I live two hours outside the city), but I was hoping that I would at least get a rejection letter to let me know what I should do next. Out of the 18 applications, I only got one response back, a single rejection. I'm a bit bummed, but it's okay, I'm aware that there are a lot of students looking for work experience in the same areas that I am, especially in the city. I come to you guys in search of advice, is there any way I could still find work for this summer? I'm very comfortable in fields such as web applications development, video game/virtual reality software development, and mobile applications development. I'm still sending out applications to small companies, but I worry that they'll go unnoticed, since most of my classmates already have their summer internships set up at this point. Any help, or direction to a place where I could look for work, would be greatly appreciated. If it helps to know, I'm a first generation student from a family of Central American immigrants, so a lot of this process is really new to me. Also, if this is the wrong place to post something like this, please let me know!"

606gio,3,2017-03-18,"My Story: 26yo M 5'8"" 250 &gt; 210lbs heading for 170",ClimbKeeping,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/606gio/my_story_26yo_m_58_250_210lbs_heading_for_170/,"**The Beginning**

To start off, I have been overweight most of my life since 3rd grade or so. Like many people, I went from slightly ""stout"" to obese without realizing it. By the time I hit seventh grade I was 5'5""ish and weighed 230lbs. The summer between 7th and 8th grade I started riding my bike a ton, first not being able to ride up a small hill a mile from my house to dozens of miles a day. I lost an estimated 30lbs (still overweight, of course). This was my first experience with weight loss. Had no idea what I was doing, just doing something.


**First major body recomp**

Freshman year of college, instead of gaining the freshman 15, I dropped the freshman 30. During this time I ellitpical'd six days a week (minimum) for at least an hour and often 1.5 hours. I lifted hard and heavy every other day. My lowest recorded weight was 170, I was wearing size 30 jeans, small/medium tees that were snug in all the right places. It was awesome. I was getting reactions from everyone (girls included ;D) like ""omg, how did you do that"" to ""hey man, don't think I didn't notice you've added a lot of muscle. Your shoulders/arms are especially looking swoll...did you take steroids, they seriously arent good for you"". Needless to say, in a lot of ways I was on top of the world...


**When it all fell apart**

Took an internship across the country in a horrid place. Hated every day of it, as it was stressful, hot and I was completely alone. I ate and drank so much. Literally my daily diet (if I had the money) included almost a six pack of beer a night and a whole medium+ pizza from Pizza Hut. Both of my parents were extremely ill and I was trying to deal with that thousands of miles away. Not fun at all. I didn't weigh myself, but my girlfriend who I started dating a year earlier didn't see me the whole summer and she said when I got off the plane that she didn't even recognize me at first. Ouch.


**When it all turned around**

Towards the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 drinking and snacking were daily routines...but I hated them more and more. It got to the point where my body was so destroyed, that even 2 beers were enough to give me bad headaches, terrible sleep and soreness all day the next day. I got to the point where there was no enjoyment left and I hated every second of it. So, in the Spring of 2015, I just stopped. After 2 years straight of drinking on a daily basis (usually 3+ drinks or more) I was able to just give it up entirely.

**Losing 50lbs**

In April 2015, I started going to the gym on a regular basis again. I wasn't trying to anything special but eat less than 50g of carbs a day (because low carb was always my thing) and lift heavy and spend an hour on the elliptical 6 days a week. I didn't track calories as I knew I would give up eventually and once I give up on one part of my routine, I give up on everything. Annoying, but it worked out.

By August 2015, I got down to 206, went from size 42 jeans to size 36 and looked worlds better.


**Emotional struggles**

However, I was kind de-energized and needed a break. So I took one from September 2015 - Jan 2015...then my mother passed away. Needless to say, I lost all motivation for months and it was finally in the summer of 2016 where I decided I needed to get back to work. Well, now back up to 215, in July of 2016 I started again.

By the time September rolled around, I was my smallest in 4 years: 197lbs. Started to get some of those old feelings back, was fitting into SOME size 34 pants and muscle definition/strength were doing really solid. I used the same ""routine"" as above.

Then...my father passed away in October of 2016. Needless to say my life has been pretty messed up since then. It has been hard to do anything but be lazy and drink and eat out.

**Today**

Here are I am, over a year since my mother's death and 4 months since my father's death, back up to 210lbs and I am ready to drop that last 40-50lbs for good. Since low carb has always been something I could stick to (when I could stick to things) and have had a lot of success with in the past, I am ready to give it another go. I don't think what I am going to do be doing would be considered ""full keto"" (I am having a ton of protein after all), but certainly low carb is something I am comfortable with and understand how to do.

For the past 7 days, I have lifted 4 times (2 upper body, 2 lower body lifts) and have done cardio 6 times for 45 minutes. I weighed myself this morning, but will do so again tomorrow to try and counteract any discrepancy.


**New Routine**

I will:

-Eat 1800 calories a day

-40g in carbs, 170g in protein, 107g in fat

-Lift hard and heavy with compound movements 3x8 sets/reps upper/lower split 2x a week (so, two upper and two lower body lifts twice a week).

-45 minutes of elliptical cardio six days a week, 3 on, 1 off, 3 on for the first month, moving to 1 hour of cardio starting month two.

**The Goal**

-170lbs with added strength, muscle mass. At this point, i will evaluate body fat% and determine if I want to slim further to 160 or lower.

-Time frame: by the second week of August (2lbs a week).

**From you all:**

I would love tips/tricks/thoughts/comments. I will say I am decently hard headed when it comes to some things like ""that's too much cardio"" or ""you can't gain muscle and lose fat"" both of which I would defend vehemently, especially regarding gaining muscle mass. I have done it, it is slow but if over the course of the next 5 months I can put on 5lbs of muscle from all that lifting, so absolutely worth it.

I do have pictures from when I was around 230. As soon as I hit that 199.9 mark, I'll take some more and we can all see what 30lbs of fat looks like on a 5'8 male.

606hh1,209,2017-03-18,How to pass the hair follicle drug test,saucymesser,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/606hh1/how_to_pass_the_hair_follicle_drug_test/,"This is a cheaper variation of the Macujo method that personally helped me beat the hair follicle drug test for an internship this summer. It costs less than $20!

The Macujo method is essentially the home version of washing the chemicals out of your hair like they do in the lab, except you wont be testing the solution afterwards. I recommend you also shave all other body hair in case they insist on not taking it from your scalp. This method is not a good idea if you have a very sensitive scalp, as it will be irritating!

The main idea behind this method is to both wash the hair and cleanse the cuticles of all waste products, including drug waste.

I did this process three times because I had both the time and supplies.

You will need (&lt;$20):

a) Shower Cap  ~$3

b) White House White Distilled Vinegar 64oz -~$4

c) Clean and Clear Astringent (Step 2/pink one) ~$4

d) aloe rid nexxus old formula  I used Baking Soda instead. It does the same thing, and is WAY cheaper ~$1

e) Tide Liqud Laundry Detergent ~$5 – Grab a small one, as that’s all you will need and more



Application Process:

1. Be careful not to get any of these substances in your eyes/ears/mouth as they WILL hurt you. Call a medical professional immediately if you do for help. On your skin and scalp, you will be fine unless you are already very sensitive.
2. Shave all hair on your legs/chest/pits/groin.  This precautionary so you will only need to apply the method to your scalp. Odds are in your favor if you skip this step with a full head of hair.
3. Wet your hair with warm water over the kitchen or bathroom sink.
4. Apply and massage Vinegar into your scalp for a few minutes (1-2 cups)
5. Apply and massage Clean and Clear with the Vinegar for a few more minutes. (1-2 oz)
6. Using the shower cap, let this mixture stand in your hair for a about an hour.
7. Take a shower and use Baking Soda  (you can mix it with a small amount of shampoo) in your hair. Mix it well, and let it stand for a few minutes before rinsing.
8. In the shower, apply Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent to your hair, massage it well and rinse it out.
9. Do the baking soda one more time, it helps your head heal and keeps your hair soft in addition to being an excellent natural cleanser.

Its a small local company, definitely not Google or Microsoft. Kinda shell shocked at how I did, but I have never had a huge problem with coding challenges in the past .

They used remoteinterview.io which the questions where just weirdly worded and did not give great explanation for what it was asking. I had 60 minutes to complete these three problems

1.) Given buffered read, where first line is number of lines that follow and the rest of lines are string print out the reverse of each word in the string (Print line where each word is reversed)
- This was pretty straight forward fizzbuzzy, but for w.e reason even though output was identical it was spitting out that it was improper output, I spent far too long trying to get it to spit out that it was right, before realizing I should move on. This wasted about 20 minutes out of the hour.

The second was a problem, moving boxes. Given 3 numbers lets say 11 2 2, first number is number of boxes, second is number of boxes that can moved in one move, and 3rd is the number of piles of boxes that it should be divided into. If a pile has more than what can be moved it should be divided into that many piles where no pile should differ more then one then the other. So with this weird description it gave example input as 
&gt; 11 2 2
11 -&gt; 5 + 6
5 -&gt; 3 + 2
6 -&gt; 3 + 3
3-&gt; 2 + 1
So 4 boxes of 2 and 3 boxes of 1 -&gt; 7 piles

What wasted a good 3-5 minutes on top of being confused by original description was confusion about where they were coming from with 4 boxes of of 2 and 3 boxes of 1 since the wording was confusing and the example listed 3-&gt;2+1 once 
- Did this using recursion mostly implemented it but not fully

The last problem still didnt fully get what was asked. It had to do with finding a divisibility rule for prime numbers. Gave an example of 3 and 11 in which the number can be broken up as decimals into r-tuples and suming the r-tuples and seeing if their sum adds up to something divisible or something along those lines. So problem given a prime number find if the rule applies or something along those lines. Issue was there was no example given of how the number is broken up into r-tuples simply example input of one digit and its expected output. 

So, pretty bummed out but wondering if these are normal 20 minute problems for entry level position."

Last Fall, around the time everyone starts applying for internships, the CS department coordinator (and my boss, since I'm a student and I work in the computer lab) got an email from a former student that he keeps in touch with, saying that he is looking for an intern for his team at Company 1. He visits our school and talks about his job and the position, and the coordinator introduces us, because he thinks I would be a good fit for the opportunity at Company 1. The guy from Company 1 likes me, and when I apply for Company 1, my application is basically fast tracked, and when I interview with the manager for that team, it's less of an interview and more of a ""yeah we've basically already picked you but I wanted to talk to you a bit first."" Naturally, right at the end of winter break (the company's recruiters took some time off for Christmas), I got a call from Company 1, offering me the job. I told the HR rep I wanted to intern with them, because at this point I hadn't heard anything good from any other companies I applied to, and I filled out an application and background check forms with a separate company that handles Company 1's temporary employees.

Around the time I was applying to Company 1, I also applied to a couple other companies, and either didn't hear back, or I was turned down. Fast forward to last week, and I get a call from Company 2 from a different HR rep than the one I had previously talked to, saying that they got my information and wanted to do an interview. I had interned with Company 2 last summer but for a different team, and they didn't give me a return offer, but my previous HR rep encouraged me to apply to a different team if I wanted to intern with them (which is what I did last Fall). Since the team that I applied for at Company 2 was in a better location than the internship at Company 1, *and* Company 2 offered me **much** better pay last summer than Company 1 is offering me this summer, *and* Company 2 offers relocation packages while Company 1 expects us to go it alone, I decided to interview with Company 2.

Since it's sort of last-minute hiring time for summer internships, I interviewed over the phone and got the official offer within a few hours of finishing the interview, because the people I interviewed with at Company 2 really liked me. Here's a little rundown of the internships:

Company 1:  
 - Pay: $22.95  
 - Relocation Assistance: None  
 - Location: Fort Worth, TX (not terribly far from where I live, but 4-6 hours drive, so I would have to get an apartment over the summer)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops sort of stuff

Company 2:  
 - Pay: $26/hour  
 - Relocation assistance: $4000 one-time lump sum for travel and rent  
 - Location: Denver, CO (Much farther than DFW, but much, much more attractive location to me)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops type thing

So the roles are very similar at both companies, but Company 2 is offering better pay, generous relocation assistance, and a much better location (especially since I've been stuck in Texas my whole life and would love to spend the summer somewhere else). Company 2's offer is looking way better to me than Company 1's.

There are 2 problems, though:

1) I interned with Company 2 last summer, and I kind of like the idea of trying out different companies while in college so that I can get a feel for what I like. However, it's a very different team than last summer's, in a different location, and with a different role (last summer was software engineering), so it wouldn't be *that* similar. More importantly,

2) I ""accepted"" (not officially through paperwork) Company 1's offer back in mid January, and I am afraid of creating bad blood if I back out now. This is emphasized because my offer from Company 1 was very much influenced by professional networking from the department head at my school and one of their former students and professional contacts.

Is it appropriate to back out from Company 1's offer and take Company 2's offer? Or is it too late, and I shouldn't risk creating bad blood with my department head?

This is stressing me out a lot and I would love some perspective.

Thanks!

***EDIT***: I want to point out one of the other things that pushes me towards Company 2. I spoke with a friend of mine from my school's CS department, who interned with Company 1 the last two summers, in a similar (but not identical) role, in the same location. They were offered $23/hour their first time around, and $24 their second. I realize that $22.95 and $23 aren't that much different, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way that they would offer me less than the norm at their company given that I had very similar credentials to other people interning there (except I have a higher GPA than the person I talked to, and I also have already done a previous internship, albeit with a different company)."

You put in your info and it does a sot inquiry credit check, and tell you how much financing you're prequalified for. I've found multiple cars I'm interested in purchasing, and it shows me an APR and a monthly payment based off that APR, title/tax estimates, my down payment.

This is my history:
I'm not from the US.
I'm currently in an internship in a big and known tech company which it soon going to be over. Also, I'm in my 4th year in a CS Bachelor (in my country the career duration is 5 years). Like I mention the internship ends at the end of the month, but they're offering me a Part-time job, not in the company but in a small company who employ people for them (They said the ""company is in freeze so there is no hiring whatsoever""), in others words is subcontract. It's not much money (less than I'm receiving for the internship). Also it's a real chance the I can be a research assistant  to one of my professors. I'm not even sure if I can do both things (work and finish all my courses for this semester), not even talking about doing the three of them. 

So, I just want to be pragmatic an just do the best for my resume in the future. What's more attractive ?

More info about it:

-  I've 5 courses (mostly of my morning is occupied with uni)
-  I really like going to hackathons and tech-related events, so I tried to usually have my weekends busy.
-  The part time job is Java Developer 


Hope you can help me. Thanks in advance. "
607lbc,1,2017-03-18,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/607lbc/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I was admitted as a computer science major this January, and I have done a TON of research about the school. However, there are still some questions hovering in my mind. I would list out the things I know about UMD first:)

Pros:
1. Overall great CS programs with helpful and enthusiastic professors and TAs.
2. The Brendan Iribe Center will be due in 2018. (HUGE upgrade for the cs department and more resources)
3. Close to DC, which means lots of internship opportunities.
4. Beautiful campus with a welcoming atmosphere.
5. Nice people with diverse cultural backgrounds.
6. Clubs and sports are quite active.

Cons:
1. Crime rate is relatively high in the area.
2. Many great professors had left the school in the past years.
3. Dorms aren't so nice?(I don't know how hard it is to reserve for newer dorms.)
4. The cs courses are more focused on heavy coding rather than on the creative aspects.

So, here are my questions:
1. I want to be engaged in data science in the future but according to the school website, UMD's strengths is in cyber security, will it make a big difference on my class options?
2. I heard someone saying the professors in the cs department are really strict and they try their best to kick off students that are not in the top 10%, is that true?
3. There's not much information about how well UMD students do in grad schools. Are UMD CS undergrads competitive enough to get in grad schools like CMU, UC Berkeley or UCLA?(Generally speaking)
4. I really don't know whether I should go to a cc and then transfer to UC Berkeley or UCLA(major in statistics) or attend UMD directly.(I've been thru some personal issues so I don't have an amazing hs gpa, but I consider myself hardworking and bright.)

**Thanks for anyone reading thru my questions and answering them:))"
607o6v,20,2017-03-18,Middle school teacher swears/menaces student athletes and myself (volunteer soccer coach),VinoRosso96,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/607o6v/middle_school_teacher_swearsmenaces_student/,"Hi guys,

I apologize if this isn't the right thread, but I'm looking for some advice.

I'm a 20 year old college student who has been volunteering at my old high school for a few years. I've been using it as an 'internship' to gain experience in the hopes that one day I can coach my own team at a club level. Overall, the past few years since my graduation has been exceptional, it's been an incredibly eye-opening experience. 

Until this year, when a middle-aged male teacher from the local middle school took over the JV boys soccer team, and has been a total nightmare to work alongside with.

Before I go any further, I want to say that I am simply a volunteer 'team-manager' who doesn't receive any financial compensation from the school or booster clubs, I do this for fun and in my free time. I don't have (or need) lay-coach licenses since I'm not on the payroll nor over the age of 21. This is an important part in the story.

The past few weeks at the practices the middle school teacher (we'll call him Greg) has been getting slightly more and more aggressive towards me and some of the players on Varsity, whom I coach. Two of my players played a joke on him, which was a bit distasteful, and Greg lashed out in an incredible manner, swearing at them, saying ""I will knock you the f*ck out"" to a 16 year old. It was beyond embarrassing and over the top for a county teacher to be threatening two boys who are barely 100 pounds.

Last week, Greg made another jab at me over ""not having lay-coach licenses and shouldn't even be out here."" I find that strange because according to all the rules and regulations, I am in violation of none. If anything, he's in violation of gross-misconduct. I simply shrugged it off and went on about my business at practice.

Then we get to Friday night. My main head coach is sick and doesn't show up. It's me and the assistant coach of Varsity, and Greg. As I'm talking to the Assistant Coach, I question why we set up for a play a certain way, in which Greg overhears and absolutely erupts on me. 

He's swearing at me in front of the team on the bench and threatens to have me removed by the administrator on duty. Dumbfounded and furious, I leave without saying a word.

His continuous lack of respect and gross misconduct are enough to get anybody fired at any job. I'm more upset about him telling players that he would ""knock the f*ck out of them"" than for him erupting on me. His disrespect towards me will not be tolerated, and I'm now looking for avenues on how to deal with this.

Since I graduated from the High School 3 years ago, I still have an excellent rapport with the faculty there. How should I handle this? Should I have all this documented and sent to the admins at both the high school where we coach, and to the middle school where he teaches?

Sorry for the long story, I tried to simplify this as much as possible. I would be glad to answer any questions you all may have.


P.S. I have learned that he has been warned at the middle school for constantly swearing at kids. He's an 8th grade teacher at a public school, surely this is unacceptable?"

Ever since I was little I have known that my mother is evil. When I was 6, I cried over a nightgown being wet and instead of drying it my mom pushed me down the stairs where I sprained my wrist. I grew up always getting beat or punished, tabasco sauce on my tongue when I didn't want to eat meat. I was the punching bag for my nmom to beat on. I grew up with fear of her and hating my life. If I spoke in front of other parents I was beat when I got home because ""kids are meant to be seen not heard"", I wasn't allowed to dress my age or listen to age appropriate music. I was brainwashed in that I had to do exactly what she wanted me to do otherwise I would be beat or punished. Growing up my siblings would sit and laugh at me saying I should have kept my mouth shut, or I should have eaten that hamburger. 

High School was worse, I had no friends because anytime I brought them over my nmom would yell or scream or hit me and after that kids would say see ya. My crappy phone was bugged, and my nmom got a print out of all the texts that were sent and received, my laptop was bugged, and I had to give her all the passwords for anything I had. I couldn't get my license until 6-8 months after I was supposed to and by than she had my younger brother drive me to school, since she didn't ""trust"" me. I had a group of friends at one point, but after I heard them saying some mean stuff about me at a sleepover I was too hurt and upset to want to hang out with them. Instead of comforting me, my nmom told me that it was my fault, I was the reason I had no friends, that maybe if I was nicer I would have people wanting to come over. I thought my dad would be my saving grace, but instead he agreed with her. Even when it came to going to college, my nmom made it about herself and said that if I was going to go to a private school she was getting a divorce since how dare I take away money that my dad wanted to use for me for college, she said we needed to save for my GC sister. The summer before I left we got into another fight, one that ended up with her punching, throwing things and kicking me out of the house, when I came home the next day I was told ""next time you pull a stunt like that I am going to call the police and you can stay in jail, I will not have you running away from here"" 

In college finally though I thought it would get better and it didn't. I feel like every time I tried to make friends or go out, she was always there telling me that I would be alone and that no one would want to be friends with me. I was too scared to get a fake ID or go to parties, since if she found out she would bring me back home. And my GC siblings have fake IDs, do drugs, go to parties, spend tons of money and can come and go as they please. Meanwhile I have a job starting in August, I rarely go out, didn't ever have a fake ID, no drugs, and only spend money on gas and grocery's. I have an extremley hard time making friends though and it just seems like the way I was raised and what I was taught will never go away. My nmom even told me last summer during my internship ""some people aren't meant to end up with a husband or kids, I've told you before that you're never going to find a guy who likes your looks or your personality, so you should forget about finding someone and focus on working the rest of your life"" 

I go to counseling and am trying to move past all of this, but it just seems more and more like she's right. I don't think I am going to get my happy ending, the last two guys I dated one cheated on me and blamed me for it and the other broke up with me in an email because of the background I came from. Friends come and go, since I'll have these flair up with my family and break down, they don't want to deal with it, so they'll just cut off everything from me. My siblings are doing amazing and it doesn't help when I get calls that all is talked about is how I am such a disappointment compared to them. Maybe if I wasn't the oldest things would have been better, instead I just feel lost and alone.

STEM Teacher: 8/10, knew pretty well. She's active in our STEM clubs as well that I participate in.

STEM Teacher #2: 7/10, knew really well but my grade was a low B in this class.

Additional rec: 11/10. From my employer, former alum to Stanford/Princeton and also interviews students for Princeton. I read it and was ecstatic by the depth and quality of her description.

Essays:
This depends on the school, but I definitely think my best writing was for Stanford and Harvard where my CA is a 9/10 and overall I believe I described myself with genuine passion for STEM and a heartfelt analysis of my high school years and life. But of course, no one really knows what these schools like to hear exactly.

Info about high school:

Really large and one of the most competitive publics in the nation from a large city. I believe there's a bit grade deflation, if that impacts your opinion on my GPA/Rank. There are several other applicants from my school.

Thanks in advance guys! I'm really just curious if my GPA alone takes me out of the consideration from these schools, or can I make up with my essay writing, ECs, and test scores? Sorry about the ambiguity - I know a lot of people from my school are on this subreddit (because of all the competitiveness lol), so if you need clarification to base your response, please ask. "
608trf,98,2017-03-19,[MF] Popped both my cherries with a much older man from an online fetish site *long*,chub_bunny,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/608trf/mf_popped_both_my_cherries_with_a_much_older_man/,"Background: I am a 24 year old Asian girl who come from a strict, religious-type family. I could never have a boy over, couldn't have sleepovers (even with my girl friends), had to report where I was if I was allowed out, and of course, no boyfriends. Well, with an upbringing like that, there was only 2 ways I could grow up: 1) Be extremely obedient and followed all rules to a T, 2) Be rebellious. 

I went down road #2. I wasn't *extremely* rebellious. I came home from school everyday, didn't bring boys home, didn't smoke, didn't do drugs. I'd discovered parties and clubs at age 20, but by then I was an intern that had pretty irregular hours so I used that as an excuse whenever I went to the clubs, and my parents couldn't stop me. I'd always known that I was into bdsm ever since I was a young teenager and I'd found an online bdsm/fetish website, although I didn't meet up with anyone at all.

That changed on Friday, 17th March 2017. 

We'd been chatting on Kik for a few weeks and he was flying over to my country for business meetings. I toyed with the idea of going; some days I'd feel like I wanted to go, and other days, I'd feel scared and anxious about meeting him. It'd been a stressful week for me so when Thursday rolled around, I'd made up my mind that I was going to be the little slut that I always knew I was. Friday morning got me really stressed out because *school*, and I was all hot and bothered in class. I took a cab to his hotel, swished some listerine in my mouth before sending off a message that I was there. He came down to the lobby to meet me and my heart was pounding right out of my chest. In the elevator, he smiled and said, ""You're so shy."" And my face went completely red as I stammered my agreement. 

I'd requested to take a shower because it was an extremely hot day and I hated being sweaty. He very graciously let me into the bathroom and it felt like I was on auto-pilot. I put on a sheer black dress that he'd requested, no bra, lace black panties. He was waiting for me when I stepped out. I must've been extremely nervous because he took my hand and pulled me into his chest. I felt his laugh rumbling from his chest as he told me to relax. He was a huge guy and towered above me (I'm only 5ft 2). He laid me on the bed and we made out for a while. It was my first time and it turned me on so much. My hands were gripping the bedsheets and I could hear myself gasping into his mouth. He ran his hands down my body and brushed his fingers across my lower regions. Something exploded in my gut and I moaned. I remember thinking, ""A man's touch is certainly different from my own."" 

He pulled aside the cloth covering my breasts and started to nip and lick at my nipples. I'd never thought my breasts could be this sensitive, but here I was, gasping and clawing at the bedsheets as he expertly sucked my tits. ""You can touch me if you want,"" he said and looked down pointedly at the bulge in his pants. I reached out and cupped my palm over his cock. It was hard and I was ecstatic that I'd been the one who made him hard. ""Take it off? Please?"" I tugged at his clothes and he complied. The minute his cock sprang free, I remembered why I was so nervous. My first time... and with a 7 inch cock! My heart was fluttering like a caged bird in my chest. ""Don't be nervous,"" he said, ""Let me help you relax. Let's take this off."" He pushed me back down and tugged my panties off. I watched them go with sadness, it had only been 10 minutes since I put them on. But I didn't have time to mourn their loss, he'd spread my legs and I felt his tongue lap my entire sex. I threw my head back and let myself give in to the pleasure I'd heard so much about. I don't know what he was doing with his tongue, but it was so good. My legs were shaking in the air, my back was arching off the bed, and I was so sure I'd torn a hole in the bedsheets. He kept at it until I was close to having an orgasm before coming up to kiss me roughly on the mouth. I could feel how wet I'd been from his face. ""You didn't orgasm, did you?"" he asked. I shook my head, out of breath to even answer him. I desperately wanted him back between my legs but he pulled me on top of him. 

I was faced with the first cock in my life. Unsure, I glanced at him. He told me to give it a lick and I did. Then he gently pushed my head down. Inexperienced, my teeth grazed his shaft every so often, but I found that I could take almost all of him into my throat, and when I heard him groan as the head of his cock bumped the base of my throat, I knew I had him. We went into the 69 position, but honestly, with his talented tongue between my legs, I just could not concentrate on his cock. I heard a squelch and felt fingers pull out of my ass, then, ""Lie face down."" I sank into the bed, mind filled with pleasurable haze, and felt him climb on top of me. He started to push gently into my virgin ass. I grimaced in pain, but allowed him to continue. His control was superb and whenever I hissed, he would stop and let my poor hole get accustomed to his girth. Never in my life did I think I would lose my anal virginity, and to a 7 inch cock!

He started to pump slowly in and out of my ass for a few minutes. I could tell it was agonising for him not start slamming his cock in. I felt myself loosen enough to take more of him in and that's when he started to build his rhythm. Before long, he had me pinned facedown and was thrusting into me. He let me have control for a while with me on top and that was when I felt the first tendrils of pleasure start to spike inside me. My clit was grazing his body and I ground into his cock. He was looking up at me and murmured, ""Look at that view."" I leaned over him, and he demanded me to kiss him. I complied. He slapped my ass, and a sharp spike of pleasure ripped through me. I asked him to slap my ass a couple more times and by the 5th time he did, I was mewling my need into his chest. ""Take my pussy,"" I pleaded. His eyes, dark with lust, looked back at me and he told me to get off his cock 

He laid a towel on the bed (hey, no-one wants to sleep in blood, right?) and told me to lie on it. I spread my legs for him as he got in between them. He rubbed the head of his cock along the entrance of my wet pussy and started to push into my virgin hole. I yelped. Sparing you the details, it felt like a loooong 15-20 minutes before I could take 1/2 of his cock in me. He started to thrust slowly. I was moaning, half in pain and half in pleasure. ""It hurts, but it feels so good,"" I whispered. He pinned my body to the bed and rode me with 1/2 his cock (he was still too large for me). 

He got off of me and inspected his cock a while later. I looked down and the towel had a patch of blood. He told me to stay there, he cleaned himself up, then came back with some paper towels for me. He got between my legs again and this time, I could take almost all of him inside me.. in between a few yelps, of course. This time, he wrapped his hands around my throat and rode me, and I loved it. When he took his hands off my throat, he leaned down and growled into my ear, ""You say it hurts, but look at you, taking it all in both holes."" My pussy contracted in pleasure at his words. ""Turn around and get face down."" Obediently, I turned over. 

He pumped, slow and deep into my pussy. He pulled my hair and all I could do was moan at how much I loved the rough treatments. This was a dream come true. He would periodically spank my ass and growl at what a naughty girl I was into my ear. He would pin me down into the bed and thrust hard, while at other times, he would stroke my back and pump slow and deep while telling me I was such a good girl. It drove me crazy with need. Finally, he withdrew from my pussy. ""I've been controlling my orgasm this entire time,"" he said. I hummed in response. ""But now I'm going to cum."" ""Cum,"" I murmured. He pushed his cock into my sore ass and I let out a gasp as I tried to sit up. He pushed me down into the bed and held me there as he rode me to his own finish. I heard him growl behind me and watched his hands tighten on the edge of the bed in front of me. I felt his cock twitching inside my ass, and then he pulled out. 

I was out of breath, spent and tired. My entire body was sore, and  my holes felt abused and raw. But all my stress was gone. What a workout!

*Thanks for reading about how I popped my cherries! I hope you like it. Hopefully I've got more to write about. I might be meeting him again next week!*"

Fast forward to this year, and I got an internship at a much larger company. As the summer gets closer I'm starting to worry about failure. I guess I did well enough last summer (I got a return offer), but I was always worried about my performance. 

My goal for this summer is to be more confident, and do my best towards getting a full time offer. But I still have this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I may not be good enough. I guess it could be imposter syndrome, but then I always think back to the times I had trouble in the past.

I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently in my junior year of college. I came home for spring break recently, and I've been thinking about this whole ""adulthood"" thing for a while now. 

For one thing, I'm going to turn 21 in about two months for now. I'm excited about my 21st birthday, because I'll finally be able to drink alcohol legally. I feel like my 21st birthday will be my first real step into the adult world, and I feel as though something huge will happen when I turn 21. 

However, I can't help but feel like I'm behind in life, in some ways. Like I said before, I'm currently in my junior year of college, and I feel as though I should know everything at this point. I believe that my junior year of college is where I should finally become a grown-up, and I feel that I should always know exactly what to do and to never ask my parents for help on anything. I'm not a teen anymore, but I can't help but feel like I haven't become an actual adult yet. 

Also, I don't work whenever I'm at college, I've never had an internship, and my parents pay for my college tuition. I don't drink or use drugs, but I've noticed that my siblings have gotten farther in doing adult things than I have. My sister graduated from college, and she lives in another state, with a place of her own. My brother is my twin, but he has a girlfriend that he's dated for months now, he has more experience with driving than I do, and he gets out of the house more than I do whenever I'm at home. I can't help but think that I have to catch up to my siblings and become an adult right now. 

So, has anyone else dealt with stuff like this? Any good tips for me, in regards to my current situation right now? "

However the thought of sharing here and your support already helps me tremendously by having a certain social check and while i picked every day, i still could go outside everyday with some makeup on, but my skin isnt yet at a point where i would feel confident working at my internship.

For this reason and to try and stop now i'll be doing daily updates from now on, as i feel this would give me more motivation and your support also gives me lots of willpower. And even though i know i won't make it alone, i am fairly confident that i can do this with you.

I'll also make a journal and write down how much, where and when i picked starting with after this post which ill also attach to my daily updates to make amyself more accountable.

The first was an 8-week internship with a small stipend that I wouldn't get until the end, so I figured it wasn't practical work experience and quit to start a job that paid and had more hours.

I left the second job after 4 months because it was stressful (front desk and working with children/parents) and the hours were 3-10 pm which threw my sleeping and eating schedule and essentially all emotions into whack.

I then started a per-diem grant funded position in my field. Hated this job because I had nothing to do, so I'd drive there, clock in, and search for jobs on indeed all day. It was good money, but I felt guilty and unfulfilled. Because that job was grant funded, it was only set to last two months (until the end of the year), which gave me an easy out, but I had a lot of pressure on myself to do SOMETHING with my time. I enjoy working when it's the right job and I'm a fresh graduate, neither me nor my parents wanted me sitting around.

So, I rushed into my first full-time job. I moved back to my college town about an hour away which has been nice because I still have friends there, but I'm having trouble yet again. I practically live alone (roommate is never around) which is hard for me because I get my energy from being around people,  my job is AWFUL, stressful, not in my field, nor what I signed up for because I'm doing way different duties than the job description, the office is cliquey and I can't seem to break into the group and make friends with these girls when I usually have a simple time with that. Also, the pay is really low and it's hard to support myself with rent, food and gas expenses - I barely have any leisure money and virtually zero savings. 

My lease is up at the end of May, and I have been considering a few options. During my time at the hospital, I took my GRE and applied to three grad schools. I got into all of them, but the expenses are outrageous and I'm having a hard time making a decision. I think one school is out because it is in a far city and I don't know anyone there, plus it is also the most expensive. One of the schools is near my college town which also happens to be only about an hour from home. The last school is my favorite option with the best program. However, it's almost 6 hours away, but my boyfriend will be living and working there.

I'm torn between going to the third school (will not be living with boyfriend, but at least won't be 6 hours away) which is what I truly want, moving back home and looking for a new job, or going to the second school which I'm not really in love with but could be good experience.

I'm also having trouble because I want to be close to my boyfriend but will ultimately be going for myself, for career satisfaction and more learning experience, but I'm probably irrationally worried something awful will happen. One of my closest friends and I ended up going to the same college when we were freshmen, I got an awful roommate who threatened to kill me and ended up transferring, and my friend and I haven't communicated since. I love my boyfriend and I know it's different but I think I have some ptsd from the experience. But on the flip side, I'm scared of living at home, so far away from him, the person who is my comfort zone and my best friend. I love my family and we are very close, but as I mentioned, social interaction is important to me as well and many of my friends have moved out of my hometown. When I lived at home before, I managed just fine, but sometimes I did wish I had more of a social life.

I'm up in the middle of the night every night because this is destroying my ability to sleep. This is one of the hardest decisions of my life and I'm so afraid to make the wrong one. I can't even go with my gut because I just feel like vomiting. This is making me super sick and it's really really difficult to have high-functioning anxiety because everyone thinks I'm fine, but I feel like my walls are closing in on me. It's so hard to see what the future will look like and I just want some calm.

I picked up CS this previous Fall as a second major, and I have really taken to it. I'm pretty certain I'd like to go into Software Engineering upon graduation, and I feel that I have the determination for a competitive career in the industry. (I'm still on track to graduate on time, and I have a 4.0 GPA on a full ride to a state university and lots of academic achievements and extracurriculars.)

I didn't apply to internships for this summer because I just wasn't qualified and I'm just taking my Data Structures and Algorithms (using Java) course this semester along with some other electives (Web Programming and UNIX). I browse this sub a lot, and I know I'm a bit ""behind"" without any sort of internship for this summer if I hope to be a really competitive candidate.

My question is: What do I do this summer? I figure it's too late for an internship, so I'll likely be scooping ice cream to keep some income coming in, but I'd like to commit my free time to becoming a marketable applicant moving forward. 

Should I work on a big project? Should I teach myself more data structures and start working on CTCI/HackerRank? Both? My only reservation is that I'm going to learn a lot of these topics in the future in the CS department, but if it would be a good use of time I would learn them as soon as possible. 

I appreciate any feedback, and I'd like to thank you all in general for all the insight this sub has given me."

Now comes the dilemma: 1) I could spend my spring semester (first two months of summer) here in Michigan to take one of the Computer Science classes. After the summer school, I would intern for rest of the summer (another 2 months) at a middle-market private equity firm. OR 2) I could spend the whole summer interning and learning at the private equity firm, as I actually ENJOY my life away from school. OR 3) I COULD JUST GIVEUP IN MINORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, and solely focus on Mathematics. Here are the questions: Which options would you guys recommend?

60b20d,0,2017-03-19,Budget VDI. unRAID or XEN?,nyx_stef,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/60b20d/budget_vdi_unraid_or_xen/,"I'm an intern as sort of an IT sub-manager in a company with **super duper hyper ultra stingy** management, who want most efficient, highly available work desktops that only require almost no hardware &amp; software replacement for the next 15 years **(no joke)**. Current PCs for the staffs are already in their 4th years, with about 10% replaced and the rest are hanging on threads. We don't even have any spare PC if another breaks down, as the IT dept. is ordered to buy only when any breaks down, to save cost. Even the purchasing dept. ordered the server RAM we so **DESPERATELY** needed from the cheapest source available, and will arrive in **6 weeks**. AND IT WAS A FREAKING **1** STICK OF HPE 16GB RAM.

As staffs only use internet browser, and office programs, the PC only needs low performance. The current replacement is a bare Intel NUC with 7th gen i3 ultrabook CPU, 8GB RAM &amp; 128GB SSD, which costs around 580 USD per unit (not including peripherals). 

I had a meeting with vendor for microsoft based VDI, which proposed 150k~200k USD for software &amp; hardware for 70 users for 5 years. I had great interest in it for cutting maintenance time for IT guys due to easier management &amp; maintenance, since they're already constantly overworked, but deemed too expensive by management.

The release of Ryzen and watching some Youtube videos (by Linus) gave me an idea. Why not build a low-budget VDI using Ryzen due to its high core amount and low price, and use open-source / cheap type-1 hypervisor?

For 4 users per machine(maybe more If I can squeeze it), I'm thinking of:

- CPU: AMD R7 1700
- Motherboard: B350 AM4 motherboard from Asus / Gigabyte
- RAM: 32 GB DDR4
- Storage: 256GB SSD for Cache, 2 x 2TB NAS HDD RAID 1 for main storage
- GPU: RX 460 (optional)
- PSU &amp; case: as minimum as possible
- Guest OS: Win 10 Pro x64

So my questions are these:

1. Which VDI solution should I use, Xen or unRAID?
2. Is that hardware specification enough?
3. Is there any good, cheap zero client that I can combine with that VDI? If possible, from big brands such as HP or Dell.

Thanks a lot :)

P.S.: If you want to know why I still work there, is because my father is a close friend of company's owner, and he has been helped a lot in many business deals by the owner, so I'm kinda forced to help the IT dept.

P.S. 2: I can delve more into the shitty situations here in the IT dept. Like, using normal shelves rather than **A** locally made, budget server rack (about 1000 USD) for saving cost.

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for the input guys! It seems that the overwhelming general consensus is that VDI won't work with the situation I;m in."
60b9bo,1,2017-03-19,I have to choose between 2 summer internships (x-posted from /r/internships),intern6019,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/60b9bo/i_have_to_choose_between_2_summer_internships/,"Hi /r/Advice!

Last Fall, around the time everyone starts applying for internships, the CS department coordinator (and my boss, since I'm a student and I work in the computer lab) got an email from a former student that he keeps in touch with, saying that he is looking for an intern for his team at Company 1. He visits our school and talks about his job and the position, and the coordinator introduces us, because he thinks I would be a good fit for the opportunity at Company 1. The guy from Company 1 likes me, and when I apply for Company 1, my application is basically fast tracked, and when I interview with the manager for that team, it's less of an interview and more of a ""yeah we've basically already picked you but I wanted to talk to you a bit first."" Naturally, right at the end of winter break (the company's recruiters took some time off for Christmas), I got a call from Company 1, offering me the job. I told the HR rep I wanted to intern with them, because at this point I hadn't heard anything good from any other companies I applied to, and I filled out an application and background check forms with a separate company that handles Company 1's temporary employees.

Around the time I was applying to Company 1, I also applied to a couple other companies, and either didn't hear back, or I was turned down. Fast forward to last week, and I get a call from Company 2 from a different HR rep than the one I had previously talked to, saying that they got my information and wanted to do an interview. I had interned with Company 2 last summer but for a different team, and they didn't give me a return offer, but my previous HR rep encouraged me to apply to a different team if I wanted to intern with them (which is what I did last Fall). Since the team that I applied for at Company 2 was in a better location than the internship at Company 1, *and* Company 2 offered me **much** better pay last summer than Company 1 is offering me this summer, *and* Company 2 offers relocation packages while Company 1 expects us to go it alone, I decided to interview with Company 2.

Since it's sort of last-minute hiring time for summer internships, I interviewed over the phone and got the official offer within a few hours of finishing the interview, because the people I interviewed with at Company 2 really liked me. Here's a little rundown of the internships:

Company 1:  
 - Pay: $22.95  
 - Relocation Assistance: None  
 - Location: Fort Worth, TX (not terribly far from where I live, but 4-6 hours drive, so I would have to get an apartment over the summer)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops sort of stuff

Company 2:  
 - Pay: $26/hour  
 - Relocation assistance: $4000 one-time lump sum for travel and rent  
 - Location: Denver, CO (Much farther than DFW, but much, much more attractive location to me)  
 - Role: Mainframe sysadmin/devops type thing

So the roles are very similar at both companies, but Company 2 is offering better pay, generous relocation assistance, and a much better location (especially since I've been stuck in Texas my whole life and would love to spend the summer somewhere else). Company 2's offer is looking way better to me than Company 1's.

There are 2 problems, though:

1) I interned with Company 2 last summer, and I kind of like the idea of trying out different companies while in college so that I can get a feel for what I like. However, it's a very different team than last summer's, in a different location, and with a different role (last summer was software engineering), so it wouldn't be *that* similar. More importantly,

2) I ""accepted"" (not officially through paperwork) Company 1's offer back in mid January, and I am afraid of creating bad blood if I back out now. This is emphasized because my offer from Company 1 was very much influenced by professional networking from the department head at my school and one of their former students and professional contacts.

Is it appropriate to back out from Company 1's offer and take Company 2's offer? Or is it too late, and I shouldn't risk creating bad blood with my department head?

This is stressing me out a lot and I would love some perspective.

Thanks!

***From the EDIT***: I want to point out one of the other things that pushes me towards Company 2. I spoke with a friend of mine from my school's CS department, who interned with Company 1 the last two summers, in a similar (but not identical) role, in the same location. They were offered $23/hour their first time around, and $24 their second. I realize that $22.95 and $23 aren't that much different, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way that they would offer me less than the norm at their company given that I had very similar credentials to other people interning there (except I have a higher GPA than the person I talked to, and I also have already done a previous internship, albeit with a different company)."
60bf1o,272,2017-03-19,Company banned Millennials [Illinois],thowawaymidwest,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/60bf1o/company_banned_millennials_illinois/,"I work in a small division of a large midwestern company - if you live within in the midwest, you almost certainly buy something from us. My company pays extremely well (I am only 3 years out of college and already at six figures - unusual in my industry). Working for this company is a major accomplishment in the industry, and getting let go from it will likely negatively influence your entire career.

Recently, the manager of our division (a VP) has been firing people with no warning for minor mistakes or policy violations. Over time, I noticed all the people fired were from my age group, and anybody older than us was never punished for the same mistakes. I pointed it out to my supervisor who said he would look into it. A month ago, he told me the reason the manager was firing people is because he said millennials are lazy and entitled and he doesn't want them in the company because they need too much ""hand-holding and baby sitting."" The VP said they are going to hold out for the next generation (some of our interns come from it). My supervisor said every time a millennial does something wrong, all they do is talk about how many problems they have, or how they have depression or anxiety or something else. Apparently, another division in the company is doing the same thing, the company is aware of it, and doesn't care. 

I told my supervisor they are going to piss off an entire generation, and he said, ""Half of them are unemployed - who cares?""

Is this discrimination and can I report them? Now that I have discussed this with my supervisor, I am worried I will be next."
60brv9,1,2017-03-19,Making the jump after ten years at my current job?,httr_247,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/60brv9/making_the_jump_after_ten_years_at_my_current_job/,"Hey all and thanks for taking the time to offer advice.

Background:

31 years old, married, no children (yet) financially stable 
Bachelor in Science in Engineering 
Currently work for a private civil engineering consulting company
Hourly wages at 84k a year plus around 5k in bonus (i am paid hourly with OT and worked approximately 2500 hours last year)
Mileage reimbursement with no vehicle stipend or gas card
My wife and I are currently insured through the company policy

I've been at my current job since the age of 19, started there with two internships while at college and was offered a position right out of college.

My company is a medium sized firm with approximately 100 plus people. I have worked in all different disciplines of the company with a ""whatever it takes"" type of attitude. I have had a couple opportunities to leave in the past as I had been offered positions at competitors firms. Every time I have came back and asked for more money my current company has came close to matching the amount offered but always promised a bigger picture of me progressing in the company. 

I have been assigned to a new division (construction) in the company last summer with a promise that there is a path for me to eventually become a manager and potential owner of the firm. Currently all owners are licensed engineers landscape architects,etc. Since my specialty is In construction I have the appropriate experience and credentials for me to oversee some of the largest projects my company designs without having a PE license. I have no desire to get my PE as that commits you to being a full time office person, whereas I enjoy spending a lot of time outside and negotiating with contractors and our clients. After seeing how things have been since I moved to my new position in the company I have serious doubts about my ability to grow within this company moving forward other then maybe 50 cent raises a year and marginal increases in my bonuses. There's a possibility of me becoming an owner in the company but it may be 5 to 10 years down the road. 

I was recently offered a project management position at a contractors firm who I have recently worked with on a project. The company is relatively new but they started on year one doing approximately 5 million in work their first season with a 150% workload increase into this year. I will essentially be on the ground floor of this firm with the opportunity to make my own destiny relative to my positioning in the firm (I would be one of two project managers/superintendents and essentially running the office side of things).

They have been able to offer me 90k a year salary with the expectation that I will be working between 2200 and 2500 hours a year (more so in the summer which is consistent with my current employer). I have been offered a vehicle stipend of 600 a month plus gas card or a company truck of my choosing with all mileage and maintenance being paid for. Bonuses will start around 10k a year depending upon performance and increase significantly as the company continues to produce. 

Deep down inside I'm ready to make a move to a new company particularly on the contracting side of my world as I knew speaking with my colleagues at other companies this is where the money is made. It's not unheard of for guys my age in this line of work making 110k with 15 to 20k in bonuses with more established firms and people who have ""put in the time at other organizations"". I'm also looking to me challenged more with larger responsibilities. As it sits now I've done great things for my company with little to no reward. 

Downsides:

If I make the move we will have to switch to my wife's insurance. Will cost slightly more but comparable benefits.
I currently get over 20 days of vacation time but due to the nature of the work the current offer on the table is for 14 days
Obviously uprooting everything I've known and the people (who for the most part I like) I've worked with for almost a decade. 

I'm just looking for some advice for some outsiders looking in what they would recommend. I have an appointment on Monday to see my potential new employers office space and my office I would be receiving contingent on my accepting the position. 

Another thing of note is that this new company would pay for my entire phone bill and new laptop. I currently am alloted a small phone bill stipend at my current position and use a company laptop. 

My gut is telling me it's time to make a jump now and try something new which may potentially allow me the ability to create my own destiny with this new firm. 

Thanks"

I'm a sophomore in college and it seems extremely unlikely that I am going to be having an internship this summer other than the two jobs which I currently have. I am wanting to beef up my resume and do some major coding over the summer.  
I saw some comments in other posts about GSoC. I looked up finished products from past years as well as some of the proposals and, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if I could have come up with the code that they had done. That kind of put a damper on my view of my coding skills, unfortunately.  
Nevertheless, i am going headstrong into attempting to further my knowledge and improve. So, now I am faced with a predicament. Seeing the GSoC stuff has me sheepish about what is actually out there on Github (granted, I haven't done too much looking around). I also know that my contribution should be quite major to anything which is open source. How major is that exactly? In terms of putting things on my resume, does contribution (major or minor) to an open source project carry more weight than a personal project of a similar stature (in terms of size and, possibly, complexity)? Also, looking at things such as hackathons/etc., where would I go about looking for those in my local area and what are the ones which are ""the best""?  
I'd like to incorporate all of these into my time over the summer to really give myself a strong boost to my, currently lackluster, resume in time for applying to internships at the start of fall. I'd also like to prioritize these things in terms of most beneficial to least beneficial to best make use of my time.  
My resume currently has education (expected 2019), a job in IT (8/2015-present), and an unrelated job (2011-present) with no personal projects. On my Github, I have code which is for scrum sprints in an open source project, but no additional material.  
*tl;dr* should I focus on contributing to open source projects in a small/large way, working on a personal project, or something else over the summer in order to best improve my resume."
60c2dk,1,2017-03-19,Worth going to uni still if offered a full time 60k+ Service Desk job at 19yo?,ScratchingMyBeard,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/60c2dk/worth_going_to_uni_still_if_offered_a_full_time/,"So last year I completed a full time (9-5) internship for 6 months on little pay (mainly for the experience) in an IT help desk role. I came into this internship after completing my first 6 months of my university degree in IT/Business double degree and the first hand experience i've had in my job has taught me much more than uni has. 

My employer which is a Government agency has recently offered me a full time position which pays 60k Australian $. At 19yo, I think this is quite a decent position to be in since many graduates out of 4 years of university do not make that. 

So I'm thinking whether it would be worth it to decline the offer and complete my university or take the job and hope for the best? Is experience more valuable than an education for the IT field? I'm looking into trying to get university to work part time but that wouldn't guarantee that I could work full time and my manager isn't honestly that flexible with hours.

I would like to eventually complete my university since I hope to open up my own small online business and would like to learn more business related skills such as banking/finances/trading/investing, etc.

Any advice/help is appreciated."

I might have the wonderful opportunity to work as an intern at Los Alamos. I have been looking on craigslist for housing, but I can't seem to find anything that is cheap. My main two priorities in finding summer housing are:

1. cost
2. closeness to lab

I would prefer to live in Los Alamos since it will be close to where I work (I will not have a car). I am willing to live in Santa Fe, as long as the bus is reliable enough to get me to where I need to go.

Does anyone know of any resources for short-term (12 week) housing this summer? I am currently only paying $275 + ~70 in utilities where I am currently at (a small college town in the east). I know that it will pretty much be impossible to find housing that cheap, but if I could find anything less than $500 near Los Alamos, I would be very happy.

EDIT:
Also, I will most likely be arriving in Late-May and staying until Mid-August (around 12 week)."

Both are companies that I might be interested in working at later on for full-time, so either of these seem like good ways to get my foot in the door. What worries me, though, is that I'm not sure if they (or other companies) will consider me for a future SWE internship or job because of the fact that the job I'll have had there is non-SWE, and it's experience but not specifically relevant to SWE.

60cmqa,8,2017-03-19,The Intern's Panties,Chews23,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/60cmqa/the_interns_panties/,"Working in an office with a host of beautiful woman runs from fantastic to awful. While it's amazing having stunningly hot females to gaze at all day and fantasise about banging, it can mean a lot of blue balls!

In recent months my eye candy of choice has been an Australian girl working in the office. She's the outdoorsy surfer type and has a body to kill for. Absolutely pert, perky breasts that are a good C to D cup, sitting on a toned athletic body. It helps that we flirt mercilessly, and she's totally filthy.

So to say I was disappointed when I found out that she had to go home for a month would be a serious understatement. Don't get me wrong, there are many other fine women at work, as I mentioned, but she's a special one. She's also my wank fantasy of choice at the moment. Usually in the work showers (I play tennis beside work but use the work changing rooms as they're nicer than the tennis club's).

As it turned out though, things wouldn't be too bad. Because it is just a month we would be getting someone in temporarily rather than hiring someone new. The decision was also made that because we are somewhat quiet at the moment we would get in an intern. In this case we would be joined by an early twenties college student on work experience.

When Siobhan first walked in I think every male jaw hit the ground. a few female ones too. She is bananas hot. Legs that go on forever and tits that are even nicer than Susan's (the Australian girl). Plus, she has the finest ass I've ever seen and she dresses like an early twenties girl going clubbing. So much skin! So much breast! So much leg!

A few of the projects I'm currently working on have components and tie-ins with partners in America and South America. As such I have been required to stay late a lot of evenings to wait for our regular conference call. This can sometimes mean sitting around surfing the net just killing time. On Monday evening I was on Facebook just looking at random stuff when I got a message from an old friend (a fuck buddy for a while). We had a small chat but she had to go. I got looking through our old messages and I found some really graphic ones we send eachother back when we were fucking.

I was instantly turned on. Reading her filthy messages gave me a huge hardon and I knew I'd need to see to it immediately. So I headed down to the changing room, knowing no one else was still in the building (I did give a few shout outs to make sure!).

Each side of the room had a row of lockers with a bench in front of it. They faced each other. I sat down on one and slid my pants down. My erection burst out of my boxers. Remembering the hard core sex that me and my friend used to have, I started stroking. Slowly. This was going to be a drawn out but massive orgasm and cum.

After a minute of two I noticed that directly opposite me hanging on the outside of one of the lockers was the clothes that Siobhan had been wearing that day. I stood up and walked to them. Still slowly stroking my hard cock. It was a low cut, high hem pants suit that was more suited to a slutty secretary costume than to a real office.

I lowered my head to her blouse and inhaled. It smelled of her. Not just her perfume but actually of her. What she had washed with and her own body'd smell from a days work. I went to lift her jacket off the hanger to get at her blouse better but it slid off the hanger as I did. As I awkwardly tried to put the jacket back on the hanger with one hand (the other still stroking my hard cock), it again fell.

This time I noticed a slight bulge in the inside pocket. I slipped my hand in and felt soft lace. Out of the pocket emerged her panties. Balled up and obviously placed there to be retrieved tomorrow. I wondered had she left work commando? It didn't really matter, I immediately realised I was holding the ultra hot intern's used panties. I raised the gusset to my nose and inhaled deeply. It smelled divine. Her pussy was sweet. And the panties almost felt a little damp. Was that why she took them off?

I sat back down and started stroking faster. I had planned on blowing my load in my hand but the moment took me and without realising, I was suddenly cumming a thick sticky load into those damp panties. Surely one of the biggest loads of my life and it was all over her panties. I lifted the panties back to my face. As I again drank in her beautiful smell, I let my load slide into my mouth. The taste combined with her smell and dampness was too much. My entire body rocked and my cock exploded again.

Needless to say, the panties came home with me. I filled them up again that night. And last night. And I'm pretty much about to do it again. I really hope I get to fuck her at some point!"

I'm pretty interested in the subject and enjoyed my time doing an internship at a local university. However looking around here it seems like it's pretty hard to get a job or internship. Although I'm not afraid of putting in work and enjoy programming, I don't feel like cs is my ""passion"" in as much as I don't have myriads of personal projects and such. It seems that the culture often expects people to invest a lot of personal time outside of work doing cs things. I suppose my question then is whether my impression correct, and is it possible to have cs as a career and not be totally 100% invested as my number 1 passion? Thanks."
60cuq8,2,2017-03-19,Delaying graduation by 4 months for another shot at top tech internship?,csguy12345,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60cuq8/delaying_graduation_by_4_months_for_another_shot/,"Hi, I'm currently a junior at a *non-waterloo* Canadian university. My goal is to get into a top tech company when I graduate.  I've done a 12 month software internship at a large company (but not prestigious) and will have another 4 month internship this summer with another large-but-not-prestigious company.

Obviously I need to work on my resume as I failed to get interviews with any top tech companies in the US. I'm afraid to apply again to full-time at the top companies in the Fall because if I fail again, then I'll have to take a full-time job for a year before applying again. I'm hoping to avoid that. 

**I was wondering if it's advisable to delay my graduation by 4 months (graduate December 2018 instead of May 2018) so I can take another shot at getting a top tech internship.** I feel like this will benefit me in 2 ways:

1. Even if I don't get a top tech internship for the extra internship I'm doing, it could help improve my resume more to increase my odds of getting interviews at top tech for full-time.

2. I'm pretty weak at coding interviews. If I attempt to get another top tech internship again it may give me more practice and even if I fail at getting the extra internship I'll have another chance when I apply for full-time and will already know what the top tech interviews are like.



Any advice or opinions would be appreciated.

Preferably in production, directing or the camera department. Sadly, I don't have any connections and have had no luck finding any internships in that field online. 

Do you guys have any tips? Is there like a local Vancouver website with internship ads or something similar? Is it even possible for a foreigner to get an internship like this in such a competitive industry?"

60d2vx,6,2017-03-19,Transferring from UCSD to UCLA for CS,transferthrowaway777,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/60d2vx/transferring_from_ucsd_to_ucla_for_cs/,"Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone has experience or insight on transferring from UCSD to UCLA. My gpa is a 3.8x with a very math and cs intensive schedule. I'm kind of worried about it because people are telling me it's super hard to transfer UC to UC, and that I usually need a darn good reason to as well.

Specifically, the transfer requirements site says that they need physics, but they're kind of vague on just how much physics I need. I took AP physics C and got 5's on both mechanics and electromagnetism. I'm guessing I probably still have to take some more physics courses and labs, but it seems really unclear on exactly how much. Do we have to hit every single transfer requirement to get considered?

My reason for transferring is that that I am not a CS major currently and the UCSD cs department is too impacted, and they are implementing a random lottery system on who gets to transfer in, with a low entry bar for the lottery(3.3). This means a huge number of people wanting to transfer and very few spots. It makes it a pretty ridiculous RNGfest to actually get into the major. My current major is actually something called Mathematics-Computer Science, which isn't a bad major since it hits all of the core reqs of the cs major here, and is still a great major for software engineering, and in fact the optimal major for any theoretical shizwiz/crypto/data science. But, many of more niche cs electives here at UCSD are locked to just cs majors, specifically Computer Networks and Computer Security(my primary fields of interest). Because of this I'm looking into applying to other schools next year. 

I'm also worried about how many EC's they expect me to have. In high school it was easy to fill out all of the ec's, but in college I can barely name 2 or 3 things since ec's take so much more time and commitment in college.(or am I the only one that feels this way?) 

In terms of side projects and skills, I have a decent amount amount, as my interest in networks/security led me to self-learn the network stack, tcp/ip, subnetting, and some basic pentesting stuff. I had work experience at Google last summer and have another internship lined up this summer as well.

Also, how is the research scene at UCLA? Is it difficult to find cs research as an undergrad?

tl;dr currently not a cs major at ucsd and it's too difficult to transfer internally which is why I'm looking to transfer schools. just looking for advice on what courses between now and transferring and advice in general on the process. Thank you."

60daul,2,2017-03-19,I feel so trapped and I hate myself and what I have not done in my life. I am only 22.,Dutchess-Gummybuns,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/60daul/i_feel_so_trapped_and_i_hate_myself_and_what_i/,"Here is basically my life story for the past 4-5 years. Warning - Wall of Text - will leave TLDR at bottom.

I went to University and graduated last year with a degree in History. My first year I moved into on campus residence, the people were party and drinking heavy....I am not. Looking back, they bullied me. I didnt fit in and I hated it. I wanted to drop out. I was shy and awkward and never made friends easily. 

For my 2nd year I lucked out hard on my current close friends. I needed a place to stay and just chose a place at random to live. Moved in and we fit in well. Very well. Same interests, accepted me and befriended me. These 3-4 people are my closest friends and other than some friendly co-workers, my only friends. I didnt drop out of school only because of them. I didnt enjoy the school, classes etc.

3rd year we stayed together. Had fun when we hung out. I look back on these 2 years and wish I enjoyed them more, been happier with my friends. I look back on this time with great nostalgia. 

But 4th year was different. They were all a year older, and had graduated while I was still there. I moved into another place, alone. The other roommates were never home and not people I would ever be friends with. I was severely depressed and alone. I went weeks without talking to anyone in person. I missed my old friends. 

I cried after my first day of classes and cried almost every night for months. I went on anti-depressants and saw a school therapist. She was very nice and helpful but in the end, it didnt help me. I never left my room except for classes and food, I thought I had no one to hang out with, nothing to do, no motivation, no work ethic. I didnt care. I almost failed every class and had to literally beg to pass my classes to graduate. This is the same guy who got A's in my earlier year classes. The same guy who was put into higher level classes and grades throughout my whole life.

My grades were so bad that last year it pulled down my average hard to the point of almost failing it all.

After 2 semesters of making some light friends in class, I was done school. Hooray right? No.

Next was getting a text from my mom saying when are my grad pictures coming in and when is my grad ceremony. I had to tell her I never took my grad photos and was not planning to go to my grad ceremony. I literally had no friends to go and enjoy it with. My mom sounded disappointed. This the same guy who never went to grade 12 prom or any parties really. 

So after a year of being so alone and depressed, I moved back home with 30k in debt and nothing but regrets with a useless History degree. I didnt even like History anymore, I only chose it because it was easy to me and it was my best class throughout my life.

I thought...I knew...that I wasted the best 4 years of my life. I would never have that opportunity again. I spent 4 years with literally thousands of young people and couldnt get more than 5 friends and especially no dates with girls. I went home a 21 year old kissless virgin with 30k in debt and nothing but regrets. I was on the verge of crying with my dad driving me home. Once I got home I went into my room and cried again, just like what I did at school.

Luckily I got a job after about a month of searching within walking distance. Just a part time, minimum wage retail job. Been working there for about 10 months now. It sucks but I've met some good coworkers and saved up most of my money by living rent free at home. With my parents paying half my loans, I only have about 3k left of student loans. I hope to be paid off in a couple months. Before summer ends. 

Back to my friends that I lived with. They are all living their life. Travelling, getting master degree's, dating. One of them moved to a school an hour away from my hometown while I was still in my 4th year of school. Where I have family there too. Hooray! She lived across the country for an internship the last year so obviously I never saw her. I thought I could see my friend again, hang out with her. 

Fast forward until now. Some 18 months later and I have seen her twice....TWICE. SHE LIVES AN HOUR AWAY FROM ME AND I HAVE SEEN HER TWICE IN ALMOST 2 YEARS. That first year I was at school. Like 5 hours away from her. But this last year, it's only an hour away. But its been so cold for winter and I dont have a car and I have been working to pay off my loans so I never saw her.

Today I learned she accepted a job in the UK. She says she will probably stay for 8 months. Leaving in September (Mid March now). 

And now I am sad for myself. I suffered through my last year at school only to come home to be even more depressed for ANOTHER year. All the while one of my good friends lived only an hour away. Why didnt I see her more, why why why. And now she will move away, across the world and I wont see her for ANOTHER year. And then she will move back here, probably not an hour away from me. She will get married to her longterm BF and move away and I'll never see her again, or it will be a huge event that takes weeks to prepare for. I miss living with her, just walking down to the living room and watching netflix or whenever. 

She isnt the only one. My other friends have gone away to UK, across the country etc. I have no car and a part time work schedule. I have not seen them since they graduated. I come home and sit in my room and be friendless just like that last year of school. Im so alone here. 

I dont know if I can take another year alone. If so, then we will have been separated longer than we were even living together. How depressing is that. With summer weather, im begging myself to see my friend an hour away as much as possible before she leaves. 

In the end, I have been friendless for almost 2 years and kicking myself for not seeing the 1 friend close to me more often. And soon she will leave me again to live her life while I am stuck at home....still. 

I feel trapped at home. I dont have a car I can take and drive to my friends, I go to work and come home and nothing in between. I feel trapped now like I did at school. Trapped in my room with nothing but regrets. 

I am 22 with no romantic experience, no world experience, barely any work experience, barely any friends, useless degree, no car, no place to call my own and I feel trapped and hate myself. Mostly for all the wasted time and lost possible experience. 

Oh, and my best friend and I had a falling out last July. Guess I forgot to mention that. His family moved across the country years ago but we kept in touch online and through video games. We talked everyday and were best friends for about 6-7 years. We got in a fight and I have tried reaching out again but I havent gotten a response since that July. Weird going from talking everyday to not hearing from them for 8 months.

When my loans are paid off, I hope to restart my life. I want my own place, I want a car so I can actually travel and see the people I want to. To see my friends, to not feel so trapped, to be so unhappy. I want a job that doesnt pay min wage and makes me not feel like a loser. I want to actually travel to Europe finally and just travel in general for the first time in a decade with my family. I want a relationship with a nice girl that wont laugh in my face when I ask her out (ugh, bad memories galore). I want to be physically fit again, I played AA hockey and baseball in my teens and if I continued and actually cared about them, I probably would have gotten a university scholarship. But I lacked confidence and I didnt care that much (or atleast that's what the coaches told me). These days, I can barely walk up the stairs without being out of breath. 

I dont care about retirement, I dont care about making 75k a year, I dont care about becoming famous or successful. I dont care about savings, I dont care about owning a mansion or having the status to look down upon lessers in society. 

I want to be happy for the first time in my whole life. I want to see my friends whenever I want. I want to be the guy you can call at 3am to pick you up in the middle of nowhere when your car breaks down and instead of being annoyed, be happy to hear from you. I want to have dreams again. I want to be a awesome uncle to my 18 month old niece. I dont want to not see my friends for 2 years. 

I only hope its not too late. All I hear about adulthood is that it is much harder to meet friends, get relationships, to see old friends often and not have it take months of planning. No one really wants to be with a 22 year old kissless virgin....let alone 23,24,25 etc

I only hope I am strong enough. That I wont give up like most things in my life. I havent been strong enough yet, so who knows if I will be in a couple months when I have no loans.

**TLDR**: Not happy whole life. Hated school but loved the handful of friends I made during. Graduated and havent seen them as much as I wanted to. When my loans are paid off, I want to be happy. I hope its not too late. "

I haven't been a kid for the past six years of my life. My high school career ended before it even started.

Every summer was filled with studying, internships, camps, and more studying so that I can have a better shot at college. During the school year, I naturally took the most rigorous schedule possible with tons of extracurricular competitions and clubs, this left me under stress from August until May every year, after which I would get stressed out some more by my rigorous summer routines. I've always wanted to get into MIT, which is why I pushed myself so hard doing a lot of extracurricular stuff and self-studying everything that I would need to succeed in my extracurriculars at an accelerated pace.

As a result of my busy schedule, I was left with a small circle of friends that I'm not very close with. I'm not socially awkward or anything, and can hold a reasonable conversation with peers, adults, and the like (pretty witty too, at times). But when I got rejected from MIT, I felt like my entire world crashed down. I felt like I've just wasted my entire high school. I basically missed the entire social aspect of high school for nothing. I know Ivy day is coming up and I still have a shot at redeeming myself, but even if I get in, I would still have a large hole in my youth that no one else has.

Prom is coming up in two months, and it occurred to me that I've never been to a single school dance or a single football or basketball game. I'm a decently looking guy, had a few girls confess their crushes(back in sophomore and junior year), but I just basically told myself no dating because getting into a good school is too important. So I have no experience with anything. I've never even held a girl's hand.

I don't think I can find a date for prom and I'm probably going to be remembered as that loser in high school. Should I even try prom at this point?

Freshmen, don't be like me. **Work to live, don't live to work.**

edit: wow thanks guys for all the support! I never expected to see so many people respond to my troubles. Best of luck to you guys too in whatever you guys decide to pursue senior year!"

I've got great academic standing (3.9 GPA), and did research at my university last summer. I'm trying to find programs that a best for math majors who want to go onto grad school, and am not sure what to apply to outside of a handful of REUs.

Are there any good options that are not obvious? For example, I just recently learned ""Quantitative Analyst"" is industry for ""math background plz"".

Currently, I'm teaching myself discreet math and proofs from a few textbooks my Calculus teacher gave me. This is mainly because I've heard that the university I'm going to (University of Toronto) has a fairly hard curriculum, and I'm hoping the head start on those two concepts will up my chances of doing well in some of the Math courses.

Additionally, I'm planning on doing a side project over the summer. I made a very small one last year with Ruby on Rails, although I haven't done anything in Rails since then, so I guess I'll have to re-learn a lot of stuff.

However, aside from getting ready for the math courses and doing a side project, what else can I do to maximize my chances of getting a job in first year? I was thinking about volunteering over the summer as well, although I'm not sure where. 

Does anybody have any suggestions?

60eamp,0,2017-03-19,Question about job titles on resume/background check,troo00,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60eamp/question_about_job_titles_on_resumebackground/,"Hi All. I recently received an accepted an offer for a summer internship for a pretty big tech company. I am now a little worried because when I applied, on my resume, I listed my previous internship title as ""Software Engineering Intern""; the actual title was something like ""Student Technology Intern"".

I changed the title for my resume since ""Software Engineering intern"" is a more industry standard title, and would avoid the confusion/vagueness of the ""Student Technology Intern"" title.

My previous role, however, was for all intents and purposes, a software engineering intern role. My mentors and bosses were all software engineers, the project I did was proposed by software engineers, I worked closely with other software engineers and built tools that they would use in their projects, etc. 

Is this a big issue/will anyone care or am I worrying too much? Thanks"
60ebpf,9,2017-03-19,22 T4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster in Waiting,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/60ebpf/22_t4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_in_waiting/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom condominium in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER first - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kind-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *The Niece:* You wouldn't exactly call your Aunt Sarah your ""cool"" aunt, but she certainly tries. To call her an aunt wouldn't exactly be accurate either, seeing as she's actually your mother's cousin, but she's always been a close friend of your family. She's taken a keen interest in your life, and growing up, she was at almost every recital and competition you've ever participated in. From what you've overheard, it seems that Aunt Sarah can't have children of her own for some reason, which always made you feel kind of sad for her. That said, after finding that out, you decided to spend more time with your aunt, letting her drive you home after school, eating dinner at her place on occasion, even having a ""gals only"" movie night every other weekend. Sarah always seems to enjoy the company, and to be honest, so have you... And maybe, *maybe*, you've started to feel something more...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

I am also a junior, so this summer will be the summer into my senior year. I've done multiple of my own projects. However they have all been personal projects, and, as a result, many of them lack proper documentation, actual use, and readability. My desire is to gain some experience in the field, but I feel that my age and self-taught knowledge is a major problem. 

I self-taught myself programing through Youtube videos in middle school and coded what I wanted with my free time. But the fact that I learned a language and its syntax rather than actual programming concepts concerns me. I fear that I might be missing some crucial piece of information that may seem basic to a first year CS student, but something I've completely overlooked. Also, there are a substantial amount of subjects of which I have little to no familiarity with ie. Machine Learning, Computer Architechture, Functional Programing.... I feel that these gaps in knowledge would be a major turn off. Since I have had no experience in a large team, I am also worried that my coding practices might become an issue.

My age is also something I'm afraid of. I understand that age shouldn't be a limiting factor, but let's be honest, it is. There is no doubt I wouldn't get the same respect, and I am scared of being considered a burden on a team. I am unsure whether or not my ideas or questions would be heard, and what my status on a team would be like. Would I do actual work, or would I be the coffee boy?

Also the matter of finding an actual internship at a company I would like to work at. A quick Google search brings up some awkward job listings on Indeed which all require a High School diploma. The criteria of a Summer High School Internship seems to be filled with ""Expert Social Media Advisors"".

TLDR: As a highschool student, where and how can I find a summer software developer internship?

60ewi9,1,2017-03-20,Should I stay hungry and keep looking for internships or be happy with where I am currently?,cscareerdev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60ewi9/should_i_stay_hungry_and_keep_looking_for/,"Starting my whole journey into CS after 3 years of post college work, I had an aspiration to work at one of the big 4 or one of those tech companies everyone else and their mom talks about. I still do, but I would say I am a bit more realistic (its no longer all that matters to me). I applied to several companies for summer internships during winter break and heard back from Hulu and Amazon. Needless to say I was stoked that these companies got back to me when a year or so ago all I got was rejections from them (and similar companies). Like before, however, I wasn't able to get past the first round. I had a shot at Amazon but couldn't figure out how to reverse the 2nd half of a linked list and as such wasn't able to get past their 2nd assessment. 



After some missed opportunities, I finally landed my first job, an internship at a small, local company. I like the environment, the work I do is interesting enough, and the people are cool. But *its not Google, its not Microsoft, its not Facebook, and neither is it Amazon*. 



My current internship isn't defined. Its seems like I could be working there for as long as I want really. But speaking to friends I have at school who got that internship at Amazon, I keep kicking myself. Its for two reasons really: the fact that I could be making 2x as much and that I would have that big name on my resume. And for these reasons, I am still applying to any big company I can for the summer, even though its March. But with all the extra work of applying and interviewing (I've got an IBM assessment to do), it makes me think if all this is really necessary.



Should I really be always looking for better opportunities or should I just let it eventually come to me (who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll be at Google)? Should I just be happy where I am at, and focus on work and school (grad school)?



I'm always trying to make myself better, yet I feel I might be too hard on myself, and should simply be happy with where I am at, even if I go to a state school and don't work at the big 4."
60f0yk,2,2017-03-20,I feel like I'm wasting away at my job,Lostindoubts,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/60f0yk/i_feel_like_im_wasting_away_at_my_job/,"I am a 23 year old graduate with a bachelors in Econ. After graduation I was unable to get a job for TWO years because of not completing any internships. 

Now before you jump to any conclusions I had to work to support myself and my family (in retail) which took up all my free time which in turn also caused my grades to suffer. (I held that job for a total of 5 years and thought that the experience would suffice for my entry level position after graduation)

Fast forward to beginning of this year, I have a job land in my lap through some people I know. Without hesitation I accepted. The pay is just under 25k a year, and I get paid on the hourly basis. I could've been paid double that at the previous job if I asked to be put on full time, but it was extremely physically demanding and I thought I needed something to start my career. 

In the last few months I showed that I am more than competent and had a flood of work thrown at me which at this point I cannot keep up with. I am back logged for over a weeks worth of work and they are expecting me to start learning and performing new things. Management knows this is an issue but seems to ignore it. 

I feel like I'm trapped with terrible pay doing work I am not ""certified"" to do. My goal was to use this to build my resume to jump into the finance field but I don't know how I would go about doing that.

it is basically paralegal work dealing with finance cases. I want to get out because it feels like there is literally no growth for me here. Sure I can learn a few things here and there but I already see how things operate and how everything is handled and I'm not happy about it. Management is cutting corners. I feel like I cannot grow passed a legal assistant position here and don't want to be doing this for the rest of my life. The work feels dull and brainless and I don't feel like I'm being challenged at all. I understand that things can be overwhelming, please don't tell me that because I single handedly operated daily business operations on my previous job and know what stress feels like.

I feel like if I start looking for something else, then I'm a terrible person because they hired me. But at the same time I feel like I am wasting away. I know that my inability to get a job for two years to start my career is what is causing me to feel like this, but at the same time I don't know where to turn and how to go about things.

For some context I work in NYC."

I was set up with my current girlfriend fifteen months ago during winter break of my senior year in college. We hit it off almost instantly and started dating shortly thereafter. I've never had a girlfriend before her, but I can safely say that our relationship is awesome. She's my best friend and we can talk with each other about anything. She supports me regardless of what I want to do, no matter how ""geeky"" (one time she paid for my VIP ticket to Comic-Con--I'll always love her for that). At the same time, she pushes me to get off my ass and become a better person. When I met her I was jaded and wandering around aimlessly in life, but since then she's forced me to square away my resume and LinkedIn, network like crazy, find opportunities, and fulfill my dream of applying to medical school. Another important thing is that while we sometimes disagree on things, we're always able to talk out our differences. In all my time with her we've never had to raise voices even once.

Even though we've only been together just over a year, it feels a lot longer because of all the things we've been through. Since we started dating, we survived six months of long distance while I finished up college and army BOLC. She's also helped me through the death of my father last April, which was one of the hardest times of my life. For my part I've helped her cope with the anxiety from her internship and pushed her to do something with her passion for writing (she's now written three articles for local media and has a blog with thousands of viewers--I couldn't be more proud of her). 

As of now we've been living together for a few months, while I apply to medical school and she wraps up her internship before applying to business school. Neither of us knows where we're going to be a year from now, and that scares me a little because I don't think anyone can survive years of long distance, no matter how good the relationship is. Which brings me to the crazy idea that I just thought of tonight--what's stopping us from just getting engaged now? We're in love, have a good thing going financially, the sex is still amazing, and I know that I want to be with her for the rest of my life, regardless of where we end up next year. What more do you really need?

Feel free to offer your support or talk me off the ledge Reddit, I'll take any advice I can get.


Tl;Dr: I'm 22, six months out of college, employed, and have been dating the most amazing girlfriend for 15 months now. I want to propose while we're still together, before graduate school possibly complicates things. Is this a good idea?

I'm starting to have a hard time growing up and really miss being  a child. I am currently in the last year of my study and following a 40-hour internship. If all goes well I will be done in a few months and 'ready' to start working. But the more I start transitioning into the adult life, the more I miss being a kid. It sounds sad but I really miss not having any big responsibilities, being able to hang out with friends at and after school, being ignorant about all the terrible things going on in the world and not having to spend my entire week working and being tired. 

When I started studying and living on my own I really enjoyed it. no parents complaining about gaming and watching tv too much or coming home too late. Deciding what to eat and what to spend my money on. Only having to go to school like half the hours of my middle school. It was awesome. But now the good days of studying are over.. I've grown lazy and unhappy.. Looking forward to getting a fulltime job and living in a world where ignorance and cruelty against animals and humans are common and accepted by many is just really depressing. It's just really hard to imagine becoming a happy person and I'm already looking forward to retirement. I'm currently in a relationship that has been struggling for over half a year and I feel really guilty because my girlfriend wants to be with me more then anything while I'm having a lot of doubt and losing the 'in love feeling'.

I can go on about what makes makes me unhappy but don't think that necessary. The things I still enjoy are nature (especially animals), gaming and hanging out with friends (though i'm seeing them less and less and I feel like I'm having a harder time acting social and happy when I'm around). As I mentioned earlier I really became lazy and tired. I try to exercise more and become more socially active but at the end of every day I come home, have to make and eat dinner and just feel like not doing anything so I usually watch (nature) documentaries, play league of legends or watch a movie and go to bed early.

Again, sorry for the long post.. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

tl;dr: I really dislike growing up and am not looking forward to my future. I really value my free time and working all day makes me tired and unhappy. I used to be happy as a kid, not anymore. How can I become happier?"
60fkwc,1,2017-03-20,"Math majors, how is it? Any regrets?",TheEternalThrowaway,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/60fkwc/math_majors_how_is_it_any_regrets/,"I'm a high school junior looking at colleges right now and I still don't know what to major in.

I'm wondering if math is for me. I originally wanted to major in engineering because I liked science and math. Then I realized I *only* liked engineering because of science and math and didn't like the non-science and math parts. So then I decided to major in physics because I liked math. But now in my AP Physics class I've come to the realization that I only like the parts of physics that involve math and not the other parts. So that leaves me with one thing. Math has always been my easiest subject, it's just one of those things that clicks. Like some people are just naturally good at art, or music, or writing, for me it's math. Obviously a lot of kids say that and college math is a lot (a lot) harder, but I'm taking AP Calc next year and I already have a basic grasp on the subject. Still, I know it's much harder in college, but I'd rather do that than something else I don't like. Plus I read somewhere that math is on the easier side as a major because other STEM majors learn math concepts in isolation while math majors have them all connected in sequence. So there's that. Anyway, I have a few questions:

1. How busy is your schedule compared to engineering and science majors? Do you have a lot of room for electives or non-math classes?

2. How hard is it to you? Do you have any favorite/least favorite parts of the major?

3. How are the job prospects? I'd imagine they're pretty broad, but I'm most interested in going into business/finance with the major. Would a double major in econ and/or a concentration in applied math work well for this? 

4. What do you do for internships? Is it work in math or work in something like research or engineering or business?

5. Any regrets? Do you wish you majored in something else? Do you wish you tacked on a double major or a minor?

Thanks in advance for your great answers"
60flkp,2,2017-03-20,Feel like getting a CS degree is making me less qualified to employers,sutehk,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/60flkp/feel_like_getting_a_cs_degree_is_making_me_less/,"I've been personally developing since 2005, and since 2012 I've had 3 jobs and started two consulting companies (in two different countries). Currently have a full time 40/hour week Rails/Reactjs job for over a year but once I graduate they want to give me a 20% pay cut (down to a CS graduates salary) and hire me on salaried (which stings) - the decision is made by people who have never worked with me.

Also I feel like seeing a 2017 graduation makes me look less qualified than not having a degree at all, and I've had people ask if I was only an ""intern"" a lot because I'm currently finishing my degree. Only reason I am doing the degree is because in the midwest it seems that piece of paper is often worth more than actual experience and also it is practically free to do my degree. 

I am a full time student and full time (well 40 hours) employee as well as consulting 10-20 hours a week. I often spend about 80-100 hours a week on education/work.

I haven't applied for any other jobs, and somewhat worried I may be seen as under-qualified because of my graduation date. Also there are only 20-30 developer jobs in a 25 mile radius of where I live and I've met most of the people holding them. I've considered remote jobs and I feel like that is very difficult because they will get dissuaded by my degree on my resume. If they meet me or see my work I'm sure they will like my work!

Does anyone else feel like a CS degree makes them less qualified than experience?"

I'm a female CS student about to graduate in May. I'd like to find an internship in Stockholm/Uppsala between my bachelors and masters (hopefully at KTH!). How feasible is this? I am an American and I sadly only know a few words of Swedish at this time. 

Also, how are Swedish tech internships usually structured timewise? In America they are seasonal, so I could get an internship that lasts 3 months starting in summer, fall, or winter. If this was an American internship I'd be looking for a fall or winter internship, but I'm not sure what I should be asking for in Sweden. "
60fzfh,34,2017-03-20,How to Get Wrecked at the South Bund Tailor Market,Speekgeech,shanghai,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/60fzfh/how_to_get_wrecked_at_the_south_bund_tailor_market/,"I purchased two suits (jacket &amp; pants) at the tailor market for 3400RMB. Basically, I got reamed up the butt. Here's how you can too!

**1. Let someone bargain on your behalf.**
I went to get two suits made at No. 129 (Joyce and Rita's -- recommended by family friend) accompanied with my Shanghainese relatives. Of course, they insist that I am not as familiar with local customs and decide to chatter away in Shanghainese on my behalf. BIG MISTAKE. The tailor market is filled with equal opportunity scammers. *Laowai* and Chinese-passing people will be equally railed and given outlandish prices.

For ABC/CBC/X-BCs out there, if they offer you or your relatives the ""Chinese"" price and wax poetic about how expensive material costs nowadays and how things were so much cheaper during the 2nd century, tell them to GTFO. If you don't fall into the range of 500 to 1000RMB for a two-piece (assuming no additional bulk-buy discounts) suit, you are getting railed.  Stay strong, *pengyou*. Don't be like me and let saving the *mianzi* of overconfident family get in the way of the deal. Nothing gets in the way of the deal.

**2. Going with other people.**
Already mentioned that letting someone negotiate for you is a big no. I made the mistake of being accompanied by two elderly people who are old-school, inexperienced, and impatient. You'll have additional pressure to agree to terrible deals like yours truly if you have time pressure from your impatient friends.  

I would seriously recommend you ditching your companions (even if you are aiming for a bulk discount, you can find them later). Seriously, take your sweet time. In fact, if there are other customers waiting, take forever to feel the sample clothes on the mannequins like you were born to be a *biantai*. Flip the tables by making the shopkeeper want to get rid of you ASAP because they want to be able to take more orders. If there are obvious *laowai* around who are picking up orders or in the stall you are exploring, straight-up ask them what they paid in your language of choice. They probably don't give a shit and will reveal the shopkeeper's hand.

**3. Have no friends.**
Talk to people (esp. any *laowai* you notice speaking fluent Chinese). Ask them what they paid and about the quality of the items, especially if you show up when someone is picking up orders. 

When bargaining, heck, make up friends. Do you even know how much daily business these stalls get? It's completely bonkers (so it is safe to say all these clothes get tailored in a factory). Talk about your friend Mark who was here for an internship who got a nice three-piece suit for 650RMB or QiuQiu who got blouses for 90RMB each. Literally make people up. Just use basic names and you are sure to get a hit. Talk about the 1st floor tailor you messaged on WeChat who offered a range of 500-900RMB for a suit (true story, messaged her 3/20/17, but too late for this buyers-remorseful dumbass). 

**4. Don't buy off-the-rack.**
I know we all visit this place because you can get everything custom and have your S.O.'s name embroidered on your qipao and the buttonholes of your wedding tuxedo done in lime green, etc etc. That's great and all, but I would speed-walk through the whole building and look for clothing racks outside of stalls. On more than one occasion, I've seen clothing samples discounted. Have gotten a raincoat / trench in my size for ~200 RMB and have seen heavy wool coat samples hanging on a rack selling for 300RMB a piece. Try some stuff on. If you get lucky, you can find a perfect fit (and skip much of the tailoring/haggling bamboozle). If something is too big, just get it tailored for cheap. I would guess that these clothing sample discounts happen more (and on easy-to-locate racks) during seasonal changes. That said, if you see a clothing sample on a mannequin in your size (or slightly larger) that you like, I would go and ask for a quote. Then offer something in the range of 50-250RMB, and chances are, you get a great deal with minimal time loss. 

**Useful Info**
I obsessively read forums and reviews when I'm upset about something, so let me do a public service and provide some recent pricing info: 

Men's/Women's Two-Piece Suit: 500-900RMB

Silk Shirt / Dress - ~250RMB

Cashmere Coat - ~600RMB 

Button-up Shirt - ~100RMB

Basic rule of thumb is to stay below $150USD. They'll still be making money, don't worry.

[Note: Negotiate for a super basic suit with no bells and whistles and push them until they give you a low price. Do the whole walking-out thing. Look ambivalent. Low-ball at 400RMB. Tell them that your job isn't that formal, you're not in a rush, you have too many clothes, etc. Once you get your desired price, suddenly remember all the doohickeys you want added. Fancy design elements should trigger minimal, if any, price bumps (barring embroidery). Go get your own buttons on the top floor -- there's a stand that sells them there (there's actually a whole findings/button market not too far away closer to *ChengHuangMiao* for your button fetish). The only genuine reason you should accept a higher price is for a higher grade material - that's legitimate.]

Another tip might be to add tailors on WeChat (if you use WeChat / aren't in a terrible rush) on your first visit and negotiate pricing through messages. If the price isn't low enough, just don't go. If it is, go in person with your designs / to pick. The place is really bus-accessible, so you'll only drop 4RMB round-trip.

*Edit: Obviously annoyed about experience but I'm only hoping that this is useful info to other schmucks like myself! I sometimes have a hard time finding recent pricing :)"
60g9kc,3,2017-03-20,The Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays,WriteToCollege,CollegeEssayReview,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssayReview/comments/60g9kc/the_top_ten_mistakes_students_make_on_their/,"The following should help you...
Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays 

It is important to first understand the purpose of the college application essay. A student’s transcripts as well as his academic and extra-curricular achievements do not give any unique insight into the student as a person. Yes….they will illustrate hard work, intelligence, drive, aptitude, etc. However, these are the same attributes reflected in the other 30,000 applications for the same institution. I know that grandpa says, “No one is as perfect as my granddaughter” but in this arena….the obvious is commonplace. 

Quick Reality Check:
Class of 2020
Harvard: 39,041 applicants 2,037 accepted, Yale: 31,455 applicants 1,972 accepted Princeton: 29,303 applicants 1,894 accepted M.I.T 19,292 applicants 1,485 accepted Columbia – 36,292 applicants 2193 accepted UPenn 38,918 applicants 3,661 accepted
Harvard turned down 500 students with 2400 on the SAT and…. 1,100 students were turned down with 800 on SAT Math Component.

DON’T BE DEPRESSED….
Simply put, essays help the admissions office evaluate your potential to fit into their school’s community and culture as a person. (Not as a student….not as club president….not as the driving force for raising money with a dance-a-thon or relay-for-life team and not as a swimmer who placed first in his county). Once again…the 30,000 other students….many of whom were driven to get 2400 on their SAT were also club presidents and competitors who gave their time to charity work….if not a kidney. 
Just remember, you parents aren’t the only ones with a bumper sticker that reads, “My child is an Honor Student.”

TOP TEN MISTAKES…
1) Writing about academic accomplishments. 
a) Deja Vu: These accomplishments are on your transcripts. The admissions officer already knows you achieved high marks in twelve AP classes.
b) Birds of a feather flock together: Remember your best friend when you were in the 6th grade? You drifted apart in high school once you started getting straight A’s and your friend ended up on America’s Most Wanted. The two of you aren’t applying to the same schools. On the other hand, everyone who is applying has similar or identical academic accomplishments as you do 
• Similar Classes / Similar Grades / Similar Test Scores / Similar Extra Curricular Activities: President of Physics Club, Class President, Swim Team Captain, 1st Violin in School Orchestra, Yearbook Editor, Mathletes Captain, 1000 hours of community service.
Academic accomplishments don’t tell the school anything about you as a PERSON… …as an INDIVIDUAL. It’s no different than stating the obvious… “I am smart.”

2) Trying too hard to appear intellectual.
a) I can curse in twenty languages: A thesaurus is not necessarily your friend. Using words like, “plethora” or “myriad” only serve to drive an admissions officer to early retirement. You need not swallow a thesaurus to “sound” intelligent.
This comes from The University of Virginia: An actual excerpt from a TERRIBLE essay…. 
“From an early age, we accept death as the inevitable, but do not comprehend its actual denotation. Death is the impending future that all people must eventually grasp. In my early teens, my grandfather tragically perished. As a youth who did not identify with such a cataclysm I was saturated with various emotions. Initially, I was grieved by the loss of a loved one and could not understand why this calamity had to befall upon my family. I always considered death to have a devastating effect, but was shocked by the emotional strain it places upon an individual.” 
Do you get any sense of the PERSON who wrote this? It’s just a collection of clichés put together with “Ten dollar words.” I get NO insight into this teen as an INDIVIDUAL. 
b) That Pythagoras was no square: You don’t need to discuss your love of Shakespeare or Milton if it’s not true and you think it sounds better than discussing the merits of the Twilight series. On the other hand, if you’re reading Fifty Shades of Grey you have bigger issues to worry about than what college you get into.
c) Eszopiclone, Ramelteon, Triazolam, Zaleplon, Zolpidem: There are enough sleeping pills on the market so the admissions officer doesn’t need an essay to put him to sleep. I am not suggesting that the essay rival that of a SNL monologue but it can’t be boring either. You can write about something as dry as my mother-in-law’s Thanksgiving turkey but it needs to sound interesting in story, sub-text, personality, connotation, sentence length, syntax, and unique in perspective. 

3) Trying too hard to appear creative. There is a good reason the common application topics changed a few years ago, removing “A Topic of Your Choice.” Too many came across as pretentious, clichéd, and desperate (trying
too hard) in an attempt to “stand out.” These aren’t creative writing assignments. They aren’t
looking for “clever,” they are looking for YOU.
A few bad examples…
• Sweat dripped from my brow as the proctor meticulously handed out the nationally recognized assessment examination. My pulse raced and my heart pounded through my chest…
• It was a cold and dreary night when I first arrived in London. I could hear the faint whispers of the Bard himself beckoning me to the Globe Theater. 
• It was all up to me. Bases loaded with two men out in the bottom of the ninth. We were suffering a dearth of three runs. I dug my cleats into the dusty granules of dirt, held my bat firmly and watched for the pitch like an eagle watches for its prey. 

4) Taking a generic approach. Stay far away from these types of clichés. 
a) Check the basement for Pods or Avoid clichés like the plague. i) “I’m hardworking, ambitious, and driven.” ii) “I love to be challenged.” iii) “I am intellectually curious.” iv) “My peers often look to me for leadership.” v) “My grandfather’s death made me want to be a doctor.” vi) “I want to make a difference in the world.”

5) My Major interest is to Major in Chemistry
• No matter which common application question you choose, don’t write about what you plan on majoring in. Let’s say you want to be a Chemistry major. (My homage to Heisenberg and Breaking Bad) Your resume is filled with AP Chemistry, internships and summer programs in chemistry, chemistry clubs, etc. And now you write that the place you are most comfortable is in a Chemistry Lab??????? You appear one-dimensional. You don’t look like a well-rounded person with multiple interests, perspectives, etc
• Most colleges have supplemental essays….one of which asks why this major. If your main essay is about your major….what will you write for the supplemental essay? It will appear repetitive and further promote you as a one-dimensional person. 

6) Not understanding the true point of the essay.
a) I can touch my nose with my tongue: What makes you unique and not like every other student who is applying?
b) When I was five, I was abducted by Aliens: What life experiences imply that you will fit in academically and socially? 

7) Not reading the school’s website. 
a) I want to go to (Name of School Here): “I want to go to NYU because it is in New York City and I want that city experience.” There are more than TWENTY colleges in New York City….so why specifically NYU? What does NYU offer that all the other institutions don’t offer?
b) Professor Smith’s maiden name was Quackenbush: Read through the school’s website and discover that 80% of the faculty are Nobel Prize Winners, that there are 250 clubs and the school provides internships in Papua New Guinea. But don’t write this. Be specific as to what internships and why….and what clubs and why…BE SPECIFIC 
*Don’t cut and paste. Don’t plagiarize. Don’t regurgitate the website’s stats. Merely show the admissions officer that you KNOW the school and what makes the school UNIQUE.
Don’t use the website information to sound like you are working in their advertising department. Here is an example of that….as well as too many clichés to count. (That itself is a cliché) 
Penn Nursing’s motto, “Care to Change the World,” speaks to who I am. I want to be that nurse practitioner who impacts families, who betters society, and who makes a difference. I want to be that PNP who smiles, who makes children feel comfortable, and who heals.
And Penn’s School of Nursing will help me achieve that goal. Where else can you gain clinical exposure in the sophomore year with access to world-class hospitals, such as The Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania? Where else do you have the opportunity to engage in real-world research, like at LIFE, and improve quality of elder care?
But practical experience is just one side of the double helix of education. The rigor of Penn’s academic curriculum also calls my name. The emphasis on leadership appeals to me. 
BE SPECIFIC Why do you want to go to our school? What are the SPECIFIC things the school says about….Academics, Internships, Clubs, Organizations and Traditions that appeals to you? And SPECIFICALLY WHY? 
DON’T KISS THEIR $#$@%. Why do you want to go to our school? Telling them it’s a prestigious university with distinguished professors, unparalleled resources and a spectacular campus tells them nothing that they don’t already know…and you sound like a Kiss Up!

8) Forgetting that you are unique. 
You didn’t have to be abducted by aliens, or work with terminally ill dolphins. It’s about you as a teenager. Not a student, an athlete, a volunteer. Just as a citizen, a sibling, a son, a social animal, a human being Clarifying Points
Although these are overused and clichéd topics…(The SEVEN DEADLY SINS)….
i) Vacation: Club Med / Costa Rica/ Cruise ii) Sports Injuries iii) Death iv) Disease v) Divorce vi) Disorders vii) Relationship break-ups

9) THEY ARE FINE IF your perspective is UNIQUE!!!!!!!!!
• It’s Okay to Fail • How I discovered my love of science when all I really wanted to do was impress a girl in class.
IT’S NOT THE ACTIVITY…IT’S YOU IN THE ACTIVITY. It’s not about being a member of the swim team because you swim. It’s about the relationships you developed, the life lessons you’ve learned…without the “hard work” and “driven to win” stuff. This applies to everything you write about. It’s about YOU in the topic…not about the topic. 

10) DON’T BE NEGATIVE: 
Word Choice is extremely important. The following “sound-bytes” come from a first draft. The girl is writing about being a Muslim in a Post- 9/11 world. Notice the language. • “Faced the same abuse…” • “Soiled Muslim image…” • “Erase the grime…” • “When others realized that I was human…I acknowledged it as well.” • “Forced to go through the motions of being a Muslim…” • “Face the realities of the world…” • “A religion with a tarnished image…” • “Ease the burden of future generations…” Same essay….nothing in the content was lost. Notice the word choice now. • “A sense of self-respect and pride…” • “Love and kindness...family…Muslim community…” • “Perceptions can be changed with honesty, patience and education…” • “Misguided information…” • “Erase the stigma…” • “Defuse myths and assumptions with a smile and understanding demeanor…” • “Supportive friends from all backgrounds who believe…in tolerance.” • “I aspire to further promote the positive reality…and acceptance…”

Read it below.*

Inspired by the [story](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bosnian-everton-fan-attending-first-11964366) of r/soccer's u/SpacemasterTom, who sent 92 e-mails to every England's professional soccer team asking them why he should be their fan, which eventually earned him trip to Liverpool, because he chose Everton FC and then he attended their match and lots of English media wrote about him and his reddit thread. 

I'm from Croatia and I don't know a thing about baseball, but since the new season is almost here, I want to fulfil my dream of becoming a baseball fan, since I'm already a big fan of NBA and NFL. I thought that following and supporting one MLB team would be the best way for me to understand the rules and everything connected with baseball. But since I don't live in the USA, I don't feel connected to any team. So, I thought I'll do the same thing as u/SpacemasterTom and I sent 30 e-mails to every MLB team asking them why should I be their long-life supporter. Only seven teams responded in one week (others sent automatic responses or nothing at all): 

From **AL East**: [Baltimore Orioles](http://imgur.com/)  	
From **AL Central**: [Cleveland Indians](http://imgur.com/xlpwtT0)  
From **AL West**: [Seattle Mariners](http://imgur.com/09XGAdm)	

From **NL East**: [Miami Marlins](http://imgur.com/32rhZjA), [Philadelphia Phillies](http://imgur.com/KgDZRF2), [Washington Nationals](http://imgur.com/PYQdwDf)  
From **NL Central**: [Milwaukee Brewers](http://imgur.com/DlMIZw1)  
From **NL West**: [LA Dodgers](http://imgur.com/yrN6GSB)

*In order of their reply*:

**Miami Marlins**  
Hi (sesve),
 
Here are a few of reasons you should be a Marlins lifelong supporter:
 
* The Marlins is the second newest stadium in the MLB. It is a massive building, filled with great baseball, excited fans and has joy radiating from the field all the way up to our nose bleed section.
* Miami is one of the most electric, diverse, entertaining cities in the world. Support for our Marlins, is support for Miami.
* Billy the Marlin, our mascot, is goofy, adorable and is blatantly superior to all other major league mascots.
* Our ticket exchange program is the best program in Major League Baseball; it allows you to exchange any season tickets for any game, at any time to fit your personalized schedule.
* We are currently hosting the World Baseball Classic, a global event that has cultivated fans from near and far.
* We have tons and tons of events that come through our park every month. Including but not limited to: Race of Champions, WBC, Guns N Roses concert, the MLB All-Star Game and more!
* We offer many pricing plans and seating options to satisfy anyone’s wants and needs. Our best seats are behind Home Plate and include access to our Ricoh Diamond Club that offers food and drinks before and throughout the game.
 
Last but not least:
We have a beneficial program for all our season ticket holders called Fish Family. If you are a part of our Fish Family, you get access to several events throughout the year. Some are complementary-  brunches, access to batting cages, ability to buy All-Star game tickets early, etc. Some are up for bids- being a manager for a day, delivering the game ball, etc. Fish Family is by far the biggest and best reason to become a fan!
 
(sesve) - these are only a select few reasons why cheering for the Miami Marlins is worth your while. If those don’t convince you, I don’t know what will. We would be so ecstatic and grateful to have you as a fan.
 
Have a great day and GO FISH!

**Baltimore Orioles**  
Dear (sesve),

I appreciate your interest in the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. In your email, you wanted to know why you should support the Orioles. While there are many reasons why fans chose to support a particular team, I’d like to share with you some of the things that make the Orioles unique.
 
The Orioles celebrated 60 years in Baltimore this past season. Over that time, the Orioles have been MLB World Champions three times, in 1966, 1970 and 1983. They have been American League Champions six times. In 2014, the Orioles won the American League East Division for the ninth time in team history. In fact, as part of our 60th Anniversary celebration, the Orioles held an incredible 30-minute post-game show that will be forever remembered in the minds of Orioles fans (and you can view it [here:](http://m.mlb.com/video/v35412653/orioles-hold-ceremony-to-honor-baltimore-legends))
 
The Orioles have certainly amassed many achievements however, being an Orioles fan goes far beyond accomplishments and accolades. The Orioles are known for playing baseball the “Oriole Way”; a phrase that indicates good fundamental skills and strong defense. The Orioles have a special quality known as “Orioles Magic”. The phrase has come to embody the spirit of the Orioles team and our ability to come back and win games even when the chips are down. Our 2014 playoff rally chant “We Won’t Stop” represented the Orioles as a team that never gives up.
 
Some of the greatest players and coaches to ever wear a baseball uniform were Orioles. Six of the Orioles retired players and coaches, Cal Ripken, Brooks Robinson, Eddy Murray, Jim Palmer, Earl Weaver and Frank Robinson are Orioles Legends and have been enshrined in bronze statues here at Oriole Park. In addition, they were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. These men were more than great baseball players; they were people of class and integrity.
 
The Orioles are a team that link together generations of Orioles fans through good memories and great baseball.  Families and friends come together at Camden Yards, which is considered the best ballparks in baseball. It’s hard to put into words the beauty of Camden Yards. It was the first retro ballpark with all of the modern amenities. With the iconic red brick warehouse in right field, the Eutaw Street corridor and a dazzling view of downtown Baltimore just beyond centerfield, Camden Yards is an exceptional place to enjoy a baseball game. Each year, thousands of fans travel to Baltimore just to experience a game at our classic ballpark.  And Oriole Park at Camden Yards was recently rated the best ballpark in baseball and the best sports facility in America by Stadium Journey website, which gave the ballpark a perfect score!  You can read the review [here:](http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/oriole-park-at-camden-yards-s4/)
 
Orioles baseball goes beyond playing at the ballpark. For more than 60 years, the Baltimore Orioles have worked hard to give back to the community, becoming involved in a variety of area programs and initiatives. Through OriolesREACH, the team seeks opportunities to reach out to our neighbors and help our fans improve their daily lives. This past season, over 3.6 million dollars were raised for charitable causes with assistance from Orioles outreach efforts. Our annual food drive alone collected 5,883 pounds of food and $28,584 in cash donations. The Orioles work with many existing charities and community organizations to benefit the community.  You can find out more information on our important community work [here:](http://www.OriolesREACH.com)
 
It would be nearly impossible to detail all the reasons why someone would want to be a fan of the Baltimore Orioles. In short, the Orioles are a team that builds on a rich history of winning baseball while creating new memories both at the ballpark and in the greater community for fans of all ages and backgrounds.
 
Personally, I’ve grown up as an Orioles fan. My parents took me to games as a child and rooting for the team with friends and family is very special to me.  I hope that you find this team special, unique and one that you can connect with. I hope the Orioles are the team you choose to rally behind and support. For me, the Orioles symbolize fun, family, tradition, community, partnership, excellence, and magic, and that’s something pretty awesome!
 
Sincerely,
Fan Services Team-Erin

Good luck with your choice.

**Washington Nationals**  
Dear (sesve),
Thank you for taking the time to reach out to the Nationals. We would be honored if you choose to make us your favorite MLB team!
 
We believe that our organization has the best fans in the world. They root for our players from Spring Training through the Postseason; attending games at Nationals Park and on the road — sometimes in the heat, in the rain and in the cold. They have been with us every step of the way, during both exciting wins and hard losses. We would love for you to cheer for the Nationals, along with the rest of our passionate fans!
 
Again, thank you for reaching out to us. We look forward to all that next season will hold, and we’re counting the days until Opening Day at Nationals Park on April 3, 2017! Go Nats!
 
Sincerely, 
The Washington Nationals  

**Milwaukee Brewers**  
Hi (sesve),
 
Thanks for reaching out! The list of reasons for becoming a Brewers fan is endless, but here are a few:
 
* **Our rich history** - The Brewers are deeply rooted in MLB history. From being home to legendary baseball announcer Bob Uecker, to having Hall of Famers such as Hank Aaron and Robin Yount don our uniform, the Brewers are well established in baseball history.  
* **Community involvement** - You can always find Brewers players, management and staff helping out around the Milwaukee community. Whether it’s assisting in a food drive for Thanksgiving meals, or bringing winter to clothes to families in need, the Brewers are a staple in the Milwaukee community.  
* **Our future** - The Brewers are a young team with a bright future. Our farm system, which was regarded by national media as being short on prospects as recently as 2014, was recently ranked as the best in all of baseball by Jim Callis, former executive editor of Baseball America and current draft analyst for MLB.com. You will definitely want to be a part of what’s to come.
 
We hope this helps your decision, and go Brewers!

I've recently been offered a 10-week summer position that will require me to dress business casual, on the conservative side. I have a few items that I think can work, but I could use some advice on how to fill in the gaps on a budget!

[Visual wardrobe](http://imgur.com/a/YSgCo)

I've photographed everything I have that I think can pass for business casual, except a couple of sweaters since it will be summer.

My questions for you all are:

1) Are there any pieces that are inappropriate/ dated/ otherwise not suitable for a professional wardrobe?

2) What can I add to turn this into a functional business casual capsule for the summer? What colors/ fabrics/ silhouettes should I look for? Should I get a skirt? A dress? A suit that I can wear as separates?

Budget: ~$300

About me: I'm 26 and a PhD student. I'm often mistaken for much younger than I am, so I want to make sure my work wardrobe doesn't read too young. I'm 5'0 and typically wear a 00P, so petite-friendly brands are a huge plus!

Please help me make a great impression during this internship! I'd love suggestions for specific items, general styling advice, or anything in between!"

60gpc3,14414,2017-03-20,UPDATE: The Trump Administration and the National Endowment for the Humanities,jschooltiger,AskHistorians,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/,"Hi, folks:

You might have missed it in the flood of political news lately, but [President Trump's budget proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html?_r=0) proposes to defund the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR stations).

You may recall that we [ran a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/) on this topic when the proposal was just a rumor, but now that it's an official proposal we decided to update this and ask you to take action. 

The mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that's not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.

That's what we're doing today, and we need your help. 

We don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you're American, we're asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**

The federal budget process isn't fast, and it isn't straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there's a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That's why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.

And we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It's easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It's a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won't talk to them directly; you'll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They've been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they'll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can't get through to one, try the other.

Don't call other Congressmen than your own. It's a waste of time. Don't follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you're calling from (city/zip code, if you don't want to give your address), and what you're calling about.

Repetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give 'em a call when you're headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.

Why are you calling?

The National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you've seen Ken Burns' documentary *The Civil War,* you've seen some of its work. If you've read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you've seen some of its work. If you've visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.

There's something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you're reading right now.**

Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)

The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.

For all the NEH does, that's a good deal. 

------- 

The previous post had three comments in reply that I'd like to highlight here: 

* u/restricteddata on the [history of the NEH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd52t3d/)

* u/khosikulu on the [types of grants](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd5xiok/) offered by the NEH

* u/the_alaskan on how the NEH [benefits many people who aren't historians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd3sffh/)

------- 

Edited to add this, from u/caffarelli: 

&gt; If you're making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you'll personally be impacted by it's loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you're a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It's a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America. "

For everyone that is already working. I'm 21 and I will do 22 on December. When I finished my college I didn't know what I wanted so I went to work in a kitchen. I didn't like.

I'm in a internship right now already at 4 month. I'm working with asp.net mvc c# javacript HTML css bootstrap jquery... I know that I'm not good programming right now and I'm very slow at problem solve. I want to learn algorithms and be really good at computer science.  And I see that I like this area. Computer science.  So I'm thinking to do computer science at university because I will learn foundations and open more paths not just Web. Like artificial intelligence. If I do this it will be more 4 years. Because I need to enter in a foundation year before university. Im currently doing English courses to do ielts. What do you guys think? I want some advices of experts in computer science area.  If you have some minutes to give me some advice Im really  thankful. 

And are there good universities for CCC entry requirements?  My average grades in 0 to 20 is 14. On maths 15. CCC is 14 in Portugal. "

60h3j0,9,2017-03-20,Me [23 M] with my SO/not married [23 F] 2years with anxiety disorder. Please help me.,distressedmale123,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/60h3j0/me_23_m_with_my_sonot_married_23_f_2years_with/,"This is also posted on r/relationships

r/anxiety, please help my case

I am under huge stress and have been facing this for the past 5months with my SO of 2 years. That i have recently [3months ago] found out that her family line is stricken with anxiety and she has a really severe [imo] one.


I really need some help and advices, I have been trying to provide care and attention for my SO with anxiety disorder but to no avail.
Lets start from the beginning, why did it took 2years for me to uncover her anxiety?


At the beginning of our meeting, I was in a all male occupation, this made her (now understood as anxiety triggered by relationships) anxiety mild and easy. Through the period, she had once a sudden episode of panic attack for no reason but I have passed it off as nothing.


Till 5months ago, I started working for a media agency where I started to have female colleagues, this is where the absurdity starts happening.


[When i still havent realised what my SO's condition was] She would rage and taunt me for me even working with a female colleague on a project. So this new job of mine requires me to take photography for the hotel and f&amp;b industries, where as ugly as it sounds (i have to take photographs of the hotel room - mind you) with the female colleague, this caused her to go into severe panic attacks and she would call me in the middle of the job and threaten me with suicide.


At the first occurrences of this attacks (where i didnt even know what was anixety disorder) i tried my best to deal with it by coaxing her and letting her understand. But to be fair, I would get angered too because while she is in this state she would constantly taunt me and force her thoughts into illusions that I would 'betray' or 'cheat' on her.


She had 2 unsuccessful relationships in the past and the previous one ended really badly where her ex told her they needed a break and she found him with another girl the week after. And she often mention how she slapped him in the public - in front of her. This is her account, but somehow her ex is still with this girl that witness her slapping.


At this point of time (2months into my job), i started researching and reading reddit relationships and anxiety then i found out couples with similar predicament. I tried my best to assure her, and this is where she started to login to my google chats to read every conversation possible (all of which was only about work). She then fixated herself on this particular colleague because she typed friendly. I give into my SO, let her read every word, even let her dictate what to reply, and that wasnt enough. She goes into panic attack whenever I have to work with communication with this particular colleague.


[This point of time is 3months in] She even decided that eating with my colleague is not possible, because when she pictures how I laugh with my colleagues and how I talk to them happily - is something she cannot stand and it will throw her into panic attack.
This is coupled with days or every other day with threats of suicide, on days where its my company's tradition to celebrate each other's birthday and festivities. It got till the point where she self-abused by slamming and cracking her watch and using her keys to 'saw' her wrists.


[This is now 3.5months in] It got so bad that I have to inform her parents to provide her with mental care. Somehow the mental care in my country or maybe it is the norm, is really slow. On her first visit to the hospital she was provided with medication for her anxiety, xaxanx for quick relieve and clonazepam for daily use. This made her anxiety attacks less violent.


Her parents and I thought that now medical assistance is provided, everything will get better from here then on. But no, I received this new project in my job now, it involves photographing 2 males and 2 females for a apparel brand (jackets, jeans and shirt - clothed).


This got her to severe anxiety issues whenever she had to face the thought. She tried to combat it, and i tried to assure her that nothing vile, nasty, dirty will come out of this. But in her mind, I am constantly eyeballing these females and it is totally unacceptable.


When the photos her used for my projects campaign, she couldnt take it, and constantly taunts me for this act. While I am helping her take her photographs, if they turned out ugly/ not to her liking, she start with anger, taunting me saying 'So you can take nice photos for those females, why cant you do it for me?'. This got to a point where I verbally retaliated because of all the taunting and she got violent and hurled her phone on me, causing me to bleed from a gush on the eyebrow.


I contacted her parents immediately and we visited the hospital again. The doctor doubled the dosage and I prayed everything will be better now.

Why I am still staying through all these, you might be wondering by now, it is because we shared great memories while not triggering her anxiety disorder before my job started. I believed that if you love someone with everything, nothing will stop you in your way.


We really had a great courtship experience, and shared a few overseas trip experience together. All these went smooth as butter and i still hold them dear to heart, this is way im still holding on but I am constantly faced with her being caught by her anxiety disorder.


[This is 3weeks ago] We are in an overseas visit for a friend, it is our fourth night, everything was perfect and smooth all other nights. I woke up at 12am seeing her crying, i asked her what is wrong. She went into a pile of rage and asked me why have I betrayed her. It was till awhile till i noticed that she was snooping on my laptop. She went in and found out that I did not delete the files from that 2 males and 2 females shoot that she instructed me to do. [I admit my fault for not deleting after telling her that i would], Im organised for all my projects and I keep all of my photos/ videos in their raw format and marked by the project title and device. I know it is conventional absurd that i have to delete it, but for this i admit that I indeed made a promise to in fact delete. This left me traumatized, it was 1am, we are in a foreign land, and she is having panic attack.


[Fast forwarding to now] This week, she has been on medication, everything seems smoother, I tried to address possible triggers to her. But surprise surprise (this is what she thinks about constantly- that something bad will happen, especially when times are good), the 1 female from the 2 male and 2 female shoot is going to join my agency as an intern.


I learnt my lesson and wanted to be honest, i informed her that night and guess what, she went into an severe anxiety attack immediately (this is where i realised, whatever i do actually will trigger her, its not about a white lie or not)


She left my home and tried to uber home angrily, i accompanied her for the wait. This is where she went into a more severe form and she started to run across the road (with cars) in the public. I had to follow her for her safety (she wasnt

 hit). she wanted a break up.
I agreed. The next day was tough, I kept thinking about all our memories and it is just this damned condition that is holding her back. I give in and asked to have her back.


After much tears and sadness, she came back, we are now eating at a restaurant. But the previous anxiety case was still not address, this is the ultimatum, she cant accept the fact that this 1 female (that hasnt even started work) is going to 'have fun, laugh and work with me'. We try to be in good condition in the day too, but at night, she starts running her thoughts and she goes into a state of anger, starting to blame me, taunting me to enjoy myself with her.


Please someone professional or experienced, please tell me what to do. I really do love her and i want to go through this anxiety episode with her and get her back. Please tell me what i can do.


tldr; great times with SO for 1.5years, not until my new job to realise she has severe anxiety issues, i still love her, what i can do?"

-wich are the best states for working in software development?

-should work and get experience here before triying to go to USA?

-how much saved money should i bring with me?

-how do i prepare for the citizenship process

some information about me:

-i started making video games 3 years ago, im a game designer and a programmer in the dev team we have, we use C# in Unity3D for development, also have used Fmod, OrkFramework, and a litle of Wwise plus some other small assets, we have some small games that i plan to put in my portfolio, nothing too fancy, we are now making our first serious game that we are planing to be a narrative ARPG, the first prototipe got elected as one of the best in the 2016 national contest Eduardo Abaroa.

-i know its hard to live by making videogames so i am also learning web development, i can use HTML, CSS, GIT, also a litle of mysql and javascript, im learning angular and planing to learn D3 next, hopping to have a working web portfolio by the end of the year and start adding web and game dev proyects there.

-i am the team leader of our litle dev studio, tought we are a thing only in the bolivian videogames asociation that is not well known even here so that may not be of any help?

-i have some litle experience in desktop applications and movile apps made with java, i dont really like that but if it gives me a work i take it.

-i got really sick a year ago and had to leave university for a year so that lowered my averagte score a lot, wich was just regular to begin with, maeby that will be a problem?

-i have worked with a small company as an intern, there i helped with web dev and some augmented reality in unity3D for android.

TL;DR:
what are your recomendations for moving from Bolivia to USA as a software developer?

60h8cv,1,2017-03-20,"Depressed, directionless, miserable at my job. Not sure if these feelings are justified or if it's just a rude awakening",SmittyWerbenjagerNo1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/60h8cv/depressed_directionless_miserable_at_my_job_not/,"I need some advice and insight. Apologies in advance for the fractured writing / grammar. Here's some background:

I've had a relatively privileged upbringing. I had parents who were willing to support my education at any cost. I worked hard throughout high school, and ended up being admitted to a top private school. Despite all this, I took many things for granted. I encountered some personal issues going into my freshman year and ended up becoming a stoner for a short period. In hindsight, I was depressed, lost my motivation, and changed drastically. I became a little more introverted, ""gave up"" in school despite maintaining decent grades. 

I essentially entered a state of mind that left me apathetic for much of college. I had positive influences and my friends were all hard workers but the problem was that, despite knowing the right thing to do (working hard, recruiting for top level jobs, socializing, exploring new passions) I spent a lot of my time doing nothing. I KNEW what was right but I couldn't get myself to do any of it and it made me more depressed at the time. I think I dealt it relatively well because I still managed to form and maintain many friendships (was quite popular), and took care of my body with diet and exercise. I was aware of the imbalances in my brain and was also aware the extent that my diet and lifestyle had on my emotions. Still, I abused xanax for a brief period, had a very abnormal sleep cycle for most of college, and just made generally poor decisions. This all weighed pretty heavily on my conscience.

Despite all of that, I managed to attain an internship my junior year of college, and secured a full-time job that I wasn't even satisfied with. The pay was decent but not the best (top finance / engineering, etc) and not close to what all of my friends were all getting at least. This was also huge source of stress for me. I had no confidence in myself and couldn't even bother interviewing at these places and knew that I had only deserved a mediocre job (relative to those) at the time. In hindsight, I was totally capable of doing so but I convinced myself otherwise...

Fast forward to now, i'm working that same job that I received an offer for in college and I couldn't be more miserable. My pay is great for most millenials, I don't have any HUGE student loans (scholarships, some support from parents, etc). Since graduating, I've eradicated most of my poor habits. Aside from a few nights out every once in awhile, I sleep and wake up early, I meditate, I eat very healthily, and I spend most of my free time with my family and close friends. I'm aware of what's important at this point in my life but I can't help but feel that my time here is being wasted. I've saved up enough to live jobless for a few months and am looking to devote that time to search for something either more lucrative or interesting. 

The thing is, my dissatisfaction with this job has less to do with the job itself and more to do with the fact that I'm not reaching my full potential. I'm neither amazing nor bad at my job but it's something that I have no interest in. I keep convincing myself that if I were to quit and make unemployment my full time job, I could be learning so much more. I want to seize this opportunity before I have to face ""real"" adult obligations. I want to find what I'm actually good at now that I've dug myself out of my previous, college-lifestyle-induced, state. 

However, I remind myself of how privileged I am and am disappointed in myself for feeling entitled enough to even consider quitting. There are people out there who would kill for my job and comfortable lifestyle. Everytime I reach a breaking point in this job, I end up convincing myself that I'm just being a pussy (which I know I am). After all, 99% of the people out there have it worse than I do; bound to their careers and lifestyles by their financial, familial obligations. I'm very aware of this and i'm grateful for my life. I'm also aware that the world owes me nothing and that I have to work for it but I eventually want to end up in a career where I feel like i'm genuinely creating value for something.

About 10 months ago, I applied for a position in tech support in a high tech company over here in Canada. Interview was fine, but I guess I was missing a bit of experience in technical suport, since I didn't get the job.

However, the company called me back, told me I was an interesting candidate and that I should apply for a more sales oriented position which was just about to open. Turns out that the guy who got the tech support position was an intern working in the sales department, so basically, I was applying for his old job.

I did ask human ressources at the time if there would be any difference in salary between the tech job and the sales job. I was told that for engineers, considering both positions are entry level jobs, there wouldn't be any difference. 

So I got the sales job, worked in the department for the last nine months. I guess it would be relevant to point out that our annual meeting with our boss to discuss raise in salary was about around my sixth month and he decided to raise me by 2.3%.

So here I am, about nine months later, I re-applied for the tech job and got it. I'm suppose to get the «official» notice and to talk to HR on Wednesday about salary, conditions and everything else.


Is nine months too early to ask for a raise? 
I'd consider my current salary to be fine, but I do not want to feel like I missed the opportunity to negociate.


Also for those wondering, it's pretty common in the company to have engineers switch between the sales and tech support job to get more experience and to be able to apply to higher positions.

If you work at a major tech company, could you explain how it's done in your particular company?

What I want to do and help others do is avoid a ""what the fuck"" kind of situation where some people are confused as to why big companies that interviewed them as a newbie would no longer even give them a call back after obtaining years of experience at other places. It is clear that there is a great diversity in career tracks, so I'd really like to know how big companies deal with this.

More notably:

If you apply for a ""regular"" SWE role and seen as over/under qualified, do they automatically move you to a more appropriate SWE level for the hiring pipeline?

For applicants that appear to have slow growth in their career (maybe poor/no mentorship, poor chances at following industry trends, no large systems experience), where do they fall into?

On a more technical level, is knowledge of programming syntax that useful or is it only important to just have to show examples of good work and/or projects?

Again, I know this varies from company to company on how it's done so I welcome anyone that can provide answers on their particular place of work."

Late December 2016, I stumbled upon this subreddit by accident where I discovered freecodecamp.com. I was hooked instantly; I spent most of my Christmas break grinding out front end projects and algorithms. 

My attention switched over to learning C++ having come across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5nd9la/tutorial_learn_to_make_minecraft_using_c_and/), and I challenged myself to do the same; build a MineCraft clone without following the tutorial. You can view my attempt [here](https://github.com/Osc10/MineClone), it's nowhere near finished but I'm proud of the progress that I've made so far and it really has taught me a lot in the process.

My initial plan was to somehow get to a point where I could apply for summer internships and be a somewhat competent candidate. Using advice from the resume threads, I decided I needed more interesting projects to pad out my CV. My initial idea was a simple C++ program that adds interesting effects to images using OpenCV. What started as an uninspiring project grew into something that I am proud of: a wallpaper app that automatically grabs images off https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper+wallpapers/top/ every 2 hours, applies a cartoon effect to the image and automatically sets it as the background. [Here is the link](https://github.com/Osc10/Simple-Wallpapers/) to the project, bear in mind it only works on Linux for now although I do intend to make it work on Windows. Feel free to critique it, I was eager to show it off however premature it was and it is probably riddled with bad practices.

I've done a quick search of this subreddit for ""data analysis"" and ""visualization"" but not much came up so I'm hoping there are a few lurkers on here.

I'm a second year MBA candidate with about a month and a half left of full time classes. After working for a large company (which was the direction I thought that I wanted to pursue) and then working for a small marketing firm through internships, I've realized that I want nothing to do with a bigger corporate culture.

The internship for the small marketing firm was suppose to be a very basic data analysis project but I ended up automating the data collection process and visualizing the data in tableau. They are so happy with my work that they are willing to pay me as a consultant after graduation. This marketing company would be my first client but I'm wondering how to pursue finding more.

Are there any freelancers who work in this area? If so, how did you get your start and build up a client base? 

Is it a crowded market or am I just looking in the wrong places? I've found a few projects on Upwork that I could see myself working on but there seem to be a lot of proposals on each post I find.

Thanks!"

60i8cr,5,2017-03-20,"Peers of mine be crazy, I don't think I can take much more of them (this is more of a rant than anything, just fair warning).",CatDeeDeeDee,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/60i8cr/peers_of_mine_be_crazy_i_dont_think_i_can_take/,"Sorry if this is really jumbled, I'm writing it before class because OMG I NEED TO LET THIS OUT.

Dietetics students where I am are known as a crazy, neurotic bunch of folks.

I first heard about this from a teaching assistant in a completely different department last semester. As I was talking to her about the struggles and stress that I was feeling, she simply asked me if my major was nutrition. I said it was and she laughed. She had taught a class in the nutrition department (I honestly cannot remember what it was, all I remember was that it was a grad class and it was writing related, maybe a workshop or something close to it) at one point.

""Man, you guys are something else,"" she said with a laugh. ""You have no idea how crazy people in your major appear to the rest of us.""

Back then, I hadn't been accepted into a DI or grad school yet and I was going up against a lot of people with better grades than me for spots in the preselect MS/DI, so yeah, that made me nervous and a bit flighty and I didn't really get what she was saying. It was only after I got accepted and things had calmed down that I began to think about what she said.

Right when I started to pay attention, I started to see what she was talking about. Some of the undergrads are kind of out there, yeah. Like they have 3.9 GPAs and crazy amounts of experience and they're in the corner having a nervous breakdown about Match Day. There's constant sizing up, crying, freakouts, etc. It's a mess right now.

But my biggest beef is with the (future) grad students.

There are 6 of us, myself included, and 2 of this group are known as massive troublemakers. They complain CONSTANTLY about everything. They bully one of our really nice professors all the time to extend dates on assignments, drop homework assignments, not count in class quizzes as grades, so on and so forth. They fight with professors over half a point on an exam that should've been given to them (yes, I'm serious). They flip their shit over a B on a test or quiz. 

In a nutshell, they drive the rest of us freaking nuts.

Other peers of mine have expressed to me outright that they feel sorry that I will be going to grad school with them. I mean, I'll be honest, I was going to stay far away from them anyways. I can tell they don't like me so much (started after they found out how much work experience I had), I am the oldest grad student in the program as of right now and my tolerance for their shenanigans is zero. So needless to say, I didn't need to be told to avoid them like the Plague. 

But dang, these are future grad students. Like...how the hell are they gonna survive? They complain about how they don't have time to do anything, it's all too much, etc. One of them doesn't even have a job, so her main thing is school. The other one does have a lot of leadership positions that she's juggling, but otherwise...they don't commute an hour and a half each way to school like I do. They don't work every single weekend all day like I do. I still manage to do everything that's assigned, get things in on time and whatever else.

Like what the hell are they talking about, there's no time to do anything?

I don't know, I'm at the point where going to one of our classes is proving to be stressful because that really nice professor they're always bullying gets attacked every class for something by those 2. My fiance has told me to go talk to one of the faculty members about them, but what the hell would I even say? 

Stroll up in the director's office and be all ""hey, you know two of the girls you admitted for grad school? They're batshit nuts, thought you should know""?

Yeah, no thanks. 

I don't know what to do other than to grit my teeth and continue to do my thing. It's really sad that these two are known as a power team in terms of grades (both have perfect GPAs and aren't afraid to say it), but when it comes to being a normal member of society, they fail hardcore and can't relate to anyone. I can't imagine how they'll be by the time we get to the internship rotations. 

Jeezus.

The startup pays $30/hour and The big company pays roughly $48/hour. Glassdoor says new grads make about $75,000 / year at the startup.

I'm interested in interning at a place that I want to work full time. The big company offers better pay as well as a strong brand name. However, I think I would be happier working at the startup.

But I figured if I’m going to do this I should go ahead and record it somewhere where other people can find it. Unlike some people, I actually believe in the scientific method. Or I did, at least. I’m still trying to piece things together.

My name is Miriam Stuart. I mean, it’s not my actual surname, internet safety and all that. I’m twenty-seven, and I just moved down to California for a six month forensic biology intern. I’ve been here for about a week and a half now. I figured I’d see a lot of weird stuff working in a morgue, but the freakiest thing was at the house I’ve been renting.

So last year I met my younger sister, Sariah—I was adopted and wanted to meet my blood family, y’know? She’s a sweet girl. She’s taking care of my little Virginia until I can get my career kicked off. The only problem is she’s superstitious. Not just casually, either. She spreads salt circles, burns incense—once I walked in on her writing on her arm in chalk. She kept encouraging me to at least look into it, at least just a little. I figured I met as well, right? I’ve always been kinda interested in weird pseudo–science stuff, and she’s doing me such a favor, I figured I could humor her.

My first weekend in California, and it was raining. So much for the state of eternal sunshine. Instead of spending my first break seeing the sights, I browsed the internet looking at all that weird stuff she’s into. I got really interested in these “ritual games” where you supposedly interact with spirits and alternate dimensions.

That’s when things started getting... wrong.

I opened a dozen or so tabs of different games, and I was just about to open the first one when my laptop shut off. It’s an older model, it shuts off at a stiff breeze, so I just ignored it and started booting things back up. I was going to just go back to reading but... all the tabs had changed. They were the same page, an article about a specific ritual called “The Hooded Man Ritual.”

Maybe I was tired. Maybe I jut misclicked. I really don’t know anymore.

I figured I might as well give it a go.

I chose the bedroom, because it’s got a road facing window, even though it gets cold in there at night. The instructions said to do a cleaning ritual, so I found this one with salt and ash that didn’t take to long. I closed the door and the closer, and drew shut the curtains. I won’t bore you with the steps; I turned out the lights, unhooked my electronics, and set out the cords and matches.

Once it was dark, I set out the phone, counted to thirteen, and dialed the number, I tied the cord, dialed the second number, then counted again. Just like the instructions said, I told the receiver I needed a camp, switched the cords, and burned the first. Then I walked over to the window to pull back the curtain, and once I’d properly disproved it, I’d microwave some dinner and head to bed/

There was a black taxi cab parked at the curb.

My heart started to pound as I watched it sitting there, motor idling silently. It was on, I could tell, but no smoke poured from the exhaust. Actually, it almost seemed like it was made of smoke. I hadn’t expected to see anything, so I wasn’t really certain what to do now, except, I guess, follow through with the rest of the instructions.

I locked my bedroom door and the door to the house, and put the key under the mat. I got into the cab’s back seat, rolled up the window, and locked the door. I was about to go to sleep, like the steps had said, but before I could close my eyes, I noticed something on the cab floor. It was a little piece of paper, crumpled up and kicked under the seat. I smoothed it out the best I could. It was written in blue ink, scrawled out hastily. Some of the ink had run, and it was all crinkled, as if maybe whoever had written it had been crying. It’s on my desk right now, even as I’m writing this.

“It’s closing in. The hooded man is my last chance to escape. Only God almighty can save me now.

I didn’t think I could fall asleep. In fact, I’m not really certain I did. But I did wake up. I’m the kind of person who has to spend hours drawing myself out from the sheets minute by minute, bet I felt crisp, relaxed, as if I’d never so much as slept. I didn’t even feel tired, but the instructions said to return to sleep. I leaned up against the glass window, closed my eyes, and waited to fall asleep again.

This time when I woke up, I finally wasn’t alone. A figure was sitting at the wheel, their free hand resting on the dashboard. When I’d read about the hooded figure who drove the cab, I’d imagined a long flowing cloak. But the driver wore faded hoodie with fraying stings and a low hood that hid their face. They didn’t speak, and just as the instructions said, I didn’t speak either.

We were driving down a highway I’ve never seen, each side hemmed it with tall buildings. Everything looked modern, but it was cracked and rusting, as if none of it had been touched in years. Even the road was full of potholes and debris, but the cab moved as smoothly as skin on ice. It was so silent and still, the windows didn’t even rattle. Once or twice, I thought I caught a glimpse of color—some distant orange–red glow far past the tangle of buildings on the left.

I sat in silence for nearly half an hour, still in shock as we moved through the emptiness. I almost threw up when the cab stopped. It wasn’t abrupt, or smooth. It was simply moving, and then it wasn’t. The instructions hadn’t told me what to do if the cab stopped.

The right passenger door opened. A little girl took the seat next to me, kicking her legs as she shut the door, watching the window as the cab began, once again, to move.

She looked familiar, in a way I couldn’t quite place. She had dark brown curls, and eyes as big an dark as Hershey’s kisses—the tiny thing couldn’t have been much older than my own Virginia. She was wearing a worn, mint green night gown, with a little black bow sewn to the neckline. Her feat were bare, but clean, and she had that soft friendly glow you expect of children.

I wish that had been all I noticed about the little girl. But you learn things working in a morgue. For example, you learn the smell of a formaldehyde preserved corpse. I did my best to avoid looking at the little girl too directly, but it was like seeing words on a page; you can’t see it without reading it. The faint purple color in her fingertips and her cheeks; the slight bloating across her body; slight blistering across her skin. It’s all subtle, all slight.

It’s all symptoms of death plastered onto a still–living child.

She spoke softly, her words dry and raspy, twisted with the sounds of a death rattle as she admired her window view. “I can’t wait to see Virginia.”

I panicked. All I could think about was getting out of there. I told the driver I’d reached my location. They’d nodded, but that’s all I remember before waking up in bed. I wanted to scream or cry, or figure out what I’d just experienced, but I was cared. I called the last number to thank them for the ride, burned the cords with salt, did a cleansing ritual—then I called my sister. She said Virginia’s fine, and I didn’t tell her why I was so scared, but I just—

Listen, I need this internship. I can't just leave. But if I’m losing my mind or I don’t know what... I don’t know if what I went through was some kind of fever dream or hallucination or worse, real, but I still have the note I found. I just don’t know. That little girl seemed some menacing. I’m going to keep trying to figure out what’s going on—that’s what a scientist does. I just don’t know what to do. I’m going to read more about this. There has to be answers. There has to be."

I worked at this company as an intern in the summer of 2015, and then worked part-time (20hr/week) during the entirety of my senior year. So all-in-all, I have been at this company for almost 2 years now. My starting full-time salary upon graduation was $60k with the promise that I would ""reach market rate"" over a period of a year and a half with accelerated raises (every 6 months instead of annually). 

Well during my first 6 months of full-time, I pretty much kicked ass. My manager actually moved me over to a relatively new venture within our company and has me leading development of the entire platform by myself. Also - keep in mind that hiring external personnel with this kind of experience would have easily cost the company $90-100k per developer. 

Fast forward to our review period, and when I get my raise, its a measly $2k. I was taken aback - $2k every 6 months was going to get me nowhere close to market rate ($75,000ish). I appealed my case to my manager and the engineering VP, but they seemed unwilling to budge on the matter. I even pointed out that I am technically performing the role of a Lead Developer (3 levels above my current position), and while my manager agreed, it didn't seem to matter in the way of a pay raise.

Am I getting screwed? Should I try to have another conversation with my managers? Should I look elsewhere? I have run out of ideas and I need some advice.

I'm kinda worried because I was sure that I'd be going to City College for my bachelors degree, but after doing more research, I'm having a lot of doubts. I recently read someone's post that said something along the lines of: ""CCNY is great for prepping you for grad school, but not for the industry, and while they teach you cs, they do not teach you skills you need to get a job in the industry.""

That's a real doozie for me because as I said, I have no experience with any programming language. I'm worried that I'll graduate not knowing enough and be unprepared for a job. Granted, I'm sure that if I haul ass now and work towards doing projects and taking internships in college, I'll be pretty okay, but I'm still doubtful.

I could always go to a SUNY (recently got accepted into UBuffalo) but it's just so much money, even with Financial Aid, and I'm worried that I wont be able to keep up with how rigorous the courses must be for someone as inexperienced as I am.

Sorry for dragging this out so long, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me? Thank you! "

I decided to start nofap after having hitting what felt like a low point in my sexual behavior. My long term girlfriend 4 years and I broke up 3 months ago (she was the only person I ever had sex with since we were together since I was 16). I am happy about the break up and feel better now in that regard, but I was basically fapping with lots of porn like three times a day for the first two months because I was used to regular sex that was very good. I felt pretty pathetic and that my ambition and drive in many aspects of my life was draining. So I decided to go nofap and noporn, and 36 days later I feel WAY better. I've working out like crazy (a way to deal with sex drive), interviewing for summer internships at my dream companies, and really working to improve myself. Problem is now, over the past week or so it's been harder and harder to not focus energy on sexual activity. I've told myself that if you want to get off, it has to be with a real woman, but now it seems like I'm starting to shift energy from improving myself, to getting laid again. I know that improving oneself is like one of the most important things to do to attract females, but the sexual frustration is starting to get a little much. I'm a university student and I also work so I'm normally very busy, especially after including time I spend working out and other hobbies, but can't stop feeling I'm obsessed with getting with someone new and that it's starting to dominate my thoughts. Just wondering what you guys' thoughts were on this or if anyone has experienced similar things. I'd love to hear what you guys have experienced. "

I've since reread my application and PS and believe that my activity descriptions and PS were both worthless and my premed adviser agrees that improving these will produce a better yield.  I also did not submit until mid-July last time around and waited anywhere between five and eight weeks to complete secondaries after I received them (I'm an idiot, I know).  This time around I will have my primary submitted on either the first or second day, and I have already begun to write secondaries for schools I know I am going to apply to (in case I decide to apply this cycle).

I just had a beer which I never do cause it's the only thing that can calm me down enough to actually start applying places without totally freaking out. I know this is irrational.

What is your advice for applying to places at this point in time? Please please tell me it's not too late. It can't be.

I would always play video games with my group of friends, and sometimes Kevin would join too. Overtime, Kevin and I became close. Sometime in February he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. 

Now, I have never had a boyfriend before, so Kevin is my first. Kevin has told me that I am his first girlfriend too. We live states apart, so we have a long-distance relationship. We were comfortable just texting and video calling each other when we had the time, and I was happy with that. I love him very dearly and he loves me too.
After months of dating, we agreed to meet up sometime in the future. The week before Christmas was our date of meet up. He flew over to my state, and we had a blast together. He was only here for three days, but those three days felt like heaven. Before he left to catch his flight, I ended up crying hard because I didn't want him to go. He cried too and said he'd come back to visit me again in the future.

Since then, it feels like things have changed. I'm not sure if it's better or worse. After our meet up, the texting and callings just make me miss him more and more. I miss him so much that it hurts. I've never felt like this before. 
For the past two weeks, Kevin has been busy with school since his finals are coming up. We haven't been texting or calling much lately because of that. I know he's concentrating more on school, and I'm happy to see that he is working hard. He says after finals are over, which is next Tuesday, he'll be able to spend more time with me. It sounds ridiculous, but recently I've been getting thoughts of how maybe Kevin doesn't want to be with me anymore or that he hates me. I don’t know why. I’ve never felt like this about our relationship before. I've spoken to him about it, and he reassured me that he loves me very much and would never feel like that. In fact, he told me that he'd like to meet up with me again later in the summer. He said he wishes it could be sooner, but he's working on an internship right now for the next two months. I still can't shake these thoughts off my mind though, as silly as they are. Has anyone else ever experienced this? Is it strange to feel like this? Any advice on how to not think so negatively like this? "

But who are you?

Are you the lonely housewife next door who settled down with a good man thinking she could leave her wild past behind and that her more clandestine desires would fade with time? I'm sure looking out the window at your new neighbor fixing up the house doesn't help. Can you resist the urge to bring him a glass of sweet tea and introduce yourself?

Are you the new intern at work set to help this tall, articulate man with whatever he needs? Sometimes we will have to stay late to finish up, just don't get distracted and spill a cup of coffee on my new suit.

Did your best friend's mom get remarried? Rather a bit of a surprise when you go over to her house for dinner. Still, when everyone else is asleep and you need a glass of water late at night try not to make too much noise?

Or are you someone else? The milf at the gym, freshman at college, or something completely different?

Tell me why you love or are curious about BBC, and a little bit about yourself. I'm not looking for lazy girls, or short term play, and cuck roles are definitely not interesting. Don't forget to introduce yourself like a good girl.

1) Liam needs to do something! let that boy be a true Gallagher for once and fuck some shit up. atleast let him microwave some toys.

2) if yall dont give my boy Ian and Micky some much needed time together, imma chase yall from your headquarters. i dont even care, i will fly to California. 

3) let my boy Lip get some break, get an associate degree or pursue a paid engineering internship with Amanda's father. And while that Sierra chick is cool and all, we all know the new Mandy would be 10x better. Bonus points if you guys make him choose between the two in season 8. 

4) let my girl Ethel come back for a cameo

5) let Svetlana burn into a hole. kidding. but seriously, the Alibi belongs to Kev and V. Kermit and Tommy should conspire and overthrow Svetlana. A coup or some shit. 10/10

6) Debbie. I love that girl but she needs to tone it down a little with her mouth movements. Other than that, the whole character arc thing should continue from season 7. but she cant be with the Welding teacher, it is  unbelievable for 16 yo her to date that man. The attraction already seams forced. just like how yall tried to make us believe Caleb (a well to-do firefighter) would even give a tiny Ian a chance. 

7) Frank should continue his rants. honestly, if you guys make him do one rant here and there, i will be happy. that is all i ask from him. 

8) Fiona should continue her stride with no romantic interest. Let that girl breath damn. one failed relationship after another. I mean let my boy Jimmy come back new and reformed though, maybe like at the end of the season. And let Fiona chase after him, we dont want another ""I love you, I love you"" from Jimmy.

First I want to thank everyone in advance for any help. So I previously posted, asking about strategies and tips for moving around a large system and I had a ton of success. So, while I'm able to move around the system, I'm having trouble knowing what does what and how things do things. I'm working in a Spring/Hibernate framework. In general, I'm just looking for advice on how to understand the system. I know it won't happen overnight but I'm eager to learn. But right now when I look at the code, it's a little daunting.
&amp;nbsp;

At this point I'm open to anything. I've been slowly working through a Spring Hibernate course on Udemy and I also have Stackskills for learning content. I'm open to any suggestions! Articles, books, even some online learning. Any and all suggestions to help me better understand this code.

Just some background, I'm a three year technical student who's about to graduate and I'm about 4 weeks into an 11 week internship. I'm working really hard. I'm doing a few hours a night on Udemy and I'm reading whatever documentation available at work. Senior developers can help, to an extent. The project has had a high turnover and there's some inconsistencies in terms of naming and documentation and knowledge base. Many of ""senior"" staff isn't that senior... so there's gaps in their understanding of what the system does and how it does it. In the end I'm just looking for strategies in being able to understand a large Spring system with a lot of interconnected systems. (Spring, Hibernate, Ajax, Maven, Jawr)"

I got hired as a PA in January 2011, working with 4 other people in Phil's very small office in LA. I helped hire Boman as a shooter/editor, and 6 months in Google approached us, asking to pitch longer form content. We pitched SourceFed, after myself and James Haffner (our original EP) spent a month working til Midnight on the deck. I was in the room with Phil &amp; James when we pitched. I also helped throw the official budget together over the course of 2 crazy busy days in our hotel room at Vidcon 2011.  

After we got funded, I had helped cast the OG talent through multiple casting sessions over 3 months. I pulled Steve Zaragoza's audition tape off our casting post and told James, ""Hey this guy reminds me of Jack Black."" Also he was just in his room being a weirdo and he was 10 times funnier than 90% of people who had auditioned. I also remember after a loooong day of casting for Nerd, asking people what video games they liked and being told ""Mariocart"" 1000 times, that Trisha responded, ""PC or Console?,"" and we fell in love with her. 

I helped hired the OG SourceFed editors, Ian &amp; Dan. After they left, Len &amp; Rickey filled those roles, and worked their way up over 5 years to Creative Director and Head of Production, respectively. 

I also hired and managed our intern program. In our first session at the launch of SourceFed (Jan 2012) two of those interns were William Haynes &amp; Daren Girdner. Daren got hired after 3 weeks, because he had the balls to give Phil his edit reel. He's also just happens to be insanely talented. Will lied about having a car, so he got stuck pulling assets for the editors his entire internship, and then on his last day he showed us one of his YouTube videos and Phil was super impressed. We all were and we all couldn't believe this quiet, car-less guy didn't speak up sooner about how charismatic he fucking is. He left to intern with Ze Frank, then came back and auditioned in 2014, joining the main cast. 

In the next couple intern rounds I found Sam Bashor and Reina Scully. Sam was also shy, but very reliable &amp; smart. After we did a video with Ashley Sky where he basically stole the show making silly faces - I literally asked Phil while we were waiting in line at Wells Fargo, ""Can we keep him?"" 

Reina was always the sweetest, most generous little sparkle of light. One time for a shoot we did with Jessica Nigri, I had to get ahold of a comically large cupcake, and Reina fucking MADE IT. She hand delivered this professional quality giant cupcake and acted like it was nbd. She also went off and did other stuff after her internship, and auditioned in 2014, joining the main cast. 

That to me, at the end of the day, is what made SourceFed so beautiful. That interns became hosts, producers, staff. I interviewed Audrey at a Starbucks in Culver City 2 days before her 18th birthday, and she ended up as our Integrated Sales Associate handling shit like a pro. I was the office manager/Phil's assistant for years but I also got to be on-camera, produce our live shows, and sit in on development meetings. Phil really instituted this energy that has lasted the entire course of the company that if you bust your ass, and really show what you can do, you will rise. 

I'm gonna miss seeing all of our amazing folks everyday, but I really really mean it when I say we're incredibly lucky. We got 5 years, and the people who worked on these channels are such good humans, with MASSIVE talent, and serious hustle. I'm excited to see what everyone does, and to everyone who has watched with us over the years, thanks for being a really decent bunch of people on the internet. Anytime I met our fans you guys have been so so lovely, and really supportive of me (who scans HR paperwork mostly). You guys are great, these channels have been a blast, and that livestream Friday is gonna be fuckin bonkers.

There's a lot of stress off my shoulders, but I feel terribly lost. He was my daddy, but I always felt it was something he did just to keep me happy. This is my first time posting here. 

I'm nineteen and studying at my community college to teach high school English. I don't have a job, but I have an internship at a local high school to further my teaching education. I have my own car and the ability to do whatever, but I just... don't. I'm terribly shy and self-conscious about stupid things. Simple tasks are monumental because I feel so alone and obscure. I start therapy tomorrow to better understand why I'm this way. No, you won't become my problem dump - if you'd like to hear my story, however, I'm happy to share.

I range from age 7-10. I'm a huge brat by nature. I like to break rules and evade punishment. I'm not looking for something totally sexual (I'm a virgin). I like animated movies, coloring, roleplaying in video games, stuffed animals, and fantasy books. 

I'm 5'1"" and 123 pounds. I'm happy to share photos once we get to know each other better. 

I'd REALLY prefer local, but if I like you we can see where we go. I'm near the border of DE and PA in Harford County. I'm 45~ minutes away from Baltimore.

My idea daddy is self-sufficient, tall, white-collar, well-groomed, nerdy and intelligent, does not smoke, drinks only occasionally at most, has engaging hobbies, enjoys the outdoors, has pets, loves to cook and learn about the world around him. Age is up for debate, but below 30 would be best for me. Having your own place is a huge bonus. Another plus would be physically active, as I want to start getting more into shape.

As shallow as it sounds, I've grown up poor all my life and have never had much luxury. I don't need luxury, but I'd love to be with a financially stable guy so I don't have to worry about anything. No, I'm not going to make you buy me everything in the world!
 
Sorry if this is too much to ask. Coming off of a breakup, I'm looking for an idyllic high. Message me if you're interested."

I'm extremely fortunate in that my rent, tuition, and most school-related costs are covered by savings which my parents put away for me. Currently, I've got about $2000 left.
I've got another internship this summer where I'll be earning roughly $1000 per paycheck (biweekly), living at home rent free with basically no direct costs to me(thanks mom); I'm looking for advice on what to do with the money, rather than just putting it into a checking account and spending it all again. I'm already trying to be much better about budgeting, as I realize I've blown through a pretty serious amount of cash over the course of 7 months, spending it mostly on food, booze, and other pleasure items/activities (excluding a few large, unavoidable purchases).
I'd love advice both on budgeting ideas and ways to save money, along with what to do with my paycheck besides just plopping it into my checking account. Obviously I could get a savings account, but from the little I know about personal finance, I know that means minimal growth, especially for a small amount of money like what I will be earning.

I am set to graduate with a PhD in synthetic organic this year. It looks to be about early summer or so. I'll probably start writing my thesis soon. Up to this point, I've more or less been successful. I've gone to conferences to give talks. I've got a bunch of research done and can write a good thesis on it (granted, the research is lack-luster due to a lot of bad luck), I've won a few awards here and there. My adviser and committee are all rather proud of me. 

I am so done though. The past 6 years has *killed* me. My spirit died years ago. I stopped caring about my science years ago. I've been running on fumes for years. It's felt like a matter of survival. I shouldn't be sad, as I had a great set up with an amazingly supportive adviser who has bent over backwards to help me. It was never enough. I honestly don't think I was cut out for this but somehow managed to make it to the end out of lucky circumstance.

I decided research is NOT for me a long time ago. I find it to be soul crushing toil for almost no return. With graduation coming up, I have to start finding a job. Or rather, I should have looked months ago but I haven't. I'm just so dead. I'm so burnt out I honestly don't even want a job. Graduating doesn't feel like a prize. It feels like a check point that leads to more toil and suffering. It feels like everything coming after graduation is going to be down hill. I honestly can not think of a career that I want. Research is absolutely out. It looks like teaching is out too. I'm really good at teaching, but my adviser and others have given me very solid arguments to why I would hate it and it wouldn't be good to me. I recently started this internship things that deals with the business end of chemistry, and barely a week into it I absolutely *hate* it, and realize that this isn't the path I want either. It feels like I won't have any use with my degree. All of the paths lead to something I'd hate or not survive in.

To make matters worse, I have 100k+ loans from undergrad, so I need a well paying job to stay afloat. Honestly, at this point I feel like I'd be happy as a peach just working at the front desk of a hotel or something. No more stress, no more toil. Just something I can go in, work with some people in a happy environment, and go home at the end of the day and recharge. But that doesn't make enough money. I feel so backed into a corner. I haven't done any work for a solid month or more and have just faked it because I have been able to get away with it. I feel terribly guilty about it and it's causing it to not be relaxing, but I am so hopelessly burnt out and absolutely *dreading* the future that I have been unable to will myself to search for jobs, or put the bow on my research (which is 99.9% done). 

I know this sounds pathetic, but please help. I have wanted to be a chemist since I was a child, and I have done everything to make it to this point, and now that I am at the end I don't want to do anything but crawl in a hole and either never come out, or just die. 

Note: Yes I have mental problems, I take medication, I see a therapist every week. None of that has been working or helping, because this stuff feels a lot larger than that all and I am just not able to cope with the impending real world.

Edit: Jeez this got a lot more responses than I expected. Thank you all. I'll do my best to answer, and thank you to everyone who offered contacts and help offers.

---------------

Edit2: This has been IMMENSELY helpful. Thank you so much everyone. The biggest take away is I now have a list of potential jobs and areas I could potentially get into. This helps clear my head some is I at least have some direction. I've also gained some prospective on how I need to deal with myself. Basically try and take an *actual* break, not this fake-break that doesn't recharge me that I have been trying. In addition I need to try and learn (and relearn) how to be positive. This is something I'm going to have to do with my therapist but at least I know it's a huge priority I need to deal with. If I don't the job search is going to be drudgery, and I can not afford to have it be like that.

Thank you all so much. I'm going to keep following things here.

Edit3: I am turning in for the day. I'll check on things tomorrow if there are any more comments. Thank you again to everyone. Words can not express how helpful and rejuivinating this has been!"

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony, VUDU and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

60mpm6,0,2017-03-21,How is computer sciences?,bruhsmh,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/60mpm6/how_is_computer_sciences/,"I got into both UBCV and UBCO, and was wondering how Computer Sciences is for each? I heard the small community is better for UBCO, and I know people going there, but Vancouver is a more educational school and has better facilities. Also, plenty of jobs and internships could be offered at Vancouver, so I'm on the edge. Has anyone had experience with these programs on either campus, if so how'd you feel about it? Also, the cliché ""does the degree on UBCO still say UBC""? I heard I can switch from one campus to other if I get the GPA, but if you graduated from UBCO with computer sciences did find that it affected your job search?"
60mpuy,2,2017-03-21,Study MSc vs scholarship to research deep learning with GPUs?,jmb-95,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/60mpuy/study_msc_vs_scholarship_to_research_deep/,"My professor has offered me a scholarship to full-time research an exploratory area to process medical images with GPUs to teach neuronal networks to make automatic diagnostics in a local hospital. This project looks really interesting to me and I would love to participate in it. The remuneration and internship details has yet to be decided but he has told me the remuneration will be quite good. I feel this is an opportunity not to be ignored. I have experience programming GPU fluid simulations (I've worked part-time in Repsol and on a fast-fluid side project) and my final degree project is about a GPU AES cipher implementation.

The problem is that I had planned to do an MSc in the same area, high-performance computing or scientific computing, in some of the best Universities in Europe. I do not know what to do now... I'm confused. Should I tell him I still want to apply to those universities until the internship is finally materialized and ask him for a letter of recommendation? It's hard to get admitted in those recognized universities and I feel like If I do not apply I am wasting my talent. I have already prepared my statement of purpose and documents for the University application. On top of that my father has told me that the MSc comes first, that then, I will be able to research and not the contrary.

I told him that maybe I could combine both MSc and internship but he has told me it would be crazy to combine both things as I would be studying in a foreign country. He is right. I have to decide.

Please help me!! What would you do?"

I'm a senior in college in a low COL and will be graduating with a bachelors in May.  I am currently doing an audit internship at a local firm ~about 30 auditors.  They offered me a job to stay on after I graduate for a fairly competitive salary for this area.  I have been interviewing at some other firms and a few private industry places and was offered a job in the Oil and Gas industry for a little bit higher of a salary.  I have previous experience in Oil and Gas as that is what I did at my last internship but I am scared that accepting that job might hinder my development in accounting based on what I have been hearing in this Sub.  I also will be trying to complete the cpa exams in the next few years and I do not know if going into industry will hinder that.  I guess I am asking for some advice on what to do or if anyone has had a similar experience.  Any information would be helpful, and thanks in advance for taking the time to reply.  "

Okay. Firstly, my profile:

TOEFL - 114 (R-28, L-30, S-27, W-29).
Undergrad: Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.
CGPA: 7.2 (66%).
Papers or significant projects: None.
Internship: Tata Chemicals (Related to Chemical Engineering).
Work ex - 2.5 years with IBM (Mainframes).
BUT - I am applying for an MS in Computer Science.

I have admits from UT Dallas and SUNY Buffalo. UIC admit is on hold.

I am now utterly sad, thinking that I could have done better.

Any thoughts on this? Should I skip this fall and apply for next fall? 

Thank you!"
60nbro,8,2017-03-21,[22/m] I think I'm in a emotionally abusive relationship with [21/f],deathwingk,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/60nbro/22m_i_think_im_in_a_emotionally_abusive/,"I've been into an relationship for almost the past year with a girl. This is/was my first relationship ever, so I'm really kind of clueless. 

I know her since highschool, we were colleagues, but we didn't really talk in all those years. We started talking on facebook after we finished highschool, but it was just friendly talks, I didn't have any plans or something. 

She was at that point in a relationship, (which as far as i understood was her first relationship)
 for a couple of years with some guy, that was from the other part of the country. After she finished highschool she moved in his city for college. A year after that she broke up with him, and we started talking almost daily since like December 2015. 

She started liking me during that period, and I saw that at some point but was too afraid that it might be a bad idea to get involved, but we still talked daily and A LOT.  I kind of dragged it like that, not really showing her that I like her back, until like May when she made the move and kissed me. At that point, I was the happiest I've ever been, that I've finally found someone that likes me.

Around March, she found a place to work at in the domain that she is studying at college, but at that point it was just some kind of ""internship"", just to get experience. She made a friendship with her boss[F/37] and she became closer and closer, and also started getting paid. It's just a small lab and it's mostly only her and her boss there.

I've went first time to where she's staying there around June, and that was also the moment when I've lost my virginity. As a paranthesis, I want to say that the sex with her is great and has always been, she is super open-minded about it) The other day, while I was there she told me that she really likes working there, and that she've made the decision that she will stay ( even tho she said that the decision is not 100% final, cause there is still 1 year until she finishes and a lot of things can change during that time) there after finishing college(which is this year). That was the first thing that hit me hard, but i got past over that, because it was still enough time, and I hoped that she will change her mind. I was really wrong, she just loves it there ( and also she kind of has not quite a perfect atmosphere home, alcoholic father etc) 

She came back home at the start of the summer, until like mid-july when she went back there. She went there because her boss asked her to work there for like 2 weeks, and that after she will take her on a vacation with her for another week. I was really dissapointed with that.. She came back almost at the end of August, and things kind of went only south from there.  I consider the summer being okay-ish all in all, we didn't really have fights until she left for these 3 weeks.

She went back there in mid-september, even though college starts in October..mainly so she could go there and work... after she went there, she started going there full time, and I think that's what changed her REALLY much.  Before finding that place, she used to come back home more often, but I understood the fact that she found this place. I've been to her almost 2 times per month since then, every month.

The work she is doing is very stressfull, i understand that..but still. In these months since that we'have numerous fights, all started by her, and was threaning me that she might break up with me. All these things, made me develop a depression, and anxiety. I've started getting really fucked up mentally, and  started drinking alcohol daily, and smoking since then.

Some days ago, after she went in a club with some of her friends(girls) and probably got somewhat drunk, she messaged me : ""Btw, you know that we'll break up right?"" ""We'll talk about it when we'll meet"". 

I don't know what to do. I've really loved this girl, I still do....but she changed so much in the last months, mainly after she started working there full time.  I can't believe she is the same person. She started treating me so shitty. She tells me that I need to work on my self-confidence, but on the other part she likes treating me with superiority. She manages to somehow make me doubt everything about me: my intelligence, my good sense, my fashion sense. HELL, at one point she even complained about how I was washing the dishes, what the fuck?! She regularly disregards my ideas, suggesstions, uses sarcasm way too much to make me feel bad. If she complains about something I've done, and I try to point out stuff she also did wrong, she says that I never admit that whatever she says I'm doing wrong its true, EVEN IF I DO, and she says that I always try to make her guilty, and that I'm basically saying that it's all her fault, WHICH IS NOT TRUE ALSO.

 I've developed some anxiety from this. I just have a feel that whatever I might do might offend or provoke her anger.

I just do not want to feel like shit. I fear of the thought  of being alone,  fear of not finding someone else( as I didn't have until 21 years old, and she was the one that made kind of everything happen, she wanted all this relationship to happen), as I'm just an quite average looking guy, that is introverted and socially awkward. I know that I'll miss the sex with her, which she made me like really much. I've really put all my heart in this relationship with her, and it makes it so hard for me to let go.  Back when I was thinking about how I'd like a woman to be, she kind of checked everything I've wanted from my list. I've even asked her that we move together after we finish college( both this year) at some point and even though she kind of made me change my mind in the start, she kind of embraced in the following months, and started to be positive with that.

I've  done something morally wrong, but which I feel it had to be done, because I wanted to know what's going on. I've looked through her Facebook Messages. I've seen that she didn't cheat on me, but she told a friend that she considered it,(because she is kind of a nympho, and sex for her on two weekends per month was not enough)  but she'd feel bad for me, that I wouldn't deserve that to happen to me. So I guess she didn't do it.

On the other hand, I've seen a message that she was saying to some other friends, that she was waiting for her birthday to come, so I'd get her a gift, and that she will probably find a way to end it with me after. Stupid me, I actually thought that getting her something more expensive, that she'll surely like will make a difference or make her change her mind.  Her birthday was in late Feb, and after I've went to her, things felt apart really bad. We started talking less and less,  and she started being super sarcastic for no reason, which made not really want to message her, because it made me feel way too bad.  

Oh, another message is that she  said she isn't sure she wants a serious relationship yet, that she actually thinks about experimenting more until she gets into one.

Since March, I can't really stay sober. I just started drinking through the day no numb my feelings. I'm drinking almost 5-6 beers daily, spread through the day and that usually helps me go through with the day. 

At this moment, I'm at the lowest point I've ever been. I don't know what to do, I have a huge fear, I don't want to feel alone.

60nwx0,61,2017-03-21,I just got a job as the first ever data scientist in a startup company. I only have about 3 months of prior experience in the field from an internship. How can I do a good job?,aconfusedgraduate,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/60nwx0/i_just_got_a_job_as_the_first_ever_data_scientist/,"Greetings, data scientists of reddit.

I had applied to a data scientist position at an online marketplace startup of about 10-15 employees. They are now looking to start data science and analytics operations in the company.    

This startup is like Amazon for certain exotic items in India.        

And so today, I got a call from them informing me I was selected for the role. Naturally, I'm happy, but here's the thing -  I will be their **first ever** data scientist, and I have only about 3 months of previous experience in data science from an internship at a different company.      

There is nobody in the company who can guide me, and I'm far from an expert in the field. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering with some knowledge of statistics.           

Here is the list of what I already did/know because of the internship -        

* Data wrangling and cleaning (of mostly structured data) using dplyr and tidyr        
* Feature engineering (transformations, PCA, imputation of missing data etc.)          
* Deploying machine learning algorithms (random forests, xgboost, support vector machines, neural networks, cubist etc.)         

I used R for all of the above. I have extensively read *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James et al. Both these books are my go-to reference manuals.

* Generating insights from data (structured, unstructured and streaming data)        
* Building statistical models to improve company operations        

The data I'll be dealing with will mostly involve their inventory database and transactional data.

I had an interview a few weeks ago with a company to work in their marketing department on ads (mostly editing, filming, etc.) and they just gave me a response last night that I got it. I'm a CS major, so my only experience with film outside of making gaming videos is a single gen-ed film class I took last year.

They wanted a portfolio and my only experience with editing is my gaming videos. And I mean gaming videos - there was literally not one video that was shot in real life. But I made sure not to include easy to edit things like LPs. I had some fancy intros I made and some other more ""well-edited"" things I threw together across the years (for example I had the first 20 seconds of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4G4Q7E-epc) in there. If you wanna see some other stuff I included I'd be happy to share but most of it is unlisted on my old channel). I had maybe 10 or so videos and at least 4-5 were made in 2012-2014 back when I was in highschool.

They played some clips on a projector in the conference room and when I realized I was gonna be showing gaming videos to a bunch of people who were like 40+ I just internally started cringing.  Guess it went over pretty well though.

Anyways, that's all. Just thought you guys might find it interesting."

I try learning new things for Information Technology.  But nooooo, I wasted my time of 3 fucking years of fucking around with a homelab I don't even use instead of focusing on papermills for a paper of a Bachelor's.  I spend my days and nights reading technology guide after guide. I wonder what's the point if employers want people with the stupid piece of paper.  I'm fucking disgusted by the lies that they think they know it all, fake it till you make it bullshit, social networking, and god fuck it all at least going somewhere unlike me.  Then they get a job where they want to work.

I burnt my only bridge because I was too proud by saying I could've gotten a scholarship from the NSA.  One fucking bridge at a community college with no fucking other bridges.  Noone wants to hire someone that ""can"" put in backdoors! Oh no, god forbid I do that!  Cybersecurity my ass, there's worse things to worry about than a backdoor.  No, instead of a helpdesk internship at $BigHospital, I have to work at McD with a fake smile for middle class folks who are concerned about what goes into their french vanilla iced coffee.

I'm starting to fail more classes than I am passing.  Why does depression do this to me?  Since I'm failing classes, it's getting harder for me to transfer to a university for job aspects.

I have a leatherman, why don't I just slit my wrists?  I want to break my window.  I want to destroy the $750 lab I have because it's fucking useless.  Useless, I don't even turn it on anymore.

Fuck it, lurking won't help anymore.  I quit.  That's all I do anyway, noone cares if I show up or disappear.  Lurking a sub full of weebos and middle aged men is great because it's the only thing I look forward to every friday since it's almost like getting to know how a friend is doing.  But I'm fed up, and fuck the weeabos since they're having a party by themselves and fucking shipping and fan fiction.  Is that the kind of people I should be with?  If I don't fit in with normal people or outcast people, then I go by myself.

Why should I care about other people?  Why don't I just start making viruses and not POCs, fucking up websites and not submitting bug bounties (i don't care about money), and terrorizing the Internet? Fuck the script kiddies who want a name, I'd burn everything down if I could. I could've gotten a scholarship from the NSA.  At least I know I shouldn't end up like Unabomber, I realize how similar we are.  For me, control over technology as it takes over our lives.

Noone cares I'm learing about high availability, or Linux, or Powershell, or about CCNA, or what is storage, or distributed systems, or full stack for web applications, or accounting, or business intelligence, or data science, or cryptology, or GRC, or web development so I can get into cybersecurity, or god fuck it all I can't even list what I should know.  Noone cares unless I know the right person or have a fucking piece of paper.  I want to push myself.  Take pride in my own work.  Fuck that.  Jack of all trades, master of none.

I'm disappointed in myself."

Roughly $850 budget for gaming and programming!,the_BK_broiler,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/60obsy/ive_asked_before_but_something_came_up_and_money/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming, such as Overwatch, Black Ops 3 Custom Zombies, and more. I will also be using this about 50/50 for school/work for programming and development.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Maximum budget is about $850 

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I just got sufficient money and a summer internship so I'm splurging myself to celebrate which means as soon as possible! I plan on buying the parts within the next week!

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Everything except monitor, mouse, and keyboard.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Michigan, USA. If deals at Fry's are substantial I can drive to Illinois to pick up parts.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Dell UltraSharp UP2414Q 24"" 4K monitor. (note: i do not plan to game at 4K, i just got this monitor for $100 so I will deal with scaling down to 1080p. Although I will use the 4K resolution when not gaming.)

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

nope

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would like a build with room for upgrades such as more HDDs and SSDs in the future.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

I've been looking at the Fractal Design Mini C with window so microATX style.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Nope, I can get one through my university

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

I have $350 in Amazon gift cards and Amazon Prime so if Amazon prices can compete with Newegg and others I would prefer Amazon 

I need a keyboard but I will do some research on my own as I would like something cheap with backlights (I've been eyeing up the Corsair K55 RGB)

Below I have created a mock build and if there are suggestions or critiques of it please tell me!

60osfx,1,2017-03-21,"Româniile trec, decalajele rămîn",crocodilul,RomaniaStiri,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomaniaStiri/comments/60osfx/româniile_trec_decalajele_rămîn/,"Pe la începutul anului scriam că din 1990 încoace au trecut cam tot atîția ani cît a avut întreaga perioadă interbelică. Și mă întrebam dacă și cum s-ar putea compara evoluțiile economice și sociale din cele două perioade similare ca durată, într-un mod cît de cît pertinent, „științific”. Sînt criterii după care pot fi măsurate ambele perioade? Se poate spune care perioadă a fost mai fertilă economic sau în care perioadă nivelul de trai a sporit mai mult? „Sînt, desigur, aspecte complicate ale unei astfel de încercări de comparație a epocilor, care comportă cunoștințe și instrumente aflate doar la îndemîna unor (puțini) specialiști”, scriam în articolul menționat. Ei bine, între timp am descoperit că de fapt astfel de specialiști există, s-au apucat de treabă și au explicat cum stau lucrurile în volume scrise într-un limbaj destul de accesibil. Iar unul dintre aceste volume este cel al profesorului Bogdan Murgescu de la Facultatea de Istorie din București, România și Europa. Acumularea decalajelor economice (1500-2010), Polirom, 2010.

Pentru că trebuia să se încheie undeva, cartea citată s-a oprit chiar la momentul propriei apariții, așa încît nu a cuprins complet perioada 1990-2015 necesară pentru compararea cu anii 1920-1945. Dar a lăsat, în schimb, cîteva repere importante pentru evaluarea perioadei interbelice. De exemplu, la pagina 217 este prezentat un tabel privind „Venitul național/locuitor în România și în alte țări europene în anul 1938”, considerat deseori drept anul de vîrf al economiei interbelice. Veniturile sînt exprimate în dolari SUA la valoarea lor din anul de referință. Astfel, în Marea Britanie acest venit era de 378 de dolari; Germania avea 338; Franța - 237; Cehoslovacia - 174; Italia - 127; Ungaria - 111; Polonia - 104; Grecia - 80; România - 76; Bulgaria - 68. Media venitului pentru 20 de țări europene, mai arată tabelul, a fost de 222 dolari. Valorile prezentate nu au poate relevanță în sine, dar putem reține de aici că la acest capitol România se situa în anul 1938 la un nivel de 34% din media celor 20 de țări europene. Pe lîngă acest criteriu, în carte mai sînt prezentate și alte tabele comparative, cum ar fi cele privind consumul, producția, nivelul de alfabetizare, mortalitatea infantilă sau speranța medie de viață la naștere. Luînd în calcul și situația din anii premergători Primului Război Mondial, concluzia profesorului Murgescu este că „decalajele României față de cele mai multe țări europene s-au amplificat în perioada interbelică” iar la sfîrșitul intervalului, „România Mare era unul dintre statele cele mai slab dezvoltate economic și social la nivelul Europei”. Aprecieri destul de severe la adresa prejudecăților privind „epoca de aur” interbelică.

Intuiția ne spune că regimul comunist nu a reușit să amelioreze situația. Dar și calculele profesorului Murgescu. Este citat, de pildă, Produsul Național Brut pe baza cursului de schimb (dolari americani) din anul 1989. Doar Albania (900) avea un astfel de PNB mai mic decît al României (1567). În Regatul Unit era de 14.570, Germania (RFG) 20.750, Franța 17.830, Cehoslovacia 5.000, Italia 15.150, Ungaria 2560, Polonia 1760, Grecia 5340, Bulgaria 2320. Media europeană (formată de această dată din 24 de state) era de 8298, ceea ce înseamnă că România realiza acum 18% din ea - o scădere de aproape jumătate față de anul 1938. Concluzia este că „în termeni relativi, România și-a păstrat în toată perioada (comunistă) poziția mult sub media europeană”; ba mai mult, poziția ei a fost de asemenea „și sub media celorlalte țări est-europene care au supuse regimului comunist” (pagina 331).

Care e situația astăzi? Dacă tot am pornit cu un set de state luate ca exemplu, aș continua tot cu el. Știu că economiștilor nu le place, dar tipul de date pe care le-am strîns (publice, de pe paginile de internet ale unor instituții de profil) nu mai e același. Adică, în loc de venit național și PNB, iau ca criteriu Produsul Intern Brut pe locuitor. În definitiv, nu valorile absolute mă interesează, ci poziția relativă a României față de alte state europene. Astfel, PIB-ul pe locuitor (nominal, 2016) în Regatul Unit a fost de 43.902 dolari SUA; în Germania - 41.267 (2015); în Franța - 37.675 (2015); Cehia - 18.020; Slovacia - 16.648; Italia - 30.231 (estimat, 2017); Ungaria - 13.487; Polonia - 13.390; Grecia - 18.953 (estimat, 2017); Bulgaria - 7091 și România - 9992 (estimat, 2017). La o medie europeană de 32.384 dolari (de fapt, media țărilor din UE), aceste valori arată că România realizează, la capătul unei perioade postdecembriste de lungimea perioadei interbelice, 30% din media statelor UE. Este o valoare situată peste nivelul din perioada comunistă, dar sub cel al perioadei interbelice.

S-ar spune că ne-am revenit, în sensul că, după o perioadă similară ca dimensiune cu cea interbelică, sîntem astăzi în aceeași marjă de submediocritate ca acum 70 de ani. Și nu sîntem singuri. În cartea citată, autorul are ideea salutară de a analiza în paralel și evoluțiile altor „țări periferice” în afară de România. Cazul Serbiei (ulterior al Iugoslaviei) este elocvent în acest sens. Dar sînt și țări periferice care au reușit să facă saltul și să elimine din decalaje. E situația Danemarcei și a Irlandei, investigată pe larg în carte, dar și a Finlandei, care e menționată mai puțin. Cum au reușit ele și mai ales dacă ingredientele succesului se ițesc acum și la noi este o altă – și mai grea – discuție."
60oyi8,5,2017-03-21,Questions about working in Switzerland,tcush89,askswitzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/60oyi8/questions_about_working_in_switzerland/,"Grüezi mitenand!

So I have some questions about moving to and working in Switzerland. This is my situation:

I'm a Swiss-American dual citizen due to the fact that my mother and grandmother are Swiss. I was born and raised however in the US, and all of my school qualifications are American. I'm 24 and have a BA in political science with minors in German and Russian from an American university. I also spent a year in Germany as part of my bachelors degree. German and English I speak fluently. My Swiss German is minimal, but I can speak a very little bit. As far as work experience goes, I have about 6 months of public relations experience where I did an internship in the PR department of a nonprofit organization, and I have been currently working for about a year as a Genius (computer service technician) at an Apple Store here in the US (so basically minimal IT experience as well as retail, which to be honest I hate the retail part of my job). I'm currently also in a MA program in political science with about 18 months left on it. To be honest the only reason I did the MA was kind of as a moratorium until I came up with a solid plan and found a direction to go in of what I really wanted to do.

My fiancee/soon to be wife is currently finishing a MA in German with US certification to teach on the high school level, and she has about 18 months left in that.

After she finishes that, we would really like to move to Switzerland. We lived in Germany together for a little while, and spent some time during trips and visiting family in Switzerland, and would really like to move to CH full time.

My main question is about job prospects. Due to the fact that I've spent a good amount of time in Germany, I'm more familiar with the German system, and of course the German system is all about qualifications. If I wanted a specific job in Germany, I wouldn't be able to get it without the proper degree and the proper Ausbildungen/Praktika.

As far as jobs I'm qualified for in Switzerland (and I just have no clue about this because I've never been employed or gone to school in CH), what are my options? Do my work experiences give me any chances of getting into fields like PR or IT or something unrelated to my degree, or is the fact that I have a political science degree limiting like it would be in Germany? Also, since I can't really speak Swiss German, would I be able to get by in a work environment with High German, or would this also be a limiting factor?

Thanks for the answers!"

I have never been great at math, so since they make you pick an emphasis at my school, I chose the one with the least math. I enjoy my systems analysis classes and find that that's the field I want to go into; I even landed an internship as a business analyst this summer. However, most of the posts I see in this subreddit have people struggling with calculus/discrete math, which is something I never had to take. Additionally, everyone seems to be programmers. My advisor says you don't have to be a hardcore coder to succeed in this field (I mean I can code, and I enjoyed some of my classes, but in no way do I want to do it for a living), but I guess I'm just worried since I don't see a lot of people around here with my career path in mind? And wondering if I'm going to be prepared to enter the world with a compsci degree and the classes I'm taking?"

So I work for a small fashion brand in one of their two retail stores. The company is based out of LA, and I live in Portland. I was offered an internship in LA this summer to work directly with their designer at trade shows, assist the production team and E-commerce team and style models for shoots. I'm very excited for the opportunity and for the time away from home, even if it's for a short time period. 

The dilemma I'm running into is that I asked the designer about reasonable dress code as I've never really worked in an office before, and he essentially said ""wear whatever."" Despite this, I want to pick one style to wear at the office, as what I wear on a day to day basis varies pretty hugely depending on my mood, the time I have to get ready and what clothes I just feel like wearing that day.

The company I'm working for has several aesthetics as the designer makes several lines of clothing. One of his lines would best be described as ""California business casual"" with a lot of polos, short sleeve button downs, khakis and light sweaters. Then there's his second line that's more #streetwear that features shredded hoodies, drop crotch joggers, jumpsuits and military bombers. Then there's his third line that's more of a relaxed LA vibe with pinstripe shorts, pocket tees and minimalist basics.

My personal style is somewhere at the corner of streetwear, PNW Americana (i.e. flannels, selvedge denim, boots), and very out-there queer fashion (lots of neon, mesh, skirts, 4"" heels). What I'm wondering is what style I should be trying to go for as a representative of a fashion brand in trade shows/photo shoots/office wear. Because it's a streetwear brand, is it okay if I throw on some cute joggers and NMDs and head to work? Do I need to go purchase a bunch of khakis and OCBDs? How much edge can I put in my looks since it's a fashion brand and the employees are expected to have some personal style? It's also going to be hotter than hell since it's July and August in LA, and I'm used to the PNW where no one cares what you look like and everyone has 50 jackets. What's acceptable office wear when it's 100 degrees outside? 

Advice and tips would be greatly appreciated! "

60pji9,1,2017-03-21,I can't afford to finish my degree. Is that a death sentence?,elephanse,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/60pji9/i_cant_afford_to_finish_my_degree_is_that_a_death/,"Some background:

I'm 21 going on 22 this summer. Studied English Lit at a medium-sized Honors university up until a few weeks ago. I excelled pretty well, making Dean's List, heading a few organizations, publishing one research paper in a book and another in the undergraduate research journal, but this all turned out to be an issue w my mental health. I'm technically a senior but since I withdrew from this semester, I'll have to graduate in 2018 IF I can afford to return (more below). I really want to be a novelist eventually, but have been pursuing a career in journalism to pay the bills—yeah, I know—and now I work at a nonprofit news agency and write a column for a small magazine based up in DUMBO.

Recently my family ran into a financial wall because, as it turns out, my mother decided not to pay her 2015 taxes so without her tax returns or information, I can't complete this year's FAFSA to receive my usual aid. As of right now I owe the school $6000 for the fall semester. I'm meeting with the financial aid counselor again next week to discuss my options moving forward.
I also withdrew from the semester because my ongoing mental health issues resulted in me not caring about my studies anymore at all. I began missing assignments under the delusion that I'd just turn them in late, though I never did. 
I'm still trying to sort this out—setting up an appointment with a new therapist next week—but I think the biggest issue was that I stopped learning halfway through my junior year. My school is pretty good for STEM, law and accounting, but terrible for the Humanities, so for over a year now I've been teaching MYSELF the subjects I've been interested in, and last semester I was stimulated the most because I spent the semester working on one long research paper that I designed myself. In short, the curriculum was too easy but required so much time. Even my Intro to Fiction class required we do fucking 30 pages of reading and subsequent journal entries every night to the point where I got NO actual writing done in the time I took that class. The upper-level classes were worse—we were given ridiculous amounts of work covering information that was not that difficult to understand.
Meanwhile I've reading books outside of my classes that were tougher and more interesting, especially thanks to a friend at Verso Books who's been sending me free proofs for the past few months. While we sorta-kinda touched upon Zora Neale Hurston in class, I found myself spending hours researching historiography of the Harlem Renaissance or Hurston's life story and published research because those things were more interesting; in one of my classes we were introduced to Derrida's transcendental signified as if it were the toughest concept out there and never really got past the basic definition of it, so I got some books on semiotics—a word I never would've learned at my school, turns out—and never went back.
MEANwhile, I was working part-time as either an editorial intern or freelance journalist. I've had an internship every, save for one, semester for the past two (three, now?) years and since I did want a job after I graduated, I devoted a fair amount of time and effort into that as well. I didn't really have a social life at all my first semester of junior year because of this work-study combo and that's fine because I was taking my first couple graduate courses and was engrossed in my studies.
That next semester, however, is when things went downhill. I didn't take an internship because I wanted to get straight As to do an Honors project my senior year. This was when I began teaching myself things because school wasn't hard anymore, and my mental health suffered as a result. I would sit in class and zone out or fall into a depressive episode for some outside reason I still don't quite understand myself. The fun in writing essays was gone because I had too many other academic assignments so I was stressed for time when the work didn't even require that much stress. It's like the faculty replaced quality over quantity or something; give the students so much work they have anxiety attacks so they don't realize that they aren't learning that much?
I thought this was just a one-off thing because the next semester is when I did the independent study and was genuinely pretty content with my life. I also took on my last internship at the news agency which turned into a part-time job this past January, which is looking to turn into a full-time one since I'm not in school right now. Things were good!
But then, this semester, I decided to go back to the traditional course load to learn some new things and it all went downhill faster than last semester. I knew something was wrong because I shouldn't have been wholly disengaged in my schoolwork by the third week, especially as someone who actually loves school.
I wound up forgetting about assignments and then skipping classes to do those assignments, and you know that most classes only give you three absences without repercussions. So, I withdrew before my grades began to sink with the intention of taking a gap semester—something I've been coveting since last spring—but now it's looking like I might not be able to go back.
And it isn't as though I'd be able to go back if I finished this semester. It's that my last semester/year of college was probably not going to happen no matter what I did, thanks to this mishap.

My family doesn't have much money. I'm a first-generation college student from a family of immigrants, and it isn't as though we're barely scraping by (anymore, I've had a rocky past) but we also don't have $6000+ lying around. I'm not really asking what to do because I'll be talking to my financial counselor about that, but rather: 

If the worst case scenario happens, that I genuinely can't go back to school for a few years, is it really that bad considering the circumstances?
I have a good job in my field paying a living wage that's training me for a career. I have a great resume/CV from both internships and freelancing. After I gain some hard experience in journalism I want to find a job in New York and move up there, because I have a lot of friends and professional connections that I'd like to be closer to, especially considering what I want to do with my life. 
Right now I'm afloat, but I HATE not having the safety net of a real degree. I feel exposed and sometimes get anxiety attacks about the future, because what if this company goes belly-up and then I try to find another job and no matter what my resume says, they won't give me a chance because I don't have a degree? Does that actually happen? (But if that's the case, how could Ta-Nehisi Coates get anywhere? *shrug*)

I suppose I just want some outside eyes on the situation, because it really is looking like this thing I valued so much when I was younger is out of my reach, at least for a few years, and I don't want to ever go back to retail work. Is this bad? Or is it surprisingly un-bad? 

P.S. Fuck student loans. They're the only things I'm genuinely angry about; I got this far and took them out and now I don't even have the degree they were for. This is fucking bullshit."

60ppxy,33,2017-03-21,[COACHING REPORT] CPU Nationals 2017 | Male 25 | 6 Athletes |,mattgoldsmith,powerlifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/60ppxy/coaching_report_cpu_nationals_2017_male_25_6/,"VIDEOS here: https://www.instagram.com/pizzacoaching/


Hey guys, here's my Coaching Recap of 2017 CPU Nationals. First off I need to thank Joel Boulianne for directing IMO the best CPU meet in the last 5 years. The bar is set very high for Avi next year and for our OPA hosted nationals in 2019!! 

Anyways, this was my first Nationals going totally crew-less. I've never been to nationals without our team, but I wasn't missing this meet regardless. I came to solely coach this year, hopefully I get my bench only total at the very least by this year. @pizzacoaching came in to coach 3 athletes, by the time I got to the venue I had 3 more. I figured that I'd be using this meet to pad my resume so I could improve my resume for my 2017 IPF classic worlds coaching application so I didn't charge for any lifters for handling. We wont be charging for meet day handling until 2018 and even still we'll work around charging in creative ways for lifters that need them. 


moving on to the actual lifting. 


Derick Jr 66kg:  First lifter up, Derick asked me to help him the night before after his handling plans fell through. This meant I was doubled up in the morning session. No problem though as we setup on a warm up rack with 2 other worlds coaches and we were all good at taking care of each others athletes. SQUAT: 175 opener, easy textbook opener. 182.5 second attempt fast fast fast. stuck to the game plan and hit 190kg 3rd, LOL this literally looked like a sandbagged attempt. We could have hit 200kg that day. Bench: Love this guys bench, its tight and fast. 115kg opener, easy. 120kg second, got weird and he cramped through. He'd cramped up all day so this was sketchy. 122.5kg LOL no cramp probs could have hit 127.5-130kg. DEADLIFT Derick's bread and butter. 1st attempt 222.5kg beltless lol. 2nd 232.5, got stuck off the floor a little bit so I cut back the 3rd to ensure we got our provincial deadlift record. 3rd 237.5 Jr provincial record. Smashed it, we had 245 easy that day.  Either way we went 9/9 got silver and a Provincial deadlift record. 


Lanre Jr 74kg: Another last minute athlete. This guy's got a big squat, hopefully he gets a chance at hancott's record over the next couple years. at Regional's in January he went 3/9 and really wanted to redeem this performance. SQUAT: Opener 212.5kg moved well. 2nd 222.5kg attempt little slow but Lanre is a good grinder so we went to his goal of 227.5kg. Third got stuck just in the transition point and missed it. BENCH: 105kg opener was fast. 107.5kg 2nd slowed down a bit but we got it. 3rd 110kg bench, smoked it 3/3 on bench. DEADLIFT: 220kg opener easy. 2nd 230kg we're in the fight now sitting in 5th place as of now. 240kg 3rd but we waited to the last second to up our 3rd to kind of throw off the guy in 4th and to push his lift up too high to be attainable. moved up to 242.5 kg Lanre smokes it and the guy after us pushes up to 255kg and cant grab it off the floor, perfect. 4th place in the most competitive class in the JR division. Love this guy mates, excellent performer and he killed it. 


Blake 83kg Jr: Blake moved up to 83kg from 74kg last minute. we were kind of screwed up as we didn't get the flights posted until the last minute, this happens often so its not too bad. SQUAT: 195kg opener moved fast. 202.5kg slowed down a bit and had a slight shake through the sticking point, I didn't like this so we stayed conservative. 210kg 3rd smoked it, probs had about 220kg that day. BENCH 110kg fast. 117.5kg second moved well. 122.5kg grindy but he got it, ended up being red lighted on downward movement I honestly should have gone to the jury because it was a VERY subtle call. DEADLIFT: 220kg opener, fast. 230kg still fast, big pr INC. 240kg 3rd, rips it up super fast but gets a wobble at lockout and gets redlighted for up and down. Blake's very hard on his performances but he did very well.

Collin 120kg M1: worked with Collin in Killeen last year. Love working with master lifters because they know how to perform, Collin knows how to let the coaches do their thing so he can do his. SQUAT: 260kg, LOL fast. 275kg 2nd smokes it. 285kg 3rd perfect call, grindy but it goes up. BENCH: HOLY CRAP we had brutal bench pauses this session. 195kg 1st attempt 3 sec pause command... 202.5kg 2nd 4 sec pause command (I'm dead serious...) miss. 202.5kg 3rd, gets a fast pause and gets it up reasonably quickly. DEADLIFT: we were chasing best M1 lifter of the contest so we had to pull out all the stops to cinch this. 250kg, fast opener. 265kg  second, fast still. 285kg 3rd, big jump still. Did some quick math and figured out we'd need to jump up to 302.5kg to secure best overall master. That likely wasn't happening so we kept it at 285kg to secure gold in the weightclass. Smokes 3rd attempt and its GG for Collin. He's going to Belarus. 


Justin 105kg Jr: Worked with Justin a few times and knew he can perform. SQUAT: 177.5kg opener fast. 187.5kg 2nd moves fast as well.  195kg 3rd hit the sticking point but grinds through it. 3/3. BENCH: 90kg fast. 97.5kg we get wait 10-15seconds to get a start command  for elbow lockout, miss. 97.5kg 3rd STILL get a weird start command and its another miss, jury was unhelpful with an explanation oh well. DEADLIFT: 220kg fast. 232.5kg 2nd fast again. 245kg 3rd fast still but slows down at lockout, nails it regardless. 7/9 Bench has plagued us for a while now but we've just got to keep up changing the game plan to find what works.


Chris 120+kg open: I train with Chris at the same gym. Can't say enough good things about this guy, he's very humble and makes time to help everyone else out in the gym. It's my privilege to help him out this week. Also the first time he's had a real coach for a meet. SQUAT 227.5kg red light on depth. 227.5kg 2nd  good lift. 245kg 3rd a little bit too speedy for a third attempt but this is actually what we wanted. BENCH 160kg good lift. 165kg gets a weird handoff and grinds the fuck out of the 2nd attempt. I wanted to pass the 3rd so we could rock deads but he wanted to go for it. 167.5kg much faster, perfect 3rd attempt speed. Good call on his part. DEADLIFT 320kg opener. 280 was his last warm up and it looked pretty rough, regardless he smokes 320kg. 340kg 2nd FAST, oh boy this is what we came for. 365.5kg CPU national record attempt!!!! 805lbs! we grab another 120+ and another coach to give him smacks and help him get hyped up. The crowd is roaring, Geno is hyping everyone up. pulls it fast up to his knees but just cant get around them. Almost got it. man that was exciting, I cried a little bit, it was amazing. 


That was it for the athletes. I'm incredibly proud of all my guys this week and cant say enough good things about all of them.


GOALS for next year: 1 get more female athletes, currently don't have any on the roster. 2 get enough athletes to coach ever day of the week. 3 complete my coaching internship and become an assistant coach for IPF worlds in Calgary for 2018. "

The main questions I have are the following: 

1. Should I send this to my regional admissions officer? 

2. The three points I want to make are that I'm still interested, I will 100% attend the school if admitted, and any updates I have. Am I on the right track? 

3. Related to #2. When should I send the email? I'm not planning on sending it until after I receive all of my decisions (April 1st). Should I send one now indicating continued interest, and then another one with updates? I'm waiting on an internship. 

4. UChicago offers a gap year admission option where you are admitted to the next year's class in addition to the normal waitlist. I don't think many people are interested in this option, but I think this would be a good fit for me. I still need to discuss it with my parents, but assuming I can, would saying I'd prefer the gap year option possibly improve my chances? Or should I just say that I'm okay with either option? 

Thanks for any replies! Good luck to everyone else still waiting on decisions :) "
60pwb6,5,2017-03-21,What skills do you think are required to be a competent Echo developer?,reWorkPutty,AmazonEchoDev,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonEchoDev/comments/60pwb6/what_skills_do_you_think_are_required_to_be_a/,"tl;dr As the title says really. I'll give a bit of context but it's not really required for the question.

I'm currently doing an internship in a company that deal with 'smart' devices that operate appliances in kitchens. Essentially with IOT devices. I'm a QA Intern, so Alexa wouldn't have been the usual port of call for someone in my position. However the company doesn't have Alexa integration, and a supervisor asked me would I be interested in developing it on the side. 
I sort have free run with it and what functionality it should take. I messed around with some Trivia skills and made a simple skill that points to our backend and reads data from it, all using JS. 
However I've been hoping to use it on one of our devices. I've seen plenty of videos where somebody asks Alexa to turn on a light switch - at the core, that's what I'm trying to do. One simple input on a button. Not with a light switch mind you, but a device that has just one button. It should be easy but I'm struggling with it big time. My ability in JS is lacking. My Python is slightly better, however going off AWS tutorials I've found no examples to show how Python could be worked in with Alexa. So I've spent the last two days looking up how to have Alexa operate with an IOT device. The official tutorial wasn't helpful at all to me, plus another that focused on bringing up a city location through a web browser didn't even seem relevant. Seeing as Alexa is used in so many IoT devices, I thought something as simple as ""Alexa, ask [skillname] to activate this button"" would have a myriad of tutorials. The 'getting started' tutorials I found have been far too basic at this stage. It's as if development on Echo goes
&lt;--Starting tutorials---Power Gap----------- Being a competent Echo Dev--&gt;
My outlook now is that the 'Power Gap' is basically filled by the developers own knowledge of certain languages and tricks that should make developing for Echo a breeze. This isn't something exactly required of me in work, but it's something I want to do for me. In my eyes VUI's are the future, and being competent enough to work with one is an invaluable skill.
Thanks guys."

I'm currently a Sophomore studying computer science and have just sent out my last round of applications for this summer (unfortunately I still don't have an internship lined up for the summer) I got a couple interviews in the fall but no luck, and now I'm really trying to get a job.

My question is - I applied for a couple jobs that I am really interested in, but I know that these companies will get hundreds of applicants. Is it a good idea to try and e-mail a recruiter or HR rep for interns now after applying to try and make a more personal connection, or will that just make me come off as bad? I'm worried that my resume will just sit in a virtual pile and not really be looked at but I don't want to come off as pushy or needy.

60qfr1,9,2017-03-21,I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to breathe. I don't love the new guinea pig.,caviabella,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/60qfr1/im_a_horrible_person_who_doesnt_deserve_to/,"I probably should start off by saying I have 5 guinea pigs, well, now 6 I guess. I'm that annoying person who will go off on you if you say it's ""just a guinea pig"". They are just as smart as a job and they all have different personalities. They're like my babies and I love them more than anything. Well...Except for one apparently. 

My boyfriend and I were in a petstore getting our usual stuff. We realized that the guinea pig that has been there for months was still there. She was up for adoption. I made a joke and was like ""Friend!"" and put my hand on the glass. I was expecting my boyfriend to keep walking but he actually stopped. He was like ""Do you want to adopt her?""  It was actually kind of cute. She was almost sleeping but perked up when we mentioned adopting her. It was like she knew. 

And I said ""Babe, we really shouldn't...."" 

And he was like ""She's been here a while."" 

Me: ""Yeah, but River and Snow White passed away last year and I'm still trying to cope and I'm really not ready..."" 

Him: ""Come on!"" 

Me: ""Guinea pigs are so expensive! We really can't afford the extra food and toys! And what about vet bills? Inara needs to go every three months, checkups are $100 a year, nail clippings needs to be done at least three times a year! And what if she needs surgery? We just paid for a $2,000 surgery a year ago! We can't afford that again.""

Him: ""It'll be fine. We'll manage!"" 

Me: ""I don't know....What do we do if she doesn't get along with Kitana, Annabella, and Inara? What if my mom's allergies get bad? What if my internship takes up too much time? What if my sister moves back home and I can't leave the isolation cage in her old room? Can she stay with you?"" *(My boyfriend and I don't live together yet, but we plan to in the next year or two.)* 

Him: ""Yeah! It's fine. They won't even notice one guinea pig!"" 

Me: ""Michael this is a big deal..."" 

Him: *-walks away-* 

Me: *-turns back to pick out the bag of pellets we need-* 

Petstore Employee: ""Here you go!"" 

Me: ""Wha-"" 

Petstore Employee: *-hands me the pig-* 

Me: ""Awww!"" 

Michael: *-magically reappears-* Oh! You're holding her! Do you want her!?  

Me: ""Well, I guess I can't say no now!""  

I know you guys don't know me or my boyfriend. But he's never been so pushy before. I've been with him five years and knew him for four years before that. He's never pressured me into anything ever. He won't even pick where we go on dates because he doesn't want me to do something I don't want to do. He's the sweetest guy ever. I can't believe he went and got the employee and told him to give me the guinea pig. I can't believe he begged so much. I felt bad, and since he said he could take her if things didn't go right at my house, I said yes. 

We got back to my house. I set up the old spare cage so we could keep her separate until she could be seen by the vet. We sat with her for a few minutes. Then my boyfriend went to work. 

I went to my room and laid in my bed and I just burst into tears. When I got the other five piggies it was love at first sight. I was bouncing up and down and super happy. I'm actually sad right now. 

I love the three piggies I have left (and I still love the two that passed away!). I'd die for them. We're bonded. I'd never give them away, or wish they'd disappear, or wish I never got them, or wish they'd die. But I had my time in the guinea pig world. I gave five piggies my heart and soul and all of my time and energy and it's theirs forever. But I need a break. I need a break financially, I need a break for all the time they take up, and I need a break emotionally. My other three pigs are older. I'm not looking forward to their time on Earth coming to an end. But I know it's inevitable and I didn't want to start the cycle over again. Does that make sense?

I was never scared to tell my boyfriend anything before. I've never felt embarrassed around him or like he'd judge me.  But I was terrified to tell him what was on my mind. I ended up texting him because I couldn't take it anymore. He, for the first time ever, called me a piece of shit and said I was being ""absolutely rotten"". He told me I was ""fucked up"" for not loving her but loving the others. He tried to guilt me into keeping her. This all makes him sound like a total asshole, I know. He really isn't. This is the only time he's done anything like this. (I will absolutely talk to him about what he said and how it made me feel when he gets home tonight. I think he just loves her already and is upset that I don't.) 

The thing is I'm not even sad he's saying that stuff, I agree with him. I'm on of those ""adopt don't shop!"" and ""pets are forever!"" people. I was being an absolute hypocrite when I didn't speak up at the pet store. Totally my fault. I'm a piece of shit and I hate myself so much right now. 

The new pig is cute. We named her Emily Elizabeth. I like her, but I don't love her even though I want to. I wish no ill will onto her, but I'm not happy she's here in my home. 

What do I do? Be the biggest hypocrite and return her? Try to keep her here and find a new home for her myself? Try and convince my boyfriend to take her? Just leave her here and go through the motions and take care of her but not love her? 

I don't know what to do. I'm just sitting here, with my three piggies, sobbing. I feel like a monster with no heart or soul. I hate myself so much. Like if someone told me I deserved to die, I'd agree with them. 

Edit: Here's a picture of my piggies! (New piggy isn't pictured. I deleted all the pictures I took of her off social media because I'm ashamed of my piece of shit self!) http://i.imgur.com/LDNEUIw.jpg "

60qlv9,105,2017-03-21,The dysfunction of civilization,iuseupyourusernames,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/60qlv9/the_dysfunction_of_civilization/,"The collapse of civilization quite frankly isn't half as interesting to me as the dysfunction of civilization is. The main elephant in the room is that this drastic increase in our standard of living might have led to material wealth, but it has merely lead to an epidemic of miserable dysfunctional people, kept alive by a government that's expected to use technology to fill the gaps created by a society that has started to fall apart. I think rather than staring ourselves blind at oil decline rates and sea ice statistics, we have to consider the possibility that civilization may fall apart simply because it manages to make people so miserable that they refuse to participate.

You can look at the suicide and drug overdose rates to see that our society is not functioning well. The terrorism and mass shooting epidemics we face are simply subsets of the suicide epidemic, expressed in a different cultural framework. In some subcultures you post on 4chan before you go out and kill yourself, in some you write a manifesto, in others you imagine yourself to act out on a religious obligation.

It used to be the case that when you got sick, you got better again, or you died. Today people get sick and spend the rest of their life in a state of impairment. They might have missing organs, they might be stuck in a wheelchair or they might be in chronic pain. A cynic might say that the solution we found to the technological unemployment crisis was to make people so sick that they can't work, thereby creating jobs for the rest of us who need to take care of them.

In the old days, you found a boyfriend or a girlfriend, someone got pregnant, a shotgun wedding resulted and you spent the next sixty or seventy years together. That's how my grandparents were married, the marriage might not have been perfect, but I can't say that I'm under the impression they were worse off as a result. If the relationship really wasn't satisfying, you'd keep it up for the outside world and you'd secretly agree to have an extramarital affair.

If you had some very unfortunate health condition you might spend the rest of your life alone, but most people managed to get their shit together. Even my grandfather who lost his leg as a kid in an accident simply managed to get married, had a bunch of shitty jobs that required zero education and could afford a nice house with a garden where he raised three children and lived out the last sixty-five years or so of his life. Try doing that now.

Look at today's society and you'll see young people have sex with the same person for a few months, anxiously making sure that no pregnancy results with state of the art contraceptive methods, move on to the next partner because the previous one didn't work out, then eventually find themselves unable to genuinely fall in love again and spend their days alone. Others are for whatever reason unable to enter a relationship. Many grow up staring at smartphones and other screens and as a result never learn to interact with others. 

If you read Michel Houellebecq's book ""Whatever"", you'll notice his thesis that our society is saturated with sex because we're secretly tired of it. I'm friends with good looking girls in their twenties who spend their weekends poledancing. You'd imagine these would be loose girls perhaps, but nope, I had one of them admit recently that she's never even had a relationship and fills that gaping hole in her heart with this girl-power clique of superficial hypersexuality. I'd love to say this is a joke, but it's not. Go to Japan and you'll find record numbers of people in their thirties who have simply resigned themselves to lifelong celibacy. These are people who would have been married with children fifty years ago. 

We think of pole-dancers and girls in thongs, covered in tattoos and piercings as hypersexual beings, but they're the opposite. People puff up their emptiness. Even if they still have sex, they separated sex from the consequences and unequal power dynamics imposed upon us by nature and as a result it can no longer be called sex, it becomes something entirely different. It has as much to do with sex as a plastic Christmas tree has to do with photosynthesis. The new image of hypersexuality is not Miley Cyrus, it's Michelle Duggar. Women like her live lives drenched in a kind of sexuality that permeates throughout their lives rather than being confined to the bedroom, whereas the women I date are forced to dress like men due to hygiene requirements in their workplace.

Birth rates are falling because young people today are completely unable to enter functional relationships with each other and develop a sense of financial stability. In the world of upper-middle class young white people, you spend until your late twenties ""studying"", with a year or two in between where you travel around the world or visit Africa to help out the orphans there because you need something on your resume. Then eventually, you just dedicate yourself to your career. Children? You get a Chihuahua to fill that vacuum and you tell yourself some convenient story you read on some hip online magazine about how children are bad for the environment.

The future was supposed to be exciting, but I can't reach any other conclusion than that most people I see are thoroughly bored with the world they live in. They tell themselves that they're ""busy"", whereas in reality they spend five or six hours a day watching TV/Netflix/some other screen because they're emotionally exhausted from profoundly boring jobs. Your grandparents had to keep themselves entertained through social activities. They might visit the local pub, they would go fishing, they would play card games with each other, they didn't have a TV to keep themselves entertained with. In the 90's young people still went to clubs, but most discotheques in my country are now struggling to survive. 

You remember your grandparents with the aura of respectability they had when they were old, but they lived wild lives when they were young too. Wilder than yours, I'm willing to guess. That's another thing worth noting. In every aspect, Millennials like me seem extremely well-behaved compared to generation X and the Babyboomers. Teenage pregnancies are at record lows, alcohol use by teens has gone down, crimes committed by young teenagers have gone down tremendously too.

How did that happen? Well, in reality, we just had the life spirit drained from us. That primal will to live and thrive that leads us to violate social conventions is gone. The friends I talk to are depressed and will claim that they don't *want* relationships with others, that they're happier single than they ever were in a relationship. The girls I talk to are frightened by the prospect of going out to a club to dance, because they envision the girls there will be better looking than them. They'd rather sit at home and stare at cat-pictures on the Internet than act like young people.

Generation Y is doing pretty terrible, but generation Z seems to have hit rock bottom. You can read the news about eating disorders, self-mutilation and all these other problems, but I'd like for people in their sixties or seventies today to simply tell me if this is how young people were back when you were young. These problems are not a normal part of youth, they're new. [The studies we have show that mental disorders like anxiety and depression are far more common than they were in the thirties to fifties, when we still had a functional civilization](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/todays-teens-anxious-depressed-paranoid/story?id=9281013). Look at teenagers today and you'll see how they seem to think it's hilarious to send me_irl memes back and forth about how they think of themselves as pathetic losers who would rather be dead. Again, that's not normal.

Today's young people spend until their mid-twenties jumping through hoops, with the message in the back of their head that if they miss any of them, they're fucked. Bad grade in high school? You're fucked. Dropped out of high school? You're fucked. No extracurricular activities to put on your CV? You're fucked. It continues all the way as they try to get into the most prestigious unpaid internship. Meritocracy has turned your life into a never-ending rat race. [Regular normal children today suffer more anxiety than psychiatric patients did in the 1950's.](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2000/12/anxiety.aspx) If you think it's bad now, wait until the next step follows, where we start genetically testing children to figure out where their skills lie, like they do in China.

In the old days, you could accept that you're born as white trash and that you'll live an average existence similar to that of your parents. If you were born wealthy, nepotism would ensure you wouldn't be publicly humiliated if you failed to get your shit together, you'd have an uncle in management somewhere or your father would know someone who can set you up with something. Today everyone can theoretically accomplish anything and as a result nobody can ever be content with anything. In the words of Sylvia Plath: ""Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing.""

60qrpb,3,2017-03-21,Admissions and Weight of SOP?,throwawayforcsstuffs,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/60qrpb/admissions_and_weight_of_sop/,"I am in the process of applying for the OMSCS program. I will be graduating in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in CS from a decent school in southeast US. I have completed 3 internships in software dev and will have completed 2 REU (undergraduate research) appointments by the time I graduate. 3.92 GPA and I've accepted a full-time job offer for after graduation.

I am concerned about my SOP affecting my chances of getting in. I am not an amazing writer (though I am not awful). How heavily is SOP likely to be weighted given my background, assuming I have great LORs?"
60qt5l,1,2017-03-21,To continue current internship / accept another offer?,Aspxa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60qt5l/to_continue_current_internship_accept_another/,"Hi! I've been interning at a fintech company (Company A) for about 4 months. Great pay, benefits, environment that I'm very comfortable in and people which work I enjoy too. Been doing well too that they asked me to extend. However, for the summer I'm a bit torn between whether I should continue or not because I'm somehow afraid I wouldn't get to experience working in a different environment too. 

I was approached by another company (Company B) last month for a position which was similar to my current internship, but will be more challenging because: it's a new division, they don't have many people yet so workload is going to be much more than my current internship. I'd also get the chance to explore new tools &amp; do more research since they're still building their ""workflow"" too. Now, I love challenges and all, and to be honest if they're paying me as much as I'm paid now, I'd take it for new experience, challenges &amp; all. Because of this (the challenging works and all) I went through their interviews and eventually got an offer. But it turns out that the salary they're offering is less than my current internship. I'm afraid that if I accept this offer, I'll keep comparing it to my previous experience and I can't console myself with ""at least you're getting paid as much/better for a new experience"" etc.  I really don't want to be miserable for three months should things go worse than expected...

On the other hand I also just got an interview call from Company C which I know will pay me as much as my current internship. However I'm not too keen on the role (I like the role at B better) so I'm wondering if I should continue or not. And Company C is pretty slow at responding/giving decisions so I'm afraid this would drag everything for even longer if I continue the process... but the pay and benefits are comparable to my current one + new environment too.

A couple of things I'm wondering:
- Should I choose Company A, does sticking with the same company for your internships make a certain impression on your CV? Is it a good one/bad one?
- Should I stay in my comfort zone (Company A) or try something new (Company B)? Or go with Company C?

Tl;dr current internship is too good, offered a position in another company where I can learn new things (which I love) but with less pay, benefits, and much more workload. Which one should I go with? Or should I go for interview with another company (which pays as much as my current one)?

Thank you everyone and sorry for the wall of text! Would appreciate any advice regarding this."

Look at me

I’ve never been so glad to get into my car. Even though it’s so blisteringly hot I feel the seat burn the back of my thighs, who cares? It’s Friday, it’s the hottest day I’ve ever known and shit, I just wanna get home! I crank the windows all the way open and pop the top two buttons on my blouse, the edge of my bra’s showing but hell, I’ll be moving and it’s too damn hot for modesty.

Opening the windows brings in the smell of hot tarmac. I reach up and undo my hair, the brown’s starting to show through the red dye, I’m gonna have to touch it up soon.

It’s been a shitty day, in all honesty. I woke up late and had to make a mad dash to class, still managed to walk in late enough that Mr. Stevens gave me that glare and the comment of “How nice of you to join us Beth.” 

Like anyone would turn up to his stupid 9am lectures anyway unless they were compulsory. I just know he was staring at my clothes the whole time too, well, fuck you old man, it’s an unreasonably hot summer and those lecture halls haven’t even seen a picture of a fan, let alone an A/C! Besides there’s nothing wrong with what I have on.

I pause when I come to the red light and take a glance down. Nope, the skirt’s just above my knees and my blouse is short-sleeves, not even close to indecent, hell I wouldn’t even call it pretty unless you’re into bored office chicks.

So there’s a morning full of a boring lecture where I had to sit and listen to some old perv telling me stuff I already knew (Seriously why do I have to take the equivalent of a high school English class when they’ve seen my grades?) then an afternoon at my part time job, if you can call basic filing and coffee fetching a job. I could do the phones too but I guess Mrs. Pripit has seniority over the intern, it’s no skin off my nose to not have to do that job, plus answering phones would take time away from looking at the boss. 

I feel the smirk on my lips. Ah, the only high point of my day, the boss of the office I work for. Mr. Micheal Casey. He’s older than me, not that you’d be able to tell, I nearly called bullshit when I had to do the office personnel files and saw thirty-two under his age. He’s dark-haired, it’s brown but so close to black and gorgeous brown eyes; they look just like Clooney’s. 

I shift a little in my seat, oh, there’s that little tingle I always get from thinking about him… jeeze he’d be shocked if he knew how many times he’s bent me over his desk in my fantasies.

Hrn. Control, Beth. I’m almost home and then a cool shower waits, bliss! At least the suns going down now so it’s less blistering. Bring on the humidity I guess.

I turn into my complex’s parking lot and after shutting the windows climb on out. I ruffle up my hair as I do, the air’s sticky and everything feels like it’s clinging to my skin.

My heels clack against the floor tiles as I walk to my apartment, second floor in a pretty nice complex all told, mostly students with jobs like me and a couple of small families. I think there’s one old couple? No-one here really knows their neighbours.

I pause at the door and glance over my shoulder. The complex forms a ‘U’ shape and I’m on one of the arms. 

I see the vague shadow twitch in the window directly across from mine and the smile creeps back onto my face. Well normally I’d just want to get in and take that shower, maybe binge on Netflix. But… well, after a crappy day a girl likes to feel appreciated. And I’d be lying if thoughts of Mr. Casey weren’t still circling my head.

I’m careful, I make out like I was looking in my purse for something. Can’t let him know and spoil the little fantasy.

Like I said, no-one really knows their neighbours.

The door opens and as I flick on the light I think, ‘show time’, in my head for just one second I can feel a spotlight rather than a dim fluorescent. My heels are clacking on a polished stage, rather than the cheap plastic tile of my apartment. Only one guy in the audience though, always just the one at first.

I’m good at this now, it’s got to look natural or he’ll catch on. I drop my purse on the dresser and take a moment to stroll to my window. I knew it must have seemed odd when I moved in that I wanted my bed under the only window but I like sunlight in the mornings. I didn’t have a clue back then, not that I regret the choice now.

He’s got the lights out in his place, but I know he’s watching.

I shake my hair in an exaggerated way and stretch out my arms; it makes my breasts push outwards, the third button strains against them. I glance down and giggle softly, I know he can’t hear but the effect makes them bounce slightly. Always slight, I love making it a long drawn out tease.

I turn and stroll slowly over to the kitchen, I don’t know if he can see this far back but no reason to stop the show. I grab a glass and fill ‘er up from the sink, then to the fridge, I go on tip-toes, almost like I’m dancing, I don’t need to but my legs looks amazing tensed, grab the ice tray and pop four out. Oops, I dropped one…

The bend over is a nice little touch I think, I’ve gotten good at hitching my skirt up just that extra inch, just enough for a flash of pink that sparks a thousand wet dreams.

Three cubes clink into the glass and I hold on to the fourth as I walk back to my bed. It’s set just far enough back that he should be able to see my upper body. I place the extra ice on the window ledge; I can just imagine him at there now, wondering what it is I’m doing?

Well, honey, it’s hot. I’m hot. I’m taking a drink, like any girl alone would. And if a droplet of condensation should run from the glass and past my lips… that’s right, watch its path… a single crystal of bliss trickling down my neck and chest. I feel the sensuous little bead slip its wet trail between my breasts and cease. The cool trail actually does feel really good.

I put the glass down and reach out to the ice cube, it’s melted a little but that doesn’t matter. I lift it and run it across my forehead.

“Mhhh.”

Then down to my neck, rolling it between my fingers I trail an icy path around the back under my hair line, it’s genuine heaven after the heat of today.

Now for the good part. I glance down at my chest as if a thought’s only just occurred to me; though if he were a little closer he’d see my nipples are already peaking at the idea, not enough yet but soon.

I press the cube to my chest, just above my bust at first, and I imagine the hiss of air between his teeth. I slide it down between my cleavage, and fuck that feels good, the heat of my body’s melting it, 
a dampness appearing on my white blouse. I pop the third button and use the free movement to slide the cube across.

My right nipple hardens like a bullet, a peak visible even through bra and blouse and a moan escapes.

“Oooh, that’s nice…” I whisper, and trail the remains of the cube to the left; it hardens like its partner. God I love that they show so much when they’re hard, I love it when I’m in a bikini and I know every guy’s looking, I love that my nosy little friend over there must be able to see them now. Pointed and pert like little mountain peaks.

“Bet you’d love to suck on them, hmm?” I purr to my apartment, he can’t hear after all. I slide my hand out of the blouse and start to massage my D-cups though the cotton. “Ohh, oh yes…”

I’m back on that stage in my head, the curtains of my window grow to fill a theatre, my mind’s racing. How to do a really good show tonight, something to relive my stress of the day and give him one hell of an act? Well normally I save this manoeuvre for nights when I’m really aching but what the heck, I’m halfway there anyway.

I stand up and moving swiftly head into my bathroom. Got to be quick now, or he’ll think I’ve gone for good.  I pull open my blouse and slip it off onto the floor, my chest aches in protest at the sudden end to the massage, hehe, steady on ladies. 

I yank the zip on my skirt down and it hits the bathroom floor, followed by my pantyhose, they’re probably ripped but I’m already in the cupboard under the sink. I know; most girls keep cleaning stuff there, right? God I hope no-one ever looks in mine; spare panties I might get away with but it’d be a bit hard to explain the stockings and garter belt.

I drop the panties I’m wearing, they’re soaked through and they don’t match the bra, different shades of pink, not that I’m sure if any guy would notice. Come to that, this guy… he must know that girls hardly ever wear matching sets of underwear unless they’re looking to get lucky? I mean come on, the only reason I wore the lace bra today is because of the rush I left the house in.

Then again, isn’t this sort of my version of a date by this point? It’s not like anyone else is looking at my underwear, hehe, special peeping tom underwear.

As I slip on the stockings and garter belt I wonder if my neighbour really thinks I wear these to work and school as often as he catches me wearing them? Surely he must suspect something? Surely he doesn’t think any girl these days wears these to her job?

Ah, fuck if I care what kind of fantasy he’s come up with about the skin tone stockings. The point is more that he’s fantasising about me. The garter belt’s pink, matches the lace panties which now I look, have a noticeable wet patch, shiiit. 

I grin and trace my hand down between my thighs, I’m soaking, eager for more and the touch makes me shudder, god it would be so easy to take care of it now. No, no, steady on. 

I breathe and head back out, pretend not to notice the movement in the window across the way, that’s right honey, I’m back and now I’m a red-headed goddess in pink lace. Heh, I wonder if it’ll ever occur to him that I’m still wearing my work heels and really, what girl does that? I wonder if he’ll catch on that I‘m fucking sashaying across the floor?

No matter. I reach out to the top drawer of my dresser, he can’t see in but he knows what I keep in there.

My hand hovers over my toy collection, there’s a fair number (what, a girl gets lonely!) and for a moment I ponder.

There’s the bullet, the one I privately call Good Vibrations, or there’s the rabbit, a sure-fire way to a good, fast release, there’s my double-ended friend there, brought during an experimental phase that didn’t last long enough to make a use of it (Though I live in hope of an exciting sex life…) but I pass over them all for my favourite ‘performing partner’.

An eight-inch dick in red silicone, complete with a suction cup on the bottom. I’m not gonna claim this guy gets me off as fast as some of the others but he gets me there. Besides, it’s about putting on a good show, hmm?

Slow first, that’s the key. I kneel on my bed, turned towards the window and pretend to be examining my toy, sliding my hands up and down it as if I’ve never seen it before. I can see the movements of his arms in the half-light of the moon, he’s keeping pace with my touches.

I grin and lower the red silicone, trailing the head over my nipples one at a time, it’s stiffer and colder than a real one and it reignites the fire in my nipples.

I moan out, fuck it if he can’t hear, his loss. I grin and placing my friend there to one side I reach up and undo my bra, my breasts bounce slightly as the pink lace drops away and I toss it behind me. Ha! Does this guy really believe girls do this anywhere outside porn? Though I guess that’s kind of what this is; Lovely, personal, one-on-one porn just for him but oh so much more for me.

Fuck I’m wet. I lift the toy and trail my tongue over the tip, hopefully if I do that he won’t see that my eyes are fixed on his window. I can see his arm’s frantic movements in the half-light, yeah, you stroke it to me, you keep your eyes locked on me, you-

I see him start to get up! What? What the actual fuck! No! 

Oh I am not letting him walk off now before the fun really starts, hell no! Not when I’ve not got mine yet, what, he thinks some slut on the internet can finish him better than watching me?

I stand, looking around the room quickly before spying the chair in front of my dressing table mirror. It’s got a wooden seat, polished and perfect. I seize on it and tug it closer to the window, fuck if he works it out, he’s not figured out I know he’s watching yet and it’s been weeks, either he’s fucking stupid or he doesn’t want to ask questions. Grab the dildo and slam the sucker onto the chair, make sure to bend over to give him a good view. I tug at the toy a couple of times to make sure it’s secure, the chair judders slightly but my big red friend doesn’t let go.

I turn back towards the window, spotlight in my mind on. Ok, so the audience is losing interest a little? Let’s see him turn away from this, I flip my hair back over my shoulders and lift one foot to rest on the chair, reach up to the edge of my panties and hook my thumbs under the waistband.

That’s right, you go right ahead and stare, let your eyes go wide and your draw drop when I slide wet pink lace down my leg and off, you start to hyperventilate as I giggle and lift my other leg, tugging the dripping wet panties from the heel of my shoe. They catapult across my bedroom and I giggle softly, I’ll find them later, maybe leaving a stain on one of the surfaces that people will ask about, and I get to dismiss it as a water mark or something. Another hot little secret between my admirer and I.

I turn back towards the window; I see a mild shiver in the half light. Oh yeah, sweetie, I got waxed yesterday, nice little surprise for you hmm? To look and see I’m totally bare for you? And do you know how wild that’s been driving me? There’s something so satisfying and maddening about going all day totally bare down there, feeling the soft cotton lace of my panties rubbing against my newly-bare skin. You know I spent half my time at work shifting my legs behind my desk, wondering if Mr. Casey could tell. Honestly I probably could have come on a breath the way I was feeling.

Like I could now, come to that. 

I trail my hand down between my legs, the skin there’s so sensitive, it’s like a whole new erogenous zone. I’m trembling, fuck, I need it bad. I straddle the chair and… that’s right babe, watch… watch me slide down, but push the dildo in front of my aching pussy first, so that every inch of hard, ridged silicone rubs along my wet flesh. I throw my head back in a moan I don’t have to act.

Up onto my feet again, take hold of the dildo and rub just the tip around in tight little circles against my engorged clit. “Nnh… mmh…”

God I want it, I want it so much… a quick glance up tells me he’s still staring, I wait, I wait even though it’s killing me, for a beat of one, two… I see the movement of his hand and that’s the cue I wanted. I slide the tip in; I have to stand on my toes even in my heels to get it into the right position.

“Fuck!” I cry out, the stretch, the sweet relief to the ache in my body, it’s almost enough to bring me to release there and then, “Oh yes…” I lower my feet slowly, letting each perfect inch slide in little by little, bad as I want to just drop and let it stretch me out I can’t because that’s not part of the act.

Finally, finally I’m seated, the silicon balls press into my clit and I shudder. I grin and brace my hand against the chair’s seat. Tense the legs and—aaaah yess!

After that everything starts to become a blur, up and down, up and down, every now and then I push down and throw in a rough circling grind into it, fuck yes, the way it rubs across my clit makes me practically shriek in pleasure. 

I don’t even have to look now, I know his hand will be jerking frantically up and down, I know he’s staring at the way my tits are bouncing, I know he’s straining to see if he can hear me moan and gasp and pant across the complex. Fuck I love this, I shut my eyes and I’m riding on this thick, hard cock in front of a crowd, none of them allowed to touch and all wanting it so bad, the spotlights flashing off of the wet silicone every few seconds as it slips in and out of my aching wet pussy. 

“Fuck yes, fuck, don’t stop, don’t stop…” I groan, though I don’t know who I’m talking to, maybe myself? Maybe him? Who gives a shit? I thrust my hips violently, the new motion drives the toy’s head right against my g-spot and a gasp out; “Oh fuck it yes! Right there, that’s the spot!” 

My tits are on fire, I grab both my breasts and start to tug at my nipples, they’re like ‘on’ switches. I start to buck and bounce and now I can’t stop my mouth for anything;

“Don’t stop baby, oh please don’t stop, keep fucking me, oh yes…! NNh that’s the spot right there, keep doing that, aaah Keep doing that!” I gasp out, I can feel my body building to something and it’s gonna be a big one. I speed up my already desperate bouncing to a frantic speed, there’s no show now, no audience, there’s only the dick and the need to come.

“Oh Baby I’m so close!” I moan out, I can already feel I’m leaving a wet patch on my chair, this is gonna be amazing… it’s gonna leave a mark on this chair but I don’t even care, another dirty little secret I’ll have to explain away, and-

Oh fuck, what if one of these days I invite him over for some reason? Let him see the stains and try to pass them off, knowing all the time that he knows exactly how this filthy little exhibitionist slut made them?

That thought alone pushes me over the edge, my hips jerk forward as I scream out my pleasure and I squirt, hard, “Ahhhh I’m coming!!!!” I shriek, and my come jets upwards and out. A few dew drops splash across my window and I don’t care, a second wave of pleasure hitting as I jerk and quiver atop this fucking amazing toy.

My pussy clenches and trembles with every movement, so does my body. The big release followed by little pleasure trembles when I slowly slide up and off the toy. I flop forwards onto my bed, naked but for those pretty tan stockings and the garter belt. Mmmmmm.

It takes me a few minutes before I can move, stretching out like a little cat and glancing dazedly around my bedroom, just my bedroom. No stage and no light, no audience of baying men desperate to touch me, just my room in my no-great apartment with too much humidity in the room and a slowly drying pool of my juices around a dildo on my chair.

I sigh and stand wobbly, tug the toy free from the chair and toss it onto a towel I left on my floor this morning. I’ll take it through to the bathroom and wash it in a sec, cleaning up in here to do first… I shakily move over to my dressing table and pull out a few of my make-up wipes, making quick work of cleaning away the mess on my chair.

For a sec I think I’m done, and then I remember the window. I reach out to close the curtains and I spot the few drops against the glass. With a smirk I reach out with a make-up wipe to clean it off and I let my eye drift to the window across the complex. 

It’s empty now, no shape in the half-light cast by the moon, I think I can see a light on deeper in the room, maybe he’s in the bathroom cleaning up himself, or in the kitchen chugging a glass of water after that exhausting session.

But for a second, if I kind of squint, I can kid myself he’s still there, watching me. It’s a thrill, maybe I’m a freak because of it but what do I care, a girl likes to feel admired. I grab the curtains and with a wink, yank them closed.

Show’s over for another night baby.

60r721,1,2017-03-21,21 F4F I'm the young college girl who rents a room out of your house...,DppSlutAnna,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/60r721/21_f4f_im_the_young_college_girl_who_rents_a_room/,"Hi DPP. I'd like to play with an older women here for a change. I've been on DPP for a while, but I can't say I've ever done a play with an older women except one time. That one time is the inspiration for this post. Unfortunately, as is started to get really juicy she ghosted on me. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it with you :) As for the play itself, I'd like to play me, a 21 year old girl named Anna in college who with my parents money rents out a room in your home. It could be near your room, or perhaps on another floor/basement, but your house is near my college. I'd like your character to be between 35 and 40, and has a high paying job. I think being a nurse would be best personally and is certainly my preference for that. I figure your character is divorced and has never mentioned to my character before that you're into girls. My character assumed your divorce fell a part on it's own, thinking the guy likely did something to screw it all up. Truthfully you divorced him because you much rather ladies, especially younger adults that you see at work all the time and often bed. (Such as student nurses working under you doing internships.) Daddies paycheck isn't the only reason you took me in over everybody else though. My ass is tight and adorable, and to boot I have a really cute face. A face you wouldn't mind seeing between your legs, or better yet sat on. 

I figure that at first you don't at all actively try to bed me. Things could get really awkward considering I'm your renter, and you wouldn't want to ruin things so early on. Instead, your character tries to see if I show you any interest myself, but I won't. I think you're pretty, but my character is ""straight"" and hides her curiosities deep inside as I've always been grown to think girl on girl is wrong. One weekend after a few months of living together I'll be gone for a mini-vacation over the weekend, but come home a night early because of bed weather. When I get home I'll be shocked to see you on the couch cuddling naked with messed up hair with a gorgeous girl from college that's my age. She truly is gorgeous and better looking then my character aswell. She's in the nursing program, and is one of many girls you've bedded since I moved in, but the first one I learn about. The only reason I learn about this is because of coming home early, otherwise I'd have no idea you're into girls... 

That is where I would like to start the play. With me walking in on you in post sex cuddles with a beautiful student that's my age. I'd like to hear your ideas about how the play moves on from here. Personally, I think my character will feel a little awkward, but yours won't really care too much and in fact feels liberated she doesn't have to hide her lesbian side any more. Even though I'm your young renter who's ""straight"", I too will end up being bedded by the beautiful nurse. I may think I'm special, but truthfully I'm just another whore who has spread her legs for you. 

My character is fairly nice and can be a bit of a kissass. Comparatively, your character is obnoxious and tends to do whatever she wants since she owns the place. Such as leaving dirty clothing where ever you want, not cleaning dishes, kicking your feet up whenever, even not closing the door when you pee, etc. I find it annoying, but really can't do anything since you're my landlord. Kink wise, I'm into in-appropiate relationships, build up, teasing, sweat, body worship(such as feet, or your ass), worn clothing, grool, and some servitude or even humiliation. I have few limits and don't think any pertain to this play. If something isn't listed here please ask me for my thoughts on it. I don't need all of these kinks of course, but I certainly want your character to be the one that's in control. It doesn't have to be a dom/sub sorta thing, but between our 2 characters I'll certainly be the submissive one.

**NOTE**: I want there to be some character development between us aswell as teasing/build up. I'm not looking to dive straight into the sex and want to build this up. If you're not into that then please don't bother. "

Originally I took general physics classes, because they are required for the computer science undergraduate degree that I am currently going for. However, I have started to become more interested in the field this semester, while taking the second required general physics class (electricity and magnetism specifically).

I have completed Calculus 1 and 2 (with an A and B), and was planning on taking Calculus 3 (multi variable) over the summer, and then linear algebra in the fall if all goes well. 

Is there any advice you would give to a possible new physics major? What are some good places to review important subjects (like Trig, Calc, Classic mechanics, electricity, magnetism, waves, optics, etc.)?

60rib3,3,2017-03-21,I think i might be depressed and i feel too dependent on my boyfriend..,secretbitch,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/60rib3/i_think_i_might_be_depressed_and_i_feel_too/,"This is really long so I put a tl;dr at the bottom. 

I'm currently a sophomore in college. Last summer I had a job and was taking a summer 1 class. I began feeling depressed around this time. In the past ( high school) I had some of these feelings but it felt much more intense and like something I couldnt just push aside, of that makes sense. It took me a while to finally realize that it was probably depression. I actually didn't even realize it until after summer. 

Summer triggered it because it was tough. I had to take a tough class (chemistry because I made a D in it), as well as working at Papa John's. When I wasnt working, eating or sleeping I was watching lecture videos, doing HW, and studying. Except for those few hours a week I got to spend with my boyfriend( lets call him Sam). 

And this summer was the summer after my freshman year, probably the hardest year of my life so far. When I got a slap in the face and I realized I wasnt as smart as I thought. I was in a bad place during the summer, but it got even worse the next semester. Classes got harder, I had more time studying and less time doing anything I would actually enjoy. And when I actually did have time to do something I enjoyed, I realized I didn't really enjoy anything anymore. The only thing I wanted to do was lay down with sam and watch TV. Anything else was non interesting and thinking about doing anything made me want to cry. 

I use to love playing board games, video games, and cards. But none of that was interesting anymore. 

Then I found out that I might be depressed. So I tried some things to try and make it better. Sam helped. He helped me set up a schedule for when to do HW and studying and when I can take breaks. I looked up some stuff and read that less caffeine and taking fish oil pills might help. So I cut out caffeine and started taking fish oil pills. 

It took a while, but I slowly began to find myself more interested in things. Im not sure if I actiakly had depression. I don't know if I was just misdiagnosing my self and exaggerated but it was getting better. That deep sadness and disinterest in things was still kind of in the back of my mind, but it wasn't the most important thing in my mind anymore. 

Now I'm starting to feel that sadness and disinterest again. The only time the sadness seems to go away is when I'm with Sam. But I'm worried for my dependence on him. I've expressed this worry but he said that he doesn't think it's that bad. 

I'm also worried that it's going to get worse this summer. Much worse. I might be getting an internship that will be like a full time job, as well as taking a class I need to take. A class that, if I fail, I'm set back a semester. I'll barely get anytime with Sam and I don't know what to do. 

Why am I so dependent? Do I even have depression? Am I being overdramatic? I'm just getting so sad and angry and anxious again. I don't know what to do. 

tl;dr: I think I might be depressed and I think it might get worse. Also I feel too dependent on my boyfriend for my happiness. "

Just trying to pick other marketers brains about the changing industry, their personal path, etc. the program I'm enrolled in has a couple specializations I'm interested in. High tech entrepreneurship and sports and entertainment marketing. 

I have a very strong background in the sports industry, but I know it's very saturated and difficult even for the most ambitious to stand out. I feel like if I cover high tech entrepreneurship it will allow me to reach into a variety of fields and not just the sports industry specifically. 

-why or why not to go back to school ?
-anyone else specialize in sports entertainment or high tech entrepreneurship ?
-does a tough economy (recession) effect marketing budgets and thus marketing personnel? 
-what are some websites/tutorials to get familiar with marketing engines like salesforce, SEO training, etc.

60sfce,1,2017-03-21,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/60sfce/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Okay. I posted a while back that I was working at a screenprinting shop as well as Starbucks and was offered full-time and a raise that will match and eventually increase to beat my SS wage. 

I was advised by the lovely people of /r/Starbucks to just talk to my managers and request to change my availability. Some might recall that I was also told I was going to another Starbucks full-time until further notice. 

Well I started my first borrowed shifts there and the SM is an ASSHOLE. I am a hired in shift. He constantly belittles me and makes me feel stupid in front of not only partners, but customers as well. For example, the other day a change order came in. I was never trained to complete a change order because my training at my home store never coincided with a visit from the company we go through. He was sitting in the lobby. On his phone. Not on a ten or a half. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe he was just trying to see how I was running the floor, but when I excused myself from the change order guys and asked him to help me with it, as I had never done one before and didn't know where everything was kept in this store anyway, he got SUPER huffy with me and told me that ""if I'm going to be a shift at his store then I need to figure this stuff out!!!""

1. Well no shit. That's why I asked for help. 
2. I don't want to fucking work at this store but I'm literally being forced to transfer?????

Fast forward through some more situations and similar things. For example, one day I was written in on the schedule and was never asked or notified about it after being off for two days. So I'm at my other job. This SM calls me and is like ""WHERE ARE YOU."" I talk to my boss and leave my other job early, crying the entire way to Starbucks because I think I'm going to get fired because of the way he's talked to me. I get there and when he's talking to me about my availability I casually mention that there's a possibility I may change my availability to evenings during the weekdays. He freaks the fuck out on me and tells me that ""a shift at his store can't have a second job and this needs to be my first priority or I'm going to be taken off the schedule."" I explain that my first priority is school, my other job is a paid internship that gives me experience in the field I'm studying in college, and that I can have more than one priority and that I WANT to work at Starbucks. He blows me off and leaves. Eventually I talked to my home store SM yesterday and told her I was uncomfortable working there and did not want to transfer. 

She basically told me to suck it up and that it's my responsibility to fix my relationship with him. And she apparently asked him about that situation and he said he never told me I had to have open availability ..... no, he didn't. In those words. Because there's two days I'm completely unavailable due to being in school from 9AM-7PM. 

My home store ASM advised me to call partner services. My boyfriend who used to be a partner advised me to contact my DM. Honestly, I really love working at Starbucks but I'm wondering at this point if it's even worth the fight. I'm upset that in order for me to be ""taking the proper course of action"" I have to talk to the SM of the store of my force-transfer, who refused to hear what I was saying once already. I'm upset that I told my SM that I'm uncomfortable working somewhere and she told other SS in my store that we had a conversation and I ""just didn't like what she had to say"" when it's beyond that. I don't want to get anyone in trouble. I don't want to call PRS. I don't want to call my DM. I'm only a month old at this company and I'm not trying to start problems or be complicated. But I also don't want to feel shut down and ready to walk out of every shift at the transfer store, and feel like crying every day before work, every day when I get home, and every night before I have to work the next day. 

I love working for Starbucks, and I don't want to leave. I just feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place and I don't know what to do. I feel like no matter what happens, my side isn't being heard because it's all he-said/she-said. I'm ready to put my two weeks in after a month not because I don't love my job, but because of the situation I'm forced into without any experience. 

Help. "
60sgi6,13,2017-03-21,Advice for an NYC Finance Intern,tiltedsquares,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/60sgi6/advice_for_an_nyc_finance_intern/,"This upcoming summer, I was extremely fortunate to earn an internship in the Financial District of NYC. I'm really excited, and especially as a sophomore, this is an almost unheard of circumstance.

However, I'm now looking for places to stay in NYC and I'm having a hard time balancing what I want and what's practical. I'm hoping you can shed some light here. From a lot of posts I've read, being able to walk to work is a luxury that many finance interns should really consider. However, if I wanted to walk to work, the rent increases dramatically (~$6000/10 weeks). The further I go away from Manhattan, the lower the rent becomes. However, the rent's still pretty expensive at ~$4500-5000/10 weeks, and it forces me to take the metro. My last option is to totally leave Manhattan and travel from Brooklyn or one of the other boroughs. This option forces me to use public transportation and my commute could easily be 45min+. 

My dilemma lies in what it is I'm willing to spend money on. The time I save not commuting, I would use for other things. I would have a lot less money but I would be happier, I would get more sleep, I would enjoy the city more. However, I'd be very poor.

60ss4t,1,2017-03-22,I suck at my job. But I'm afraid I'm turning into a career hopper. [Long Post],TigerDriver89,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/60ss4t/i_suck_at_my_job_but_im_afraid_im_turning_into_a/,"For about two years I've been working as an accounting clerk for a small business. And frankly, I'm pretty terrible at it. I have bad time management skills and there's a few duties I've been neglecting for months. I lose invoices a lot, and I either waste time  asking for new copies from vendors or waste the company's money by incurring finance charges for past due balances. 

At times I'm so overwhelmed that I give up on doing anything productive and waste my time browsing the web or social media. I think the only silver lining I see in my poor work performance is that it lead me to seeing a psychiatrist and getting diagnosed with ADHD.

To give a little background on myself: I graduated from a state university in 2010 with a Bachelor's in English. My biggest college regret, besides getting a useless liberal arts degree (kidding) was not having an exit strategy. Coming out of high school, my dream was to get into journalism. But in the late '00s, I thought that field was on shaky ground and I was discouraged to even attempt breaking into it. 

I didn't work or take on any internships as an undergrad. I couldn't really put anything in the relevant experience section of my resume, so I'd imagine any hiring manager that I sent it to at the time chuckled and deleted it immediately.

I started working as a substitute teaching assistant for special education classes at the school district my mother teaches at. The plan was to save up enough money to go back to school and get my teaching credential.
  
That job was soul-crushing. At best it could get boring or tedious; at worst it was day after day of non-stop high-stress situations. Getting bit, slapped, or spat on by children that don't know any better isn't my idea of a good time. I gained a tremendous amount of respect for special education teachers and paraprofessionals from that experience. Unfortunately it also resulted in me not wanting anything to do with education.

One night I came across an article on Forbes about someone transitioning into an accounting career late in life and how happy they were to do so. It also claimed that accounting and finance jobs are almost recession proof; that when a company is downsizing employees in those departments are the last to go. Further research lead me to realize the most complicated math accountants need to know is basic arithmetic and algebra. So I enrolled into a community college, and I worked my way into earning an Associate's degree in Accounting.

Having no experience in an office setting, I applied to a staffing agency specializing in administrative positions. They matched me up with the company I'm working for now, and for a few months I was the assistant to the receptionist who was suffering from a recent back injury. Management liked my work ethic and attitude and found out about my degree, so they offered to hire me to replace their then-bookkeeper who was retiring. Unfortunately when I was onboarding, the outgoing bookkeeper had a week left beofre she was leaving. My training period was an abbreviated four days. Which wasn't a problem the first several months; I didn't receive a lot negative feedback at least. Until our company bought and merged three other companies, which lead to an increase in my workload. Since then I've been behind on every aspect of my work and have been making egregious errors. 

Last week I was wasting time at my desk and looking at my company's website. It hadn't been updated in a while and I noticed the copy on the front page is absolute trash. I then spent a few hours trying to come up with good copy for our website. And that felt satisfying, apart from the anxiety I got realizing none of my actual work got done that day.

Since then I've been doing some research on how to break into copywriting. I'm considering taking a brief online course on it and learning how to put together a portfolio.

Naturally, I'm very conflicted on what my next move will be. Getting into advertising or marketing sounds attractive right now. But what if I find out I'm not good at it either? Or what if in a few years I get bored of it too? I've read people diagnosed with ADHD are notorious job and career hoppers.

And I'm also considering the time and money I spent studying accounting -- does that all just go to waste? But then, do I want to stick with something that's obviously not my passion? And I'm also considering my employers. They've been very patient with me through all this. I don't even have a clue why they haven't fired me yet. I'm afraid things are going to get even worse for them if I leave.

I'm just so envious of the people I know who've had clear, specific career goals before entering the workforce. I sometimes check up on old high school abd college friends. Many of them are working jobs they love that are related to what they studied in college. And I just can't help but think, 'Why couldn't that be me?'"
60swsf,882,2017-03-22,Story of a Self-Taught Software Engineer: Part I,Zalgo_Doge,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/60swsf/story_of_a_selftaught_software_engineer_part_i/,"I have finally worked up the courage to write my story. I was told that my path wasn't possible and that I should get my degree in Computer Science, but I was stubborn. However, there were some points when I almost gave up.

A little bit of background on me: I went to a special needs private school for 4 years, transferred to public school my junior year, graduated at the bottom 50% of my class, went to community college with an undecided major and eventually halfheartedly choosing Hospitality Management as my major halfway through my freshman year. But how did I end up as a software engineer at a big corporation? Well, hopefully you guys like this series and you'll find out sooner or later! This is my story from my first line of code in 2012 to where I am in 2017.

During my first year in college, I struggled greatly. I had a history class where I studied day and night only to get an F on an exam. I eventually dropped the class which was pretty much the story of my college career. I had no idea what I was walking into. I continued to get C's and D's all while wondering if college was too much for me.

During the summer of 2012, I decided to take an HTML class as a GPA booster. I built a website back in middle school using Microsoft Publisher, so I figured it'd be a fun skill to learn. It was online, too. So I could do the class at my own pace. As I progressed through the class, I slowly but surely developed a poorly designed and coded website that I was more than proud of. I finished the class with an A. I had a lot of fun with it, so the next semester I took a class in JavaScript to make my websites more interactive and it turned out to be a very humbling experience. 

I couldn't debug, I couldn't find out what was wrong with my code, all of my assignments were late, and I almost dropped the class. There was even one time when I cried to my mom about how stupid I felt. I somehow managed to limp through the class with a very tainted A (Thank you, StackOverflow).

I then registered myself as stupid and put coding on the back burner. and proceeded with my Hospitality Management degree and landed a job as a bellman at a Sheraton in the summer of 2013. Within weeks, I knew that hospitality wasn't for me. I then dropped all of my classes at my community college in exchange for programming classes. I constantly fought against all of the self-doubt I had and whole-heartedly pursued web development. During the slow days at work, I would be on the computer practicing my craft. All of this was priming me for an interview with a small start-up company in March 2014.

I dressed my best for the interview, brought my laptop with some personal projects on it and was ready to woo them with my words. It turns out that they weren't interested in any of that. They quickly gave me a run-down of the company and gave me a coding quiz on one of their computers. The quiz was relatively simple, I had to create a box that changed colors based on the button you clicked. I wasn't proud of my code but I managed to get it working. Before I could finish, the manager came behind me and told me to stop. He offered me more than two times the amount I was making as a bellman. He then stated that I outdid a person with a Master's Degree in Computer Science for the internship. I couldn't believe my ears. It was like I was part of a joke that was nearing its punchline.

I then quit my job at the hotel without any notice. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, after all. I arrived the very next day for my first day of work. The office was the poster-child for start-up work environments. Big Nerf guns, nice conference room, open offices, a fridge filled with free Red Bull, candy, and snacks. I of course spent a good part of my first day taking pictures and sending them to my friends who were very happy for me. On the third day of work, I got my first task.

I resembled a headless chicken as I tried to finish these tasks, all while getting constantly rejected by the manager because they weren't up to their coding standards with his frustration growing with each and every interaction. After about a couple of days of back and forth, I finally completed my first task and I was pretty proud of myself.

On the Monday of the third week of my job, I walked in bright and early ready to learn. I sat down at my desk and tried to sign onto my email, and I couldn't. My account had been deactivated. I knew what was coming. My manager walked me to the accountant's office where they took my security badge and told me that I wasn't as far along as they had hoped. I asked what I can improve on so I can grow from this and they just told me to keep studying.

I emptied out my desk and walked shamefully out of the office as my co workers looked directly at their screens so they wouldn't have to acknowledge me. After I walked to my car after I was escorted out of the building, I stared into space for what it seems was like an eternity. I burned a bridge with my previous employer to pursue my dreams, I dropped out of school to give my internship 200%, I only gained about two weeks of experience from the internship. And as I stood there, with all of my belongings in my arms, I felt as if I had truly lost.

60t20b,75,2017-03-22,My [27F] roommate [25M] of 1 year wants me to move so he can get his apartment deposit back.,peachyfckingkeen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/60t20b/my_27f_roommate_25m_of_1_year_wants_me_to_move_so/,"Sorry for the long post.

I met my current roommate (let's call him Eric) through mutual work friends. After talking a bit, we realized that we were from the same city and he knew some of my distant family members. 

A short time into our friendship, he let me know that he was looking for a new place to live. He knew the lease to my 1 bedroom apartment was ending soon, and suggested that we look for a place together. I agreed because I wanted more space and possibly a yard for my dog.

We found a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment with a small yard. I had originally wanted a townhome at the same complex, but none were available at the time. So we submitted an application, but Eric was denied because of bad credit and a prior broken lease. He asked if I would put the apartment under my name anyway and he would pay me monthly. I said okay.

3 weeks after move-in, Eric told me that he had a friend who would be doing an internship at a hospital right down the street from our place, and he had already told her that she could stay at our apartment while she is interning. She lives about an hour and a half away normally. I asked how long the internship was, and he said THREE MONTHS. I told him no, she can't stay with us, we had a big argument, and he dropped the situation.

A little while after that, the leasing agent at our complex (who became a friend of mine after we moved in), called and let me know that a townhome had become available and he would save it for us if we still wanted it. Eric and I talked it over and we agreed to take it. BUT, he said he wanted to find some way to get himself on the lease ""for his own security.""

I pulled some strings with my friend in the office, he spoke with his manager and told Eric that he could only be placed on the lease if he paid an $800 deposit on top of the original $400 deposit that we split. He agreed and was written into the lease.

Fast forward a few months, and he brings up his friend again, and flat out tells me that the only reason he really wanted to be on the lease was ""because I didn't want you to dictate who comes over and for how long."" He said he wouldn't have cared to be on the lease otherwise. Clearly doesn't understand how being roommates work, but I agreed to her staying after he said she would help pay a portion of the bills. So she moves in, I see one small payment throughout the 3 months, and she leaves. He claims he put her monthly check (around $200) toward our utility bill. I hadn't seen an increase in any bills while she was there, so I dropped it.

Cut to now. Our lease is ending in mid-April. Eric's brother offered to let him stay at his new home rent-free, and he accepts. I am staying in the townhome, and told him as much. The only thing he needed to do to remove himself from the lease is to sign a roommate addendum, and I would re-lease on my own. He asked the leasing agent when he would get his deposit back, and was told that he wouldn't be getting any money back until BOTH of us moved out. 

He called me upset, saying things along the lines of ""We need to work this out, because I need my money back,"" and ""I only got on the lease because you said my friend couldn't stay with us."" He then said he asked the leasing agent if he would be able to get his money back if I moved into another unit. She said that would be the only way, but there would be a $300 transfer fee. He offered to ""loan me the money"" for the transfer fee and said I could pay him back when we get our deposits. I said no, and he has been hounding me about ""how much he needs his money"" all week.

All in all, I would get $200 back and he would get $1000. I'm going to tell him that the ONLY way I would agree to relocate is IF there are any units that I like, and if he covered ALL my moving costs (the $300 transfer fee, $150 for transferring my utilities, any cleaning/repair costs the complex would charge, as well as movers). And that I would not be using any of the $200 on any of these things. I'm going to let him decide for himself if it'll be worth it to spend however much those things will cost to get his deposit back.

Regardless, I'm leaning very heavily toward just staying put and dropping the friendship.

So I guess my question is: If I decide to present Eric with the option I mentioned, am I being fair?


TL;DR - Apartment lease is up, I am staying and my roommate is leaving. He wants me to relocate to a new unit in the same complex so he can get his large deposit back but is offering minimal financial help for me to do so. I am going to tell him I will only agree if he pays for ALL costs of moving (transfer fees, cleaning fees, etc). Is this fair?"
60t2en,3,2017-03-22,how to explain mental health issues (exacerbated by living in DC after election and new supervisor) and plan to move across country to employer?,[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/60t2en/how_to_explain_mental_health_issues_exacerbated/,"TLDR; I've struggled with mental health issues (anxiety and some depression) for a few years and have managed to keep things generally under control but have been doing much worse since the election and feel that I need to make some major changes. I love my company and the CEO, but have been put under new supervisor who makes anxiety worse. Decided I want to stop working in May when I finish my Master’s and move to California. Not sure how to convey the message. 

Background

- I work in DC in the commercial space sector and am studying space policy for my master's 
- Outer space is my passion - I studied astrophysics as an undergraduate and then fell in love with space exploration and so veered to business (my concentration at the GWU space policy program is international business in space)
- My main love of the space industry is the idea of bringing all kinds of people from all over the world together to accomplish new things and explore the unknown, hopefully bridging the gaps created by national boundaries and giving people hope for an exciting and more prosperous future 
- I LOVE the work my company does (we send things to outer space, including student research and satellites that study the Earth, CEO is kooky and into ideas like sending wine and art to space) 
- I've been working consistently as an intern/assistant since May 2016 (40 hours/week over summer and 20-25 hours/week during the school year) -- I've had a flexible contractor contract since then
- I usually under-report hours or at least never report time just hanging out at office, eating lunch, or doing research on my own time about ideas I could pitch or if I want to make sure I deliver the highest quality work, but they didn't ask me to do research
- There's an expectation I will likely stay with the company when I graduate in May, but my contract is open-ended and I haven't made any promises

Recent developments 

- I used to work directly for the CEO as an intern assistant which was always super exciting and rewarding - he's been a mentor of mine for some time, is a visionary in the industry, and our personalities just mesh 
- They realized it didn't make sense to keep me as simply an assistant after I was working there part time for over a year and so the CEO put me under the supervision of the marketing director, who's also my age (23 at the time) and didn't really know what to do with me... spent a couple months aimlessly making my own to-do lists and reports 
- We spun off our education program as its own company which I found terribly exciting - so they put me under the supervision of its new CEO and we just don't vibe at all. The woman snaps and complains all the time and is just cold and makes me feel awkward all the time 
- Since the election, I've been distracted by the news and looking at ways to help people getting f**ked by the system. I'm an immigrant who's parents came here for a better life and I've benefited incredibly from affordable quality education and other American institutions. I'm also a firm believer that none of us have rights until all people are free from blatant and institutional systems of oppression and the results of this election feel like a calling to the battlefield 
- My anxiety and depression have flared up intensely and have caused me to be more flakey and call sick more often -- but I haven't told anyone at work, especially since we don't have an HR department - also it's a startup with only 10 people in the office and there's a certain expectation of always being on-call... also feel way discouraged reporting to this new CEO
- I graduate in May and my partner and I decided to move to California this summer to get away from DC and get into the space scene there -- and I would like to get more involved in the media industry to advocate for the importance of STEM and space for young people to a larger audience, advocate how space exploration and social justice can be linked, and get more involved in boots on the ground civil rights and education advocacy (also warm, sunny, chill people, weed)

I bailed on work last week and told my new boss I want to talk about a personal matter when I get back (tomorrow) and I'm lost on how to explain all of this and what parts to explain... 

Mainly I want to get across that 

- My mental health has been affecting my performance and I'm sorry I didn't bring it up sooner (??)
- I don't feel that this company is the right fit considering where I'm at in my life, but I will always be happy to support them with some contracting work here and there 
- I plan on moving and want to stop working in May 
- I wanted to be honest about my situation and future plans to ensure I am serving the company the best way I can since I believe so strongly in the vision and am so grateful for the opportunities I’ve been provided

Questions

- Is it worth explaining the details of my mental health?
- I've heard that with mental health, it's good to suggest options to help employer help you - but if I plan on leaving in two months... perhaps just offer to spend my remaining time getting records together for whoever they hire next (I'm in charge of a number of databases that only I know how to read/manipulate)?
- When talking to new boss - do I mention that her management style is stifling and flares up my anxiety? 
(with different words lol)
- Should I mention the awkwardness of changing my supervisors to the CEO? 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!!"

60t8rq,1,2017-03-22,how to explain mental health issues (exacerbated by living in DC after election and new supervisor) and plan to move across country to employer?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/60t8rq/how_to_explain_mental_health_issues_exacerbated/,"TLDR; I've struggled with mental health issues (anxiety and some depression) for a few years and have managed to keep things generally under control but have been doing much worse since the election and feel that I need to make some major changes. I love my company and the CEO, but have been put under new supervisor who makes anxiety worse. Decided I want to stop working in May when I finish my Master’s and move to California. Not sure how to convey the message. 

Background:

- I work in DC in the commercial space sector and am studying space policy for my master's 
- Outer space is my passion - I studied astrophysics as an undergraduate and then fell in love with space exploration and so veered to business (my concentration at the GWU space policy program is international business in space)
- My main love of the space industry is the idea of bringing all kinds of people from all over the world together to accomplish new things and explore the unknown, hopefully bridging the gaps created by national boundaries and giving people hope for an exciting and more prosperous future 
- I LOVE the work my company does (we send things to outer space, including student research and satellites that study the Earth, CEO is kooky and into ideas like sending wine and art to space) 
- I've been working consistently as an intern/assistant since May 2016 (40 hours/week over summer and 20-25 hours/week during the school year) -- I've had a flexible contractor contract since then
- I usually under-report hours or at least never report time just hanging out at office, eating lunch, or doing research on my own time about ideas I could pitch or if I want to make sure I deliver the highest quality work, but they didn't ask me to do research
- There's an expectation I will likely stay with the company when I graduate in May, but my contract is open-ended and I haven't made any promises

Recent developments 

- I used to work directly for the CEO as an intern assistant which was always super exciting and rewarding - he's been a mentor of mine for some time, is a visionary in the industry, and our personalities just mesh 
- They realized it didn't make sense to keep me as simply an assistant after I was working there part time for over a year and so the CEO put me under the supervision of the marketing director, who's also my age (23 at the time) and didn't really know what to do with me... spent a couple months aimlessly making my own to-do lists and reports 
- We spun off our education program as its own company which I found terribly exciting - so they put me under the supervision of its new CEO and we just don't vibe at all. The woman snaps and complains all the time and is just cold and makes me feel awkward all the time 
- Since the election, I've been distracted by the news and looking at ways to help people getting f**ked by the system. I'm an immigrant who's parents came here for a better life and I've benefited incredibly from affordable quality education and other American institutions. I'm also a firm believer that none of us have rights until all people are free from blatant and institutional systems of oppression and the results of this election feel like a calling to the battlefield 
- My anxiety and depression have flared up intensely and have caused me to be more flakey and call sick more often -- but I haven't told anyone at work, especially since we don't have an HR department - also it's a startup with only 10 people in the office and there's a certain expectation of always being on-call... also feel way discouraged reporting to this new CEO
- I graduate in May and my partner and I decided to move to California this summer to get away from DC and get into the space scene there -- and I would like to get more involved in the media industry to advocate for the importance of STEM and space for young people to a larger audience, advocate how space exploration and social justice can be linked, and get more involved in boots on the ground civil rights and education advocacy (also warm, sunny, chill people, weed)

I bailed on work last week and told my new boss I want to talk about a personal matter when I get back (tomorrow) and I'm lost on how to explain all of this and what parts to explain... 

Mainly I want to get across that 

- My mental health has been affecting my performance and I'm sorry I didn't bring it up sooner (??)
- I don't feel that this company is the right fit considering where I'm at in my life, but I will always be happy to support them with some contracting work here and there 
- I plan on moving and want to stop working in May 
- I wanted to be honest about my situation and future plans to ensure I am serving the company the best way I can since I believe so strongly in the vision and am so grateful for the opportunities I’ve been provided

Questions

- Is it worth explaining the details of my mental health?
- I've heard that with mental health, it's good to suggest options to help employer help you - but if I plan on leaving in two months... perhaps just offer to spend my remaining time getting records together for whoever they hire next (I'm in charge of a number of databases that only I know how to read/manipulate)?
- When talking to new boss - do I mention that her management style is stifling and flares up my anxiety? 
(with different words lol)
- Should I mention the awkwardness of changing my supervisors to the CEO? 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!!

At the moment I'm Multimedia Design and Communication student in Denmark and I want to start my freelance business. I have done some freelance work few years ago, and it was design stuff mostly, but after that, I never took this thing any further. 

Currently I'm working full time job next to my full time studies, so I barely have any time for my studies and myself. Since I'm interested in web design/front-end stuff, I need to put at least 25 hours a week coding on my own, but because of my job, I don't have time for that. I feel that my knowledge and studies really starts to suffer. 

Now I have savings for about 8-10 months and I want to start my freelance business until I ran out of savings (after 10 months, I will start my internship, so I need source of income for that period of time too). I know how big the competition is, and for some reason, I don't want to take the usual upwork and elance path and bid low against asian people. I have tried those websites before and I had no success at all. I need advice, how can I get my first clients the other way around. Where should I start looking for them, how to spread the word that I'm freelancer? 

My current knowledge is HTML/CSS, RWD, Boostrap, Jekyll and I'm learning Javascript. I already know the fundamentals of Javascript, currently learning about prototype, scope, all the weird things of JS and after that I'm going to start learning either React or Angular 2. Are these skills valuable in freelance world, because I know for sure that JS frameworks are on peak right now, but when I check freelance jobs, it's mostly CMS, PHP thing, which I'm not interested in. What advice would you guys give me? Bear in mind, that after quiting my shitty job, I would study web design full time (at least 4-5 hours a day).  What are my actions apart from building skills and portfolio? What should I do from business/marketing side to attract my first clients?

60urht,7,2017-03-22,How doable is transitioning to a management role?,themooseexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60urht/how_doable_is_transitioning_to_a_management_role/,"As a disclaimer, I'm aware this post is a lot of speculation and I'm aware it's pretty vague - I'm hoping to get many different opinions from many different areas of the field. I'm a sophomore at a target school with a decent GPA majoring in CS and also minoring in Business. I have my first SWE internship at a Fortune 50 Insurance company with a very reputable program this upcoming summer. 

I very much enjoy programming and have built a few smaller-scale projects on my own, but at the end of the day I would still lump myself into the ""work to make a good salary to afford what you really enjoy"" category. CS isn't my life, and for all intents and purposes let's say I'm most interested in making money in my career (which is often stigmatized here, but I feel that it's totally okay to want to work to make as much as possible). 

Anyway, my question is as the title states: how difficult would it be to switch to a management role? I know CS can have a bit of a salary cap, where as the more people you manage the more your pay tends to increase, seemingly continuously (spending some of my younger years living in NYC I have seen this firsthand). I would say my social skills are probably the strongest part of my ""complete package"" and I have no issue managing people and being proactive and, for example​, straight up asking a boss for more managerial type work if the opportunity presents itself. 

So, do you personally have any experience with or know anyone who has transferred from a programming role to a management role? And if so, how? 

Thanks! "

Internship 2: It is in the Permits Department of a road commission. This one only lasts about 75% of the summer. The duties in the job posting are:

1. Assist in residual driveway review.

2. Observe and assist with Plan/Engineering Review.

3. Progressive exposure to on-site inspections.

4. Exposure to permitting process.

All things being equal I would prefer Internship 2 because I prefer the location and the people I have dealt with so far.

I was wondering if any of you had any insight on which internship would be more relevant or any other thoughts.

I'm a student in my senior year of my BS, and I have some questions regarding how I should go about marketing my current experience and what I should do to fill the holes in my resume. Essentially, my experience as any sort of ""developer"" has been less than standard or rigorous, and I don't know what to expect job hunting or what to present on a resume. 

Some background: I'll be graduating in May with a BS in Mathematics. While going through my degree, I've taken a number of math courses based on applied programming (namely, Numerical Analysis 1 and 2, Computational Math and Science, and Data Oriented Computing). All of these classes were based in Python, and needless to say I've fallen in love with the language and that kind of work. 

As a result, I had some extra time to take some CS courses (which included Intro to CS (Java based focused on OOP design and testing), Data Structures (which was in C++), and some other intro courses).

Now, during the last year, I've been working as a ""loose"" developer for a small realtor group. Here, I've created a custom, internal CRM using Flask run on Google's App Engine (which uses a MYSQL database and a custom front-end I also developed). I've also done very light data analysis for them (which was why I went to work for them in the first place), which includes some machine learning using Theano and Keras (albeit, with nothing fleshed out enough to put on github). 

And of course, I've been involved in many various personal and scholastic projects raging from games to formal data analysis. 

Now, my current dilemma is trying to figure out what kind of jobs I could be a competitive applicant in. My experience at the Realty group is very informal, and I'm afraid that my work done their isn't ""professional"" enough (I mean, I have no formal experience with web development, so everything I did was learned as I went without any guidance). I also don't know if I should pursue jobs as a web developer or a data analyst or anything else. Frankly, the only thing I'm confident in calling myself is a python developer (a jack of all trades, but a master of none). 

I want to go back to school and earn my Masters in something related to data analysis and machine learning, but im taking some time off of school and I want to use this time to gain experience and use my degree (and current experience, of course). 

Any advice? I'm willing to relocate or work remotely, and I'm not concerned about starting a career or even working full time. I'm figuring that I'm going to be stuck working entry level since my experience is limited, but should I be shooting for internships instead?

I've tried looking through forums to see how others handle situations like this, but it's tough to gauge my experience as it seems to be rather unique. 

Thanks for any help!"

I'm going through waves of seeing silver linings (a chance to become healthier, try some new recipes, reconnect with myself and family, read, exercise, etc.), but I also go through waves of 'why me', 'is this somehow my fault', and general hopelessness. I was recently diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and OCD, and cannot help but think this was part to blame for me to become a less efficient employee, and therefore was one of the few to get cut. I am thankful for my medication, and I don't think I would be able to handle this second lay-off without the recent stability the SSRI's have provided me. 

I've got a BS in Mechanical Engineering, with a couple internships, and just under a year and a half of engineering experience. 
I'm considering continuing into this niche (energy engineering, i.e. running simulations for virtual buildings as part of utility incentive programs), because I think it's awesome and I love thermodynamics. But, I'm looking for advice because while I love energy engineering, I am concerned about continuing to be laid off. I have taken a couple Python Coursera courses, and have enrolled in a few other, as well as basic HTML and Java courses. I've always been interested in data science and higher level math, but unsure of the chances of getting involved in that type of work with only a BS in Mechanical Engineering. Does anyone have any experience in this? 

As far as finances go, I don't have much savings, living alone in Somerville, but I anticipate unemployment which should keep me afloat for 4-5 months. Leaning on my family isn't really an option - they are barely making it themselves. I was only at this company for just over a year, so I'm not sure if I'm eligible for severance but figured I'd call HR today/tomorrow and give it a shot (anyone have any experience with this)? One comfort is that I have received overwhelming amounts of support from various other engineers who have reached out and passed along their support, kind words, and offers for references/to help out any way they can. I really enjoyed my time with this fantastic company, could see my progress and knowledge increasing, and honestly pains me to see that job end. Unfortunately, these engineers are in other parts of the country, and working with any connections they have does not seem to be in the question. Any advice on any of the above (thoughts on pursuing energy engineering in this political/environment climate, transitioning to data science/computer science with the help of Coursera with only a BS in Mechanical engineering, how to move forward, any kind words)? 

When I was laid off before, I sort of slipped into a dark hole for a few months, and did a fantastic job of isolating myself. I'm trying not to do that now. "

La menguante población japonesa en edad de trabajar supone un serio problema para la economía del país. Para intentar solventar esta situación, el Gobierno creó un programa que otorga permisos de trabajo y residencia a ciudadanos extranjeros de países en desarrollo. A primera vista parece una decisión acertada y que beneficia a japoneses y extranjeros, sin embargo, son muchos los inmigrantes que han comenzado a quejarse por las condiciones precarias, los abusos e incuso por impagos de salarios.

Tal y como publica Bloomberg, este es el caso de Tang Xili, una ciudadana que llegó a Japón en 2013 desde Yizheng City (China) y que ahora vive en un refugio para gente sin recursos. Xili explica que después de trabajar jornadas interminables seis días a la semana, el que era su jefe le ha dejado a deber 31.000 dólares.

Esta ciudadana china estuvo trabajando por un salario que se encontraba por debajo de la remuneración mínima del país. Sin embargo se encontraba acorralada, no podía dejar su empleo porque su permiso de residencia en Japón dependía del contrato que había firmado. 

Xili se encuentra dentro de un programa 'Technical Intern Training Program' que puso en marcha el Gobierno japonés en 1993. Este proyecto trabaja con 72 ocupaciones diferentes en áreas como la agricultura, la pesca, la construcción, procesamiento de comida o industria textil. Según el Ministerio de Justicia, en 2015 unas 31.320 empresas están utilizando este programa de reclutamiento. Este programa otorga permisos de trabajo para formar a personas con baja cualificación y que pertenecen a países en desarrollo. Tras unos años en Japón, estas habilidades adquiridas serán útiles para el día que vuelven a sus países natales.

Este programa ha suscitado críticas entre determinados sectores. Shigeru Ishiba, ministro de Revitalización Regional, señala que ""realidad es que muchos de los que vienen para formarse terminan trabajando en condiciones pobres, en lugar de ser tratados como aprendices reales. Antes de hablar acerca de políticas de inmigración, habría que corregir la forma de trato hacia esas personas"". 

""Realmente me arrepiento de haber venido a Japón. No recomendaría a ninguno de mis amigos ni conocidos que viniera aquí a sufrir"", explica esta mujer de 35 años y que lleva en Japón desde 2013 para buscar una vida mejor. 

Un programa polémico
Tang Xili es uno de los 180.000 trabajadores extranjeros que han logrado permisos de residencia dentro del programa del Gobierno para 'rejuvenecer' la fuerza laboral del país con la edad media más avanzada del mundo. 

Y es que, según Bloomberg este programa se ha convertido en algunos casos en una especie de vacío legal para las empresas, que aprovechan para eludir las normas laborales y obtener una mano de obra barata, según ha destacado algunos funcionarios nipones. 

A pesar de la polémica que ha causado este programa (por su permisividad), el Gobierno de Abe están preparando su ampliación por cinco años más, aunque es cierto que en esta ocasión se creará un organismo supervisor para prevenir la explotación de los empleados que se acojan a este programa."

Two years ago, I started an internship program after grad school and I met a guy in that program who became my best friend. We'll call him Carl. Carl and I were both in long term relationships when we met, but there was always some tension between us. We would flirt with each other sometimes. He compliments me all the time and has told me he thinks I'm beautiful and intelligent on numerous occasions. He also volunteers to do favors for me all the time like changing the oil on my car and he helped me move into my apartment and assemble some furniture. For the past 2 years, we have talked everyday and we tell each other everything. I noticed the only thing he has never seemed to talk much about is his relationship with his girlfriend even though I shared details about my relationship with him all the time. For awhile I sort of questioned if he even liked his girlfriend or was just staying with her because he was comfortable in that relationship. Over the last two years he probably only mentioned her 4 or 5 times and it has never had anything to do with how much he cares for her or something he likes about her. I've only met her once and that was at his birthday party. He never brings her with him to parties or our weekly group happy hour.

Last month I decided it was time to end my four year relationship with my boyfriend because I wasn't in love anymore. Even though I've always secretly had a thing for Carl, I didn't act any differently toward him after becoming single since he is still in a relationship and I figured it was pointless to pursue him.

Well two weeks ago, Carl called me in the middle of the night to say he was leaving a party near my apartment and wanted to stop by. This is unusual since we usually hang out with our group of friends at the bar or during the day. He had never showed up at my apartment in the middle of the night before and we had hooked up or even kissed before. So he comes over and we decide to watch a movie. Twenty minutes into the movie he asks me if he can just stay over and sleep on my couch and I say sure. We were kind of cuddling and spooning while watching the movie. After awhile he starts to move his hand shirt and start feeling my breasts. One thing leads to another and then he starts fingering me and I ended up giving him a bj. He came over again the very next night and it happened again. He wanted to come over a third night in a row, but I was on my period and feeling bloated and unattractive so I made up an excuse not to see him for two days and I think he felt like I was blowing him off because when I invited him over on the third day he said he wanted to stay in. Ever since things have just been kind of weird between us. We still talk all the time but he hasn't made any more advances toward me and we haven't hung out even just as friends. I'm not sure what to do right now or if it's even possible to go back to our platonic friendship since I think it's clear he doesn't want to be in a relationship with me after all. I am definitely disappointed since I built this up in my head for the past two years thinking he liked me as more than a friend, but he's still with his girlfriend and doesn't seem to have any plans to end their relationship even though I'm finally available. I thought perhaps he felt guilty about cheating on her though he hasn't really distanced himself from me entirely. He still talks to me daily and initiates conversations over text but it has dialed down some. We spend about an hour less per day talking now than we used to. Even if we can't be together in a relationship I just want us to move past this and go back to being BFFs. What should I do?"

60wjet,1356,2017-03-22,He wakes up when I go to sleep,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60wjet/he_wakes_up_when_i_go_to_sleep/,"Humans don't have a physiological need to sleep. Over time, chemical levels of Adenosine build up which cause the sleepy feeling, but that is simply a trigger designed to force our bodies to rest. Some scientists have theorized that this is an evolutionary mechanism intended to prevent us from wasting unnecessary energy while keeping us hidden during the night. Well there isn't any shortage of calories to consume, and there's nothing going to eat me in the night, so as far as I'm concerned, sleep is just an antiquated fetter which humans should leave behind.  

We don't need sleep to live, but we cannot survive without dreaming. And if you stay awake for long enough, you'll start to dream even while awake. The more you try to fight those dreams, the more real they will become. Pretty soon you can't tell which is the dream and which is real, or whether there is a difference at all. That's the story I told the police, and my attorney, and it's the story I'm sticking with now. 

It started when I read an article in my psychology class about this Vietnamese insomniac named Thái Ngọc who hasn’t slept in 43 years. It said he had some kind of fever, and then never felt the urge to sleep again. Even working full time, it’s like he has a vacation every night. 

I don’t know about you, but for a stressed out college student always trying to cram for the latest test, that sounded like a lifesaver. I’m paying my own way through college with a work study program, and trying to maintain a social life in the half-hour break I have between class and work is absolutely impossible. I'm tired, and stressed, and missing out on what is supposed to be the best years of my life because I never have a free moment to be myself. If I could find a way to waste less time sleeping though, maybe things would get better.

I did some more reading and became obsessed with the idea. If we sleep for 8 hours and are awake 16, then eliminating sleep would be equivalent to adding around 40 years to my lifespan (assuming an 80 year life). I found some studies about a drug being tested on mice called Orexin-A which was supposed to completely eliminate the need for sleep. It hadn’t been approved for human trials yet, but there weren’t any negative side effects found in the mice. If anything, they seemed more active than ever. And the best part was, research for this drug was being done right at UCLA where I go to school!

Well I was able to find where the lab was easily enough, although I didn’t expect them to just hand me the chemicals. I tried to get an internship there, but they required at least twenty hours a week and I couldn’t even begin to fit that into my schedule. I forgot about the whole thing until I overheard Ricky, one of the other kids in my psych class, mentioning that he got the internship.

Ricky was boasting about using the keys to sneak into the lab at night and get high off the anesthesia they used on rats. If he doesn't sound like an idiot yet, then add a tank top that says ""I party with sluts"", a hat with the ""obey"" sticker, and a skateboard which he carries around to look cool but doesn't know how to ride. You got the idea. 

But that was fine with me, because it made it a simple matter to pretend to be his friend. All I had to do was turn my hat backward, make a couple dumb jokes about the blonde sitting in front, high five him when she bent over, and voila. Suddenly we were bros. Future of American science right here.

It didn’t take many hints before he invited me into the lab. I found where the Orexin-A experiments were just by looking up the faculty directory in charge, and before my “buddy” finished coming down from huffing anesthesia, I had a whole backpack full of the little spray bottles of Orexin. It was nasally administrated, but I didn’t care as long as it worked.

And holy hell – it worked alright. Twenty squirts up each nostril (seemed like a lot, but I controlled the dosage to 1mg/kg body weight, which was equivalent to the dose the mice were getting). I played Skyrim straight into the dawn. Okay, so it wasn’t quite self-actualization, but I hadn’t had any free time in awhile and it felt great to have the constant pressure off me. The night was so quiet, and by the early morning it felt like the entire world was made just for me. I didn’t even feel tired until the following night, and I just took another dose and all the weariness washed away. I spent the second night reading Shakespeare just for fun. How else would anyone ever have the time for that? There was so much to do and learn about the world, and finally I had the chance to do it all. It was the best thing I could have ever hoped for.

The one thing the mice hadn’t mentioned during their experiments, however, was that you can still dream without sleeping. They started on the third day, little visual abnormalities that danced around the corner of my vision. Patterns, or shapes, or textures just drifting idly by. I actually enjoyed them at first, but the longer I went without sleep, the more real they became. By the fifth day I actually started seeing fully formed people walking alongside me. They were always in my peripheral vision, and as soon as I turned to face them, they disappeared. 

It was the evening of the sixth day when I opened my bedroom to see a smiling figure sitting on my bed. It didn’t even have a face – just teeth which wrapped all the way up around up to where its ears should be. I splashed cold water in my face and the thing disappeared, but it still freaked me out. 

I decided to take a break from the drug then, but even without it I couldn’t sleep that night. There must have still been some in my system. I tossed and turned, and every time I got up, that figure with the teeth was there watching me. Every time I jolted myself awake, it would linger a little longer in my room. Just silently smiling.

I managed to get through the next day – still off the drug, and still seeing the creature out of the corner of my eye wherever I looked. I got used to him though and even began to nod off during the psych lecture. After class, I decided to call in sick from work and just go sleep. Ricky was trying to talk to me, but I was so tired I couldn’t even figure out what he was saying. It was hard to even look at him with the creature standing next to us. I just mumbled something and turned to leave, but the idiot kept following me.

I shouldn’t have shoved him, but I was so tired I couldn’t deal with pretending to be his friend anymore. He stumbled back a few paces – right into the smiling creature. The weirdest thing was, I swear he bounced off the creature and looked over his shoulder. It seems stupid to think he could see my dream, but I was so tired I wasn't thinking straight. I just bolted and ran. 

Ricky was still following me though - he was insistent. Something about there being a security camera at the lab. That we had to get our story straight about what we were doing there. I don't know. I just wanted to get home. I just wanted to sleep. I ducked into an alley between the psych and sociology buildings, but I couldn't lose him. He grabbed my shoulder and pulled me to the ground, and I didn't have the strength to fight him off. I was too tired to get up, so I just lay there and let him yell at me. My mind was so numb with exhaustion, even the sound of his shouting faded into a gentle white noise, and I must have fallen asleep right there on the ground.  

His body was mangled almost beyond recognition. The police told me there were witnesses who saw me jump on top of Ricky and bite his face into a bloody pulp. They said I had some kind of inhuman strength, and that it took almost a dozen people to drag me off him. They said I hurled him like a rag doll into the building, dislocating both his shoulders and smashing one of the bricks into powder. I don't know how I could have done it while I was asleep. All I know is that when i was about to drift off, I saw my creature standing behind Ricky, and the last thing I saw before closing my eyes was its teeth sinking into his neck. 

The court blamed the incident on the drug and I've been transfered to a rehab clinic. It's been four days since I've last taken Orexin, but the creautre hasn't gone away. Every time I close my eyes, it’s sitting a little closer. Sooner or later I’m going to fall asleep, and it's going to take control again. I'm writing this because if I can't stay awake, I want someone out there to know. 

Don't blame me for what he does when I'm asleep.  

I'm fighting it for as long as I can.

Basically, I didn't formally code until I got to college, and I like it a lot. I have a very strong academic background in biology research, and I'm wondering if I can transition that to computer science (likely changing major to comp bio) on track for a software engineer job.

I just need advice for catching up to everyone else who are already doing internships or have years of coding experience.

I'm looking into opportunities like summer of code since all internships are done recruiting. I'm eligible for Explore and the Google Practicum so if there are other programs like those for minorities, I'd love to hear about them for next year.

thanks guys"

This was originally posted as a comment on one of the threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/60bm5m/special_snowflakes_part_4/df56v01/?st=j0l7saw2&amp;sh=99e29aa0). It happened 2 years ago and I was not present for any of it, but I have two eye witness accounts that depict the collosal idiocy. One is from my mother (not tech savvy, but knows enough of the ""computer speak"", as she puts it) and she had no part in story development except that she is the original source for this story to me and rellayed the gossip to me (but will be mentioned nonetheless), the other is from my friend who was part of the team that created the software in question. This has little to do with actual TechSupport, because the team in question was denied the right to do the software by the book and had no chance to actually do any TechSupport because their support contract had ended abruptly.

Cast:

* $Boss = CEO of the company (50-ish)

* $BTW = $Bosses Trophy Wife (late 20s)

* $CTL = Contracted team lead

* $CTF = Friend that was on the job (graduated CS last August)

* $TS = ""The software""

* $ArchiveSorceress = My mother (name explained later)

* @ML[2] = Men of Law

* @SG[2] = Scape Goats that took the fall, aka. the accounting team

* $EL = Expensive/Elderly Lawyer ($CTL's dad)

Let's commence!

**(The Idea)**

$Boss made it big selling shoe polish and then decided to mix things up. He bought vinegar processing factory and wine cellary, leaving his shoe polish days in the dust. He got a divorce and married this unsatiable, unbecoming woman that just got fired from ""the big, proper company"" and who started to ~~change everything to the way it was at her old office~~ raise the quality of the work environment. $BTW had some nice things done, but for not so good of a reason. Only one thing was missing. Partly because of the routine, partly because she was a golddigger, $BTW wanted to have access to the accounting info and remembered $TheOriginalSoftware and how someone was praising it for being ""so goddarn easy to use and had all the info one could ever need"". The problem was that she had no idea what set of 0s and 1s they were using at the old firm so she had an epiphany - ""I'll have $Boss make one just like that, but made easy so I can count every single $, £, penny, cent, button,... that gets into our bank"" - and relayed all she ~~wanted~~ had at the old job to her ~~gold shitting retriever~~ husband. He wasn't excited by it, but he was compliant.

**($Bosses incompetence)**

$Boss rushed forth boldly to make his damsels wish come to existance, but, unfortunately, he had no idea who to contract as the only IT in the small town of $Cantpronounceitwithahumantongue had no idea how to do that. $CTF was a junior and started an internship at $CTLs firm. His mother was so proud that she told everyone that her son was ""a big deal IT, and not yet out of college"" and eventually someone told $Boss about it. As it goes in this part of the ~~shitter~~ world, $Boss called $CTF directly and said roughly:

&gt; I have a job for you and your team. It's super important to get here as fast as you can

&gt; $CTF : Who was this again?

&gt; $Boss : It's $Boss from $TheCompany. A little bird told me that you are a big shot computer guy in $TheBigTown4hrDriveAway and I have just the job for you, you will love it. Get your team and be here in half an hour *click*

&gt; $CTF : *screaming internally*

$CTF was no Encino man, but a man of intellect, so he told $CTL how he got offered a job from $Boss that would possibly need a whole team and that the meeting was already set. $CTL was unhappy how he wasn't contacted first, but agreed to go there and check things out with $CTF.

**($CTL's incompetence)**

$CTL and $CTF mount the German chariot with 450 horses and a crosshair on the frontmost horse and rush to $Bosses work quarters where $Boss informs them on his needs. No pleasantries, just a cup of coffee and down to bussines they go.

&gt; $Boss : I need a software that works with our accounting database.

&gt; $CTL : OK, what kind of software?

&gt; $Boss : I want to be able to make financial reports and have some nice graphics. Also, to add, update and delete entries. And it needs to look decent from my iPad and iPhone, so I can check the progress on some jobs.

&gt; $CTL : It can be done. *counts the dough internally*

&gt; $Boss : I'll pay you a $SizeableCrapload for it to be done until the end of the month (about three weeks time), and you'll do support when we need you.
$CTL has ~~a fuckup in mind~~ an idea.

&gt; $CTL : $CTF here is one of my best workers and he will be onsite to be accessible to you, he needs a desk, we will supply everything else.

&gt; $CTF *are you kidding me, I'm not up to it* : ...

&gt; $Boss : Sounds great! Let's get some schnapps and celebrate! $SG[1], print the contract and bring it here!

$CTF consults $CTL on the idea he had in mind

&gt; $CTL : Do you know the phpMaker?

&gt; $CTF : Is that the one I worked with on the first assignment?

&gt; $CTL : No, this is much simpler. you need to connect to the database and make a frontend, it's idiot proof so you'll do well. Do everything as he wants and call me if you don't have a check box/radio button/menu that does exactly that.

&gt; $CTF : Thank you boss, I will not fail you.

**($BTW's thoughtlessness and $CTFs work)**

$CTF checked out the software supplied and saw all the options available, so he jotted that down and decided not to mention anything else, just for his convenience. $Boss and $BTW pull him into a meeting.

&gt; $BTW : It needs to be accessible to us. I want you to make it so I don't need a password.

&gt; $CTF : I think it's against your companies policy.

&gt; $BTW : Screw the policy, it's my company.

*no it's not*

&gt; $CTF *remembering what $CTL said* : Ok, so no password, just a username.

&gt; $BTW : No username. I don't want to memorise such irrelevant info, I do a lot of work here, it'll be too much.

&gt; $CTF : But,... *stops dumbfounded* ...everyone will have access to it.

&gt; $Boss : Come on, don't make this difficult to us or we'll report you to your boss.

&gt; $CTF *gulps*

$CTF gets the unimportant (for the story at least) details settled on and goes his marry way. He shared office with $ArchiveSorceress (she holds all the WiFi chants, potions for god-like deeds on the servers, Skeleton keys, Accounting Almanacs and such...) and she was told to share all the info he needs, but inform $Boss if he is asking for something suspicious (he did no such thing). He was done before the deadline, $Boss was pleased, $BTW also, everything worked from their offices, the @SG were trained to use it proficiently and given his contact details in case they needed anything. He informed $CTL, got 10% from the job, regretted telling him about it, and he was done with it for good, *or so he thought*

**($CTF's struggle)**

So everything was fine until the new contract was struck and added to the database. $BTW wanted to check it out from her home, but it just wasn't there, invisible to her measly intelectual capacity. She was enraged, her combo counter ready, target a few beeps away.

&gt; $CTF : Hello?

&gt; $BTW : Listen to me you bastard, you need to get $TS back up right now! I can't access it at all! It's not there! It disappeared from the internet!

&gt; $CTF : Who was this again? (He has zero tolerance to bullshit, so imagine every word that he says following this reply in the most condescending tone he can pull of - about 31.41592% condescending)

&gt; $BTW *in no 'e didan't mode* : You son of a ~~bitch~~ mother, it's me! You made that piece of ~~shit~~ software that doesn't work for me, and it's your fault it doesn't work!

&gt; $CTF : OK, calm down. Tell me when did this happen?

&gt; $BTW : I don't know I haven't used it in $num days

&gt; $CTF : Does it work for @SG?

&gt; $BTW : I don't know.

&gt; $CTF : Can you go ask them?

&gt; $BTW : I can't, I'm at home and if I hang up now, you won't pick up later, I know your type, you good-for-nothing computer dork.

&gt; $CTF : Are you remoting in to your server?

&gt; $BTW : What kind of question is that? Are you trying to confuse me with your computerist (had to use this expression it's just too good; I do not hold the rights to it) mumbo-jumbo?

&gt; $CTF : It's a standard question if you are not on site. Since you don't understand that I'm gonna assume you don't even know how to do it, so I'm gonna explain this simply. If you are not connected to your internal work network, you cannot access it. Capisco? You need to connect remotely or actually be there.

&gt; $BTW : I'm calling your boss right now.
$CTF has some time before she gets the number and tells $CTL what happened and how he reacted. He gets a look of disapproval and just before he gets put in place the phone bell interrupts.

&gt; $Boss *in a calm tone* : I need to see you two at my office tomorrow so we can settle this

**(Inflection point)**

$CTF was scared although $CTL assured him it's nothing. They were both escorted by $ArchiveSorceress into the Executive Meeting Lounge($EML), chatting along the way, no idea they were about to get the greatest news they could've hoped for. In the $EML, on his throne, $Boss, beside him his ~~leech~~ faithfull $BTW, and under his feet two panting lawyers clad in cheap suits and armed with ~~pikes and shields~~ pens and briefcases.

&gt; $Boss : I want to end the contract with you, the lawyers say it's okay since our contract excludes the support and we didn't sign the one about that. I want you to do just one more thing and never see you again.

&gt; $CTL and $CTF : ?????

&gt; $CTL : Can you elaborate a little bit?

&gt; $Boss : $BTW doesn't like the way you treat her, and neither do I.

&gt; $ML[1] : We need the source code for $TS and we need you to execute the final request so you get compensated your trip at least.

&gt; $CTF : The source code is with the $ArchiveSorceress.

&gt; $ML[2] : Good, so we can go on to the next thing. Go put $TS on the internet

&gt; $CTF : Do what now?

&gt; $Boss : Put it on the internet so we can see it from home

&gt; $CTF : But, it....

&gt; $BTW : I told you he was like that, he can't do it, so he didn't do it in the first place.

&gt; $CTL wanting to relieve some of the pressure : Can we consult on this issue for a minute?

&gt; $Boss : Sure, but I need to see you through the glass so you don't run away.

&gt; $CTL and $CTF in unison : Thank you!

Outside

&gt; $CTL : What's the problem, why won't you do it? I'm sick of these people already.

&gt; $CTF : The password.

&gt; $CTL : What password?

&gt; $CTF : Exactly....

&gt; $CTL : ....

&gt; $CTF : They have no password on it.

&gt; $CTL : Are you kidding me? You know the procedure, right?

&gt; $CTF : But they explicitly asked for it to be removed. That ~~bitch~~ lady was complaining about how hard it is to rember it.

&gt; $CTL : Let me call my lawyer. What's the licence on it?

&gt; $CTF : No liability on our part for improper use.

&gt; $CTL : ~~Let them be the victims of their own stupidity~~ You just made my day.

*Cue the $EL carrying the usual mumbo-jumbo he drew up with $CTL some time ago with a few sentences added (goto below)*

&gt; $EL : We need you to sign this thing before we execute the end of contract papers.

&gt; @ML *in unison* : What is it?

&gt; $EL : Standard contact stating that we do not have anything to do with $TS once we end the contract, (:below) and that you demanded our client break your Security Policy.

&gt; $Boss : Gimme dat! *signs* Put it on the internet now, I'm sick of ~~you~~ this

Flip of the switch (virtual) and hitting the door. Chariot awaits, expenses were paid, $EL offers to drop $CTF to class. They are happy with how things turned out.

**(The Epilogue)**

The page was indexed. It could be Googled and popped out right after the generic $AlmostADecadeOldCompanyWebsite hosted from the same server. Work continues as usual and after some time they notice some of the records have been added 

'ClientName: ~~ButtHead~~ Beavis; Amount: One Gazzillion to be payed; Due: $CurrentDate; Added: $CurrentDay-12h(not working ours);' 

Everyone jumped to the conclusion - THEY WERE HACKED. Police were called, $CTL and $CTF also (they refused to show up until the police ~~busted their door~~ politely scheduled a meeting with them. Data was lost. No backups, except for ~~the paper trails printed~~ Accounting Almanacs in possesion of the $ArchiveSorceress. Police shunned them for wasting time on their stupidity, they sued $CTL, but they were rejected at first hearing and so @SG took the blame for not caring for the data and had to do unpaid overtime for 3 months to get everything into the database the old way. @SG both retired since. $TS was scrapped and never used before. $CTF was questioned extensively by me for the 4 hours, and still came short on details, therefore, aforementioned embellishment. He moved to another company since and is still condescending (unfortunatelly, I had the chance to intern there for 2 months and he was my ""mentor"", thus pointing all the condescension towards me). The company survived and $Boss never listened to $BTW again (or at least I wish it were so). $ArchiveSorceress had a surgery and is recuperating for 2 more months (still gets calls about the WiFi chants)."

I still picked a bit today and yesterday (didn't have time to post then) i also picked two spots at my face, but today i didn't pick my face at all, so i feel like that's really great. But again, i still picked during these two days my upper body a lot of times and even though i didn't have a single picking 'spree' i realize looking at my pickimg list that it is still a lot of times when i picked there... So thats my second goal now: To also stop picking my upper body (and maybe be able to fully enjoy summer vacation at the beach). But all in all it's been a great week and i have made some real progress so i can go outside tomorrow catching my flight to my internship location abroad. Thank you guys so much for that too!

By the way: Here's as promised my picking list (how many times i picked a spot at a location) for the last two days (really helped me to keep myself accountable and quantify how much i really pick):

12 chest

i am 23 and live in La Paz Bolivia a city in the hearth of sud america, im finishing my degree in systems engineering next year and thinking about moving to US, i have some questions about this:

-wich are the best states for working in software development?

-should work and get experience here before triying to go to USA?

some information about me:

-i started making video games 3 years ago, im a game designer and a programmer in the dev team we have, we use C# in Unity3D for development, also have used Fmod, OrkFramework, and a litle of Wwise plus some other small assets, we have some small games that i plan to put in my portfolio, nothing too fancy, we are now making our first serious game that we are planing to be a narrative ARPG, the first prototipe got elected as one of the best in the 2016 national contest Eduardo Abaroa.

-i know its hard to live by making videogames so i am also learning web development, i can use HTML, CSS, GIT, also a litle of mysql and im learning javascript, angular and planing to learn D3 next, hopping to have a working web portfolio by the end of the year and start adding web and game dev proyects there.

-i am the team leader of our litle dev studio, tought we are a thing only in the bolivian videogames asociation that is not well known even here so that may not be of any help?

-i have some litle experience in desktop applications and movile apps made with java, i dont really like that but if it gives me a work i take it.

-i got really sick a year ago and had to leave university for a year so that lowered my averagte score a lot, wich was just regular to begin with, maeby that will be a problem?

-i have worked with a small company as an intern, there i helped with web dev and some augmented reality in unity3D for android.

If you have any recommendation for the citizenship process that may help too
Also if I should be pointing towards other place I can take the advice

60xo6q,9,2017-03-22,Should I have seen this coming? Or was it just a coincidence...,lajulaju,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/60xo6q/should_i_have_seen_this_coming_or_was_it_just_a/,"Hey ladies, 





I recently got let go from a new job I started in my field (and kinda liked) and would like some opinions on the situation. I apologize in advance if this is long, but I'll summarize it up at the bottom as best as I can.





 So I got hired about 2 months ago for a slightly bigger local manufacturer (active/ swim wear) doing mostly pre-production task. I have less then a years experience from working under a smaller company (women's ready-to-wear) along with three 3-month internships (also women's ready-to-wear), but was up front with them in the interview. I got good vibes from the owner, a white lady, but got mixed vibes from the office manager, also a white lady. I was offered the job on a trial bases, 60 days, and then we'd go from there. 





 All my job task came from the office manager and whenever we had to converse, she always had this weirdness around me like talking to a women that was clenching on to her purse anxiously. Only with me though would she get all weird, because when she would talk to my co-workers, it was calm and collective. I think it's worth mentioning that my co-workers only speak Spanish and broken English, except for two that were bi-lingual and did the same work as me.






After a couple weeks, I got a check in from the owner, telling me she liked the work I was producing, she's so happy this is working out and can really see that I have the skill set even for the type of clothing I've never worked with before. But then I would get the office manager telling me that I work too slow and need to hurry up with orders. Well, when I would rush on certain orders, I made a couple mistakes and the office manager would get upset. She then told me to get her every time I finished a task to check it before I went on to the next order. I would also like to add that I would have to fix my mistakes (which is no duh) but then she would also have me fix other coworkers mistakes as well, putting me behind on my own work. 





Then they hired another girl I went to school with within a couple of weeks of hiring me (also bi-lingual) and she was about the same pace as me. She also made multiple mistakes, but the Spanish speaking coworkers would point it out to her before it reached the office manager and she would fix it. I was sort of annoyed because it happened on multiple occasions and the new girl was getting praise from the office manager while I got scolded about my ""slow"" production and previous mistakes. The office manager then started putting me on repetitive task that would take hours on bulk orders because of the focus and detail that went into it, which she knew, but would approach me every 15-20 minutes asking me how's it going or if I'm done. I was becoming really annoyed but totally swept it under the rug, suppressing my agitation through passive-aggressive smiles and nods. 





Well one day, I was heading to the restroom when I overheard the office manager talking to the owner and only heard, ""she's not really friendly and seem's like she has an attitude with me"" . I don't know who she was talking about, but I assumed me because of paranoia. 





I went in today, getting weird vibes from the office manager (as usual) but also the coworkers that worked beside me. That's when the owner told me I wasn't the right fit for them because of my slow performance and their busiest season was coming up. She then goes on to tell me she really wanted it to work but can't afford the time or money to train me longer on every aspect of their company. She then proceeded to hug me and giving me severance pay for the next two weeks. I cried (once I got to my car) because I thought I was a failure, but looking back at it, I feel like I was totally set up to fail. 



What do ya'll think?




I would also like to add, all the Spanish speaking co-workers including the 2 bi-lingual girls were Hispanic. I was the only black, or bi-racial chick there. Only the 2 bi-lingual girls and the owner would converse with me. The Spanish speaking women would ignore me and only chat it up with the 2 bi-linguals, which is understandable, but would try to chat it up with the owner and office manager when they were around. 



tl;dr:  Only black girl/ bi-racial at new job, Weird vibes from office manager (White) and co-workers (Hispanic) and felt like I was being set up to fail."

60ya0e,7,2017-03-22,SLO vs UCI,throwaway042599,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/60ya0e/slo_vs_uci/,"I am currently choosing between schools and I am having trouble choosing. Here are some pros and cons of  **UCIrvine**:
**Pros:**  
1. Undeclared/Undecided - I originally applied as a Computer Engineering major but was put into Undeclared.  
2. Flexibility - say I don't like engineering, I could pursue something else  
3. Cheaper - While tuition is more here, I live close by and will commute after dorming the first year, cutting the cost.  
4. Comfortable with the area(Irvine)  
5. E-sports Lounge  
6.  Can Easily find an internship/job because of the growing industry in the area  
7.  Food in the area is good (personal preference)  
8. I will probably purchase a Disneyland Pass!  
9. I will get a car that my parents will pay for if I commute  
**Cons:**  
1. Irvine is too close to home, therefore making it seem like an unauthentic college experience (I think its overrated anyway)  
2. Irvine is apparently socially dead(I'm pretty much an introvert but I want to socialize and connect with more people)  
3. The school is not as well known as SLO for engineering  
4. Commuting seems like a drag because I have to live at home.   
5. I want a change of scenery and Irvine doesn't have that much new scenery since I live close by  
6. Since I am undeclared, it will take long for me to get the classes I need especially since its in computer engineering.  


Now here are some pros and cons of Cal Poly SLO:  
**Pros:**  
1. It's far enough from home  
2. New Scenery/Experience  
3. Computer Engineering Program is very good  
4. Employers from big tech firms tend to hire from SLO  
5. From what I hear, SLO is pretty sociable with a lot of parties  
6. Since I am already in my major, it won't be as hard to get my classes.  
**Cons:**  
1. If I don't like my major, it's difficult for me to switch out  
2. It is more expensive because of room and board  
3. Uncomfortable(which could be a good thing)  
4. The area around SLO doesn't have many employers since it is a college town(this is what people tell me), therefore making it difficult to get an internship during the year  
5. There isn't much to do outside of SLO besides Pismo Beach and nature  

My background: Asian male in a middle class household.  
This is one of the hardest decisions of my life and I just need some input from anyone. Thanks!  "

I frequent this sub a lot and I appreciate all that you do. I am about to graduate in May and I am trying to revamp my resume, I feel that it needs some work.

[Here is my Resume.](https://www.scribd.com/document/342752151/Resume)

My last two years of school I have really been specializing in cyber security. I currently hold a cyber security internship, but I am casting a wide net by applying to both cyber security jobs (of which there is few entry level) and software engineering jobs (a lot more entry level). I feel like I will need to build two resumes to tailor to each type of job I am applying for.

I am currently working on cleaning up my github, on which I have a couple of school projects and security tools that I wrote for my capstone.

I feel like I need to revamp the ""skills"" portion of the resume to showcase those tools once my github is up to date and documented. Also should I bother listing the freelance web development experience I have? I basically just built simple webpages and ecommerce stores for people using wordpress, etc and am really not interested in web dev.

Any tips, recommendations, and insight will be greatly appreciated.

60ytr6,73,2017-03-22,(NY) Roommate is trying to move in her boyfriend and/or not pay an agreed upon amount of rent. What are our options?,Nettubs,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/60ytr6/ny_roommate_is_trying_to_move_in_her_boyfriend/,"My boyfriend and I rent a 2 bedroom apartment with a third person. The leaseholder is my boyfriend, and the roommate and I are listed as residents. We agreed to split the rent per person living here rather than by bedroom. We are all students.  

The first issue is that my roommate sent us a message telling us (not asking) that she was planning to move her boyfriend in for the summer because he can't stay in campus housing due to not having a lease the following year. My BF and I asked about splitting rent between the 4 of us because she failed to mention it. She explained that he will split her portion (1/3) with her and that's that. We explained that we didn't find that fair because we originally agreed to split it per person and that adding a 4th person should go along with that. Her response was ""Well I'm trying to cut down on my own costs."" 

My boyfriend also has an internship this summer that is out of state, which he knew about and we all discussed before moving in. This is the second issue. The original discussion we had ended with the two of us (roommate and myself) splitting the rent in half until we finished out our lease. My boyfriend would move the lease to my name. However, she claims she never agreed to this(I believe we have it in writing somewhere). So, I suggested that with moving her boyfriend in she could ask him to just take over BF's 1/3rd if the rent, keeping her payment the same rather than making it go up. 

Her response was that she/he couldn't afford this, so I offered to split the rent per bedroom like before, allowing her to split her half with her boyfriend at her discretion. She did not want to do this either because it's not the ""cheapest option"" for her.

My boyfriend and I are wondering what we are able to do if she decides to not pay rent or attempts to move her boyfriend in without our permission. Ideally we would like to come to some sort of agreement about payment and have us all sign something in writing. This girl can be particularly vindictive and petty and we aren't sure if this will happen. Is it within our rights to evict her? If she decides not to pay my boyfriend is solely responsible. 

TLDR- Roommate can't agree on amount of rent to pay and wants to move her boyfriend in without discussing it with us. Advice? 

*Edit- clarification/rewording



Edit 2- Thank you everyone for the advice. My boyfriend and I both read this over and are actively discussing our options together, from giving her notice to move out and finding another roommate to possibly trying to break our lease and put the whole thing behind us. We are still trying to have a sit down conversation with Roommate before making any official decisions but considering she seems to be avoiding us and not coming home, it might take a while. "

The last two years of school I've been specializing in cyber security, as I personally find it very interesting.  I lead my schools cyber defense team, have competed in the USCC as well as CCDC and the ICPC.  I currently hold a cyber-security internship with a defense contractor.

However in applying for jobs I find very little cyber security entry level positions.  So far my strategy has been to cast a wider net and apply for software development jobs as well.  Don't get me wrong I love programming and have put together a suite of cyber security tools for my capstone and personal projects.  I feel like the best way for me to understand certain cyber security topics is to try to implement something related in code.  

From what I can gather it can be difficult to get that first job in cyber security, and I'm also worried that what jobs I can get would be more of an IT-role.  I'm interested more in the secure-coding side of things, as well as penetration testing (also difficult to get into I've heard).  I feel like my priority should be to land my first job after graduating, and then pursue to transfer into the job that I want.

Also I feel like my resume needs work, currently I have it set up to target cyber security jobs, but I think I need to make another that targets software development jobs.  Those that want to check it out, here it is:

https://www.scribd.com/document/342752151/Resume

Should I try to land a software dev job then transfer later into cyber security, or should I hold off until I can find the job that I want?

At the age of 31, I would be interested in transitioning to a for-profit role with more opportunity for growth. Some people have suggested that some of my skills my translate for marketing. While I think that's true, I am also worried about my ability to compete against people who already have experience in marketing for businesses. 

I have lots of experience with increasing donations and numbers of actions via email and social media, as well as with organizing large events (such as a concert with Graham Nash) and public speaking. I also have some experience managing paid interns and staff, although I'm not currently in a managerial role. 

If you are someone with experience in marketing, and perhaps experience hiring others, would you consider an experienced non-profit professional like myself for a non-entry level role? What sorts of skills or successes would you want to see from someone with a background like mine to take them seriously as a candidate?

60zdhx,1,2017-03-22,Career advice for an entry-level electrical engineer,portland_engineer,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/60zdhx/career_advice_for_an_entrylevel_electrical/,"Hi guys,

I'm a bit frustrated to say the least. I interviewed for a position at my company in the Portland area for new college graduates, which I was able to apply to since I've been with the company for a year and a half since I graduated... as a technical writer. It required an electrical engineering degree due to the nature of the company (semiconductor software), but it is still obviously not an engineering job. There were several openings for the type of engineering position I applied to, but I was initially told I couldn't apply since I already worked for the company. I found out this wasn't true, so I applied to the last opening for this year.  

Anyway, I didn't get the job. I had LTspice, Verilog, object-oriented programming, and of course EE experience. Not as directly tied to the job, I also have materials science experience, optics experience and have some graduate work done towards a masters. I even knew a guy on the team. The team works on the other side of my hallway, so the hiring manager's office is the first office I see everyday I walk in. The interview went fantastic and they spoke as if I had gotten the job. When they notified me that I wasn't hired, they said it was close but that they went with a candidate with ""deeper experience"". This position did accept master's candidates, so I'm thinking that's what happened. However, it's still really disheartening that I couldn't even get an entry level position which I was highly qualified for within my own company that I've been with for 1.5 years.

I spent 5 years in college getting an electrical engineering degree with minors in both chemistry and math. I worked 14-20 hours a week my last two years of college at an internship doing field work for the power company to support myself while in school taking 18 credit loads a term. I took additional mechanical engineering coursework, and have received a grant to work on research. I have experience working in a machine shop as well. 

I've already been told by several different engineering managers that I'm qualified and a great fit for the engineering role I've been trying to get into. The role I got turned down for was for both a technical and customer interfacing role. I prefer a role that lets me interact with people. I had two different engineering managers approach me about this 4 months into my career (although they didn't have openings). 

I'm applying to a lot of different types of electrical engineering and customer interfacing engineering roles in the semiconductor industry, but I'm afraid that being a female that's taken a technical writing position has greatly hurt my chances of being taken seriously as a candidate. 

I was looking at other people's resume's online and noticed back in 1996 you could get a computer science associates degree from a community college and get a job as a software engineer. Within a year, that guy got a job at Intel that now takes a masters/phd and 15+ years experience (I know this because I saw the same job posting today). Back then you could buy a house on that salary and not have any student loan debt. It makes me frustrated how much easier it seemed back then.

So, what advice do you have? I feel like a completely inadequate failure and I don't know what to do besides spam out more jobs and hope I get a bite. I keep my linkedin profile active and try to reach out to people that I can. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

This summer will be my final co-op term and I just received a summer internship offer for a dream position of mine. As I plan to take this offer over the other offer I have (I got this through WW), I was wondering whether I should let CECA know first, or email the other office first. 

I hope to convert the internship into a full-time offer so being banned from WW isn't really a big issue. However, since CECA is infamous for giving sh*t to people, I was wondering what the best way to deal with this situation would be. 

Thanks."

I want to go through TBS and serve in the Marine Corps after graduation for 3-4 years, then switch to reserves and work as a software engineer. Ideally, I would like to continue being a dev until the reserves need to be called in during wartime, which is why I would like to switch to reserves soon after. I've wanted to be in the military since I was a kid, but I also am very passionate about CS.

I currently have a big 4 internship lined up for the summer, so hopefully all goes well this summer so I can get a return offer. Does anyone know if I could defer full-time until after TBS? Also, would my CS career prospects be severely affected?"
60zk1d,2,2017-03-22,Career pathways for nuclear engineering student (United States),human08425,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/60zk1d/career_pathways_for_nuclear_engineering_student/,"I will graduate with a BS in nuclear engineering from UW-Madison next spring with a minor in nuclear materials and a minor in math.  I am considering many options for my future career path based on my education, job market in engineering and trade skill sectors, and preferred working hours.

On a previous co-op/internship (8 month) I had worked with reactor core engineers for an electric utility and was given some of their responsibilities.  I mostly stared at spreadsheets and tested nuclear core software, and I  left work most days feeling unsatisfied with my progress and having a strong distaste for office work, despite doing excellent work in improving and automating data processing and documentation.  This has shown me that my desires rest in more active and social work.  I’m not sure if other engineers share the same notion.  I have also learned that I do not have a need for the salary that engineers earn, I’m not opposed to it, but earning $20/hour in a 40 hour week was far beyond what I spent in the internship, and I saved up over half of my earnings over my 8 months.  

From all that I’ve learned about how and where I should work, I know that the most satisfying work is from skilled trades.  My philosophy intervenes here, being a utilitarian, and I end up arguing myself to work for some greater good of humanity, that being creating and promoting clean energy sources.  If the industry is saturated with engineers (which I feel it is), shouldn’t I step aside and let someone who would happily look at spreadsheets do the work instead?  Without making my mind up on how or if I should solve nuclear problems, I feel that I’m standing on thin ice on a foggy night.

Note that I use very few modern amenities and am quite happy this way, I can survive on poverty level wages by cooking and repairing things myself (my friends call me amish).  I’d like to live in a town or very small city and would be happy working any job that comes my way.  I enjoy welding and other trades, but have never gone beyond casual under the counter work so I could not be considered professional.  

The career options that I am considering are below:

1. Graduate with BS, find entry level nuclear engineering job at utility or national lab

2. Graduate with BS, find ANY job at utility or national lab

3. Graduate with BS, find job or apprenticeship in trade skill like welding or carpentry

4. Don’t graduate, find ANY job at utility or national lab

5. Don’t graduate, find job or apprenticeship in trade skill like welding or carpentry

6. Transfer to trade school, find career in skilled trade

7. Graduate with BS, apply for graduate studies in welding metallurgy or nuclear materials science


Here is a general overview of my skills.

– Computer (c++, matlab, latex, maple, bash/zsh, linux, CAD, vis basic, general IT knowledge)

– Trades (light MIG/TIG welding for 2 years, some automotive, some woodworking, private pilot license)

– Communication (I believe that my communication is clear and concise, solid presentation skills)

– Given my time with other students in the nuclear engineering program,  I think that I am exactly average on problem solving intuition and general aptitude of nuclear physics.

I have the following concerns which should be criticized:

1. The market for nuclear engineers is declining (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm)  and the 20+ schools that offer a nuclear program and prior engineers should be more than enough to fill the need for nukes.

2. Very few plants will come online in the next decade, potentially only 2.

3. National labs will only hire nukes with Ph.D's or MD's with much experience.  My expected graduating GPA (~3.1) will put me out of preference for graduate school, and I would prefer to avoid grad school.

TL;DR  -  I feel that although the nuclear industry is very important, and I will always advocate for nuclear power, my career prospects might be limited and I may not lead a happy life with a career as an engineer for the same reasons I would not enjoy life in any office job.  I am almost done with college, and feel that it would have been wasted if I went off to become a welder or any other tradesman.  I will be happy with any wage above ~$12/hour, especially if I live in a small town.  Choose my career pathway."
60zqd1,0,2017-03-23,Anyone here works for a start-up in NYC as a part-time web/iOS developer? Average market price?,zombo29,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/60zqd1/anyone_here_works_for_a_startup_in_nyc_as_a/,"I'm about to discuss my new salary(I'm switching from 40 hours per week intern to 20 hours per week employee) with my boss next week but I can't find average market price for a part-time web/iOS developer since most salary data I can find  are for full-time positions and some of them are not in NYC. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since in NYC, many start-ups offer no salary for interns which is like crazy illegal in Minnesota where I come from. I used to get $22/hour working as an intern in Rochester, MN.  But here almost all start-ups offer no salary for interns.........so I assume the new price I'm going to get will be very low. 

&amp;nbsp;

But I don't know how low that would be and I do need a bottom line reference since I will quit if my boss tries to de-valuate me. This morning I heard a smaller company offers an iOS guy $5 per hour.........which makes me super uncomfortable. I don't know what's happeing to this field, really. Bubble bursting? 

&amp;nbsp;

So does anyone know what's the average market price for a part-time web/iOS developer in NYC start-ups? Thank you!

&amp;nbsp;

PS: I have about 6 months experience and a BS in CS from a decent state-university. I'm 100% sure that my boss likes me a lot and I get along with my colleges. It's a 15-employee start-up company. "

I am a first-year student at the University of Chicago. I want to be an entrepreneur and stalk this page pretty often. I had to split off emotionally from my parents for many reasons (they can't get their shit together), so I finally put my foot down and said hey I'm living in Chicago over the summer. 

I've been trying my best to apply to internships and such to really strengthen my resume, but have had no luck. I'm paying for college alone and taking out loans, so I've been getting kind of desperate. All of a sudden, at a frat party, two MBA professors walk in. I think to myself, damn this is my time to shine. My biggest talent is networking, I can make friends with anyone. So I go up, we talk, I mention my interest in being an entrepreneur. One guy gives me his card, then I set up a pong game for them! I emailed him two weeks later and I have a meeting with him this Tuesday to talk about internship opportunities over the summer.

I am so fucking happy, man. Wish me luck.

Edit: I'm a computer science and economics double-major. Really into coding and trying to learn how to freelance right now."

610bad,1,2017-03-23,FC St. Pauli: Neuer Job für Ewald Lienen?,betamax65,fcsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcsp/comments/610bad/fc_st_pauli_neuer_job_für_ewald_lienen/,"[](http://ift.tt/2etfvjl)Könnte zum Sportdirekor aufsteigen: Ewald Lienen © Imago

Nach nur sechs Punkten aus den ersten 14 Spielen stieß es bei nicht wenigen Beobachtern auf Unverständnis, dass der FC St. Pauli dennoch weiterhin an Trainer Ewald Lienen festhielt. Elf Spiele und 19 Punkte später hat sich dieses Vertrauen aber bezahlt gemacht, wenngleich sich die Kiez-Kicker nach wie vor in einer bedrohlichen Lage befinden.

Bis zum Ende der Saison dürfte Lienens Position nach dem Aufschwung der letzten Monate aber nun nicht mehr in Frage gestellt werden. **Danach aber offenbar sehr wohl, denn nach Informationen der [Bild](http://ift.tt/2noD5Sp) soll es intern Zweifel daran geben, dass der 63 Jahre alte Fußball-Lehrer mit der Mannschaft mittel- bis langfristig eine nachhaltige Spielidee entwickeln kann.**

### Rettig will Interimsjob wieder abgeben

Deshalb sind anscheinend Planspiele vorhanden, Lienen nach dieser Saison zum Sportdirektor zu machen, worüber schon [vor Weihnachten](http://ift.tt/2hYPffw) spekuliert worden ist. Vorstellbar wäre ein solcher Jobwechsel aus mehreren Gründen durchaus. Zum einen will der seit der Trennung von Thomas Meggle interimsweise auch als Sportdirektor tätige Andreas Rettig künftig wieder nur als Geschäftsleiter tätig sein, womit der Posten vakant wäre.

Und zum anderen ist mit Olaf Janßen bereits ein potentieller neuer Cheftrainer im Klub. Der im Herbst als zusätzlicher Assistent verpflichtete Janßen hat Beobachtern zufolge großen Anteil am sportlichen Aufschwung und wäre als Nachfolger vorstellbar.

**Den noch bis 2018 unter Vertrag stehenden Lienen zu entlassen, ist angesichts von dessen Verdiensten äußerst unwahrscheinlich. Ein Wechsel auf den Posten des Sportdirektors wäre für alle Beteiligten jedenfalls die eleganteste Lösung.**

Gewinnt St. Pauli in Aue? [Jetzt wetten!](http://ift.tt/2nfvCEU)

610bnb,4,2017-03-23,29/F at crossroads: More School or Code Camp?,foo_bar_wug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/610bnb/29f_at_crossroads_more_school_or_code_camp/,"I would appreciate any feedback I can get here. I am a 29 year old Female that just finished a masters in Linguistics. I have spent the last year taking pre-req courses as a second degree student in CS at my state university as well as a few CS courses (3 Ruby on Rails courses, SQL &amp; Intro-CS). I started an internship at HP a week ago so it's too soon to judge my impressions there.

I am here because I am not sure what I should pursue and would like some advice. I have three routes I can take:

1) I can study next year taking linear algebra, prob/stats, intro CS 2, data structures, and systems programming, as well as continue the undergraduate research I am doing in NLP. Then go into the Masters program (2 more years) focusing on NLP. Seems like a natural pairing with the Linguistics but I am not sure if I can cut it. I am interested in NLP and ML in general but a little worried that the meat of it will chase me off. I am simply not the type of person to eat, breath, and sleep this stuff, which isn't to say I wouldn't work my ass off, I just won't go reading about it every time I have a spare minute. I believe in work-life balance and don't plan to be someone who is completely consumed by their work. I have other interests. (3 more years of school)

2) I forget about NLP and just get another undergraduate degree in CS. I find this particular track the least appealing but maybe it is necessary. (3 more years of school)

3) I really enjoyed the Ruby to Rails certification that I did, which made me consider if I should just round out my web dev with some extra javascript, angular, and even the C# &amp; .NET stuff offered through my local Code Camp and call it a day. 3 more months of training and I am ready for a job. I am a little antsy to get into the work force since I have been at uni for 8 years now.

Basically, I am tired of being a poor college student, I am almost 30 years old, and I am not sure if I can be successful in NLP without giving up everything else I enjoy in life. Any advice about going with a particular route would be appreciated. "

610hxq,1,2017-03-23,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/610hxq/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I actually went and got a degree in college so I could apply and hopefully get into the headquarters of the company. I worked hard for a 3.5 (hard for me) and made sure to get at least 3 internships under my belt before graduating. 

When I graduated, I applied for a research position in the company, which I was almost perfectly qualified for. It was an entry level position doing work that I had done before. The interview process took nearly a month, and it was down to 2 candidates out of 50. I went into the final interview and had a great time meeting everyone that worked at HQ, and I thought I crushed the interview. Well, apparently I wasn't quite good enough, because I just didn't get the job (recruiting manager said it was basically a flip of a coin). 

So I didn't get the job, and that's ok. I can try again when I have more experience. That was my mindset until word got out that the winning candidate was a guy I worked with at the company in my younger years. This guy worked in the same sector as me in high school, but switched to a different one in college when I stayed on the path that would lead me to my dream job. He never took anything seriously and always fucked around. I hadnt heard about him until I heard he just got a job at the same company and location I was applying to. In the same sector too. 

This guy didn't even finish his 4 year degree, which was a requirement of the job. All I know is that his uncle is a higher up scientist there, and that may have helped him get the position. 

I feel like such a fucking wimp writing this out, but it just sucks losing to someone you know deep down you shouldn't have. Totally disappointing too because the job is 2 hours away from where my parents live, right next to where my S/O lives. It would have worked out perfectly if I would have gotten that FUCKING JOB. So now Im at home applying for more jobs, money is running out, and I just feel fucked. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR: I feel that I got fucked out of a job that I shouldn't have because a guy knew someone on the inside I didn't."

I am nearly 29 years old. I graduated with associates of arts and then a bachelors of business administration - finance. I chased money with finance and was never reeaaaaally interested in the type of work which led me never to pursue a job or internships in finance.

The last few years I've been in sales, but I never really enjoyed it even though money was ok. I've always been interested in software development but I felt the need to chase what i believed would net me the most money, so I never have gotten more into it than a few college courses

Going home grumpy everyday because I hated my job really wore me down and caused me to, understandably, lose some relationships. I decided I wasn't going to live my life doing something I wasn't happy and fulfilled doing.

Which leads me to now. I'm struggling on what best option is to begin a career in Software Dev. I posted in a few other subs and got some decent feedback.

Most of what I got was to forego more traditional schooling. I still have old student loans I am paying off and don't want to get into too much more debt, but I am willing to work multiple jobs and go to school if need be.

I guess my question is where should I begin? I have been looking at some ""bootcamp"" style options such as bloc.io and the Firehose Project and was wondering if anyone has experience with those and if they would be good for someone like me struggling for direction on how to start.

Firehouse seems shorter, but much more affordable. 

Any advice on these or if I should be looking elsewhere would be incredibly helpful. I'm tired of chasing my own tail around!"

I've posted here a few times before and gotten some responses that seemed more targeted for people recently out of college or looking for internships. I have 7-8 years of working experience. Unfortunately a lot of that was in a city in the Midwest at not great companies doing mostly web development, so I'm a bit behind. I have good reasons for it -- shitty job market, was in a relationship, etc. -- and I now work for a fairly successful startup in my home city, but I'm looking to leave to a better job market where I have more options. I'd like to move into a mid-level backend engineering role, somewhere with room to grow. My current company has little career advancement opportunities and I haven't found anything else very appealing in the area.

I've been studying for a year or so now and interviewing here and there to get practice but I wanted to see if anyone had been through a similar experience. What did you do to convince recruiters you were worth it? Did you do anything besides practicing coding problems to prepare?

612fj9,189,2017-03-23,"One of my coworkers tried using The Red Pill on me, here's my field report",r0sied0nut,TheBluePill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/612fj9/one_of_my_coworkers_tried_using_the_red_pill_on/,"At work, I have a few friends that I hang out with at the occasional work function. I'm better friends with some of these people more than others due to frequency of interaction for my job function. One of the people that used to be in this group for reasons I will describe in this rant, Douche, thought it would be a good idea to use Red Pill seduction tactics on me. I didn't have too much interaction with Douche but I met him due to my proximity of my desk to one of his bros and only occasionally had to interact with him for work-related matters. He eventually meandered his way over to my desk and would ""neg"" and sometimes insult me with classic lines such as: ""Since I helped you with (simple work related task) you should buy me food. I care too much about my girlfriend to make her pay for my stuff. I don't care about you."" I actually thought he was socially awkward and had difficulty interacting with women so whenever my coworkers would act annoyed with him, I would actually defend him a bit: ""He's not that bad, he's just socially awkward and wants to make friends."" He proceeded to stop at my desk almost daily for a few weeks to make small talk but he never got anywhere and eventually he gave up. A few months later, he gets upset with me since I'm talking a bit too much with one of our other coworkers and angrily asked why I was so uncomfortable with him. He and his girlfriend break up (lol) and he makes one or two feeble attempts to neg me via work chat, when he and his girlfriend eventually got back together I resort to replying her name whenever he initiates conversation. A few months pass, he stops being rude and I assume things with his girlfriend had become less turbulent. We make small talk and our interactions can be described as cordial. Almost a year later at our company's Christmas party, my friend (someone I trust and talk to on a daily basis) is going to give me a ride home since I drank more than anticipated and Douche insists giving me a ride home instead so my friend wouldn't miss an after party. My friend sees I'm uncomfortable but since we're all friends we both capitulate and let Douche give me a ride home. Douche points out some of my insecurities and since I'm drunk I get more worked up than I normally do. He then proceeds to ask me really detailed and incredibly uncomfortable questions about my sex life (that I largely do not answer) and calls my boyfriend a beta. When it becomes clear that his ""seduction"" is not working as intended, he proceeds to discuss at great length his sex life with his girlfriend. He kept referring to himself as the ""alpha male"" and explained that he and his girlfriend have had multiple discussions and decided that since he was the ""alpha"" she was the ""beta"" despite the fact that she outearns him and has to be an ""alpha"" in the workforce. He then brought up things that totally didn't bother him about his girlfriend, such as the fact that she's had sex with 19 guys and he was only in the single digits. While he is doing all of this, he forgets that his phone is synced to his car and is reading texts from his girlfriend. She's sad he's ignoring him and has sent him a long text message. We arrive at my house and he basically calls me a fat gold digger. I leave, block him on all social media and do not speak to him at work. The End. 

For those of you wondering: ""Well how did you know he's swallowed The Red Pill?"" 
- he's into lifting
- frequently used the terms ""alpha male"", beta and ""all women are the same and want ___""
- tried negging me and asking me to buy him crap
- said I was with my boyfriend because he's wealthier than me (honestly doesn't take much, I'm 1-2 rungs above an intern at the company we work at)
- used a similar term to ""hypergamy"" 
- said something along the lines of: ""all girls really want is someone dominant in bed"" O.o
- ignores significant other and instilling ""dread"" in her so she's constantly afraid of him leaving her

I felt like this was a good place to rant. I have to see this clown on a daily basis and it annoys the living hell out of me that he keeps getting promoted and is super boastful about it. I hate him for obvious reasons. Any tips on how to ignore this human garbage? "

My boss is out of town and sent me an email asking me to push along a project while he's gone.

I went to a coworker and inquired about the status of a few things, and when he asked me why, I explained our boss's request of me.

His response?

""Ugh, that's just stupid [boss] would ask you to do that. No one is going to listen to you!""

I'm buddies with this guy and I don't believe he meant it to be rude (even though it was!!), and I wasn't even offended at the time because it struck me as being so incredibly true. 

Of course, this is just one story out of many. I'm treated like a glorified intern, and few of my male coworkers respect me. They're all huge assholes whereas I am a team player and very kind. I'm well-liked, but not respected as an equal. I'm getting so tired of working in this field."

Should I Stay?,floridaguy25,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/612xw2/trouble_keeping_talent_in_government_should_i_stay/,"I work within the federal government in R&amp;D, and we recently lost our intern (BS Mech, pursuing MS Mech) after 2 years to the private sector.

Our offices manage different projects within DoD. It can be very hands-on -- we work closely with different companies who develop the technologies we request, and a lot of the products are really cool.

But, we're also project managers, and there's a mountain of paperwork that always needs done. Very often, more time is spent on paperwork than real engineering activities. And given the seniority of other engineers on our team who dislike paperwork, our intern found himself constantly dealing with documentation since they were more than happy to delegate.

I think this is one of the primary reasons we lost him. He's just starting his career, and he needs to be developing his skill sets. As a mechanical engineer, he wants to do more design work and other hands-on tasks. I wish we could have provided that opportunity, but the day-to-day emails, forms, and bureaucracy kept getting in the way of true engineering.

I completely understand his situation, because I used to be the intern before I was promoted. But, after spending time training him how to do the engineering and the paperwork, only to see him jump ship, I'm wondering whether I should jump ship too.

*****

I'm also just starting my career (BS and MS Industrial Eng, under age 30). But with the serious lack of young people in the government, somehow I skipped the work that junior engineers typically do and catapulted into project management, research, and publishing in scientific journals. There's a big need for it, and the government has trouble recruiting and keeping talent.

I'm afraid I did this too quickly though, and I'm afraid if I try to make the leap back into the private sector, my skill set won't match what those companies are looking for for someone my age. I think our intern felt the same way.

On the other hand though, a significant portion of the federal workforce is retiring in the next 5-10 years, including half of my team, which means there might be significant upward mobility.

I'm not sure what I should do. I'd really appreciate any advice!

TLDR:

BSIE/MSIE under age 30 weighing whether to keep a bureaucratic government engineering job with strong likelihood of promotion...

or

... jump ship and go to industry (after seeing my junior engineer do the same thing) before it's too late to develop stronger engineering skills."

I was picked up by a large international Project Management Consultancy / General Contractor (GC) company in London, UK where I spent a year working on a massive government demo/fit-out project. During that project I spent most of my time meeting with the GC, design team and client playing the role of design manager as well as project manager to ensure everything was getting done on time and the design was fully coordinated. 


About a year later I was informed that I would be moving to Chicago for a project that was starting over there. The project I am now on is more of a facilities management type job. I am managing extremely minor maintenance works all over the country and essentially managing a GC who is doing all the ground work himself. 


Given my background and what excites me my goal is to get out of this ASAP, though i'm struggling to figure out what type of role this would be. I've made a list of the things I enjoy and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction:


1. I enjoy spending time on site reviewing work and talking with different trades, contractors, the client, architect, engineers, etc.

2. I enjoy the technical aspects of construction, including site logistics, innovative construction techniques and doing some problem solving to figure out how to do the best job at the lowest cost possible

3. I'd prefer to be a large part of a small project rather than just a tiny part of a massive project 

Given this, please let me know what types of jobs I should be applying for (Project Manager for a GC? Developer? etc.)

Thanks Reddit!!!

TL;DR - Based on the 3 points above, help me figure out what types of jobs I should be applying to!"

First thing first, we are in the same college, but I am one year above her. She have 2 months left in our current city, then she will move to another city for an internship. I will have finish this year's studies in a month, and then I will have an internship in another country (but close to where she is, like 6 hours by car). Next year, we are both going in exchange in two different continents.


The first time that we both kissed was during the integration of new students in September, then we kissed another time in October during a party. Flash forward six months, and since a few weeks we have been talking to each a bit more (before that we would just ignore each others). Then we saw each others during the college bal.

I don't know for sure if she is in love with me, but since 2 - 3 weeks, since the bal, I am kind of sure that I am in love with her. Last weekend, we went, with all of our promo (basically my class plus her class) to a week end together, in order to ski. Each night, we had a party, and during both night she came toward me to dance with me, talk and cuddle. I did not kissed her the first night, since I had the mentality that I have only 1 month left in college. But the second night, we kissed, and since we kiss each other only when we are both drunk, I propose her to see each other outside of college during the week. I propose her yesterday to eat at a restaurant during the week, and she politely declined since we only have one month left here, and it's not worth it.

During the night, I went to a party where she was too, and I just wanted to go and see her, but I did not. Instead I told to few of my friends that I was in love with her, and one of our common friend went to ask her why she would not date me, and she repeated the reason.

Also, she never date anyone and more than one people told me that she might be afraid to date someone, thus making the possibility of us dating impossible. 

What should be my next move ? Should I just let her go, and try one last time ? We are going, with all of our promo, in a weekend together in 2 weeks. I am afraid of being a little too pushy.

Thanks all for your advices ;)

TL;DR: We do not date each other because we only have a month left together"

IBM would allow me to work on Watson, which is something I'm very interested in doing. But I'd make almost no money this summer.

I am expecting the offer from the company I interviewed with to originally come in around 15-20k less than the offer from my current company. I'm sort of tight on time with a deadline. My company has already waited over a week so (through a communication mixup I didn't get the offer letter until Tuesday though) I'd like to let them know by Friday. Is it appropriate to call my recruiter and let her know about the offer and sort of flat out tell her that if I get an offer for less than ""X"" I probably wouldn't feel comfortable accepting? I'd honestly be okay with even an offer 10k less than my current one but I don't want to be rude by basically saying ""pay me this or I won't accept"".

I'm basing my expectations on their glassdoor salaries and also her reaction when I originally told her a number I was expecting and it sounded like it was too high. I'd basically be telling her that that would be the minimum I would be willing to accept (which would be 10k less than my current offer).

Is that... Fine? Idk. I just don't want to be crazily rude but I also don't want to waste time on a negotiation that is almost guaranteed to happen. I'd rather they just know what they need to offer."

I'm about to finish up my second year at a small state university majoring in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Software Development. I know that my major immediately puts me lower in the applicant pile for potential jobs/internships so I've been doing personal projects to make up for the lack of an actual Computer Science degree.

I've found that I enjoy Android Development the most so all of my personal projects on GitHub are android apps. I like to think that I know android development to an intermediate level (my personal projects have used REST and Firebase integration with a material design UI).

My main concern is padding my portfolio enough to make me an attractive applicant for internships in Summer 2018 which will also pave the way to a junior developer job after graduation.
Would it be worth it to go through the process of getting an [Android Developer Certification](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/) as well as continuing to develop personal projects in my free time? The certification costs $150 but it would be worth it to me if it helps pad my portfolio enough.

Thanks!"
613qq1,1,2017-03-23,"Inappropriate use of lol, hehe, ha ha, giggle.",maythefoxbwu,Rants,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/613qq1/inappropriate_use_of_lol_hehe_ha_ha_giggle/,"Am I the only person who is really irritated when people signal in writing that they are laughing or giggling about things they should not be? 

Last night I was reading a medical forum where people post for advice and talk about their clinics or medical experiences. 

Somebody asked whether a procedure to insert a needle into their ovaries at a particular clinic requires anesthesia. A woman responded, "" I just spoke to X today and he said no way to puncturing ovaries without anesthesia hehe.""  

Why is this a ""hehe"" matter? Nothing about going through fertility treatment is ""hehe"" including the procedures or the anesthesia. 

The ""hehe"" here also indicates to me some sort of agreement that you can't do this procedure without having anesthesia, which I know is not true. I have had my ovaries ""punctured"" more than once without using anesthesia. I switched clinics specifically because the clinic I had intended to use refused to do it without anesthesia so I found one that allowed the patient to choose. 

I also don't find anesthesia to be a hehe matter. Death is a risk of anesthesia. I had a close relative killed by the anesthesiologist. Her daughters sued for medical malpractice and won so it is not just my opinion that the anesthesia killed her. 

I think many medical procedures overly require the use of anesthesia when it is really not necessary. That is not a light matter. If a patient really wants it and has a low pain threshold, ok, that is their choice. But it should not be forced on patients when not medically necessary in my opinion. Some procedures really require it to lower the heart rate or to ensure the patient does not move or because it is truly too painful to do otherwise. However, in many cases, it is just used as a matter of course out of habit of the doctor/hospital or because the surgeon is too ham fisted or so the patient is kept in the dark about what is going on (for example, hospitals and surgeons often let interns operate on patients--those patients might have something to say about that if they were awake and could hear an intern basically learning on them).

When I was awake during my procedure I actually helped because I was able to hold one of my ovaries in position for the doctor. That meant they did not have to call help into the room as there are only three other people in there with me all of whom are busy doing something during the procedure. I have also had very short but informative discussions with the doctor during times when it was possible. It also meant for them that they could schedule more patients because the procedure without anesthesia is much faster for them. I was able to leave almost immediately so I did not take up an extra bed longer than the required 10 minutes to make sure I was not bleeding a lot.

Not using anesthesia meant I saved $500. I avoided the awful hours or couple days of nausea I get from anesthesia. And I avoided the risks from anesthesia which include death as well as possible onset of Alzheimer's or memory loss or other changes to the brain that sometimes occur with its use, especially repeated use, as documented in studies I have read.

I think a patient should have access to anesthesia if they can't take the pain. But I also think a patient should have the right to say no in reasonable circumstances. We should have some say over what happens medically to our bodies within reason. Why is that a laughing matter? 

A related annoyance is the use of cutesie terms on that forum. Embies (embryo), frosties (frozen embryo), BD or babydancing (sex)...It seems extraordinarily immature as if I am reading posts by junior high schoolers. 

It is a very serious subject that involves a lot of effort, emotional trials, physical pain, and often an extraordinary financial sacrifice that all many times ends up in failure. Why don't these people stop using childish language when they are discussing these matters?

Adding to all that is the cliqueness (don't know how to spell that) on there and the hero worship of some of the posters by the majority of others. There is one lady on there who I can see is telling untruths on a regular basis but she is treated like some sort of expert and dignitary. She claims that lots of women in her family do not start menopause until their ""middle sixties"". Um, really? Why aren't they in a medical journal because I think the oldest I have ever heard of is 62 and usually the latest for 99.9% of people is like 55. She says at 53 she has the fertility of a 33 year old and yet she has been doing fertility treatment for years and trying to have a baby with her 17 years younger husband for 10 years. Despite the number of inconsistencies in this lady's posts, all the women there grovel to her with thank you's and asking her medical questions.

I don't post anything on there. I don't correct any of the misinformation because it is pointless I have found. Ms. Know-it-all will just attack because she wants it to be just her with information and everybody else hanging on her every word. Her band of followers join in on attacking so I read and use common sense to try to glean whatever useful information might be posted on there. It is like a weird cult of stupid women. It makes me wonder if there are others like me not posting information on there for the same reasons so it might limit the helpfulness of the forum.

Thanks for reading. After weeks of reading this garbage on there, I just wanted to vent. (If you are wondering why I am still reading there, it is because between all the misinformation, there is some truth coming out about this experimental procedure in these women's posts so I am trying to evaluate whether it will produce any successful results for anybody. So far not but I am continuing to follow to see if more time is required since many of them have just started doing it and it takes months sometimes for a positive outcome to be seen. In the meantime, I have to wade through these women's moronic posts.)

# Title

&gt; [REQ] ($1100) - (#Los Angeles, CA, USA), ($1200, 6 monthly payments of $200 starting April 1, 2017), (PayPal)

# Post contents

Hi Lenders, this is my first time borrowing, but it's an emergency so...here goes. I'm currently interning as a data manager for almost 2 months, paid monthly around the 20th-27th. This internship will become a full-time job around May, as discussed with my boss recently and signed in contract in the beginning.

With my first payday and some cash I had saved up previously, I bought myself my first car, paid other bills, and paid some of my school fees. Now, my car note of $550 is due in 3 days (March 24, 2017), and by mid-April, I have more bills to be paid. So this loan will be stashed to the side as security money for my car notes, since this is my most important asset. I have a new credit card with a $300 credit limit that I use for food and emergencies. Because of the credit card search, new car, and new phone service, I have too many hard inquiries on my credit report, so I've been denied by other loans I've applied for. My credit score was good before these hits, but now it's a high-average. It will rebound soon.

My monthly check for my internship is only $500 (better than unpaid, and this will pay off in the long run), so I've estimated that by my next payday later this week, and by my following payday in late April, I'd have $1,000. Subtracting my two monthly loan repayments of $200 leaves me with $600. This is enough for the month following, but by then I will be full-time and no longer paid monthly, so I won't have to worry about being late on any more payments. 

If $1100 is too much to invest, are any lenders willing to go half-and-half? In the long run, I'd like to establish relationship(s).

613yj7,2,2017-03-23,A sincere thank you,lonelyemoburrito,SourceFed,https://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/613yj7/a_sincere_thank_you/,"From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you. Over the last 5 years Sourcefed has been a consistent source of happiness and I’m so glad I got to experience it in real time. 

I was on board with SF from the beginning when the channel started and the best part of my day was when I got back from school and would watch the 20 minutes or less videos. Over the last five years, a lot has changed for me personally. When SF started, I was a freshman in high school. Since then I have had my first kiss, learned to drive, lost a grandparent, got a job, graduated high school, and got accepted into college, and SF has been there through it all. When I first went off to college, I was so homesick and lonely in a new city and I swear all I did was rewatch sf vids and laugh at table talks. 

As I grew up, so did the channel. Starting from nothing, the audience came out grew and became a community,  coming out strong and voting Lee on the Maxim hot 100 list for 2012. 
So many video series started, moved, ended, came back from the dead, and evolved. New channels like SourceFedNerd and Super Panic Frenzy and People Be Like and Nuclear Family started and grew and evolved. Forhumanpeoples grew  and grew and changed buildings. Phil sold the company and it changed hands after that. When the channels grew and grew and SF and SFN hit 1 million. There have been so many conventions and two rounds of election coverage. Then of course there’s the hours of entertainment from all the comment commentary, bloopers, behind the scenes, podcasts, and table talk episodes.

Sourcefed has seen people get divorced, start new relationships, and get married. We’ve seen families grow and kids that have grown up. We’ve seen literal strangers turn into friends before our eyes. Hairstyles changed, as did hair colors, with the occasional weird facial hair. We’ve seen people come and go both in front of the camera and behind the scenes. There’s been interns that grow into hosts, as hosts join the cast, while other hosts move on. We’ve seen the great things the people who work at Sourcefed do, like having their own stand up specials, or great personal channels and podcasts, or appearing on other channels. Sourcefed has had so many guest stars, so many burps and farts, so many great bits and inside jokes, and so many great videos. 

I want to everyone who ever worked at Sourcefed, past and present, the hosts, crew, producers, editors, assistants, and everyone else behind the scenes, thank you. I have enjoyed every minute, and am so sincerely grateful and glad that I got to enjoy all the content you worked so hard on. Thank you for the numerous hours of entertainment and laughs you have given me, and thank you for bringing joy to my life daily for the last five years.

Anyone else staying?,fancyprosestyle21,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/6140u0/things_to_do_on_campus_over_the_summer_anyone/,"Hey guys! I'm a freshman in CompE who is officially staying on campus for an internship at Research Park this summer. I'll be working 9-5 but I was wondering what other cool things I could do? Are there any popular events or activities in Chambana over the summer? I don't have a car, and I'll be able to get into bars but I don't drink :(

I don't really have any other friends staying since they're all freshman and most didn't apply to internships or anything here... So the second part of my post is, if you're staying over the summer and wanna hang out, hmu! I'm always down for an adventure. (I'm a girl if it matters but I'm only looking for friends lol)

6142ck,26,2017-03-23,"Me [25 F] with my controlling parents [49 M&amp;F], who are angry at me on a weekly basis for not visiting them more",throwaway299365,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6142ck/me_25_f_with_my_controlling_parents_49_mf_who_are/,"A short cultural background that's important to note: my family is from a Eastern European background but I have lived in the U.S. since I was very little. The culture that my parents were raised in was very traditional and not individualistic.

I'm now in graduate school studying for a Ph.D. (as my parents had always wanted me to do, since they highly value education). I'm almost done and all that's left is writing up a last paper and then finishing my dissertation. This means that I am extremely busy most days of the week because my advisor expects a lot from me and I am also trying to learn a lot of additional skills because I want to go into industry and my doctoral work is simply not enough to get a ""real-world"" job. I have also picked up additional work on-campus that helps pay the bills. With this, I have virtually no free time because I get up early and spend all day doing research, teaching classes, doing extra work, learning more skills with free online courses, and applying to jobs and internships.

Despite all this, I typically try very hard to visit my parents (who live about a half-hour to 45 minutes away) at least once a week (for either a half or full day) and spend time with them and my brother [6M]. I also try to text or call on a daily basis asking them how they're doing. However, almost each time I show up there or call is met with anger that I am not prioritizing them. They tell me that my brother misses me and keeps asking when I'm going to be coming home to visit. They keep emphasizing how disappointed they are with me becoming too ""Americanized"" and how this is not how they raised me and how I've never done anything for them and am being extremely selfish (this is a word they love to throw around constantly to describe me).

A bit more background information: I was not given the option to move out for college. I commuted from home ONLY for my courses and no additional work or social activities. The reason for this was that they expected me to help care for my brother who was born when I was in college. I babysat a great deal (despite my mom being a stay-at-home-mom), cooked dinner for them, helped my mom take him to the playground, and watched him in the very early mornings so they could sleep in. I only had time to do my homework after my brother went to bed (very late, around 9-10pm). I really wanted to go to grad school so all the time that I wasn't with my brother, I was working really hard on my school work and extra research. Due to this, I have absolutely no friends from college and essentially missed out on the whole college ""experience"".

Sure, I'm not perfect and honestly I'm very relieved at having a bit of a break from childcare because I have since moved out and don't have to babysit on a daily basis. This makes me feel incredibly guilty anytime they call me and either yell at me or passively-aggressively tell me that clearly I only care about myself and they don't want to see that selfish person anyway. They refuse to hire babysitters because they're ""strangers"", so anytime they need to go somewhere, they call me and tell (not ask) me that they need me to babysit soon.

Reddit, what do I do? I have gone to therapy because I truly believed that I WAS being extremely selfish and needed help but the therapist (being American and not from a more traditional culture) thought I was a perfectly reasonable person who just wants to be an independent adult. She suggested I go to therapy with my parents but that's not an option because they have a huge stigma against that. I don't want to cut them out because my little brother doesn't deserve that since he did nothing wrong. But any effort at a compromise has not worked. I have tried to agree on a weekly time that we can spend together and do stuff but they get very offended at that suggestion because they think that family matters should not require a schedule. I tried to express that my work is very demanding but they still treat me like I'm a schoolgirl and ask me to put off my ""homework"". I have tried doing that and pulling all-nighters after I visit them multiple times a week but that makes my research advisor upset with me because my work is not up to par and it doesn't even solve my problem because it's still not enough for my parents! What is there left for me to try? I feel horribly guilty every time I call them and my mom puts my brother on the phone and has him ask me to visit them.

Thanks for any suggestions.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Controlling parents demand that I (a very busy grad student) put aside all my work and duties to spend time at their house multiple days a week. I've tried really hard to do this but it makes me behind on my work and they're still upset with me for not doing it more often. Looking for any suggestions at compromises so that I don't have to cut them out but also can live my own life and finish all my work on time."
6144eq,75,2017-03-23,I hate how the mistakes I made at 16 are holding me back at 21.,PM_ME_YOUR_HANDCUFFS,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6144eq/i_hate_how_the_mistakes_i_made_at_16_are_holding/,"Back when I was in high school, I was a total hooligan. I skipped school frequently, got suspended, barely graduated with a 1.8 GPA, and so on. 

I joined the Navy out of high school and that straightened me out. Served a little over a year before getting out for medical reasons. 

Got home and worked a few different jobs before I decided I should use my GI bill. I recently started and my grades are 1000x times better than they were in high school. 

I've always wanted to get into law enforcement so I applied for an internship at my local sheriffs office. I powered through the interviews and quickly moved to the background check. 

After weeks of waiting my background investigator told me that my background is complete and has been submitted for evaluation. He warned me that I probably won't get the position due to my high school history. 

There's a still a chance I could be accepted but based on the wording, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get denied. It's really disheartening because who I was 5 years ago is completely different from who I am now. 

That internship would've opened so many doors for me. So far 2017 has not been a good year for me. My girlfriend left me, I've started to run into financial troubles, I had to quit a job I really enjoyed due to internal issues, and now this. 

I have two interviews for my state Department of Corrections next week and after this blow, part of me doesn't even want to bother trying. If I can't even get accepted for an internship, why would I be accepted for a position as a Correctional Officer? 

I try to be optimistic and keep a positive attitude but it's hard when I keep getting knocked down. It's time like this I sometimes wish I'd have someone swerve into my lane and hit me during my drive home. 

I'm sure these feelings will pass but I just wanted to get this off my chest. These are things I would've talked to my ex about but she's gone.

6147ya,4,2017-03-23,Bigotry against the successful,iuseupyourusernames,accountt1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/accountt1234/comments/6147ya/bigotry_against_the_successful/,"What causes the modern epidemic of school shootings and terrorist attacks? We can point towards Islam as a cause, but Islam can not explain on its own why school shootings have risen simultaneously with suicide bombings. Islamic extremism as we know it today really only became a phenomenon in the 1980's. Angry Arabs until those days generally sought refuge in socialism or communism, they didn't seek refugee in a form of radical Islam. 

It should be clear that there is a bigger problem involved here than simply the existence of Islam. What is necessary is a fertile psychological breeding ground for people to find themselves attracted to these teachings that would normally lie dormant. If you're a Muslim living a happy worthwhile life, you don't care what Muhammed expected you to do. Religion will not be a priority in your life. That doesn't absolve Islam however.

What we certainly shouldn't be doing is giving Muslims preferential treatment over other impoverished minorities simply because they're more likely to lash out with violence. Look at Molenbeek in Brussels and other Muslim dominated neighborhoods and you'll find that terrorist attacks tend to be met with government programs meant to get young Muslims internships, youth centers and other forms of appeasement that are a de facto reward for the massacres and other problems their community imposes upon the rest of us.

What motivates these terrorist attacks around us, is the same thing that motivated the looting of Jewish stores in 1938, the genocide against the Tutsi's in Rwanda, the slaughter of Armenians near the end of the Ottoman empire, the eradication of the clergy in Spain, the massacre of Kulaks in Russia and the murder of the French aristocracy: Envy. Envy is a moral failure. Rather than acknowledging envy and trying to fight against this internal demon, humans in our era choose to invent ideologies that lead us to come up with pseudo-intellectual justifications for our own moral shortcomings. School shooters call it nihilism, Muslims call it Islam, yet others call it Marxism.

Try answering this question for yourself: When you see someone on TV with a noble title, living with his family in an old castle somewhere in Europe, inherited from their ancestors, filled to the brim with paintings of their ancestors and antique jewelry, surrounded by a beautiful garden, what do you genuinely feel? Chances are, without knowing anything about them, you're not going to like that person. You might make a joke that they're inbred, or express your fundamental envy in some other manner. Having grown up in poverty myself, that is my own natural inclination.

The reason for that is ultimately because you don't have what they have and never will have what they will have. That's a realization that you psychologically struggle to come to terms with. As a result, you find yourself filled with envy and unjustified resentment towards such people. It might be unfair that they are rich and you are poor, but they did not make you poor. In fact, in all likelihood they carry no ill will towards you. 

Blessings and curses are distributed among us in a manner we struggle to make sense of. Just as they might have done nothing to deserve their wealth, others have done nothing to deserve their beauty, their talents, or their (lack of) longevity. I can similarly point you to incredibly wealthy women whose lives were filled with grief because they were unable to bear children.

We generally don't insist on making everyone equally pretty, equally smart, or equally talented. Instead, we try to make the best of the reality that we find ourselves in. When it comes to wealth, we seem to think that we can somehow solve that situation, simply by taking wealth from the rich and redistributing it to everyone else. In the worst case, we do this through violence. Ultimately, we have to recognize this as a simple moral failure.

There are plenty of people who live in poverty, who have never had any education worth speaking of, but who are nonetheless wiser than your average modern academic. They can look at people who have it better than them for whatever reason, but rather than seeking to destroy or redistribute that, they do not speak of the matter. If pressed on the matter, they will respond with a simple ""good for them"". 

This is what plenty of Russian peasants would say if asked about their Czar and his family. They harbored no desire to empty their guns on his family. Rather than trying to seize what others have, they sought to find happiness in what they themselves had been granted. We live in an era where we have enormous wealth and yet, we take it for granted. The very fact that you can open your fridge and be met with a variety of flavors your ancestors couldn't begin to imagine is a miracle.

Marx might say that these peasants missed a sense of ""class consciousness"". I would say that Marx is guilty of rationalizing a personal shortcoming: The inability to be happy for others. I am willing to bet that those peasants who were happy for their Czar's happiness ultimately had happier lives than those peasants who joined the communist revolution and were rewarded with the wealth of the Kulaks who were liquidated by Stalin as a social class. 

If your mentality in life is sick, there is no wealth you can steal from others that would cure your suffering. If you can look at others who have it better than you and genuinely feel happy for the fact that they get to enjoy such things, that is the moment when your soul begins to heal. If you can't do that, then you're going to be your own worst victim. 

At the end of the day, what will make people like you is when you work with what you've been handed in life and try to make the best of it. Everyone whose opinion is worth a dime respects an old man who goes jogging, nobody is going to look down on him for his lack of speed. Similarly, if you're born in poverty, people will respect you if you make use of the means you have been given.

When it comes to Muslim terrorists, they are guilty of the same moral failure as Communists, Anarchists and Jacobins are: They see what others have that they don't have and find themselves unable to accept that. The envy they feel might be towards good looking young white people dancing in a French club, it might be towards tourists, business people and politicians in London, or it might be towards Jews living in a first world nation surrounded by dictatorships stuck in perpetual civil wars. 

True alchemy is concerned with an internal spiritual transformation, a lot of the beautiful artwork we struggle to make sense of today is actually meant as metaphors for internal psychological processes. If you can be happy with what you were allotted in life and can be happy for others who were granted more, then you have accomplished an alchemical transformation, you have turned lead into gold. 

When it comes to men like Lenin, Muhammed and Robespierre, they manage to gain power and wealth by using rhetorical devices to make others believe that the suffering produced by their own moral shortcomings is instead a product of righteous indignation. A man like Muhammed might inspire you to murder a tribal leader because God does not want women to rule over tribes, a man like Lenin might inspire similar atrocities because the wealth of others is inherently unjustified. These people gain power and wealth through spiritual blindness, I invite you to read the Quran and you will fail to find a word of wisdom there.

When you fail to put up resistance against your own moral shortcomings, you might refer to it as jihad or insurrection, but it will always end the same way: With edgy photographs with [decomposed nuns](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d7/27/4e/d7274ec4a509ce170e2ad2cc28607ff1.jpg) or [beheaded non-believers](https://ejbron.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screenshot_167.png?w=1400), dead children, bodies mangled by trucks and nail bombs, mass graves, firing squads and orphans. When it's all over and the bodies are buried, you will find yourself confronted with the same emptiness as before you joined the revolution."

614hqj,11,2017-03-23,7 Round Mock Draft,mrpopperspenguin,steelers,https://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/614hqj/7_round_mock_draft/,"I was feeling left out and was bored so I did a mock on fanspeak. Let me know what you think.  


Big Board: CBS

Team needs: NFL Mock

**R1- TJ Watt (Wisconsin) [3-4 OLB]**

There should be plenty of edge rushers and CBs here that we like so unless someone ridiculous falls to this pick we should have lots of options. This class is also pretty deep for both IMO so picking another position wouldn't be terrible. I think there's a good chance Watt is available at this pick. To replace Harrison. 

**R2- Kevin King (Washington) [CB]**

Very raw but also very athletic. Measurable similar to Obi. Good on the boundary. Has experience in the slot and at FS. Will need some time to develop but he's too good of an athlete for me to pass up at this pick and we don't need him to start right away. Should replace Cockrell. Could replace Gay or Mitchell potentially.  

**R3- Derek Rivers (Youngstown St.) [3-4 OLB]**

I highly doubt Rivers is available at this pick but he was in this mock so I snagged him. I planned on getting 2 edge anyway and if we can get Watt and Rivers in the first 3 rounds that would be pretty sweet. To replace Moats/Chickillo. 

**R3- Jake Butt (Michigan) [TE]**

I think this would be a good use of the comp pick. Most people know plenty about him. I don't think he'll have any lingering issue from his injury and has tremendous upside. To replace Green. 

**R4- Tanoh kpassagnon (Villanova) [3-4 DE]**

I don't really know what to think of this guy. He's 6'7"" and has the best pSPARQ of all the DL I could find. He hasn't played football for very long. I read his parents are very smart and he's already had an internship at PwC which makes some question how committed he is to football. He has poor technique and isn't as good of a pass rusher as he should be. I think he definitely has the tools to fix that however and should definitely be able to eat up multiple blockers right away. Hope would be that he can get on the field year 1 and rotate with Tuitt and Cam. Maybe sub for Hargrave as well. 

**R5- John Johnson (Boston College) [FS]**

I really doubt he's available here but if he is we should take him. With this pick we can develop King into a pure slot or boundary corner and not have to worry about replacing Mitchell. He needs to work on his tackling but his coverage skills are there. Frees up Davis to blitz more.

**R6- Damore'ea Stringfellow (Ole Miss) [WR]**

I know nothing about this dude. All I saw was tall and fast from the SEC. Apparently wasn't invited to the combine because he plead guilty to an assault charge a couple of years ago stemming from a fight outside of a nightclub. While that is concerning, it was a while ago and hopefully he has matured. I can't interview these guys so I have no way to know. Assuming he has I think he'd be a good pickup in the 6th. Also his last name is awesome. 

**R7- Blair Brown (Ohio) [ILB]**

Probably won't last until the 7th but there's a chance. Combine numbers were stellar. Not great size and I have no idea how he is in coverage. His athleticism could help correct that and he could be a viable replacement for Timmons in a year or two. In either case he should be a special teams demon from the get go. "

So starting off, I'm just an average student with a ho-hum GPA. I've got a job this summer and two internships under my belt, but I've been thinking about internships for next summer (when I'll be a rising senior). I've gotten almost addicted to thermodynamics in the course I'm taking now, and I'm very interested in finding something that would help scratch that itch.

Also, and this might be asking a lot, but I'm very familiar with personal computers and I'm wondering if there's a way I could merge those two interests into an internship. I know there are lots of consumer companies that are interested in keeping computer processors cool, but I was wondering if there was anywhere else where I could look for processor thermal dissipation.

Thanks in advance!"

One option is I work part time with a company during my studies fall and winter (year 2 onward). During the summers, I work for them full time until school starts again, then go back to part time, and repeat until I graduate. Another thing to note is that I will get a full-time offer from this company when I am out of school. This is with a smaller company (you might consider it a start up).

Alternatively, I could work part time for a year with said company, and seek internships during the first summer. Is it worth voiding my future part-time and full-time offer to gain some potential big-name internships (1+, I'm relatively confident (72%) I can land a decent one next summer, 2018)?

**Options:**

1. Do intermittent part time (fall/winter) and full time (summer) work with a small company for the next 2 years, and be guaranteed a small-time job after?

2. Take a year of part time (1 fall &amp; winter), get an internship(summer), and then see what I can land after graduation?

I'm also curious how my time would be viewed in terms of ""years exp."". For example, apps often ask for X years exp. Would my potential 2+ years working part/full time, on and off, count as a full 2+ years for the sake of future applications, from a recruiter/hiring standpoint? 

Which option do you think has more value? Thanks!

&gt; $Intern: Their account was created like 14 years ago!

&gt; $Selben: ...and?

&gt; $Intern: Oh... well then we put them on terminated status without any approval! Then turned it back on and off again like 30 times!

&gt; $Selben: All of those done without approvals or?..

&gt; $Intern: Yea! Then they suddenly put him on maternity leave with no return date like 3 years ago!

&gt; $Selben: ...You mean paternity leave.

$Selben internal huh?..

&gt; $Intern: Nope maternity leave!

&gt; $Selben: Okay... Let me take a look... 

$Selben turns to his desk and has WAAAY too much open to open another report, and offers to go back to $Intern2's desk instead.

$Intern2 points at his monitor, $Selben bursts out laughing.

I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying computer science. This summer I have an opportunity to do research full time doing some stuff that I think is pretty cool. I'm not sure if I would be better off in the long run trying to get more traditional experience with an internship - I don't plan on going to grad school or working in research after I graduate. I have had an internship before, so its not like I don't have any experience, but because I'm going to graduate soon I'm getting a little anxious and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot or anything.

As the title says, this is all sort of up in the air right now. I won't know for sure until April 2 if I have gotten the dietetic internship. But I know that if I am accepted, I'll have to hit the ground running since I will need to be in the area by July 15th. 

Some background: 

**Rental time-frame**: July 2017 through August 2018

**Budget:** ideally my own room/studio for $1200 per month (some wiggle room)

I'm not a night-life person, so that isn't a consideration. But I do like a good cafe to sit in and it would be nice to be near a good grocery store (also, a kitchen would be really nice--I am seeing lots of listings with just a fridge/sink/microwave). I have a bike. I don't really know much about the area, so I am looking for neighborhood recommendations, ideally near the Parnassus UCSF campus.

1. Is it even worth trying to live in SF at all or should I start with looking at living outside the city itself and use public transportation to commute?

2. Recommended locations/neighborhoods? Recommended muni/BART/public transportation routes from these areas to the UCSF Parnassus campus (and in smaller part, the Mission Bay campus)?

3. Is it possible to find a place at my price point in the short timeline (move-in by July 15th)? Anything I should do to improve my chances of landing a place?

A bit of information about me so that you know my situation. I graduated from a 4-year university back in May 2016 with a degree in business admin, concentration in finance. GPA wasn't amazing, but also wasn't awful. It's very...average, sitting at a 2.75. I got out of college with the idea of going into something in analytics like a financial analyst. Almost a year later, I have had no such luck in getting a position like that. During that time I continued to work in the part time job I had back in school, and back in November got my first 'real' job as an inside sales representative for a SaaS company (software as a service). Things were alright there until February, when I was let go because I wasn't able to hit my commission goal two months in a row.

And that's where I am right now. I haven't had much luck getting interviews for a position I would be interested in, with the big exception of 3 interviews with Bank of America for roles I was interested in. I've also been studying to take the GMAT, but from what I understand the majority of good business schools still require relevant work experience in order to be accepted.

So I guess my question is this: What can I do to become a more attractive candidate for these sort of positions? I've got a somewhat relevant internship under my belt where I worked for a hospital doing medical administration (where I worked with market share analyses, FTEs, and scorecards) but that's about it. I also do not want to go down the path of financial advisor because I don't think I'd do well in a commission-based job.

Are there any certifications / skills I can get certified in that will help me become more experienced for an analyst-type job? Or courses I can take? I also would be more than willing to accept an internship, but all of the ones I find are geared towards students currently in undergrad, and are usually only held in the summer.

I am very lucky in that I do not need to worry about student loans or worry if I am going to have a roof over my head, but I need to be doing SOMETHING that is going to help me get on the right career path.

What do you guys suggest?

TL;DR: I feel overwhelmed and hopeless in gaining experience for the career I want, and don't know where to start."
61579c,1,2017-03-23,"Buyers remorse, new grad concerns",throwaway_7821368731,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61579c/buyers_remorse_new_grad_concerns/,"Background: Fresh Grad (MS CS ,STEM undergrad). Long time lurker first time poster. I graduated in December, started looking for FT in January and the results were better than I expected, got 4+ offers (None from Big 4 but got close 2 times). 

The two main offers were from Company A and B (currently been at A for ~1month).
Offers:

A. 100k Base with ~8% bonus

B. 110k Base with stock options (monopoly money at this point), catered lunch expense dinner and various other perks (ex fully paid insurance and gym.)

I wound up going with company A, due to laid back atmosphere and good hours (Ex: get in @ 10 leave @~530ish), which agrees with an inside tip a friend who works their told me (works on a different team). The downsides with company A I knew going into it were tech stack. They utilize a monolithic PHP driven app/api to power their system. However, they are a major player in their space.This coming from two internships in Python was a downer, but I did not think I would be unable to program in another language as I have always stood behind that languages are just tools. Also the app is hosted on a private data center, with only new modern services being hosted on GCE. I do get a little discouraged/frustrated when tasks that would take me 1hr in another codebase/language take me 5-6 hours in my current spot. The whole app was built in house and not with an OS framework, so things are done as they were originally implemented. I've observed 3 different ways to obtain query parameters from the request ./shrug.

Company B on the other hand utilizes Python/Java on the backend with Mongodb as the DB for certain services and Postgres for other. The overall architecture here seems much more modern and with the times,smaller modular microservices. The perceived downsides of company B was they came off a bit ""stuffy"",but that is mainly for the part of their company that is client facing. They are a medium sized company (so is A) of ~200 people. They also had some ex-Googler's/Big-4 people with some impressive resume's on hand and in key positions. Last round of the onsite interview was with the CTO, intense smart guy who called BS on something I claimed I did during an internship (called BS by asking me to pseudo-code it on the spot). Their interview process was much more rigorous and typical of what is posted on this board with, easy-&gt;medium'ish leetcode type questions. The people who interviewed me were chill, and one did respond with a lengthy answer to a lot of questions I had afterwards.

Anyway I am a month into Company A, and having some doubts. I may just be new to PHP and their code base but I find it cumbersome and sort of dislike it (I recognize my opinion may be biased because I have 1000's of hours with Python ). I am just not as enthusiastic about using it as I am other languages. Partly because I feel investing time in it won't be so transferable for the next place I go. Additionally, I am on a small team, and on any given day half the team is working remotely. Which is awesome for future me, but not so awesome imo now. However, the job is comfy and the team members are chill af and so is my boss. But I do believe this team does not have the rigor a lot of people discuss commonly on this board. On the flipside the place is super chill, and is no BS in regards to the work life balance.I read a lot that your first job or first two years as an engineer is when you should learn most. While there is much to learn here, I have my doubts. 

What should I do fellow cscareer'ites. Ride it out for a bit and see if PHP and such grows on me, or reach out to Company B and tell them I may be in the market again and give them first dibs. Is enjoying your work/the tool you use important to you."

I'm sure most of it is mentality, but I'll try to give the TL;DR

1. Had terribly hostile high school experience, never really gave thought to what I wanted to do due to dealing with this. I was isolated and addicted to video games.

2. Very intelligent, but didn't ask questions due to not wanting to reflect badly on my race (African-American) (which was an incredibly stupid line of thought and dumber for not asking questions 

3. As a result, cultivated a bad relationship with the more complex maths and sciences. Last time I did ""real"" math was junior year of HS, statistics don't count imo. Well they do but they're for a different purpose.

4. Went to Sacramento State in Fall 2011. I was in ""fun/chill/play"" mode and literally chose a major without doing research- I thought it sounded like what I needed- Digital Video (within Communications) to work at Pixar (LMAO). Found out it wasn't for me, didn't do research again so I decided to stay in the major but change concentration to org comm.

5. Picked up a minor in management of human resources STRICTLY to feel better about my choice of major.

6. Like always, I felt like I was going with the motions, I didn't feel passionate about what I was doing. It felt like a slog. In the Spring 2016 semester discovered an interest in STEM (specifically something with computers, maybe programming, IT, or cyber security). I was too far into my major though, so I went ahead and finished in december 2016.

6. Working at a city hall as an adminstrative intern (such an insulting title given what I actually do), and at hte grocery store around the corner from my house (which makes me think why did I go to college every day that I work that job).

7. These things are temporary but I'm not sure as to the best way of moving toward my goal of working in tech. I'm thinking etiher IT or software development- I Just want to make a difference. I have an interest in working in software development for the healthcare industry but I'm not sure what that looks like.

**tl;dr: Went to school. Chose wrong major, like I was on auto pilot the whole time. Discovered interest in STEM, specifically software development or IT, but might be interested in something else in STEM as that's how I think. Unhappy with the temporary jobs I have.**

6161j6,0,2017-03-23,"[REQUEST] Inside is link to a script of The Social Network hosted by Sony, and I'm looking for a reply w/ a handful of Do's and Don'ts and a brief explanation why as to each. I'm looking for formatting help/advice, so TSN's content is irrelevant.",Death_Star_,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/6161j6/request_inside_is_link_to_a_script_of_the_social/,"Since it looks like I wasn't clear in my request earlier, and I apologize, I am looking for a couple of submissions to act as though this script is a submission and I'm requesting corrections and the like.

* **The carrot**

I'm offering the top 2-3, maybe 4 replies Reddit Gold. Or, I could just give the top 2-3 $5 via PayPal. OR, I may just give $15 to the one response that is very helpful. At the very least, I promise to give out 2 Reddit Golds so long as there are at least 2 replies offering sincere help.

I am looking for help fashioning a ""go-to"" example of a well-formatted script (by the end; as in, after receiving help, I can apply the notes to this script and be able to use the combination as a resource on how to edit/write my scripts)

* **The Request**

[I've provided a link to a copy of a Sony-hosted link of The Social Network](http://flash.sonypictures.com/video/movies/thesocialnetwork/awards/thesocialnetwork_screenplay.pdf), **which I do not feel is a good representation of what a good submission would be in terms of formatting, as it is more like a transcript drafted after watching the film than the ""blueprints"" for a film before it's made**. 

The title page doesn't provide any particulars beyond title/writer, so I'm assuming that this is neither the shooting draft nor an actual final draft from Sorkin himself, but simply the product of an intern transcribing a film with minimal effort put into formatting. 

If it IS the final draft by Sorkin himself, I'd be surprised, since 99-100% of the dialogue and filler-words made it to the screen, like ""...um,"" which is why I say it seems like a transcript.  I've watched the film many times, and it seems like a lot of...formatting stuff/terminology/jargon is missing; what's missing is not dialogue, but perhaps wrylies or writer ""direction"" or action lines. 

Or, maybe that's the way it should be, I genuinely don't know, which is why I'm asking.  I'm an amateur who wouldn't know if this is par for the course or too bare bones or too much. I just know, or feel, like this script is not actually representative of a properly-formatted script.

* **The Directions**:

1. Skim through the first X% of the script -- whatever % you feel is sufficient -- until you find both good and bad examples of formatting, and identify what makes them good or bad examples of formatting. I'll assume that the pages you skipped up to that point are fine in formatting. E.g., if you begin on page 18 or something, I'll assume the first 17 pages are fine.

2. Once you identify what is wrong or insufficient in terms of formatting, suggest a substitution or correction. When you identify a good example of formatting, identifying and maybe throwing 1-2 sentences why would be helpful. If there's an area where it's just missing something, like a ""cut to"" or a wryly you'd suggest, then please point that out.

3. You're not re-writing anything. It shouldn't really take much effort if you're a professional reader, which like 75% of this subreddit seems to be composed of. **Pretend it's a real submission, but ignore content**. If it's a joy in formatting, point out why, if there are flaws, point them out. 

4. Again, I'm not asking or expecting you to change the movie or care about the content. I chose this script because I know it well, I assume much of this sub knows it well, and this is actually a clean script so you don't have to worry or complain about grammar or spelling; if you have complaints about formatting, well then that's the whole point. 

**Basically, if this were a submission, what would be your take on its formatting? What would be some examples where it makes your job easy, and what would be some examples of what not to do and/or how they could be improved?**

* **THE EXAMPLE**: A reply that provides maybe 5-7 (or whatever seems sufficient) good examples of formatting on this script, and 5-7 bad ones, each with brief 1-3 sentence explanation why. Just cite the page, cite the example, write why you think it's good or bad. Pretty simple stuff, especially if you're a pro reader (I know, it's easier to just critique/criticize something than it is to do something like this**^1**). Maybe also give an overall assessment of the script.

Maybe there's nothing really wrong with this draft. Well, then that's great news for those willing to help, and they'd get easy gestures of gratitude back. 

Again, I'm NOT asking for a proofread of this entire script.

I am NOT asking for a re-write of anything.

I AM asking for a handful of Do's and handful of Don'ts with respect to this script and explanations why. 

* **Why?**

Why this script? Stated above. Most know the film, it's already spell-checked and it's grammatically clean. It should be easy work. But it's less a script and more a transcript with *some* formatting.

Why this request? So I can edit and polish my scripts knowing that I'm on the right track, because 4 different books have 4 different styles, and I'd rather have real-world eyes on it, if this sub is made up of so many readers. **It's easier to have one ""perfect"" example of a script and use it as a reference than to consolidate 4 books' worth of instruction.**

Many of you ARE readers and have spent ***free-time*** complaining about terrible scripts that aren't even provided; here -- hope it's not too much to ask for actual help during your free-time.

Why not just submit my scripts for feedback?  Because I'm not looking for feedback yet, especially on content; I'd rather submit a cleanly-formatted script where a reader can focus on the content and not have it become an example like ""this is what's so wrong with so many scripts today I read during my day. So many writers waste my time with their terrible writing. How did they manage to even submit their scripts?"" 

I'm trying to be the change **you** readers want to see. I'm trying to avoid being one of those writers you hate. I'm not saying there's nobility in me trying to get better, I'm merely trying to get better.  


**TL;DR - I am looking for some feedback on a produced script on its formatting because this particular draft seems like a transcript and not an actual final draft. I want to end up with a resourceful script with pointers on how to edit my drafts and how to write my new scripts.  Looking for ID on the good and bad formatting examples.  Not asking for critique on content, not asking for re-writes. Will reward.**
____________________________________________________________________________


* **About me**

I'm an obvious amateur writer (hence why I wouldn't know a script with good/great formatting). During the day, I'm an attorney. 

I did get accepted to UCLA's MFA Screenwriting program 4 years ago, but I was only 3-4 years into my career as an attorney and it was a major crossroads for me and I chose the safe path. I say this because I lack the formal education that many of you have on writing and formatting, so I'm turning to you.

I've read a good amount of books on formatting, but the 4 books I have give me 4 different types of instruction. So, instead of using ""textbooks"" to try to format my scripts and polish them, I'd rather have an example of a well-formatted script, according to readers.

I feel like I have quality content but no real confidence in my formatting, and I'm ready to start polishing a couple of my scripts to submit to connections/agents and contests/fellowships. I'm asking this community for help, and I'd be grateful for help.

Personally, I mentor law students and 1st year associates on their briefs and legal writing because when I was their age -- I'm ancient at 34 -- a mentor helped me with my writing. Having even a sample legal brief is really helpful, even if there are many different ways to write a legal brief but really only a narrow set of ways to write a film script.

Footnote

**^1**

As I've seen too often, this sub is relatively slow, inactive, or not very helpful w/ respect to advice and help, and just inactive overall until the regular ""Readers, what drives you crazy?"" thread comes up, and then everyone comes out in droves and dishes out their examples of terrible formatting and writing like a bunch of bored housewives over a bottle of wine. 

This can be like /r/TalesFromRetail for screenwriting sometimes, instead of a *community* of like-minded people passionate about screenwriting looking to help each other. 

I've been subscribed for 4 years, and I definitely rarely see quality help on the level of /r/buildaPC or the average subreddit on a craft. It's almost like this sub is made up ***mostly*** of people who aren't all that passionate about the craft and/or people who don't care about help...(there are always exceptions, and I'm expecting the help to come from those exceptions, the people passionate about screenwriting and wanting to help out a fellow writer. I'm expecting many snarky responses with no help).

It's the nature of writers, I suppose, like what Hemingway said in Midnight in Paris -- writers hate the writing of others because either it's bad writing and they'll be upset their time was wasted reading the writing, or it's good writing and they'll be even more upset that it's better than theirs.

That would be my best-case take on this sub and an explanation why help is so difficult to come by. I can't even find help on how to better ask for help.

Even with my earlier submission and request for help mentioned before, instead of sincere advice on simply *how to improve my request for help*, I just got snarky responses that at best marginally pointed me in the direction of improving my request, and many comments that didn't even help me with how to better ask for help but existed only to criticize.

61644b,5,2017-03-23,Did I make the right choice?,bthi,Alienware,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alienware/comments/61644b/did_i_make_the_right_choice/,"So, a couple of weeks ago, I was in heavy debate with myself about the Alienware 13 R3 vs. the Razer Blade 14 2017. For the longest time, I was obsessed with getting a blade because of how nice they look etc and I had an internship this winter so I had saved enough money to get one. Unfortunately, they weren't available in the Microsoft store yet so I kept waiting and waiting and I started to look around for other laptops.

I eventually found the Alienware 13 R3. I wasn't the biggest fan of the big vents at the back but I always thought Alienwares were cool and i never have really seen an OLED screen but all the comments about it really hyped me up. I was slowly going from deadset on the blade... To choosing between the blade and the Alienware. Portability is important to me however so I was kind of meh about the weight of the Alienware but I was rest assured that the Alienware 13, while heavy, is certainly portable in every sense of the word. 

So, anyway I ended up springing for the Alienware 13 with the OLED screen and 3 years of warranty + accidental protection. My laptop is due to arrive in a couple of weeks however, today I saw that the blade is now on the Microsoft store and with their 10% off student price, it is much cheaper than I anticipated. Ultimately, it ends up being around the same price as the AW but with a shittier warranty. So, I been feeling kind of eh all day about this, like maybe I didn't make the right choice. So, did I? 

Can anyone speak to the portability of the Alienware vs the blade? Like how much worse is it? Weight is fine tbh but like is it bulky? I'm coming from a Thinkpad T410 (from 2010) BTW so it's gotta be a big improvement thinness wise I would think... I plan on taking the laptop to school in my backpack everyday basically but ofc once I'm there, I'll be set up in a location for a while. I just want it to be portable. Also, would you say it draws a lot of attention? I really love the Alienware logo etc but I also liked how the blade was nice looking. Anyone also who has had both, can you comment on how you feel between them? Im basically just looking for nice responses (that's why I posted in this sub) because I wanna know I made the right choice and not have to deal with the pain of returning it. Would greatly appreciate all responses though.

Given my grades, I do not anticipate on being accepted into Waterloo or UofT for engineering.
Even if I do get accepted into these universities, I don't think I have what it takes to survive or thrive in that type of competitive learning environment.
That being said, how is Ryerson for computer engineering?
The school kind of gets a bad rep, but I feel most of this comes from high school students.
I personally have nothing against Ryerson, but I do get a lot of negative comments from my high school peers.
This is why I wanted to get input from students who are actually in the program, rather than listening to trash talking highschoolers.
If I attend Ryerson, do I still have a chance at getting hired at a big tech firm in the US?
Some people (mostly high school peers) have scared me into thinking I will not find a good job after graduation if I attend Ryerson.
Those in upper year, what kind of internship jobs did you get? What companies were they at, which location, salary, etc.
Also how is campus culture? Is it competitive/cutthroat like Waterloo and Uoft?
I was also accepted to York for undeclared engineering, so would I be better off going to York of coming to Ryerson?
I also got into UTSC for computer science (co-op).
In terms of commute, Ryerson would be much more convenient for me.
Please feel free to throw in anything else you might like to add."

Hiya people of DKP. Today, I want to roleplay out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

I found out that I was accepted to UCSB which came as a real shock as It's become more and more of a reach as SD, Davis, AND Irvine didn't happen. But while UCSB is getting better in terms of prestige and US News ranked them higher this year than Irvine, SD, and Davis, I'm having to pick between UCR and UCSB so I'd like some guidance on which is best for pre-med and which helped more for all of you in terms of getting into med school.

**UCR PROS**

* Close to Home (2 hrs ish)
* Med School (newish, idk if i wanna stay in Riverside for 8 years for med school as well but the fact there are opportunities for pre-med students like shadowing and volunteering is awesome)
* Pre-Med Advising is good I've heard
* I got Chancellors!
* My major is BA in Neuroscience in CHASS but i'm tryna change it to BS in Neuroscience or CMDB CNAS
* no Gunner mentality like in Cal, La, or SD
* ASIANS!!!!! (my pplllllllllllll), not much in terms of a party school, parties concentrated and localized
* Thomas Haider program

**UCR CONS**

* Close to home (It has pros and cons)
* More Pre-Meds so a little more competition for opportunities
* I'm in CHASS rn


  

  
**UCSB PROS**

* More research oriented than UCR (or at least I've heard)
* Great opportunities in and around Isla Vista
* Isla Vista is more Pretty than Riverside
* I'm not in Honors right off the bat but the Health Sciences Honors Program has epic advising and helping to gain an internship (the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department internship caught my eye) and u can apply into the Honors program in between your sophomore year
* Less Pre-Meds-&gt;More Opportunities
* Less Asians-&gt;Less gunner mentality
* Prestige over UCR

**UCSB CONS**

* I'm an Introvert, so the party scene scares me
* I'm Muslim and want to adhere to my faith, and the party scene scares me
* I'm Asian and I like to be with my quiet, introspectional, geeky Asian brothas and the party scene scares me
* Did I say the party scene scares me?
* I can't even take my parents to Spring Insight this year as it coincides with Deltopia and I don't want my parents seeing that
Lack of Med School
* SB's Prestige supposedly comes from it's amazing af Physics dept and Math dept and nothing else so shoot.


If there's any cons with SB, I guess it's the party school stereotype it gets classified under. Are any of you on here at SB and more of the reserved, quiet type and able to handle SB or is it just hell? Are there people at SB who are like me and are more introverted? What is there to do in Isla Vista on weekends that doesn't involve consuming large amounts of alcohol and shooting ping pong balls into cups all night? 

And are my assumptions about how SB has great opportunities even without a med school correct and also the prestige not coming from SB's Bio program but their Physics/Math dept? 

Ik the go to response for threads like these is.....think about cost first. Cost isn't an issue though as i'm getting a ton of grant and scholarship aid for SB even without Chancellor's Invite. At the end of the day, SB seems amazing due to the location, breadth of opportunities, Honors program (which i can apply into), and less competitive nature but the party scene schtick scares me. UCR's close to home, has a med school, and has great opportunities for pre-meds.

In all your opinions' what should I do? Thank You!"

After that also we were texting each other... But then it was a forced one, She had already moved on from that and was starting to avoid me... I was silent about that because I knew things had change.. but I didn't got that closure from her... So one day I directly asked about our future to her...which she plainly said that she and I are nothing right now and didn't stand a chance... She said all those feelings for me are true but she can't be with me..because we both had no backup and our parents won't agree because we were nothing in life right now...

The plan was that I would continue to work as an intern until I graduated college, then I would start as a full-time employee.

I've now received another offer from a company that I like more, and I'm planning to accept. The trouble is that I'd like to continue my internship at my current company until I graduate, I have to pay the bills after all. My first instinct is to tell my current company as soon as possible that plans have changed, and that I won't be accepting their offer. I live in an at-will state, so I'm not worried about repercussions, but in the back of my mind I'm concerned that they might terminate my internship since I'm not planning on joining full time.

Should I tell my current company now that I won't be joining them after I graduate, or should I wait until the time gets closer to tell them? Thanks in advance for any input"

Then did an internship in which I did okay in but should've been fired for but wasn't. Then I started working this other job which was still with the sameu company but a completely different role which I was not qualified for at all yet still hired. Go figure, I got fired for good reasons like being on my phone too much, falling asleep in the job (like closing my eyes for like maybe 2-3 min) regardless. A bunch of bad habits.

Now I've been working for this one company for about 4 months. Continuing with some of the same bad habits. I am starting to worry get depressed that I might lose my job. More importantly though I have been really unpleased with all these habits that I haven't yet broken. That continue to interfere with my efficacy  at work and bot my mental health and physical health.
I want to keep this job that I have. I like the company but I feel as if I don't deserve the position because of how poorly I am doing. I want to tell my boss how I feel and also be honesty about my work because I have been lying to cover my ass and I feel very convicted by my dishonesty. I am afraid of losing my job and having to find new work with all this horrible history but part of me is ready to accept these consequences and hopes that it will help me get better. 



Long story short, should I come clean about how bad I am doing at work? And how can I break bad habits and make better ones? 

Added note I am ashamed that it has come to this and honestly cannot look at my boss in the eyes. It's bad real bad. "

I'm pretty confident with my technical skills but I'm worried about my social skills.

I'm a very shy guy, I rarely make eye contacts when I talk to people.

I didn't have any friends throughout high school and I only have 2 or 3 friends in college. I'm that ""anti social"" guy who just never talks to anyone. 

People often tell me that I'm a very difficult person to get along since I don't talk that much and honestly, I don't know how to keep a conversation on going with someone who I'm not close with.

I'm pretty sure its  my low self-esteem that keeps me from socially engaging with people. Honestly, I don't know how I even got the job as the interview was 100% behavioral. 

How should I fix this problem? I want to make new friends and get along with my future manager and co-workers but it just seems too hard for me.

Yet I dread graduating because I still have not locked down an engineering job. I grew up in a small town that doesn't have a ton of opportunity, and thus it would be hard to ""network"" or make new friends who could help me land something. People tell me to not worry I have experience but it isn't enough. Everyone these days has had at least one summer internship. A friend of mine told me a friend of his may get me an interview for a position starting January but that isn't a guarentee. I have a bad habit of not keeping in touch. 

I just turned 27 a month ago and if getting a real career at 27 isn't bad enough already I can't imagine how pathetic it would be to not start a career until 28 or 30. There is nothing positive about being a late bloomer, it's  just another word for loser.

With girls it's even worse. Most people my age or younger are already in serious relationships and about to get married. I only had 1 girlfriend in my life so I have no where near enough experience for a wife. 

""Everyone moves at their own pace"" was something my mom always said. Yet the guys who move faster get better everything and are liked more by everyone. 

I don't want to marry a former slut who had sex with more than 10 guys. Yet the only girls over 25 who arent sluts are either in serious relationships or fat. I don't want the table scraps of early bloomers. 

I decided if I don't get a job 2 months after graduation I'm going end my life. It will hurt my parents but 10 years from now they will forget I even existed. "
617s5l,3,2017-03-24,TAG into UCI or UCSC?,DemiPixel,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/617s5l/tag_into_uci_or_ucsc/,"So recently I was rejected from UCI but I was accepted to UCSC. I'm interested in majoring in computer science. Here are the two options I've been considering:

**UCSC**

It's not a bad school and, although ranked lower than UCI most of the time, is still a UC. Unfortunately, it seems to be a tad more of a party school (or at least has a reputation for that), and Irvine's dedicated computer science school makes it a more attractive option. I could always apply for standard transfer to UCI in November, but not much will have changed other than getting senior grades (which probably won't hurt my GPA but won't boost it either) and receiving new AP scores. Overall, I wouldn't be surprised if I was rejected again.

**CC with TAG**

My AP's complete 50/90 required credits (as well as covering things like calculus and physical sciences), so I could theoretically do a single year in CC, apply for TAG in September, and as long as I complete all my required CS requirements (done about 8 years of programming, not too worried) &amp; English requirements, I should be set, right? It guarantees me a spot at UCI as a junior assuming I keep my GPA up (should be easy if I just take some CS classes where I already know the content). I live in Silicon Valley, so coming back for internships wouldn't be an issue. Negative is the slight chance of under 3.4 GPA, and also missing out on some of the ""college experience"" for the first year.

******

Arguably they're both great school, however I keep finding myself finding reasons why Irvine might be the right choice (e.g. UCSC is closer to Silicon Valley but UCI has been getting more attentions from companies in that area. UCSC has more of a fun social aspect, but I've heard some goods things from UCI students, and I'm not exactly a party guy anyway).

I'm sure half of you will say ""UCSC is a great school, just suck it up and go there, not everybody gets what they want"", so I'm interested if the other half thinks my idea is too much effort and has too many risks or might be worth it.

******

I plan on talking to a few people at the school(s) as well, I'm just wondering if it's even worth it ignoring all the figures."

Majoring in computer science, 3.44 gpa. actually UCSC was my first choice because I heard there is Sillycon Valley and UCSC offers really good internships. However, because of location problems(I live in La atm), I tagged into UCI, and they accepted me as a provisional admission. But they requires me to keep my gpa over 3.40 after this spring, and I don't think I'll be able to keep my gpa with 4 hard classes right now(not meaning i will fail at this semester, but will get some B instead of A). yea, i was cocky I will be good standing with discrete math/linear algebra/differential equation/c++ at one semester.

Recently, I got a message that I wasn't admitted by UC santa barbara. so my worrying is becoming as a fear if I won't be accpeted by any school(I applied all UC except UCLA and berkely).

Q1) Although my last name starts with character A, my admission status is still pending review by UCSC. For transferring students, normally, when did you guys get accepted at last year?

Q2) my major gpa is not high. Although I got all A from CS courses(c++,python,java), I got all B from math courses(calculus1,2,3) does it hurt for my admission if I dont have any A from math courses?

I assume there are a lot of people on this sub in the position of hiring people like myself so i ask: 

Is this normal? Am i being screwed? My starting salary in my old job was 18k and that was a crappy admin entry position. The figure is all i have to go off for now.

For the record the tech company I work for has a great atmosphere and is a market leader in my area (Suffolk in the UK).

6192qi,16,2017-03-24,What is up with Pentax Social Media?,ksuwildkat,pentax,https://www.reddit.com/r/pentax/comments/6192qi/what_is_up_with_pentax_social_media/,"I hope someone from Ricoh US drops by here once in a while because Pentax social media is really pathetic.  Here are links to their social media sites:

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/PENTAXIAN)

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RicohImagingNA/)

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ricohpentax/)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/pentaxian1/featured)

First off, they are not very active.  ~~Most recent tweet was January.~~ Pinned tweet, my bad.  Still, not very active.  I get that you don't want to tweet for the sake of tweeting but at least put some effort into retweeting the great content other Pentaxians are posting.  A quick trip to [#Pentax](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PENTAX?src=hash) would deliver a ton of content from folks who would probably be over the moon if Pentax USA recognized them.  What does an hour of labor cost?  What the return on that hour?  Good god get an intern from DU (Denver based company) to do it.  

They do a little better on Facebook but the majority of their content there boils down to a product ad.  Yeah, more ads.....  They do have some user images but most of them belong where they are - on Facebook.  Ill admit I am anti-Facebook but I am that way for a reason.  Besides the overall lack of quality, its the epicenter of stolen content and bad PR.  What they are not using Facebook for is what it does best - connecting to people and promoting partners.  

Instagram is a complete train wreck....and the Pentax page sucks.  I know a lot of photographers are on Instagram but personally I hate it.  I grabbed an account to keep someone else from having my name but otherwise leave it alone.  Still, if you are going to have one, put some effort into it because having a bad one is worse.  Make it a ""feature picture of the day"" place as your excuse for not doing more.  If you can't go big, go exclusive.  

YouTube is an embarrassment.  Newest video is of the K3ii.  Brand new video that is on their Facebook page is not on their YouTube.  Really COOL video too.  Someone put a Theta on a DJI drone and shot mountain climbers on in the Alps.  Amazing 360 video.  Not on YouTube.

To top all that off, their is no brand consistency.  Some sites are Ricoh, some are Ricoh Pentax.  Some are black logo, some are no logo, none are Pentax red.  Whats really crazy about that is their corporate web page is red, pictures from their convention booths are red and even some of the ads are red.  Their Facebook banner has a K-1, a 645 (D I think) and a bunch of discontinued cameras we all know and love.  Great.  You know what isn't there?  A single Ricoh GR, a WG or a Q.  On YouTube you can learn all about the K-S1 and then discover you can buy it.  

And as bad as all that is, the worst part is where they are not.  No Flickr.  No 500px.  No DeviantArt.  hard core photographer sites.  places where people who REALLY care about images, still images, show their stuff.  Not there.  But you know what is even worse than ALL that?  They don't even have a link ANYWHERE on they social media for [Pentax Photo Gallery](http://www.pentaxphotogallery.com)!  Its their own site to show off Pentaxians and nary a mention.  Good god its free content for EVERY OTHER site!  All you have to do is grab the top 10 images from PPG for the week and feed it into everything else.  And its not like they don't know it exists because there are links from PPG to all their other sites.  

Seriously Pentax, do something about this.  You are the underdog.  You are the small guy.  You are supposed to be quick and agile and using gorilla tactics.  Instead you are 5 years behind and making zero effort to catch up.  Do Better!"

Sorry if I have submitted this post to the wrong Subreddit, but at this point I am pretty desperate.

I am a University student of International Business. I have chosen to write my thesis on Renewable Energy of  the United Kingdom, because I would like to gather more knowledge on how the emerging renewable energy sources of the UK, especially Scotland, are being used by a country which is not considered a top user of green energy sources compared to other countries in Europe.

At my University we have to complete a compulsory internship for 3,5 months for the diploma. I wanted to complete this in the United Kingdom, but so far without any luck. i have messaged over 60 companies and only a few replied that it is not possible at the moment. At this point I am willing to go to any country in Europe just to deepen my knowledge on renewable energy as I find this topic very interesting.
If you know any companies, consultants, or NGOs that might be able to help me, please suggest it. After the compulsory internship, it is possible to for me to stay for longer.

For more information feel free to contact me.

Every advice, help is appreciated.

I cannot thank you all enough from the bottom of my heart.,Shanemurphy7,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/61aee5/a_month_sober_i_cannot_thank_you_all_enough_from/,"A month ago I forgot who I was. I was having massive anxiety everyday, drinking to maintain a buzz to relax and de stress. A month ago I found myself getting anxious around my closest friends, I did what I could to hide it, Drinking excessively behind their backs, but they saw right through me. From that point on I decided to never be that person around the ones I love, being a high functioning drunk who kept running from his emotions, I faced my fears and made a decision for myself and future family. 

I went through a week of withdrawals, jitters, sleepless nights, unbearable cravings, cold sweats. But I stuck through it thanks to this subreddit and hearing everyone's stories along with their motivation. If my friends on here can do it, I can't let them down!!

Ive gotten back in the gym, have been excelling in my college classes, feel I have actual control on my life again. I even feel myself again. I even setup a Physical Therapist internship for the summer! (My dream job). Sober me was the one I loved, it was the one I could count on, I take pride when I beat a battle with my demons. The grass is greener on the other side!

Stay strong everyone, a month is a small step but a step in the right direction. I raise a glass of clear delicious water to you all! We got this! I will not drink with you today!

Update: You are all so kind. I am truly grateful for all your words!"
61agpa,6,2017-03-24,Couple of questions for current UCI Undergrad Computer Science Students,Sling269,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/61agpa/couple_of_questions_for_current_uci_undergrad/,"Hi all i plan on attending UCI this coming fall for CS and had a few concerns/questions:

1. I heard that you take Data Structures later on around sophomore/junior year. This is problematic isn't it for internships/interviews Freshmen year summer and sophomore year summer? Would i have to self-learn data structures/algorithms if i want to land an internship during those times?

2. How do specializations exactly work? If I specialize in data structures would it solve the first questions problems.

3. How is the social/club scene at UCI? I want to go somewhere where I can make a lot of friends interested in CS. I don't want to feel isolated. I don't necessarily mean I want to collaborate on every homework or anything just to make some friends with similar interests.

4. How are career fairs at UCI? Do most major companies attend and recruit?

Thanks!"
61ahoh,1,2017-03-24,Started My Own Business Early,wastelands33,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/61ahoh/started_my_own_business_early/,"Basically, instead of going into the workforce world, I started my own Marketing company back in 2006. Right before I graduated with a finance degree and minor in economics. The business has been great for me and my family.

But as of last year, with Brexit (Im American) I had alot of clients go out of business which dented my business but not too much. Then overtime more clients are looking for in house marketing specialists with degrees in marketing. Which really didn't exist when I was in school.

I also realized I wanted to change paths of owning my own business (more for security) and apply for outside in house Marketing positions.

What my issue is, is that I just have my own company as a list of what I've done the past 11 years. Most told me they are looking for those that have worked in a team enviroment (even though my teams of managing 20-30 virtual workers and freelancers was mentioned) So Im always turned down. 

Other positions I've been told Im over qualified for jobs unrelated to my current business.

Im 32 and I cant intern because As my business has slowed down from clients going toward prospects with papers that prove they have the education, my 11 year experience and numbers dont matter.

Ive networked and partneted with lots of people but in this industry, once one gets the upper hand, they leave you on your own

So now I fill like I made a mistake starting a business straight out of school before building credentials.

So Im in a spot where Im not sure how to get into a career path because most I dont meet the criteria.

Any advice is appreciated and anyone with experience with head hunters too would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance"
61arun,3,2017-03-24,I (18M) thinking about ending 6 month online LDR relationship with (19F),doesitrungoogle,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/61arun/i_18m_thinking_about_ending_6_month_online_ldr/,"TLDR at the bottom.

Hi, so here's my situation. 6 months ago, I met this girl on an online dating website. I am from California but she lives in Algeria. I feel that we have a strong connection, we have similar interests and goals but there are some things that are concerning me. We text and voice call every day and sometimes we talk for hours. We video call once a week when possible. We have an 8 hour time difference so it's a bit tough.

So here are our situations; I am a first year junior studying computer science at a university and work around 32 hours a week at a paid internship in programming that I landed 2 months ago. I will be 20 when I graduate next year and have the potential of getting a full time well-paying position in the company when I graduate. I plan on pursuing a masters degree right when I finish my bachelors.
Her on the other hand, she is also doing her bachelors in university and will be done in 2 years.

We both want to visit each other but she cannot come alone to visit me in the US since her parents won't let her. The only option is if I visit her in Algeria. The problem is that in summer break I will be taking extra classes to finish up faster and working more at my internship. Winter break is not an option either since I will be working full time at my internship too. So we can't visit each other for 2.5 years and I've come to the realization that I don't know if I can wait that long or if it's even worth it since we haven't even met in person either. I mean, we really like each other and I feel we have a strong connection, but I don't know if I should just end it at this point or not.

But here's what is concerns me. Let's say hypothetically speaking, we do keep this up for the next 2.5 years until we can finally meet. When I come to meet here for the first time, she wants us to get married in Algeria and that means she would come back with me to California and live with me, I would only be 21 years old and just starting to begin my masters. When I say that I would rather wait a few more years until I finish my masters and am established, she doesn't want to wait.

Next point is about jealously. I don't think she's the jealous type but the other day she was asking how my day went and when I told her I was studying for a programming class with this friend that I made that's a girl, she thought I would end up liking her and she told me she's jealous.

With summer coming up in a few months, I would be even busier with work/school and family/friends that I feel that I wouldn't have time to keep doing long distance, especially without visiting each other. Even though I feel we have a good bond and we get along; the lack of visits for 2.5 years, the fact that she wants us to marry the first time we would meet are reasons that have me thinking of ending our 6 month relationship.

Any advice on what I should do will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

TLDR: I (19M) met girl (18F) online. Been together 6 months. I live in California. She lives in Algeria. Great bond, get along. Cannot meet for 2.5 years. But on our first time meeting girl wants us to get married and move back to California with me. I told girl I want to wait a few more years to finish masters degree but doesn't want to wait longer. Should I end this online LDR or not? Any advice?"

61b2yg,217,2017-03-24,What is truly keeping you from taking action?,TheGovernorPR,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/61b2yg/what_is_truly_keeping_you_from_taking_action/,"I have been on this subreddit for a little over 8 months now and I decided to weigh in. When I stopped making excuses and listening to this advice, I lost 15lbs, I had the confidence to apply to my states Governors internship program, and I tackled my fear of public speaking. 

So I say again what is holding you back? Have you honestly taken a serious look at yourself and ask yourself “What is it that is holding my back”, Is it a physical barriers that is keeping you at bay from doing what you want to be doing? If not then that is a bullshit excuse.  I always see many of my friends, and family make excuses on why something cant be done. When in all honesty it can, because the only person that is holding you back from being the best thing you can be is yourself, If your mind, and your body are aligned, and you are building up your masculinity, you are already miles ahead of the crowd. 
		If you take that extra hour to read your book instead of playing your xbox you are ahead, if you go to the gym for an extra hour instead of watching your show, well my friend you are ahead, if you get up and do the damn thing, you are ahead. That is the beauty of it taking simple action, pushed you ahead of 90% of the population, and not because of some magic elixir, or some magical pill, it because you challenged yourself that day to be more then normal, to push yourself, to see how far you can go. 
		One of my favorite twitter accounts is a Man named Veritas and in his bio he says “You must declare unceasing war on yourself.” And it really didn't resonate with me until now, whenever your push your comforts, set boundaries, build up your irrational confidence, and say “No”, you are challenging yourself, you are challenging the boundaries society has placed on Men, and your are pushing forward.  

TL;DR When you take action you are challenging the norm, and you are getting the edge to help you become the man you want to become. 

Edit: I did not expect my first TRP post to get gifted with gold. Thank you!"
61b4e7,2,2017-03-24,Should I apply for a job that requires a degree if I don't have one but exceed skills and experience requirements?,Outofash,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/61b4e7/should_i_apply_for_a_job_that_requires_a_degree/,"I majored in mass comm in college for 3.5 years, but foolishly left the program without a degree after I completed an internship and was offered a FT job with the company.  It paid well and all was well until I got married and moved states and needed to find a new job.  I have an incredibly extensive portfolio and experience with a reputable company, but most jobs state that a degree is required.

Finishing the degree program really isn't an option right now, but I am overly qualified for most of the jobs based on skill level.  I often wonder if the degree requirement is to weed out people who have no formal education, which I have, just not the degree.  I know the worst case scenario is they don't hire me, but I do want to be respectful of the requirements.  Is it worth applying or no?

Note:  I know certain sectors like educational institutions are governed by state or federal regulations that don't leave any flexibility in terms of degree requirements, but I am talking about private companies, non-profits, etc."
61b5yb,29,2017-03-24,I believe programming is one of the best careers for somebody with ADHD.,VISUALBVSIC,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/61b5yb/i_believe_programming_is_one_of_the_best_careers/,"First, I want to say that some people may disagree with me, but it's just my opinion. I also want to mention that grammar isn't my strong suit so I'm sorry if my grammar is bad.

For a little bit of background, a couple years ago I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was just out of high school, and I had a lot going on and I would've been happy being a manager at a pizza place for the rest of my life. Not that there's anything wrong with that, It just wasn't for me. I'm sometimes bad with customers. But anyway, I decided to start programming after 6-8 months of being out of high school and enroll in some classes at a community college. I finished most of the assignments early, and got an internship over summer. I decided to skip the next semester to focus on the internship, and wait until spring to go to a university. 

The greatest part about programming, in my opinion, is that there are so many different languages, and so many different things you can do. You can create web pages, web applications, learn about artificial intelligence and create neural networks, create scripts for machine learning, learn about computer security, be an ethical hacker, create iOS or Android applications,and work on databases, the list just keeps on going. There are SO many possibilities, and right now programmers are going to stay in demand with how much technology is growing. If you start learning HTML and get bored, go work on learning another language that can go hand in hand with it, like JavaScript. Just pick a certain topic and start learning, you can bounce around as much as you want, and you're still learning. And with some languages, the syntax is very similar so you'll pick them up faster.

If you're stuck trying to figure out what you want to do with your life and haven't at least tried learning programming, I would highly recommend it. It's really fun to have an idea and be able to go in and create it and try and figure out how to do it. And for me, I feel a lot better about hyper focusing on creating an application, than I do when playing a video game or something. 

If you're interested, just get on YouTube and look up some tutorials, or download a PDF of a book (not that I encourage pirating, but a lot of books have PDF's that somebody uploaded online).

I really hope this helps somebody or encourages somebody to look into programming!

61bcuq,1,2017-03-24,[M4F] For Fertile Minds,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61bcuq/m4f_for_fertile_minds/,"Note: Old prompts and scenarios are still open. Feel free to suggest anything you like, too. I'll at least give you feedback, and I am singularly difficult to offend.

Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

My first real girlfriend and I lasted close to 4 years together. I went through a rough patch and while I wasn't mean I wasn't caring... I get that.

She made out with a co-worker she mentioned she felt attracted to and then didn't tell me about it for close to 4 months.

Rough patch wasn't over and that didn't help. By this point, when we fought (harsh words we didn't even yell but it wasn't a discussion either) I stopped being the composed guy I am and was an asshole a couple of times. Even went through her phone once, found out she messaged the guy she made out with to sort of end any leftover feelings... Only for him to say that he REALLY wanted her, wanted to sleep with her sooooo badly. To which she replied: right now I can't. ""Later maybe?"" He answered... She sent him a little kiss.

I AM aware I was wrong for looking through her phone, no need to beat me up for it I already have.

Sure, sounds like a fucked up mess but she and I... We really clicked. We were in sync in a lot of things... She loved me and took care of me, as did I. I was always straightforward, honest and in hindsight she wasn't to a 100% but... She tried. I helped her through lots of stuff... Until my rough patch.

Well, part of why I was having a hard time was I just got my degree and I was unemployed, recently ending a paid internship in what I now realize was a horrible work environment.

She, an engineer too, had an amazing job for someone who also recently graduated. Well what do you know? They're hiring. I'm a bit depressed, we're in a rough patch... But she loves me and wants the best for me so she puts in a good word.

I went to the interview, felt I nailed it... Didn't hear more from them. By this point I've spent a year looking for a stable job so... Kinda used to it.

She said she couldn't take the pressure anymore, felt too guilty about cheating and says I don't treat her like I used to, that I don't love her anymore. She said she needed some space but doesn't think I'll give it to her (I always tried to fix things by talking about them... Felt like the right thing to do so she was probably right about this). We broke up. I got the job.

Ecstatic I accepted and once the call ended I realized I'm stuck with her and the guy she made out with. We didn't stay in touch after breaking up... I wanted to tell her but well I knew she knew I got the job, since it was close to her... And well she needed space right? Don't want to blow my chances as slim as they are.

First day on the job, she was kinda awkward so I tried talking to her. I expected some... Friendliness. Not in a ""Let's get back together"" way but in a ""I know it's hard for you too"" way (although tbh getting back together sounded amazing to me).

Well I was met with cold disdain and a ""I've dated other guys... There's one that's special nothing serious yet"". This is a month after we ended our almost 4 year relationship. Felt like crap. Kept it together, talked some more... She ended the conversation with a casual ""You know what? That guy and me... We ARE serious"".

For the next couple of months she was an asshole tag teamed with the most lovable person ever. She stood up for me when people talked behind my back but then when we were alone made sure to remind me of this new and amazing guy she's dating. Made me feel bad for not moving on only 2 months after it ended, calling me immature and boosting herself for the amazing way she was able to move on, then helped me make friends with our coworkers. Avoided work trips where I might feel uncomfortable. It was.. weird and confusing.

Moving on was hell but there I stood 2 months into my awesome job. Finally had the guts to tell her to stop talking to me altogether, didn't wanna speak with her again. She agreed. A week later she came by to chat. I chatted too, couldn't help myself. Next day told her again to leave me alone. Her eyes got a bit watery but she agreed. Week later... She comes by to chat. We chatted. Next day, again I tell her I want nothing, this time a bit more aggressively. I want nothing... At all. I don't want us to get back together I don't want to be friends... Nada. She almost cried which moved me quite a bit and I told her I just needed space... Wasn't over her. Implied in a way I was seeing someone else, which is a lie. Thought it might help somehow. 

A week goes by... Two weeks. ""This is it"" I think to myself. Well she saw a season finale of this series we watched together and that not that many people we know do. It WAS pretty moving and stirred up some stuff she has dealt with her whole life... Heavy stuff. Sooooo she came by to talk about it. We chatted.

A week or so went by and I made up my mind to tell her yet again to leave me alone. This time I'll be an asshole I don't care anymore. Two days ago I met her outside our workplace. Greet her and tell her I want to talk. She says she doesn't want us to talk ever again.

Hell. No. I tell her if she sees the irony in this... Well we did talk. I tell her this time to picture her new magnificent bf finding out her ex told her to leave him alone thrice now and she just comes back. I tell her to leave me alone. I want nothing at all, not now not ever. We're done, she ended it. That's it.

She teared up. This is a girl I was friends with for 6 years, dated for almost 4. I can't stand her crying... Lowered my tone and told her that, maybe if she just told me everything she wants to tell me she'll feel better about us being over.

I expected her to be angry, resentful, to make me feel awful and just unload everything... But then feeling better and actually leaving me alone. I got something along the lines of...

""Thank you. You were amazing to me, you helped me through a lot of things and I wouldn't have made it without you. I know it took a lot of you to forgive me for lying and even if you WERE an ass for a while I acknowledge it had to be hard. I tried to compensate for lying and you didn't do anything in response... But even if the last couple months were bad, you are amazing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been since you got in. That whole 'Im over you' deal on your first day... That was me being angry at you, wanting to hurt you. I'm sorry. I can't believe right now I am in this situation, never felt like the type of person who would be in a relationship while mulling over the last one. But I realize that I am. I still care for you, you're amazing, I missed you like hell and it's been really complicated. I know what you did for me wasn't an obligation... All those times you stood by me... I'll always be thankful.""

Well... Fuck me. Told our goodbyes and went our separate ways.

...I miss her. Like I haven't in months. I really really miss her."

I managed to land an internship a year ago but it was due to massive luck on my side as I almost lost hope days before. Due to a learning disability I struggled in school just to now get back to a 3.0 gpa. 

I get even more depressed when I see people bring up the importance of networking because I don't have too many friends and just can't develop that deep connection. 

On top of that I don't have very much experience with the opposite sex. Just one relationship that lasted a month and a bunch of first dates that went nowhere. Since I am 27 time is ticking to find that perfect wife as a girl who is 25 and single is either a whore has either fucked a bunch of random guys, or is significantly overweight. I'd rather die than marry a whore.  No 22 year old girl will ever marry a 30 year old man. Even then 22 year old girl who is single is very likely to already hooked up with 15 random guys. 

Meanwhile I see others with awesome jobs, cute innocent girlfriends and fun weekends. 

My mom thinks my body sabatoge itself from all the depression I take in but how can I fight it if things don't look good for me. She recommended me some books but they only explained the problem not any solutions.  She calls me selfish for not thinking of others but how can I when thinks just look so bleak?

I really don't want to kill myself but I'd rather not drag on this miserable existence. "
61bo48,0,2017-03-24,A senior lead with 1 year of dev experience...,Tabgokogbat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61bo48/a_senior_lead_with_1_year_of_dev_experience/,"Hi all,

I want to get (back) into CS but I am finding my title is getting in the way.  I have essentially been working in operations for the past three years and have risen to the rank of ""lead senior service performance engineer"" - leading a team of 4 others.

My CS experience is limited to several summers of internships in undergrad and graduate school, and one year working at a defense company in-between undergrad and my master's program. 

I have never worked on code on a team, or had senior members around to provide mentorship or even had code reviews.

When I apply places, or when recruiters reach out to me, they always seem to be expecting a senior developer or senior data scientist (thanks to my job title).  I typically get dropped out of the running due to lack of experience and/or not meeting their expectations for a senior role.

I want to move out of my current position, despite its healthy salary and job title, due to the infuriating division between ops and dev at my work.  I am fighting the division now...But it is so draining.

Any advice on applying to companies for much more junior level positions than what I am currently holding?

61btu4,3,2017-03-24,Rights as a graphic Design Intern!,schneuke,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/61btu4/rights_as_a_graphic_design_intern/,So about two years ago I took an unpaid internship at an advertising agency and while I was there I was appointed to create a logo for this girl's non profit . The logo I created got the green light and they chose to use it ! So I left the internship and maybe a year later I see on my Facebook feed the logo and her non profit page. I'm curious because I had a professor that told me that at an internship an agency can't use the logo you created and call it theirs . What do y'all think???
61c1sq,1,2017-03-24,Not sure which project I should join for summer internship,granny-mist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61c1sq/not_sure_which_project_i_should_join_for_summer/,"I'm going to be an intern for Google EP this summer. I got two host-matching calls back to back for different projects. 

The first project made me really excited because the host was really chill, the project itself is perfect for me, and it's in Mountain View (first choice location). 

The second project also had a really nice host and we had a really nice conversation, but the project didn't interest me as much and the location is one of my last choices tbh (NYC). The host immediately said she was interested in working with me, while the first project's host didn't say that.

I already told my recruiter that I was interested in working with the first project, but I don't know what to do about the second one because I'm not as interested. I would say no, but I also don't want to start this process over again if the first project's host says no to working with me. Here's a pros and cons list to get a better feel of what I'm factoring:


**First Project:**

**PROS:**

* Great location

* Better familiarity with project and more interest in it

* Good host

**CONS:**

* expensive to live in MTV

* I would be on the other side of the country from family and SO

* host might say no

~~

**Second Project:**

**PROS:**

* Good host, already said yes to working with me

* Closer to family and SO

* A bit cheaper to live in NYC? (not sure though...)

**CONS:**

* I don't like NYC AT ALL

* Not familiar with project and not as interested


I would really appreciate advice and insight on this!"

61cjbs,11,2017-03-24,Any advice about AI careers that aren't software engineering?,rosesandivy,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/61cjbs/any_advice_about_ai_careers_that_arent_software/,"I'm a Master student in AI trying to figure out what career I want to pursue in the future. Problem is, I don't really know what I want to do, and I don't really know what my options are. I have a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and what I'm most interested in is the human and philosophical side of AI. For example I have taken courses in cognitive modeling, modal logics, nonmonotonic logics, intelligent agents, philosophy of mind, etc. 


I feel like most jobs outside of academia that AI students end up doing are actually more computer science jobs. Although I do have some experience with programming (only introductory level courses though, in Java, Python, R, Prolog and some others) and I enjoy it, I'm not sure that that's the path I want to take. 


I have also never had a job that's relevant to AI, and I've never done an internship. I just feel kind of inexperienced. 

Do you guys have any advice about careers that I could pursue?"

I'm currently a developer intern who is thinking about following more of a security analyst career. But I have a few questions about my future in these two fields.


I don't really know about the job titles but if we assume the same time experience, let's say 5 to 10 years. Also, for the sake of argument, I would like to avoid the huge companies (as in the big 4 mostly), just to keep it more to the earth.


The questions are:

- Difference in salary between the two;

- Difference in job availability;

- If I decide to go for Security, how hard it is to make the switch to a developer job;

- Any other interesting info you might wanna add is welcome!


Thank you!"

I just started working part time with company A as a tech, doing some intern level engineering stuff while I'm still in school, etc. They pay me $14/hr, it's interesting work, and they seem like they will want me to stay during the summer(starting about a month from now). 
Company B is a startup, also wants me to do intern stuff over the summer, and sent an offer starting me at $20/hr. Also interesting work, but seems a bit unstable to me given the nature of a startup business. But here's the kicker, they want me to decide fast, by monday, not giving me time to talk to the other employer, and see if they want me full time, and at what rate. The good news is there's no contract involved, so at any time I can give notice and terminate my agreement with them, and can stay with company A should they hit me with a better/more stable offer. 

Advice? I'm open to any you have."

So a few months ago, I found out that I got Temple's Presidential (Full-Tuition) scholarship and a $4000 stipend to be used for research or study abroad. Here is my financial aid: http://imgur.com/u939EOv 


Yesterday, I found out that I got Drexel's liberty scholarship which is also full-tuition, except with grants, I recieved 75K in scholarships so it covers everything and goes beyond the cost. Here is a picture of my financial aid package: http://imgur.com/a/A7MIm


I'm still waiting to hear back from Vanderbilt and Brown, but I mainly focused on Temple and Drexel.

My dilemma, I guess, is that I do not know which school would be better? For temple, I really like the community, the school spirit, and how it focuses on having interdisciplinary education (I wanted to minor in either Spanish or a specific history minor), and how I would be able to study abroad. My worries though, is that Temple's engineering program is not that well-know and the program is small. I am worried that it would be really difficult to get internships during the summer. I've been volunteering at a lab at temple for the past two years so the connects could help but who knows. Also, I would have to take out around ~4K in loans every year which I do not want to (first-gen, dislike having to owe anyone).

On the other hand, Drexel has an amazing engineering program (5-year/3co-op). I would like to go into aerospace when I finish college so I feel like Drexel could open those doors to me. Also, due to the financial aid package + co op, I would have a lot of money saved up which I could spend on finding a job farther away. But at drexel, I feel it is too stem-focused, too dead (no school spirit etc), focused too much on getting a job instead of enjoying your college experience, and I wouldn't be able to study abroad, and the schedule is really tough imo (10 week quarters), which might make it difficult to join clubs AND do research. 

So my question is do I go for Drexel, which gives me the most money and opportunity but is really stressful and has a dead community, or do I pick Temple, who gives me less money and less opportunity, but has a school environment I enjoy?

But what's tough at both schools is the diversity. I am a female so it kinda sucks that there is just so few girls. 

I would like to hear your imput into what made you decide to go to your school, and what you found to be the most important qualities to you! :)

61d0of,1,2017-03-24,Advice on pausing studies,mateoat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61d0of/advice_on_pausing_studies/,"Hey eveyone. I'm currently finishing my second year of 'Systems Engineering' (It's actually some kind of mixture between CS and Software Engineering) in my country. I have a scholarship and without it I wouldn't be able to attend this school (I'd be able to attend a public one though). The thing is that I feel like I've take the wrong approach to learning during the first 3 semesters. I currently have almost no mathematical background of any kind, even though I've already finished all math-related courses, even some of them with perfect scores. The thing is that I have to take quite a few (for my learning method, 6/7) courses every term because of scholarship requirements, which means that I end up learning just to pass the tests and then remember almost nothing at all because of lack of time to really understand the fundamental concepts. I did that with most of the math courses (and the DB course, nice mistake) in order to focus more on the CS related ones. I think it worked well enough to keep the scholarship and learn the basics of programming (specially in terms of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms), but I feel like I'll never be able to pursue postgraduate studies with conficence considering my current math background, and that it took too long to learn just very basic stuff.

Now, my corcern is that I'm getting 'close' to graduation (and an internship I have to do just before that) and I've noticed two things: that I know nothing of even basic real world development (e.g. creating a basic Adroid app that connects to a database) and know even less of math in case that I want the replacement for intership (or job) which is joining a investigation group.

I've already had offers to join investigation groups, but they asked me to learn a few things before doing that (Computational Geometry for the CAD group and basic Biology for the Biological computing one, for instance, because those subjects are not in my curricula and I don't already know about them). The thing is that I have very few time to do that, so I didn't accept. I also had some kind of offer to join a Graph related group, and even though I'm informed about plenty graph algorithms, I can only implement them and can't really prove why the work and don't even fully understand why they actually work in some cases, which I know would be a problem there.

My idea was to learn that back background I've missing through MOOCs/books (or even joining a public school to study math) so I can join the interesting groups and take the cool courses (in my last semester I have to take 4/5 postgraduate courses and also have 2 free election courses left), but that probably won't happen because of time. My last concern is that after graduation I'll have to start earning money somehow, so probably won't study anymore, and then will have fundamental concepts missing basically forever.

I've thought of stopping for a semester to get 'in-shape' for what I've discussed but, would that be wise? I turned 18 years-old a few months ago btw. 

In case that stopping is not a good idea, is it 'safe' to get into market with my current conceptual gaps? 

Thanks in advance. If you know about learning techniques to speed up my learning in the mentioned fields it'd be awesome to hear about them too.

Goddamn god forsaken Mexicans, stealing titles from hardworking fourth-generation Americans. My grandpappy didn’t murder his way through the Cossacks just for some Mexicans to come and take it! Anyway, let’s get on with the fucking rankings. Mexicans. Take it down, intern!

##The Singles Rankings (feat. “Big Bad” Barry Coronado)

1. **Maverick (WC)** - Punky no-brewster over here drinks the Pibb like it’s some sort of alcohol, like vodka, or American vodka. He carries the world title around his waist, and refuses to let anyone steal it from him. You better, kid. I don’t want a fucking Frenchman as my world champion.

2. **Dalidus Nova (UIC)** - Dirty goddamn Canadian stealing the titles from hardworking Americans! He’s got that good ol’ Canadian strength, as in leg strength for flippy shit. He’s probably the best Old Crow that money could buy. Mmm, if I could buy that Canadian Vanilla… What? Oh, uh, next one.

3. The Mark Dutch - Good ol’ Kaiser’s got himself a title match. That’s good for him, it’s not like Germans getting power lead to anything bad. Goddamn Brits just allowing this to happen. This is how the Great War started, when “Cummerbund” Heinrich Barr took the European Wrestling Championship!

14. Andrade Allegra - Fucking Spanish anarchists. What is this, Civil War-era Republican Spain? Anyway, this dirty fucker stole my boy’s title shots! He’s a thief, I tell you! This is how the Mexican-American War started, when the homeless kid stabbed me! What do you mean, that’s not how history works?

25. Jack Anchor - This new kid on the block, he’s got potential. Fresh new talent with the voice of an angel. Enjoys several different types of burgers, stand-up American kid. He’s for America, by America. Has a golden retriever named Rover. His parents are stand-up Americans.

5. Miles Alpha

4. Louis Blackwater

8. Murphy Twain 

7. Sonny Carson

9. Ryan Sunshine

11. Eric Appelbaum

12. Teddy Coronado - Greatest of all time.

17. Klutch

19. Doctor De La Sangre

18. Brendan Byrne

15. Andrew Garcia

22. Stephen Romero

16. Joey McCarty

21. Tyson Zamura

22. Kyle Scott

13. Carl Jones

23. Eric Matthews

24. Kevin Klondike

25. Robert Warlock

25. Super Fan Alice

##The Tag Team Official Power Rankings

1. **The BBC** - The blacks have got it good, there’s no one that can even challenge for their titles. It’s good they aren’t race-mixers. What? Oh, that’s inappropriate? Fucking PCoholics, next you’ll say I can’t say ni-

2.  El Amigos - These fucking Italians want a shot at the gold, I say, don’t give it to them. They’re beasts from the other East, as in, the South, so they aren’t too good. You want anarchists to run the place? Because they'll just remove your power to run the place. 

3. H.E.R.O. - They haven't done much, recently, but they're a cohesive fighting force.  I wouldn't be surprised if this group came back together to take the titles, as a veteran of this business.

At the moment I am deciding between CSULB and still waiting for UCI and Cal Poly Pomona to respond. A quick search on INDEED gives a relatively small list of engineering internships compared to the other schools. I'm scared going to UC Davis will make it vary hard to find the major factor in getting a job after graduation. I also don't want to be forced to intern somewhere and learn skills in a part of an industry I was not interested in due to sheer limited opportunities.

Other than this one issue, I'm in love with Davis. Visited back in February and everything about it was sooo pleasant. I could really feel at home there. Also housing was cheaper and nicer compared to other school areas. If the internship issue wasn't the case I wouldn't have applied anywhere else. 

Can any engineering students provide me with some kind of idea as far their internship experiences go.

61dtfe,3,2017-03-25,Seeking advice for transferring to an ivy,summersadvocate,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/61dtfe/seeking_advice_for_transferring_to_an_ivy/,"##I'm a freshman studying computer science at a mid-tier UC school. Since starting university, I've generated enough income that I lost some of my financial aid eligibility. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm looking to transfer in to an Ivy League or other top computer science focused school that can potentially offer me a scholarship. If i'm going to pay the same amount to attend an ivy league, I would prefer the more prestigious school and change in atmosphere during junior year.

I was hoping to hear about others' experience with transferring from a UC to an ivy league. 

&amp;nbsp;


##Some questions I would have are:

&amp;nbsp;

1) What was your GPA and how high should I keep my GPA? I messed up for my first 2 quarters and got a 3.92, and I'm hoping that hasn't set me too far behind.

&amp;nbsp;

2) What are some criteria that would set me apart from other applicants in the transfer pool? I've been able to pick up 2 software engineering internships (one during Fall and Winter quarter and one during the summer) and leadership positions at my school, but I know this may not be enough to keep me competitive.

&amp;nbsp;

3) Can I reach out to University admissions through Linkedin like I do with my job search?

&amp;nbsp;

4) If you were admitted, did the university offer you scholarships?

&amp;nbsp;


I would appreciate any advice and links to methodologies to increase my chances of acceptance. 

TL;DR: Freshman at a UC looking to transfer to an Ivy League. Seeking advice on what I can do to increase my chances."

I used to work at a tech startup till last week, when I was laid off. Now I am currently on a work permit in the country so I don't have much time to find a new job that can support my work permit. If  something doesn't work out soon, I'll have to ditch everything here and go back home.

Yes, a job at a tech startup doesn't seem that bad and I even received my work permit after a year at the company. But honestly I had lost interest in the job after the first 6 months. But I am a lazy ass so I kept riding the wave.

Speaking of lazy and lucky:

When I moved to US, I had received admissions from various universities, but my visa was denied multiple times, I had an undergrad degree in computer engineering and I was applying for graduate CE/EE degrees. My relative works at one of the universities and he helped me to get financial aid at his university and an assistantship position that covers my tuition and pays me stipend. But the catch was that the degree and assistantship was in the CS department and not CE, which meant for me to catch up on a lot of coding. Talked to my parents and decided to make the jump, reapplied for visa with this financial aid and I was approved to come here.

When the period of assistantship was over, I received another teaching assistantship for being at the right place at the right time. What happened was that I was having a chat with one of my professors and he was looking for people to assist him in his 2 upcoming classes. He just asked me and I obviously accepted.

I even received an internship at a large tech company thanks to my roommate and another professor. Remember that I had to catch up on coding? Well I never did. I am a smart guy, if I put my mind and my time into something, I can grasp things pretty quickly. But yea, I never did that. I always procrastinate any task till the last possible minute. I was not prepared for the interview at this company which my professor refereed me, but it turned out that my roommate and his friends were interviewing me so my bad code and inability to answer questions was ignored during that interview and they said positive things about me which got me the job.

Internship was over, I graduated and I was burning of precious time playing video games and procrastinating and I did that for a whole year. But I also had a safe space of a research job which again my relative helped me get to at least have a job. I felt horrible each day I woke up because I was living off someone else's favor and not doing anything on my own at all. I was rarely applying to jobs, the interviews I got were via referrals and I obviously tanked the interviews because I could never get my ass to practice coding. One day, this prof that helped me get the internship tells me that he's joining a startup and after he joined he brought me in as well! And guess what, I did not even give a single interview for that job.

My parents visited me here last summer, but since then my roommate (yes the one who helped me get the internship) left. All my college friends also left and joined their respective jobs and I felt really really lonely after that. My days consisted of lying on my bed or playing video games to pass time. I stopped cooking, stopped working out, relied on deliveries and did barely any work. I lost all my motivation (well if I had any) and desire or hunger to work and get better at coding. If I think about it, yes I honestly feel interested in the field I am in. But why am I still not motivated to work? I am lazy to even follow my hobbies. I want to get better at playing guitar, I want to play soccer again, I want to write on some topics I have in my mind for a while now, I want to read more books and I even want to get better at the video games I play. But I never end up doing any of this and I used to do all of it 3 years ago! I wanted to stay curled up in my safe space and any thoughts of going out and doing something started to scare me. My attention span shortened, I could not keep my eyes on a paragraph while reading and I have to use the mouse pointer for e-copies or a finger for books to keep my concentration on that thing. My sleeping pattern got broken up into 2 parts. I crashed after getting home from work and woke up 3-4 hours later and then obviously I could not sleep till I force myself to sleep early in the morning after which I have to be up for work again in 2-3 hours. I gained 44 lbs over 2 years. And yea, forget about dating. I talked to my friend about this and he said that this all might be depression, he genuinely cares about me so he calls me often so I don't deteriorate.

I had no motivation or cause of hunger to do any of these things. I was making good money and I did my job as such that it couldn't get me fired. In the back of my mind, I had read all the signs that the company may lay my branch off since the past couple months but I never did anything to get a new job. I wanted to prepare for interviews but as usual I kept procrastinating and postponing whatever interviews I got. I kept on riding the wave till that wave finally crashed.

I've given a couple interviews in the past week but I have failed. I have a few other interviews lined up but I am extremely nervous and stressed about them. I have always been lazy and not prepared for interviews which makes this task look so huge. I don't know where to start and that makes me do nothing. I am just lying on my bed for the first part of the day and then on my chair for the rest of the day and the actual quality time I put in is only ~2 hours.

I just woke up from my evening sleep and I started crying thinking of all this. My assistantships, my internships and my job were all something that were literally handed to me. They were all favors and I never really had to work hard for any single one of them. All this comfort I received so easily in my life, all this luck has created a comfort zone which I feel is difficult to get out of. I feel like I cannot do anything on my own at all.

Anyways, the clock's ticking and I know I am smart. Hopefully I am able to sort this shit out soon but more importantly hopefully I am able to get out of my comfort zone and DO THINGS!"

As an international applicant, unfortunately, I don't know too much about it: my only source is its homepage website. I am hoping you guys can answer some of the questions I have about this program and other similar courses in the school.

First off, how competitive is the program? How many apply and how many are accepted? 

How different is this program from the Music &amp; Computer Science Major? 

Do I have to audition for this program? How stacked should my C.V be in order to compete for this program?

How is life after the program? Does the program help students with internships and whatnot?

How is the current audio-related (possibly studio) job market in Victoria or BC in general? What are some careers one can pursue after completing this program?

I am a computer science MS graduate. I have been on job hunt for long  time and now I landed a couple of offers. I need advice on choosing between two offers:
One is 6 month internship offer in bay area as software developer from a database company with possibility of full-time conversion when req opens up and another is a full-time quality engineer offer in NC. I am really confused about which one to choose. 

Internship offer:
Pros
 1. It's in bay area
 2. It's a developer role
Cons
1. It's internship, don't know when the req will open up for full-time. Chances r that I ll become unemployed once it ends.

Full-time:
Pros
1. It's a company I interned with last year
2. Better pay than the above internship offer
Cons
1. QE role - I worked as QE before I started MS and it was one of the reasons I decided to take up MS
2. It's in North Carolina​

61evbr,3,2017-03-25,"Third year student, feeling like I'm losing all interest in CS. How can I change that?",apatheticaf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61evbr/third_year_student_feeling_like_im_losing_all/,"As a kid, I pretty much wanted to major in CS and work in the field since I knew that it was actually a field. I went to a high school with a CS program, and during those 4 years, I really enjoyed it. I thought that data structures and algorithms and how they abstracted problems were so cool! I genuinely never thought I'd ever outgrow what it felt like to finally solve a problem or find that one bug or ""woah, I've never thought about this that way"". I'm not sure why, but ever since last semester, I've just been steadily losing interest. This semester, I can't even be assed to go to class anymore. I feel like nothing I'm doing is worthwhile, or compelling, and school feels like a grind. Some people look forward to weekends, or summers, or whatever, I'm just looking forward to the day I never have to take another fucking CS class again. The idea of doing this for the rest of my life makes me literally cry. I used to be really excited about programming; it was a hobby and something I wanted to do. Now, even reading my assignment specs makes me feel dread; when I do read it, I feel like there's this mental roadblock between me and the text; I have to reread it over and over to even understand what it's saying because my brain seems to want so desperately to just not do it. I don't know what happened at all; I'm not struggling in classes, I've got decent internships with sought after companies, by all means I should be very happy with CS and where my life is going? I've wanted this since I was like in 6th grade, and now I just feel kind of... lost.

I'm sorry for the long rant. I just really needed to get it out there because I feel like none of my friends understand.

Has anyone been through something similar? Did it ever get better? Did switching major focus help? Is industry any better? "

I suffer from anxiety and I have just started a journey to try and cope with it (mainly meditation), but obviously that's going to take time. However, I have this specific phobia, which is fear of going out alone. It's not social anxiety, because what scares me isn't interacting with other people/socializing. What I'm scared of is becoming victim of a crime, or an accident, of getting hurt in general. I believe the main reason is that I do not trust myself to be capable of doing anything by myself, of being independent, so I think that if I try to do something trusting only my abilities, it's going to turn out bad. Basically I believe that I have zero self-esteem, and this is the source of all my problems. I have ups and downs, sometimes I feel better because maybe someone complimented me on something, but after a while this feeling goes away and I go back to thinking that I'm useless. So, I also tend to be anxious about the opinion of others, and I always want to be up to other people's expectation, but always feel that I don't deserve any respect. This is also true for my profession, I often think that I'm an ""impostor"", that I lack the skills and competences to do my job.

But going back to my fear of going out alone, it probably doesn't help that I have never lived alone, not even for a short time, I have always been with family or friends, plus I live in a not-so-big town, very peaceful and quite, where nothing ever happens and everyone knows you and so on. So I feel relatively safe when going around my town, but the idea of being alone in a big city scares me. For example, there is a big city close to my town, and every time I go there I need to be with other people. Once I happened to be alone for a couple of hours and I panicked, just froze and waited until my friends picked me up. 
Now this is a problem not just because, well, I can't live like this. It's even more urgent because I'm probably going to move to London (I'm from Italy) for an internship and I'm going to find myself alone in one of the biggest cities in the world. So it's kind of a mess.

I'm sorry for this very, very long post, and I apologize if this has already been discussed. I don't even know what I'm looking for in this community, perhaps just some support of any kind.
Thank you if you managed to read all this!"

To put it into context, last year I took up secondary studies in a field I had originally wanted to go but refrained because of a few bad teachers. The problem was not that I did not understand the second field but the amount of classes I had to attend (41 credits per semester in total) and about half of the classes in that course were unrelated to what I wanted to learn. Needless to say because of this I failed a couple of classes and lost my scholarship in the process.

Then I decided to do a semester abroad. Which turned out to be a nightmare as well because I had a hard time adjusting. I will probably fail yet another class because I took up too many subjects once again.

Now I am coming home in less than a week to do my internship and start the next semester after that... which will, once again, have +40 credits, regardless if I minimise what I need to attend. If I find out I failed a class here it might bump up to +45 credits for one semester.

I want to be an overachiever. In school I went to 3 different tutors and took up the maximum amount of exams. I used to go to MMA, dance classes, swimming and jogging all in the same week. I used to be an active member in 4 different student organisations all at the same time. But I simply cannot keep up with this much stuff happening at the same time and it is hurting me both academically and emotionally.

I want a girlfriend. I want to finally have the body I want. I want to live for myself at least once where I don't need to spend the entire day glued to class material. I want to work for a bit, it does not matter if it is a shit job or not. I am completely reliant on my parents to pay for everything I have and it makes me feel lazy.

It is why I want to take a year off from university to... well, find some sort of job and just do nothing for a while. I spend barely any time with my friends or my other hobbies. I want to catch up on a movie marathon with a friend for 2 years now, as well as finally play through a few video games.

But I don't know if this is the right way to go... I know I will feel like shit because I will be a year behind everybody I know, I will feel like I had failed in my life to have gap year right before I finish university... but at the same time I will have to go into the military and then immediately pursue my master's degree, after which I will have to seek employment in my field... this means I still have at least 4 years to go and then put all my focus on my ""real job"". but I do not want that yet. I don't want to be ""adulting"" all the time when I barely had any time to be a teenager. I attended zero parties in school, the only friends I made were the nerdy types and my ""social age"" is stuck somewhere between 16 and 18.

I do not want to be running headfirst into life and end up completely miserable because now I have to have kids, get married, etc. ... I will not get married until I had at least a few girlfriends, I am not a believer in ""love at first sight"" and I am completely sure that I will be miserable if I end up marrying the first person I find when I'm +25 years old. I still hate on myself because my first relationship was when I was 19 which lasted 2 months due to a shortage of time, when everyone I know had some sort of experience at 16, 17, etc.

I know this is stupid, but maybe someone here will throw in their two cents on where should my life be going."

As you already know we have a new update and now we have Rapid Rivers, AI Snail and some more small features like you can use ability on Foods and others. 

I just wanted to give very special thank to Stan, the owner of the game who believed in my abilities and given me a chance in a life time to prove the guts. I was so nervous throughout the ""intern"" phase that I might not be able to fulfill Stan's requirements. My first addition in the game was on 14th Feb when ""tracking arrows"" were introduced which were removed in hours after getting negative feedback. And that's where I started to think I am having a tough time. 

But that was just the beginning... that failure lead into putting 1000% percent and willing to do something unique that stands out the rest. I kept going through the pile of posts on Reddit, ran all my thoughts and put more time in thinking about what should I do that impresses the Mope Community and specially Stan. 

I found ""Fish Throw"" idea on reddit, and I developed it. Stan liked, so many of you liked it but it failed to get that ""woow"" factor that would make it official. So it failed again. Not that bad but yet it was much better effort than the last one.  

Then, 5-6 days ago I found a River idea on our subreddit I sent the post link to Stan and asked him how does he feel about it? He liked the idea and said we can do that he took his notes. Then I asked him what if I develop it and if its good we will add it in updates? He gave me the Green signal and said, ""Sure, try it man"". Then I started working on it. During the development River was not approved or thought of if it would be part of the game. But I literally put a lot effort in it to make it happen. When ever I needed help from Stan he gave me the tips even spent hours to explain each part of the game how it works. 

When I gave him first demo his words were ""Wow Its looking great"". And that's where I was so much happy that yes, its going to be part of the game. Then Stan started to take more interest in River and wanted me to finish it. According to Stan, more than 95% of The River work was done by me. But really had a huge responsibility. Because it would be end of me if I hadn't done it. There wont be a 4th chance. Though I have over 20 years of coding experience but still to make things work in someone else's code is not a child's play. I learned his code and his logic and his approach to deal with the stuff. And now I am almost following Stan's foot steps and thinking like him. 

So, I am here to tell everyone and specially Stan (though I have told him already) that he is my Professor, I have huge respect for him. No matter if I am elder, more experienced and well equipped but still I respect him just like one would respect to his/her teacher or mentor. Nothing was possible without him and he is a good human being too. So all credit goes to him. 

During last update, we both stayed up for like 30+ hours.  We both helped each other. So all credit goes to Stan he is super cool to work with. We both stayed all day/night to make this happen. Skipped meals, no water, no coffee, even ignored family and there was only one thing in mind ""work work work"". And our minds kept saying ""Make it happen before going to bed"". And we literally could have gone to bed twice before that update. There was huge pressure from whole Mope community. 10-days passed like nothing. And we both had to put everything on offer to make it happen. So the end product is in front of you.

We will keep putting our more than 100% to bring more entertainment and excitement. :)

61finv,6,2017-03-25,Accepting a temporary contract and exit opps after controlling internship,spe617,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/61finv/accepting_a_temporary_contract_and_exit_opps/,"Hey guys,


I've been studying Corporate Finance and wanted to pursue such a career, but ended up doing an internship in one of the largest automakers (the offer was too good to reject). Unfortunately, I've been placed in the controlling department - an area that I don't like a lot. 


Recently, I've been offered to stay for 5 more months with a full-time contract. However, I am not sure if I would accept this, because it's very unlikely that I'll be offered a position afterwards. Still, the money is good and could help me cover my living costs and save some extra. 


Anyhow, I am graduating soon and wanted to do an internship in banking, because I lack the banking experience which would be relevant if I want to go for a career in banking. 
I also have internship experience in business development &amp; strategy from mid-size and SMEs.


Thus, I have the following questions:

1) With no banking experience, but ~1.5y of internship experience and a major in corporate finance would it be difficult to land a job in banking/ big 4(no auditing, though)? Not necessarily investment banking... (I also live in one of the financial centres/ hubs)

2) Would you opt for the temporary contract or would you rather do an internship (I haven't landed any internship yet)


Thanks a lot to all read until here :) and I would be glad to read your suggestions.

61fkpw,24,2017-03-25,Should I tell my boss about my Crohn's,caimca,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/61fkpw/should_i_tell_my_boss_about_my_crohns/,"So I been on prednisone 40 mg for the past 2 month and now I think Monday I can finally start my medication imuran I think. I had to put it off for two weeks because I got sick with bronchitis and had to wait until I got better. Well I am feeling better and done with the antibiotics on Monday. So my question is should I tell my boss that I have Crohn's disease? I am worried that I going to have some side effects from the medication until my body gets used to it. Also even before the prednisone and now the  immunosuppressant I always  catch a lot of viruses, and infections. So the amount that I going to get sick might increase because of the two medications So, I might miss some work and I don't want her to get mad or anything because I want a good letter of recommendation after I am done with the internship in May.


Then in the fall I am going to be starting college, in your experience dose registering in college for disability help improve college any? I guess my question is would it protect me if I have to miss any classes? Thanks any help and advice in advance!



EDIT: Again thank you everyone for all the advice , I think all I needed was the support that others with crohns told their boss and it didn't hurt their job any. So on Monday I going to tell her about it, she been asking questions for awhile now about things like food and I always avoided the questions. So I guess telling her will be for the best."

**Name/Alias:** Dr. Cyrus Tilden/ Somnus(Midnight)
 
**Age:** 40

**Physical appearance:** [Tall unkempt man](http://taintedsilence.deviantart.com/art/CDS-21-updated-161704173) dressed in a shabby trench coat. His shaggy dirty blond hair seems to suffer from permanent bed head accompanied by a minimum of day old stubble. Often seen in a suit and tie or his trench coat but like the rest of his appearance it suffers from a certain degree of neglect. The fact that his wrinkled clothing has become his trademark speaks volumes to his general appearance.

**Mentality:**  Brilliant and motivated even though his outward appearance and behaviors often make people believe the opposite. He is within the category of parahumans whose powers take a drastic toll on the capes mind. Even though his thought process disorganized from the constant mental prods from his power, he is highly observant of his surroundings. The price of his powers was practically becoming a high functioning schizophrenic. Due to this, he honestly can only stand 8 hours awake before becoming over stimulated. He is seen to be a bit eccentric due his many odd habits, ticks and behaviors. These habits are concessions made from the countless voices of his alter egos. In his paperwork he is labeled as having an immune disorder that leads to constant fatigue, this of course is a forgery to hide the need to sleep 16 hours a day for the sake of his power, this is not to say that he is not still dead tired all the time.`  

**Back-story:** Cyrus was the son of Anarchy a nationally known villain from the golden age of parahumans. Anarchy was the kind of villain that the Birdcage was built for. If it weren't for one of the investigating detectives Anarchy's twin boys would have been orphans when he was finally caught.  Pulling a few strings Detective Tilden was able to take in the young boys that he found hiding in a cupboard under the sink. It is thanks to Tilden agreeing to adopt the boys and that it kept Anarchy's children out of the Medias spotlight. Cyrus's adopted father strove to teach him right from wrong, always trying to keep him and his brother on the straight and narrow. His Brother Markus unfortunately never really took his new fathers teaching to heart, but he kept his nose relatively clean. Wanting to do right with his father, Cyrus set himself on a path of following in Tildens footsteps while his brother seemed to grow more distant.

Cyrus aimed to join the force, solve crimes and help people from a very young age. Unfortunately, he often lacked the physical abilities to do such. It is because of this that he eventually delved into the academic side of crime fighting.  Going into college, He studied Criminology, with a specialization in parahumans. When he got his first job, he found he had a knack for it. In his internship, he traveled around following the aftermath of some the nation's most violent villains.  Its was during one of those trips that he was left the sole survivor of an attack enacted by the Hallowed.  Unfortunately it was during this trip that he ended up meeting up with his estranged brother.   Markus was running a small backroom gambling den that unfortunately brought Cyrus closer to the Hallowed than any Intern would ever want. Somehow, be it luck or some twisted long game from the psychopaths Cyrus was left alive. Markus's body was never found.  Cyrus will never admit what happened that night but It was during this event that he triggered. A part of him fundamentally broke from this experience and from this his power became both his coping mechanism and a curse in a way.  The shard latched onto this and the first of his alternate personalities were formed. From there as his shard matured so did the number of personalities grow.

His drive to catch villains intensified after this incident. He started out in a support role as an analyst to the protectorate being called in to various cities to create profiles on its villain population.  During this time he tried to be a (sort of) solo hero. He coined the term Guardian Corps to disguise his heroes as a fully formed team. This deception only worked for a time. His reluctance to join the protectorate stemmed mostly from trying to find a way to stop the negative side of his power from manifesting. Unfortunately, as he quickly learned suppressing his villainous personalities only seemed to make them stronger.  It was during one of these periods that led one of his villains, a Brute by the name Johnny Jack Irons to lead hostile takeover of a local crime family. With a powerbase outside of Cyrus's control, Cyrus relented and joined the Protectorate, but not before constructing an elaborate lie. He resurrected his brother in name creating false reports of a long lost meeting between two brothers, one a hero and one a villain. It was then that the Villain known as Midnight was born to explain the villains following Somnus.
Midnight was borne; a master who manifests villain into this world to be the antithesis to Somnus who brought heroes into the world for the Protectorate. Due to a deal with the Director the true nature of his power is kept a secret from all but top brass and Protectorate members. As far as the public is concerned, his heroes within the Guardians simply travel around to lend aid to Protectorate teams. Given he has no plans to go out into the field, he is content to let his manifested heroes be the ones in the spot light.  Even Cyrus does not understand every aspect of his power that helps him keep the skeletons in his closet.
On the record Somnus has participated in a total of 7 End bringer attacks,  Silver and Kaiju have been in two attacks each while Angellus, Judge, &amp; Jack have been in one respectively. 


**Resources:**  Due to his double life  his resources are split into three categories; What he himself makes, What His guardians make(Dream),  &amp; What the Family make(Nightmare). With his tenure as a roaming parahuman Forensic Criminologist, a member of the protectorate  he makes almost 100K a year. He keeps an apartment separate from his room at the Protectorate (doesn't use often since he's often sleeping for 16 hours a day at the HQ.) Keeps a motorcycle to get around.
The Gaurdians don't make much given most of them devote themselves wholly to hero work, but some do make some money to make use of like that of hullahan or the occasional freelance bodygaurd work. Generally make enough to keep Hullahan working when he is manifested.

Being by design focused on selfish goals, his Villains tend to make much more than even Cyrus himself.   A large portion of their funds come from illegal activities but some like to keep appearances during their turn out in the open.  Most of these assets come from the actions of Johnny Jack Irons and him single handedly taking over the Morretti Crime family. Not including upkeep costs, On average the family makes a surplas of at least 300K in liquid assets a year. Jack keeps a specially modified armored truck as a means of transport due to being too heavy for anything else.   While he leaves behind a fair amount of infrastructure when he pulls roots to follow Cyrus. Jack has a core group of 30 armed men to make use of.  Jack has set down roots in town in the form of buying a gentlemen's club and a and an old low income building in a bad part of town.   Given Kaiju has been around long enough he has accumulated enough lab equipment to work which he keeps in a converted semi trailer. Spirit  contributes a fair bit by healing people.

**Alignment:** Hero/Villain... Consciously he views himself as a hero but is so ashamed of his villain side that it runs a little rampant at times. He just tries to minimize the damage they cause while working to keep the secrets of his power safe. Given each one of his projections exibit  unique personalities Alignments vary but while there are a few that are grey in both camps His nightmares tend to be Villians while his dreams tend to Heroes

**Equipment/Weaponry:** Phone, Laptop, handgun, x1 flashbang,  collapsible stun baton, most important bit of equipment is the locked safe room that he commossion Hullohan to build in any Protectorate HQ he transfers to. His manifestation  can have different equipment at times but generally they have similar items to Somnus himself if its not easily retrievable or mentioned in description..

**Specializations:**  Parahuman studies, criminal pathology, lockpicking  and pretty good with a computer.  Without the assistance of his powers he does not show much prowess in combat besides all the hours he logged at the gun range and a some knowledge of judo (Although due to his weak build and wirey frame it only really helps him in fighting defensively.)  His real strengths lie in his mental acuity

**Power:**  Dream manifestation (Master/Trump)
Somnus power allows him to temporarily create a single creature out of his dreams or nightmares as long as he maintains an unconscious state.Unlike other with the projection power Somnus's creation are not tethered by range. What he makes in range, he loses in his control of the ability. With any one manifested summon he exerts far less control of his manifestations and lacks the ability to shift projections on the fly.
With his powers active, he goes into a death-like sleep.  In this sleep state, he is unaware of all events that occur around him and will not rouse unless he is injured.  In this state, he quits breathing and will be declared dead by most tests. While in this state, he gains the ability to manifest mental constructs of creatures from his dreams or nightmares. They manifest randomly somewhere within a few blocks of him. He has no control which manifestation occurs other than being able to nudge it to being either a nightmare or dream(Although if he has already used one, the power tends to choose the opposite in the next go around.).   He exerts a minimal amount of control over the actions of his manifestations but he can push them to a degree based on several factors that will be discussed later. Which creature manifests is based on rolls from the table below. If a creature is ever killed or dismissed that manifestation is grayed out from the table until Somnus uses all the options on that table(or enough days have passed equal to number of choices).This really only matter during arcs that take days or weeks in game to conclude. In a 24 hour period Somnus can only manifest two projections each maxing out at 8 hours.  He does have the option to push this time limit but out to a single manifestation lasting 16 hours but this tends to strain his control and tends to cause his power to force him the use to opposite table for an equal amount of time next time he uses it.
His projections  are created from his subconscious acting as  Free-willed entities spawned from splinters of his own mind. While they can take many shapes and sizes, Somnus's obsession  with parahuman studies  tends to lead his created projections to take on the personas and forms of Heroes, Villians and Case 53's that he encounters or studies.New creatures can be created by normal equipment rules. Manifestations are created either through intense study of a subject matter or from experiencing trauma. Due to this, it is much more easier for Nightmares to occur naturally. It should be noted that while the creation of more projections increases versatility it decreases the chances of getting any one option. The power is one of Duality, creating an option on the Dream table will always require creation of a similar option on its opposing Nightmare table and viceversa.  
While Somnus has his powers active he sees himself as a ball of light, his form an incorporeal wilowisp that is invisible to all but his own manifestations. He is continually floating in and out of his manifestations (Think how in dreams there are moments when you see in first person at one moment then in 3rd) In this form his senses can see in all directions or through the senses of his creations. It is during this time that he gets to act as a voice in his manifestations head.
In his waking state both his dreams and nightmares manifest to him as voices in his head and it is the two leaders that  tend to rise to the top of the din of voices. The leaders  are chosen by either their level of power or force of personality. Leaders often change based on their infighting or through mental traumas. Leaders have one special ability that they obtain upon receiving the title. This ability is a more speedy resurrection that get flavored in game based on their abilities. Leaders do not become grayed out as options like any others would and have a chance to manifest in place of any grayed out option.  When projected, his manifestations at least listen to  him to a small degree but if he choose to let the rosters grow uneven what little control he has over them slips loosing the ability to speak with them. Given many of his Heroes motives align with his this tends not to be a problem for some but even good motive unchecked could lead to bad results.  This issue mostly occurs through the act of refusing to manifest from his Nightmare Roster. If one roster grows depleted with more than one  persona remaining on its opposite table Somnus will remain asleep and begin manifesting those unspent personas until they are spent.  Personas manifested in this manner are slightly stronger remain active for a week and have destructive aspects of their personalities exaggerated.  
The Current Leaders are as follows: Johnny Jack Irons (nightmares) &amp;  Silver (Dreams)
A weak Stranger effect accompanies the manifestation of his creatures.  It could be considered a Clark Kent effect that creates dissonance in the minds of subjects that try to draw connections between his manifestations appearances and disappearances. This dissonance also acts to distance people's minds from connecting the sleeping guy to the manifestations. The dissonance is not perfect but it casts just enough doubt to keep people from thinking, Hey these guys only appear when Cyus goes to his bedroom.

61gjd5,5,2017-03-25,Software Engineer bubble? Saturation in the near term?,panchilly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61gjd5/software_engineer_bubble_saturation_in_the_near/,"The field of software engineering is absolutely exploding in a way that not many predicted. Undergraduates are FLOODING into Computer Science departments, coding boot camps are popping up all over, and armies of international students are streaming into US masters programs. They are all trying join the software engineering gravy train. 

There is a huge wave of software engineers that will be hitting the market soon. Will this trigger over saturation and wage stagnation? This surge combined with an economic downturn could be devastating for the industry.

As a developer with 10+ years of experience this is concerning me. I've heard stories of the last bubble peak (2001) and what is was like after that. From 2001-2004 being ""senior"" and out of work for a full year was not uncommon. As a junior, it was a *very* hard time to break into the industry. I personally knew ivy league CS grads in 2003 who could not find jobs. In the summer of 2003 I was still in college and had to take a summer job doing construction work since internships were incredibly scarce. On that job I met 2 former CS majors that graduated but could not find employment and had to settle for this work. Both of them were from solid schools such as WPI and UConn. 

To me, 2017 seems a lot like the happy days of 1999-2000. It could all come crashing down just as it has before. "
61go03,4,2017-03-25,When should I apply to my dream job?,lupaluposa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/61go03/when_should_i_apply_to_my_dream_job/,"Ok, I little bit of background.
I have a BSc in Physics and during my entire undergraduate, I worked doing research in university labs. I may not have the best GPA (for US standards), but I do have a lot of research experience, more than the majority of undergraduate students. I've always wanted to work in the materials science field applied to energy storage and conversion.  


Two years ago I moved to the US with my husband (he has an H1B and, therefore, I have an H4 and, therefore, can't work) and initially I thought of applying for a Ph.D. and continue with my academic career but a part of me always wanted to work for the private sector, at least for a little a while, just to know how it is and if I would like it.   


The past 2 years haven't been easy (being an H4 is really hard) and right now I am enrolled in a Community College to keep my mind working and I am also volunteering in a physics lab of a university. So, here where it gets tricky, we are half of way of a green card process and I am expecting to get my work permit (hopefully) by the end of the year, so I started searching around for jobs, just for ~fun~, to see if there is anything out there for me. Turns out that I found a start-up that does research on batteries and they have an opening for an R&amp;D position. The company is 5 minutes from my house and the job is basically what I wanted my entire life (at least my adult life).   


Ok, basically they require some experience in a lot of stuff that I do have experience with, but it's been a while since a worked with that stuff and I would need a little time remembering and adjusting, I don't know if that's ok and expected or I need to know everything about every requirement on my first day at the job. I have always been in the academic setting and, besides the horrible stuff we hear about it, it is a learning environment and everything is okay and enough as long as you commit to learning the expected subjects, but I've never worked in the private sector and have no idea if it would be the same.   


Because of my academic background and experience, I feel the urge to apply for the job and in my cover letter tell them my immigration situation and propose that I ""volunteer"" (for free) for the few months that I don't have my work permit, as I learn and remember the things I need for the job, and I get hired after I have my work permit (in that way I will have the perfect experience for the position), but I have no idea if this is a great idea or the stupidest idea. At the same time, they have summer internship positions coming up and I could apply for that but, again, I don't know if it's a paid position or not. Also, I am afraid that if I apply for the internship or I wait for my work permit to approach them, the position will be filled and I would have lost my dream job that I know I would be perfect at.  


What do I do?"

**Body**


**Disclaimer:** I started this out as one post, but the tale grew long in the telling. I have decided to break it up into four posts. Please check my post history for the other parts.


&amp;nbsp;


**PART 2**


My second incel phase started at the age of 25, with the end of my second LTR. This phase went on for about 3.5 years. During this phase, I got laid about once in 6 months on average (with hookers whenever I had spare cash).

 
I focused on my job, and laid the foundation for a successful career. One thing that helped me was that I had internalised “Don’t shit where you eat” from the ASF forums, and stuck to this almost religiously, with one exception.

 
The exception was a mid-20s HB8 CC rider who was an intern at my workplace for a month. I developed oneitis for her, despite (or maybe because of) all the stories she told me about her various drinking and sexual exploits. She had a boyfriend, and although she had cheated on him in the past, I didn’t escalate with her (because I was such a nice guy, ugh!). I did tell her about my oneitis for her, and she tried to turn me into an orbiter. My job however kept me busy enough during that period that I didn’t have time to turn into her orbiter.

 
My second incel phase ended at the age of 28 when I found a 24-year-old HB8 FWB. I had the advantage of some pre-selection here (a good friend introduced us). I also escalated with her fairly quickly, and always kept things fun and casual. This was probably the most RP relationship I have ever had, although I wasn’t aware of RP at this time. I didn’t develop oneitis, didn’t waste time on phone and text, didn’t go on dates until after we had had sex, etc. It ended without any drama 2 years later when she left the country.


While I was with the HB8 FWB, some of my colleagues at work tried to set me up with their various single friends. Although I declined most of them, I did make the mistake of agreeing to this a couple to times. Got burned both times.

 
The first one was a 26-year-old HB7 CC rider. I went out on 8 dates with her over a period of 3 months, without ever escalating (because I was such a nice guy, ugh!). I would also text her all the time, and listen to her drama.

 
It ended like this. I finally got the balls to ask her to come over to my place on a particular Sunday. She agreed. She then proceeded to tell me that she was going to meet another guy on the Saturday before that, and she may end up making out with him. But I wasn’t ready to go full cuck yet!

 
I told her that I would stop seeing her if she did that. She tried to create drama about how I was not her boyfriend and couldn’t tell her what to do. I told her that she was welcome to do as she pleased, but I wouldn’t see her after that. I then proceeded to hard next her with no contact. (Remember this bitch, she will turn up again in Part 4).


The other woman who my colleagues tried to set me up with was a post-Wall 33-year-old HB6. I took her out on 6 dates in 4 months. Again, no escalation. This one was flaky as hell. We literally worked at different workplaces within a one mile distance of each other, and yet setting up a date with her was next to impossible. I finally got sick of the flakiness and ghosted her with no explanation.


The positive aspect of both the above fuck-ups was that it didn’t affect my equation with the colleagues who had set me up.


&amp;nbsp;


**Lessons Learned from Part 2:**

1.	Women will test you in an unbelievable number of ways. If your game is weak, your only real option is to walk away when the testing starts.
2.	Women who are not sexually interested in you will still be happy to receive your time, attention and money. If your game is weak, your only real option is to walk away.
3.	Don’t shit where you eat. This has been repeated to infinity, but is worth repeating again.
4.	“Don’t shit where you eat” should include “Don’t get set up with friends of colleagues”. I can easily contemplate a scenario where either one of those women could have poisoned my colleagues against me, and fucked with my job.

For instance, I took an internship doing frontend work since we don't have any similar classes at my college, and was so glad that we didn't because if I had taken that as one of my first CS classes, I might've chosen a different major simply because I hated it so much. I was wondering if liking certain classes would indicate that someone would like certain fields/companies/projects/career paths.  I'd really like to hear people's thoughts on this in general.

Personally, one of the most rewarding classes I've taken to date is my OS class; we got to work with the Linux kernel as a code base, and I really liked the fact that for most of the projects, I had to understand not only what my code was doing, but what the code base and my project members were doing. I enjoyed it because I felt like I had to have a more comprehensive understanding than I did with individual homework assignments. I have 2 internships coming up with 2 relatively large tech companies, and I haven't matched with a team yet. I was wondering what kind of teams I might enjoy, or I might want to try (infra, ops, prod, application development, etc.) Thanks for any advice! :)"

I am trying to decide which of two professors to ask for my last (3rd) recommendation -


Professor A:
Have been working with this professor since September 2016. Worked with one of his graduate students until Mid-February, didn't achieve much and didn't publish a paper. I got lazy towards the end because I could see that the research was going to hit a deadend and I wasn't interested in the material. However, my research focus that I have developed since then came from a subproblem of this project, in which I did deliver results (but the results became meaningless in the context of the overall project). Since then, I have been studying independently with the professor on this topic and have produced some really exciting results. I think I can publish at least once, maybe twice by December. Also, took his undergraduate class last semester and got an A-. It wasn't a hard class, and an A- puts me in about the 60th percentile (I'm guessing). Overall seems enthusiastic to work with me, but I am unsure if he can write me a strong recommendation based on my weak start and the fact that I got an A- in his class. This professor went to my second preferred school.

Professor B:
Just started working with this professor two weeks ago, hit the ground running. I'm working with one of his phd students and I am optimistic that we will publish one paper by October. I am taking one of his graduate level courses next semester, I expect to get an A. This professor went to my top choice school. By application time I'll only have known this professor for ~9 months as opposed to professor A, who I will have known for ~15 months. Also, while I plan on continuing this research over the summer, I will be doing it remotely, as I have an internship in the bay area. So really, face-to-face time is closer to ~6 months.

Overall I am more interested in the work that I am doing with professor A. I am currently planning on doing my senior thesis with professor A, but that could change if I decide to pursue professor B for a recommendation. I think that professor B will have seen more of my good side but for a short period of time, while professor A has observed my maturation from being a mediocre researcher to a good one, and also helped develop my focus research area. But again, weak start and A- in his class makes me hesitant to ask.

I basically started to see more of her that I wasn't so fond of. She is kind, generous and gorgeous but there was never that oomph or spark. There was never a problem so I felt that it was going good until I realized I didn't love her. It just wasn't there for me. 

When we first met she seemed perfect. She is super down to earth, was big on fitness, and seemed very independent and emotionally tough. Months later she stopped going to the gym (We both gained that relationship weight and that is never an issue) but for me it felt like she stopped trying. We would always compete with each other in lifting and running and she stopped.

 I noticed she would break down emotionally and would constantly be sad all the time. Being ""tough"" was always a big attractive feature to me and I felt like that was just a lie. Of course life is stressful and I was always there to help her but I didn't want to be. I feel the shittiest about that. 

There was also an age difference. I'm 24 and shes about to be 21. I have a career and am pretty settled in life and who I am. She is still trying to figure out everything while juggling multiple internships, school, work and me. Not to sound too much of an asshole but I always felt more mature than her too. I've never been able to get close to her family. This sucked since I've always dated people my age. Sometimes I want to go to her place and hang out but that isn't allowed. 

We just broke up and I told her how I felt. She was begging me to reconsider and how she can change and be different. I kept telling her I don't want her to change and got nowhere. She was sobbing like crazy too. Basically were done but I feel so shitty. She feels like I wasted 2.5 years of her life. Was I in the wrong? "

Hiya people of DKP. Today, I want to roleplay out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

I've since landed one as a software engineering intern and couldn't be happier. 

So thank you everyone who posts career advice here and who makes this an overall helpful and beneficial community. I followed advice that I got directly from this sub and did whatever I could to get out of my comfort zone to land an internship. I sent out 350+ applications, cold-emailed recruiters, messaged people on linkedin asking for mentorship, went to career fairs, talked to professors, etc. 

Overall I'm happy to be pursuing a field where people help each other and I've seen people give crazy good advice and even offer to hook people up who are down on hard times with interviews. Makes me proud to be in this field so thank you!

P.S. to students: It is definitely not too late to land an internship. The only reason I landed mine was because I emailed someone from my career fair 3 weeks after we exchanged information. I figured its been 3 weeks they probably filled the position already but emailed him anyway asking him to take a second look at my resume. Point is keep grinding, stay positive, and make that shit happen."

This is an extended summary, original article can be found [here](http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ONKbSVlovDX2tHli1zMpVI/The-cheese-revolution.html)

# Extended Summary:

**The cheese revolution | One of the world’s oldest dairy traditions is cultivating a brand new culture. Meet the men and women behind India’s quiet cheese revolution**.

In 2014, newspapers reported that archaeologists working on a site in the Taklamakan desert in north-western China had discovered mummies from the Bronze Age, dating back to 1615 BC.

And so, the worlds oldest preserved cheese had been found.

Over the last few years, though, a curious series of circumstances has conspired to replace the processed cheeses at the top of our minds, and in speciality stores and restaurants across urban India, with hand-crafted Cheddars, mozzarellas, Gruyres, Bries and fetas, all made locally.

The spread was everywherein newspapers, magazines, listicles online, long-form musings, interviews with chefs.

So is artisanal cheese a food fad? Physicist-turned-cheesemaker Aditya Raghavan rolls his eyes.

This is not a big leap.

Raghavan should know.

According to the Economic Survey 2015-16, the country produced 146 million tonnes of milk thats 18.

We churn it into butter, culture it into yogurt, slowly caramelize it to make khoya.

The question that fascinated me was, why does this country have only one cheese? I know there are a few others, but essentially one cheesepaneer.

To extract the rennet, the calf has to be killed.

The answer is practicality: Indias tropical climate doesnt allow for bacterial preservation.

Amul was the first company to make an attempt at an Indian processed cheese in the early 1960s.

Amuls cheeseeasy to melt and storewould go on to flood the market.

In 2014, retail sales of packaged dairy products in India were estimated at $10.

Film-maker Mansoor Khan, director of two blockbusters, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, moved to Coonoor in 2003, where he has been making Gouda, Colby, Gruyre, halloumi and more on his farm Acres Wild.

Acres Wild produces 8-10kg a day and only sells at two stores in Coonoor.

Bengaluru-based Mukund Naidu quit engineering studies in 1991, moving to a farm in the Tamil Nadu hill town.

Naidu and New Zealander David Hogg set up the cheese unit and are suppliers of European-style artisanal cheese to a number of restaurants in the south.

I showed it to chefs back then who had no idea what to do with this ball, how to apply it to their dishes, laughs Naidu.

You could be making cheese in less than an hour.

I used to play around with cheese and beer pairings when it struck me that the process of making beer was very similar to that of making cheese.

Hard cheeses, like Cheddar, need at least six months to reach maturity, and thats a long time to wait to see if it has comes out right.

They surprised themselves with the resulta soft rind Brie with a profound buttery note, without the faint ammoniac tang of French Brie de Meaux.

The brothers make almost 250kg of cheese a month in the basement of their home in suburban Mumbai, supplying to chains such as Indigo Delicatessen and Salt Water Caf in their city, and Toast &amp; Tonic in Bengaluru.

Cheesemakers are applying the knowledge gathered abroad to meet this demand.

basically everything related to cheese..

I, on the other hand, was like, where can I eat more? She quit studies to focus on cheese and landed a three-month internship at Murrays, where she was put to work in the cheese caves..

My daily chores were cleaning, vacuum packing, unwrapping cheeses, sorting them, turning the harder cheesesand on my birthday, they let me have the cheese trier (an instrument that lets you take a sliver of cheese out to test its ageing without cutting out a slice) to try any four cheeses in the caves.

In 2014, she founded The Cheese Collective, which curates cheeses from across the country and supplies it to parties, corporate events and restaurants.

Cold-chain logistics remain the weakest link in the supply chain.

I put my cheeses in a reputable chain of high-end food stores and found that they werent even refrigerating it.

Last year, he began shipping it directly to interested customers and restaurants, so he could control the quality.

One of the more popular ones is, Is there egg in this cheese? Arbitrary government regulations have actually helped local cheesemakers though.

We have a bunch of issues importing cheese with certain ingredients into India.

Once that happened, it eliminated about 80% of the worlds repertoire of good quality cheeses, because its just not made that way; it changes the nature of the product, says chef Manu Chandra, the man behind the Monkey Bar gastropubs and Bengalurus Toast &amp; Tonic.

Local cheesemakers were happy to step in to fill this void, and restaurateurs were happier paying a premium for local cheese made right than using lower-quality imported cheese.

Its not just the quality of milk, or the terroir, he says.

This culture of boiled milk hasnt made Indians vigilant about raw milk and inculcating it in the farmers who supply the milk is difficult.

Vegetarian rennet is made in a laboratory and you train bacteria to produce chymosin, the active enzyme, and the way it deals with the proteins in milk lends it some bitterness and when you make enough cheese or taste enough cheese, you can feel it.

The working model is to have a hybrid dairy, one that makes yogurt and supplies milk, alongside the cheese.

Trends like foraging and slow food have found enthusiastic proponents here.

Chef Sabyasachi Gorai, at his Armenian restaurant Lavaash By Saby in Delhi, serves a cheese platter composed entirely of indigenous cheesessalted and smoked Bandel and a sharp Kalimpong.

In the meantime, though, we can revel in our local cheeses and hope that in a few decades, we will have a lovely Indian cheese of our own to be buried with and bamboozle scientists with in the future.

Prateeksh and Agnay Mehra produce Bombrie, Camembay and Rombay, versions of French and Italian bloomy rind cheeses like Brie, Camembert and robiola.

Dutchman Chris Zandee works with local Gujjar and Bakarwal pastoralists to make Gouda, Cheddar and the local kalari and build a sustainable, community-based business in Kashmir.

These all-natural cheeses are made from milk supplied by local farms and include styles of Cheddar, Parmesan, feta, Gruyre and a pungent auroblochon.

Set up by Father K.L.

They now produce flavoured Gouda, goats cheese, mozzarella, mascarpone, ricotta, scamorza and kwark that retails from their own cheese store, The Cheese Ball, on Lodhi Road.

When they first made landfall on the east coast of India and discovered they couldnt get their beloved cottage cheese here, they set about making it by acid-curdling milk and treating the curds to form three different kinds of cheese.

This is also smoked for a deeper, stronger-flavoured Bandel.

Native to Udhampur in Jammu, kalari or maish krej is a soured milk cheese that uses a hot pan to stretch the curds and shape it into chapati-like discs.

A hard, crumbly, mild-flavoured cheese that shares similarities with Gouda, Kalimpong was made by a priest in Sikkim.

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

61kd6y,27,2017-03-26,I hate one of my students,uniqueishgirl,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/61kd6y/i_hate_one_of_my_students/,"Okay, hate is a strong word, but I just need to vent (FYI I'm a faculty member in her 20s, and I look young to the point where the students are regularly shocked to find out that I'm a regular faculty member). I'm in STEM so I see the fact that I'm a young female as a privilege, and my goal is to act friendly and down-to-earth around my students while being competent and professional, so that I can be a great role model that they can relate to, yet still respect (especially for women!). I think it works really well; even though my classes are 80-90% men, my office hours have a very high percentage of women showing up (often more than half of the people there are women, I've had one all-women office hour, even!), and many women in my class actually tell me that they work extra hard because they want to be remembered as a good student to me. So all in all, I really adore my students.

Unfortunately, there's this girl in my class of 700 students, who really takes advantage of my friendliness. She does it in the most annoying way possible.

- She decided that I was more approachable than my TA. So she shows up to my office hours ALL THE TIME. That in itself is not a crime, in fact I encourage the weaker students to show up and get help. I hold my office hours three time a week, and she saunters up to me after EVERY class and asks, ""hey, do you know if there will be a lot of people in your office hour today?"" to which my only answer every day is ""I have no idea, you'll have to come and see"" but she does this EVERY FUCKING DAY.

- When she shows up to my office hour, she wastes my time in the biggest way possible. Unless I'm looking over her shoulders making sure that she is doing everything correctly and guiding her every step of the way, she slumps on my desk, sulks that nothing in the course makes sense, and refuses to do any work on her own. Not only is this completely rude, just seeing her slumped on the desk like that puts such a damper on my mood as well.

- So she doesn't actually get a lot of work done during my office hours; she just shows up to ""hang out"". There are some weeks, like the weeks with midterms, where I put in probably 30+ hours into just the one course (making up the midterm problems, extra office hours for reviews, proctoring, grading, entering grades, etc etc) and the one break I get is that usually NO ONE shows up to my office hours right after the midterms. This girl somehow got it into her head that I'm like an older sister figure, so she decided to come to my office and rant about how badly her life is going (note: it's actually not that bad; the usual stuff that goes, if I don't get a C or above I'm going to lose my internship, and you'll ruin my life kind of crap). No one else showed up, but I ended up not getting any work done during that hour because she just wanted to chat and refused to leave even though I tried to hint to her pretty bluntly that I'd much rather be talking about the course material or she should leave.

- If there are other students, she is just so annoying. While the other students are also doing their work, she always chooses to think out loud, talking very loudly to herself. I can tell that this distracts the other students, and I try to shush her gently by saying things like ""don't spoil the answers for the others"" etc, but she JUST FUCKING DOESN'T GET IT.

- She sometimes shows up with homeworks from other classes, asking me to help her. To those I firmly say no, but she keeps doing it. Even when she has no questions on the course material, she just shows up to my office and asks if she can just sit there for the hour and basically use my office as a study space (I say no to that too, apparently I have no problem saying no, lol)

- Other little incidents: she's emailed me in a panic a few times asking whether I've seen her lost items (I teach in a lecture hall, lol); she asks all of my least favorite questions all the time in office hours -- the kinds where she goes, I didn't get TOPIC, can you teach it to me again? (I only answer specific questions because otherwise I end up wasting time for everyone by repeating my lectures) or I don't know how to start this question (I don't give help unless I see the evidence of their attempts) etc etc

Not sure if the above descriptions do her justice. I guess it's also just the tone in which she speaks, like she clearly doesn't want to be there doing my homework, like she's so angry and annoyed to be stuck in this situation. I'm the kind of person who picks up the moods of the people around me easily, so I have really started to dread my office hours just because she keeps showing up.

So in short, she acts like a petulant three year old who really craves my attention, and I've put up with her for a good three months now, but I still have another month to go and pretty much seeing her face in my office makes me so angry now. I still have enough self control to act professional, and I'm really hoping that I can make it through the end of the semester.

I had to fight tooth and nail to get through undergrad and grad school, so I admit that I have very little patience for people who are not willing to try, but how do you change that perspective, when you've lived your entire life trying your hardest?

The rest of the students who show up are fantastic though. I've actually never had such a good class before. They're energetic and communicative, they're smartasses just to the right degree that teaching in front of them is a fun interactive experience, and they work so hard that I'm so pleased with their progress so far. But as always, there are a couple of students that really sour my classroom experience. Oh well."

I am 3rd year with no experience and it looks like I won't be able to secure a summer internship/co-op (as I have not heard from any other places yet).

61l2cu,4,2017-03-26,19F Singapore to US/UK/CA/AU (in order of preference),jimmycarrick,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/61l2cu/19f_singapore_to_usukcaau_in_order_of_preference/,"Hi,


Come this fall I will matriculate in a top 20 LAC in the US. I am a Hong Kong passport holder (which qualifies me for working holiday visas in tons of countries as well) but I was recently given a one-time chance to convert to Singapore citizenship. This leads me to my first question: Should I convert so 4 years down the road, I can go for a H1B1 visa instead of a H1B visa? Can I even trust that H1B1 visas will still exist with someone like Trump at the helm? How hard is it to get a H1B visa as someone from a top 20 LAC? What if I do the 24 month OPT extension for STEM majors instead? Can I transition from that to a green card (EB-2/3?) What are the odds of success for the various routes? (STEM OPT -&gt; H1B/H1B1 -&gt; EB2/3)


Am I correct in thinking that the most likely pathway for acquiring a work visa and subsequently some sort of permanent residency in CA/UK/AU first requires me to work in the US? From what I have read, Canada requires 2 years of professional experience and UK has a tier 2 visa. How competitive are the different options?


Further to the question, I was also wondering - what major/career would make it easier to stay and eventually earn citizenship/permanent resident status in US/UK/CA/AU? I intend to pursue 1 practical major (math/econ/CS) and 2 minors/majors I am interested in. (French/Spanish) Career-wise, I am thinking of gunning for consulting/banking/silicon valley. How feasible/what other options are there for an international student like me? Is this advisable?


Whether I should stop purely at a Bachelor's degree is also something I am thinking about. At least for now, I am interested in going to law school in US afterwards (which will leave me with about 250k in loan debt probably, i.e. a terrible idea, but likely to be very employable. I know pretty little about credit scores and such, but it seems to me that if 250k in debt were indeed so terrible, nobody would do JDs at Harvard then). I may also do a PhD (if I am admitted to a prestigious programme) instead. I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with the above options as an international student and the various possibilities after graduation.


Another question I have is how I can prepare for this, given I am only 19 now. How difficult/advisable is it to gun for summer internships to secure post-graduation employment? Is it possible to graduate in the US and then work immediately in Canada afterwards? How would that work?


Oh yes and lastly pay/some sort of career advancement is pretty important to me. Would my attempt to migrate/secure permanent residency somewhere stultify my career advancement?


I appreciate any responses! Thank you very much in advance!

61lmkr,13,2017-03-26,What to do to make life more interesting?,[deleted],SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/61lmkr/what_to_do_to_make_life_more_interesting/,"Lately I am bored most of the time. I have a full time job and waste about 2hours of commuting a day to go there, so my days are basically: home - train - work - train - home (and gym whenever I can which is the only thing I am proud of). I don't get along well with the coworkers because some of them are hard to deal with. I also hate the job and it's very badly paid, but it was all I could find for now (first job off college and the work situation in my country is really crapy so I actually think I am lucky to have a job). 

When I was in college and in one of my internships things were more funny and I felt joy to leave the house because I would be with people I like and have fun while learning. Now I am just like ""meh"". I wake up because I have to work because I need the money to achieve my short and long term goals. If I didn't have those goals I believe I wouldn't even want to get up in the morning so I had to make them up to keep me motivated for life. 

Besides that everything just sounds painfully boring and uninteresting. Work is uninteresting, I spend my free time bored waiting for it to end and my work time bored waiting to have a day off, but then I don't really have anything to do on a day off so I just sleep a lot or clean stuff. My friends are older and still on college so they are always busy with works, exams, their families (most of them are married/have bfs and some have kids). Most of us are also struggling to pay the bills and worrying about money issues so it's not like we can go out clubbing all weekends. I also feel like the group is dissolving because there's some conflicts between some of my friends, but when I was in college I would make an effort to put everyone together and we'd have a lot of fun lunches and fun time. But now it's much harder to convince all of them to meet outside school at the same time because they don't like each other and because they are busy with their lives. 

I live in a small rural area and there's nothing to do, no places to meet people. Even in the city where I work there's really no way to meet new people. I don't have a bf - never did - and already signed to some dating websites, but feel completely uninterested about chatting with people there. Again, it just sounds boring. Besides, I don't feel like a catch. I am not that good looking, I am broke most of the time, I am emotionally unstable (can go from cheerful to really distant in a click), I am a virgin so I am not a sex godess, so yeah what good could I add to somebody's life?

I suffer from depression so I know this could be a bad phase. I am already on antidepressants for three years so there's not much else I can do about it. And actually the fact that I am not trying to kill myself makes me happy.

So yeah, I don't know when or why life became so boring. Maybe it's because I dislike my job and don't feel fullfilled? or is it because my lack or hobbies? or lack of social bonds?

i am 24 female."

OK! So where to begin. I think I’ll start with some back-story.

I’m a 21-year-old male who is studying a Political Science degree majoring in history. I was raised in a religious family, and I still live with my parents and siblings (hopefully planning on moving out once university comes to an end, huzzah!). Since I was little, my parents placed a huge importance on religion (I’m a Musi btw, towel-head, Muslim or whatever!). I say this because I want you all to know I’m not easily offended about these little things that make reference to the faith. I also want to point out that I don’t take religion as seriously as my parents, and my older sister does. We will come back to the significance of this soon :) 
I live in a suburban area in Melbourne where most the residents are Middle Eastern migrants, refugees or asylum seekers. Studying a politics degree, I’ve written many reports, essays and so on about the Middle East and the reason of why it’s such a shit-show today. I’ll now just explain my first delusional experience, and the reasons why I believe I had it in the first place, here goes..!

It was a nice Sunday afternoon, I remember I had just finished a history essay and I figured I would reward myself with – some good ol’cannabis. Let us keep in mind prior to this experience I had smoked weed regularly (2 years) and never had such an experience, sometimes erryday during university break hah! 
I really like nature, the sun was starting to set so I loaded my weed vaporizer (I bought a nifty cannabis vaporising device couple years down the track of starting to smoke weed) and went to the back yard. I finished my bowl and went inside to chill on my computer. 
I was listening to music and heard footsteps at the door. Three men, dressed in typical traditional Muslim attire came to the door and rang the doorbell. My mother was home, as well as my older sister. I opened the door but did not open the fly-door (in Australia we have double doors, a door, and one to keep those nasty Australian bugs out!). Now, I am familiar with the Muslim faith, as well as the politics that shapes that region as I study it in college. These men dressed one in black, the other in white and last in orange said something on the lines of “Brother Muhammed will you come to the mosque?” OR “Brother Muhammed will you come to the mosque?”. This firstly pissed me the fuck off as we live in Australia – we are not in Afghanistan and people should not go door-to-door ASSUMING the resident inside if of the house is Muslim before they ask/before the fucking door is open. Infuriated, shocked, and a little bit high, I felt the weirdest, creepiest most twisted feeling to date. I said something like nah, all good mate, thanks anyways, have a good one and ciao. They left, nothing else was said, and immediately shut the first door without looking at them again. Now, most Muslim families will name the first name of their first son Muhammed, good ol’Moe! I have a middle name everyone including my fam calls me. I went to explain this to my mother and sister, I was like WTF do these people think this is, are we in fucking Iraq etc, it’s not proper to assume. Now, this is where I get even MORE freaked out. I explained this situation to my sister and mother, and they smiled a quite sincere smile, they thought as if this was some ‘sign from God’ inviting their heretic son to the correct path of God, (because hey, they got my name right! haha). As they are both rather more tight-knit with religion than I am they kept asking me “what did they say?” “did they know your name?” “did you see these guys before, how do they know your name?”. This freaked me out even more, I said I don’t know, I ahven;t seen them. I explained that any group promoting religion MUST have promotion papers, pamphlets or whatever approved through Australian law and so on. Let alone having official papers, these fuckers were not promoting faith but FORCING this kind of shit on people who maybe are not of your particular faith? Ya get what I mean?
 
Now, I am critical of every faith be it my own, others and all that stuff. I always ask questions and state to people that this part of the book is really illogical, does not make sense, you can’t apply it in the 21st century etc. Yet, I still like listening to philosophers on topics such as reality, space and the universe such as Alan Watts and so on. So I am kind of in limbo, not knowing what’s out there, critical of my own faith and always trying to figure out how, what, and where the fk are we going to end up? I like philosophy and the bigger picture.. a lot.
This is becoming quite a long post, but please excuse the inconvenience as it is my first. So, my mother and sister made this seem as it was a divine fucking experience. I was instead creeped the fuck out, shocked and felt really numb/weird (and hey, my weed is fine, it’s clean mkay). For almost a whole week I played this in my mind, it really effected me, I could say it was traumatic. I spoke it with my (also religious) father soon-after and he is rather politically aware as I am – we came to the conclusion these guys are Wahhabi Musi’s (originating from Saudi Arabia this fucked up way of thought bans women from driving, promotes terrorism etc etc) who are fundamentalists. We are Turkish, who have lived in Turkey’s secular Istanbul. 

I got past this experience, my father was of great help. This year is my last at university and I am doing an internship in parliament, WOOP! Since I started this internship I haven’t smoked weed for about 2-3 months as I don’t want anything distracting me. Since that experience I have had very weird dreams in a similar context to that of the first ‘door’ experience. I’ve also had 2-3 experiences after the initial ‘door experience’ where I know I’m about to fall asleep I get ‘foreign’ thoughts in my head, thoughts that I don’t think of that are weird, nonsensical, all over the place to sometimes scary (I don’t remember these thoughts exactly but I know they are ‘foreign’ thoughts, thoughts not thought by me…)

**What’s even worse is I’ve had thoughts where I would think something, and I’ll be like nah that’s fucked up, that’s illogical doesn’t make sense, chill dude. Example: my father was brought up as an agent since child-hood working for a religious organisation for the sole purpose to raise me (and my brother) properly faithful xD. After evaluating this thought/delusion I do not believe this anymore as I pondered the thought of this delusion for one-week or so, always reminding myself of the facts and just thinking LMAO dude wtf chill. I know my parents love me, I am very lucky, even though they have a proper fucked relationship where arguments in the house is more than common. This at times does not phase me, I’ve learnt to build resilience to this kind of shit together with my siblings.
I’ve gotten an appointment this week to see a psychologist. I don’t know whether I should explain everything all at once. I’m thinking of talking about my background first, how I feel, my social life, what I like. What do you guys think? Maybe I’ll explain my thoughts as they also have been a little bit all over the place, disorganised since I started this internship…**

*If you persevered and read through all of this, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, it REALLY really means a lot. Thank you so, so much and have a good one, much love &lt;3 :)*

61m6s1,21,2017-03-26,"Overview/primer of the best arguments and evidence proving that the official story on the alleged ""holocaust"" is a gargantuan lie",Thy_Weapon_Of_War,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61m6s1/overviewprimer_of_the_best_arguments_and_evidence/,"1. First off, what really happened. All of the German-run camps were internment and work camps housing potential threats to Germany in a war-time environment, and not ""extermination camps"". These camps were similar to the camps used by the U.S. Government to intern Americans of Japanese and German ancestry on U.S. soil during the war. Red Cross records show that around 270,000 people (jews and non-jews) died in the German-run camps. But these deaths were overwhelmingly caused by disease (typhus epidemics), and not by any policy for mass murder of jews. The outbreak of disease at the camps was caused by the break down in conditions inside Germany and Poland due to the war, with railways and roads being destroyed, making it impossible to supply the camps with food and medical supplies, etc.

2. The sacred ""6 million"" number of alleged jews killed is a complete fabrication. On dozens of occasions over the late 1800s to the 1930s, the jews (as documented in newspapers), alleged an impending ""holocaust"" of ""6 million"" jews (using the EXACT terms ""holocaust"" and ""6 million""). See here for proof: http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php. The number ""6 million"" has some special significance in the occult religion of Judaism. In Kabalistic gematria, the number 6,000,000 is the number of perfect souls times ten. This special number has absolutely nothing to do with the actual number of jews who died during World War Two. And, by the way, the jews just admitted a few days ago that they totally fabricated the figure of ""5 million"" non-jews who allegedly died in the camps, and now claim it was only a few hundred thousand. See here: http://www.jta.org/2017/01/31/news-opinion/united-states/remember-the-11-million-why-an-inflated-victims-tally-irks-holocaust-historians

3. The allegations of ""homicidal gas chambers"" at the camps is a monstrous lie. There were gas chambers at some of the camps, but they were DISINFESTATION (aka ""delousing"") chambers used fumigate clothing in order to kill lice in order to prevent typhus and other diseases. Zyklon B was an insecticide. And this was also the reason that the inmates' heads were shaved, and that their clothing was replaced when they arrived at the camp. These were measures to prevent the spread of lice and prevent typhus. See following article for more discussion of this: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-myth-of-homicidal-gas-chambers-only.html

4. The example of the Dachau concentration camp is a huge smoking gun and microcosm of the fraud of the ""Holocaust™"" story. Around 25,000 inmates died at the Dachau concentration camp, but not from any policy of extermination. Rather, most of these deaths occurred as a result of a typhus outbreak near the end of the war in early 1945. Today, even proponents of the ""Holocaust"" story acknowledge that Dachau was not an extermination camp. But there's a huge problem. Immediately after the war, inmates told stories of ""homicidal gassings"" taking place at Dachau. And the U.S. Army even produced a ""documentary"" video alleging that inmates were murdered using a homicidal gas chamber. The only gas chamber at Dachau was a delousing chamber used to kill lice and prevent disease. See here for evidence and video: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2009/10/dachau-us-army-and-government-lies.html

5. The Nuremberg trials were a kangaroo court and propaganda display, not a genuine and fair finding of fact. Traditional western rules of evidence were not followed. Proof of the crimes alleged was not required. Whatever accusations were made by the prosecutors were termed ""facts of common knowledge"", and could not be questioned by the defense. See here for proof: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-nuremberg-trials-admittedly-did-not.html. Dozens of the defendants were tortured by the Allies (beaten, testicles crushed, etc) into giving false ""confessions"" to crimes which they did not commit. One of the glaring examples of this was Rudolf Hoss, the commandant of the Auschwitz camp, who was tortured by British military intelligence and then ""confessed"" to killing ""2.5 million"" jews at Auschwitz. See here: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2015/06/huge-smoking-gun-fake-confession-of.html

6. Based largely on this false confession by Hoss, at Nuremberg the Allies ""proved"" that ""4 million"" people were allegedly killed at Auschwitz. Decades later, around 1990, the government of Poland revised the number of alleged deaths at the Auschwitz concentration camp to around ""one million"" (which is also false). How do ""3 million"" deaths vanish, and the sacred ""6 million"" number remain unchanged? See here: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2009/09/at-nuremberg-4-million-deaths-proved-at.html

7. Other absurd and now debunked allegations (war propaganda). At Nuremberg, the Allies presented ""testimony"" and ""evidence"" of various other outrageous crimes -- including steam and electrocution chambers, mobile bone-grinding machines, shrunken heads, making soap out of human fat, and lampshades from the skin of jews. Most of these ridiculous allegations are no longer alleged by even proponents of the kosher fairytale. See here: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2009/10/human-skin-lampshades-and-nazi-shrunken.html. This is nothing more than war-time propaganda, similar to the U.S. Government claiming that Saddam Hussein's army took babies out of incubators in Kuwait and bashed their brains out. The Allies used similar propaganda against Germany in World War One, with false claims of ""bayoneting babies"" and ""making soap from corpses of their dead soldiers"". See here: http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/02/world-war-one-anti-german-propaganda.html

8. Why? What is the purpose of the ""holocaust"" lie? The ""holocaust"" mythology is of EXTREME importance to shaping the world following WW2, and furthering the agenda of the ruling jewish elites. First off, the ""holocaust"" mythology acts to protect jews as a group, insulating them from criticism and opposition, allowing jewish elites to maintain and strengthen their grip on power in Western nations. Secondly, it is a great psychological weapon against not only the German people, but all whites/Europeans -- which cripples the will of whites to resist their attempted annihilation via the weapon of Third World non-white immigration. Those who dare to speak out against and oppose the jewish ""multicultural"" and non-white immigration policies are primarily deterred, marginalized, and intimidated into silence and acquiescence by the Marxist ""anti-racist"" brainwashing, which primarily relies on the false history of the Holyhoax and Nazi Germany, and the idea that ""racially aware"" Europeans are monstrously evil and dangerous. In this paradigm, the very idea of ""white nationalism"" and that the European peoples have the right to self-determination and nations for their own people is effectively made criminal. Lastly, the lie of the ""holocaust"" acts to conceal the fact that the TRUE genocide of World War Two was committed against the GERMAN people, with at least 15 million ethnic Germans killed after the war, in a policy of deliberate genocide orchestrated by the ruling jewish elites who controlled the American, Soviet, and British governments.

61mc9e,1,2017-03-26,Grad School Finances Advice,YellowMellowFellow90,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/61mc9e/grad_school_finances_advice/,"So, as the title implies, I'm 27, and I have just been accepted into 2 year graduate program starting in the Fall. I have about $18.9k in my IRA (2/3 in a regular, 1/3 in a Roth) and $15k in an employer sponsored 401k. I also have about 30k in savings. I am unmarried and have no debt. 

I think I can keep all of my living expenses to about $1250-$1600 a month; I do own an older car that needs a lot of maintenance. I also have some credit card reward points I've been amassing in anticipating for graduate school (I'd like to go on one European trip during this time).

Tuition, books, and health insurance is expected to cost about $27k a year. I can take a federal loan maximum of $41k for the 2 years, while interest is accrued during my time in school (I believe the rate is 6.8%). I plan on, at a minimum, paying off the interest to avoid the interest being added to my principal owed amount (what would happen if I deferred paying interest during school)

My boss plans on keeping me part time next year, and I think I can make about $24k- $30k a year (depending on the number of hours I can handle around my graduate course load). This might be even more if I get a good internship for the summer.

So my question is: how much should I be keeping in an emergency fund and how much should I be using to just pay off school costs/ use for living costs?

Should I bother contributing to an IRA this for the 2016 tax year? If so, regular to get a higher tax return or a Roth? The maximum amount?

Thank you in advance for your advice and for reading this long post! All of your advice is appreciated!

I'm having trouble being effective in my support.",Eton1357,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/61mcvk/my25m_girlfriend23f_is_falling_short_of_her_life/,"Recently my girlfriend has been getting increasingly more depressed about her standing in life/ the outlook of her future. I'm really worried that she is giving up on her dreams and I know that it'll make her unhappy if she does. It has been really difficult talking to her about it because I'm half trying to console her and half trying to kick her butt into gear. She's really sensitive to these conversations though, so anytime I bring it up it's a little painful. She's at a point where she's just complacently laying in bed for a big chunk of the day taking no steps to get where she wants to go. 



I'll do my best to sum up the situation. We live together, I'm in school for industrial design Graduating in May. I have a great internship with a firm in town. She's going to be graduating in May with a degree in music and psychology. No job, or job prospects. She has been in school for about 6 years with a lot of debt that is worrying the hell out of her/me. Her dream is to be a songwriter, but she has some obstacles in her head that have kept her from doing that.




First of all she has social anxiety to the point of her not being able to perform or be personable to strangers. Big problem in the music industry. Second, she hasn't been able to record anything for months because she doesn't have the right equipment at home and pro recording is expensive. Finally, she has to be in the right mood to write anything and since she's been depressed she hasn't written at all.




Now, I'm a person with a strong work ethic, so the above problems are all things that are very hard for me to sympathize with. To me they're just easily solvable problems. But anytime I mention that she could go to school to use their equipment or ask my dad who is a composer to help her out I just get a whole lot of defensive reasons why she can't do that. 




She is so proud that it's difficult for her to accept any help. I've done so much from doing job searches, to getting her in contact with professionals to even trying to buy her recording studio time. Nothing helps. I've suggested that she should go talk to a therapist, but she hates that idea also. Through this whole thing I've been trying to reinforce the idea that I'm there for her and that she can trust me, but it doesn't feel like she feels that way.




The biggest problem is that she refuses to compromise on anything. She wants to write what she wants to write no exceptions. She doesn't want to work hard. She has all of these things that she doesn't want to do and it's blocking her from the goals that I know she's capable of attaining.




How can I be better at helping her and how can I get her to realize that she needs to work hard for her goals?

By now I've heard back from all the colleges I applied to, but I never found the college that I loved and could get into. At this point, I need to pick a college from the list of schools I've been accepted into and I'd love to get some opinions on this. 

Here are the colleges I've been accepted to minus some I feel comfortable ruling out:

* ASU - Barrett Honors program and scholarship
* Colorado Boulder - 6k per year scholarship
* RIT
* University of San Francisco - 16k per year scholarship
* Santa Clara University
* Case Western Reserve University
* Boston University - 20k per year scholarship
* Union College

Currently, I'm leaning towards San Francisco, Santa Clara, Case Western, and Boston University (not in any particular order) but I wanted to add the others to make sure I'm not missing anything.


To personalize this a bit here's some information about myself. I will be majoring in computer science and would like to participate in undergraduate research along with summer internships throughout college. When it comes to the location I do like an urban environment so I'd be happy in a big city and I don't mind being anywhere in the United States it just has to be nice.

What would you choose if you were in my shoes?"

For example, can I occasionally text people? Can I have skype open to message people (not call)? What about calls? Can I play some passive (click once every couple minutes) video games while I work? Or would my boss get mad at me/disallow these things?

Also, say I have a friend who is also going to get an internship at the same company as me. Could it be arranged so that we can sit next to each other while we work?

Last thing, is it likely that I would be able to work from home sometimes? How often is acceptable to work from home, as opposed to going into the office?

For reference, I am in Ontario, Canada, and dealing with more traditional tech companies than startups."

I am a student attending MDC, and I plan to transfer to FIU during spring 2018. I am currently pursuing a B.S in Computer E. and Electrical E. Ideally, I am interested in artificial intelligence, but anything related to electrical or computer engineering interests me. I have plenty of questions and would appreciate any advice or any answers. (Edit: I suck at formatting, first post on reddit, I apologize).
1. Are there any scholarships, clubs, internships, or programs that would be beneficial that I should know about? (Currently a member of SHPE &amp; Phi Theta Kappa at MDC).
2. It is my understanding that B.S CompE and ElectricalE are very similar, so let's say that they both require 120 identical credits and 28 different credits, could I earn both of them by taking the 120 common credits and then the (28 x 2) different credits? Or does it work differently?
3. How is the online MBA program? Is getting a master's in engineering worth it, or is an MBA better? How about a Ph.D in engineering?
4. Is it possible/recommended to attempt to enroll in the FIU honors college despite having my A.A from MDC?
5. Although an A.A requires 60 credits, STEM students often accumulate much more during ""their first 2 years"" (I apologize for my wording here). Will FIU take take all the credits I have that apply to engineering program, or only 60, meaning I would potentially have to repeat some classes? If I do have to repeat classes, would I choose or no?

I would have also taken care of all pre-reqs plus 2 highly recommended pre reqs that I had to go to two different CC's to get. 

But thing is, my EC's are laughable. I worked at a restaurant for 4 months in 2015. Volunteered for 3 months in 2012 and besides the hobbies I have like video editing and working out, that is pretty much it.

I am trying to get a summer internship this summer but it's a long shot due to me being at a CC and not having taken very many upper division courses yet.

So will the lack of EC's really cripple me. Are they critical to getting accepted to UCLA, especially for mechanical engineering or any engineering? "
61nfpx,1,2017-03-26,Me [25M] flirting with co-worker [22F]. Genuinely interested or friend-zoned?,wvmrtn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/61nfpx/me_25m_flirting_with_coworker_22f_genuinely/,"Some backstory of me: I'm some Swiss engineer working in some research center, recently graduated last year. I've just got out of a 8-9 months relationship a month ago with a Czech girl who lived in Prague. We were doing the LDR thing and I found out she was cheating on me for two months when we were on holiday in New York for Valentine's. 

Anyhow when I came back from NY, I was pretty f*cked up and depressed and impulsively booked a flight to Madrid in three weeks time (meaning last weekend). I had some friends I wanted to see and I had 2 unused coupons for some plane company that I had purchased to visit my now-ex in Prague. I had the attention of going alone until one of my Spanish friends found that weird, so I asked pretty much all my friends and co-workers in Switzerland but no-one could come with me last-minute.

Now here is where things get interesting. This new intern [22F] had just started working the day I came back from NY. The first week we just talked, got to know each other a little but nothing too fancy (mainly because of my depression). Two weeks in though, when I was looking for someone to come with me to Madrid, I sent her a text (yes I already had her number) asking if she wanted to fly to Madrid with me. The answer was a solid yes but I could sense she was hesitant, mainly because we barely knew each other. I offered her the second coupon but we split all the bills (Airbnb and all). 

Some backstory of her: she just go out of a 5-year relationship (the day she started working as well). The guy wants to get back with her but her not at all. They're sill seeing each other from time to time but it's mostly him wanting to win her back. On top of that, she was 6 months in Brazil beforehand, where she had a LDR with him at first until doing a pause and finally going out with some Brazilian guy for a few months and unpausing her previous relationship after coming back home. The Brazilian guy and her are still in contact but she told me it won't go anywhere further (mainly because of the distance).

Anyway, fast-forward to our trip to Madrid. During our trip we got to talk about almost everything: family, friends, life stories, previous relationships you name it. And it sometimes went in full detail. We really got to know each other in such a short time, it was so easy to talk to one another, and we were not scared of small physical contact (hugs, a hand on the thigh etc...). Needless to say, I was starting to fall for her, hard. So hard I went for the kiss when we were coming back from drinking one night and taking the metro back to our Airbnb. She kind of refused the kiss and said, I quote: ""I want to stay faithful"". I'm the kind of guy that gives zero f*cks, so I apologized for my move and we continued having a good time together in Madrid. Things were not at all awkward. 

Back home/at work now, we are still speaking to each other, a lot. We send snaps, emails at work about stupid and non-work-related things. I try to stay professional when seeing her in person but flirt like a hog by message. I suggested going on a road trip next month just her and me for a weekend, turned out to be a big positive yes. 

Now, I'm pretty sure she's kind of interested in me but considering what happened in Madrid and her backstory I'm starting to consider a whole new-level of friend zone. Am I right to think about this or am I being paranoid? 
The ""I want to stay faithful"" move may have been a polite excuse or is actually true: she was very faithful to her 5-year ""ex"" when she was in Brazil because that Brazilian guy was trying for months before getting anything. And she may still feel attached in some way to both guys. Then I don't know if she is staying faithful to her 5 year-guy or the Brazilian dude, I'm confused. 
Anyway, she clearly knows I like her. I have given enough signals in Madrid and she doesn't seem to be backing off. Help?

**TL;DR;** : Known this co-worker for a month only, we travelled to Madrid together. We both have complicated pasts but we get along almost perfectly. Is she genuinely interested or am I being thrown in a new-level of friend zone ? "
61o5i9,22,2017-03-26,I recently noticed something about confident people,axp99,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/61o5i9/i_recently_noticed_something_about_confident/,"I feel like social anxiety and low confidence go hand in hand, so I wanted to share this thing I noticed recently. It might even be common sense to a lot of you, but it was somewhat of an epiphany to me. Confident people tend to think anything good that happens in their lives are because of their actions/abilities. Anything bad is because of something that’s outside their control.

For example, I have a friend from college who (in my opinion) isn’t the brightest. He got his post-junior year internship through a family connection, and he is at his dad’s firm now. But he carries himself like he derives a great sense of accomplishment from his work. And I’m not saying this to bring him down at all, I know he works hard and earns his paycheck fair and square.

On the other hand, I work for a Tier 2 company in my industry. For a long time, I’ve subconsciously told myself that I’m only here because the Tier 1’s rejected me. In fact, whenever something bad happens in my life, I instinctively relate it to a belief that my inadequacy led to the outcome. X happened because I wasn’t good/attractive/smart/cool enough.

I’m starting to apply this logic to social interactions as well. Every time something goes well, I’ll say it’s further proof that I’m a normal, functioning human being. If something doesn’t go well, I’ll say the other person was busy/in a bad mood/etc. Hopefully, this will help me build up my confidence and someone else’s too."
61o8sb,3,2017-03-26,"I was planning on pursuing a BSCS, but have many years experience in ""Technical Support""...will this hurt my chances?",Fuegopants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61o8sb/i_was_planning_on_pursuing_a_bscs_but_have_many/,"So, in short I started as a customer support technician right out of highschool at 16 (yes I graduated early). I worked my way up to management in 2 years, and have since moved on to a larger company in a big city. 

I've been here 2 years and am about to have worked my way up to T3 in a company who's support team has highly specialized knowledge in our industry. We support and repair online streaming by encoders running in a cloud based environment. This job has given me the opportunity to get my hands dirty with some pretty new technologies and our company is regarded as the ""cutting edge"" of our industry.

*All of that being said, I'm still very young and if I go back to college for my BSCS, I'll graduate in 2 years (at 27) with over a decade of experience in IT/Support, 4 years management experience, and 2 years as a high tier support engineer in a technically demanding company.*

I was extremely confident that this would have given me a leg-up (as it seems most people can't even get internships) until I started reading this sub's opinion of the ""dirty stain"" that is being labelled as technical support.

Then I thought about the way the SWE department has treated ours since I've been there and it made total sense. This is really disappointing since (in our company) it seems that the majority of them have their heads planted firmly up their asses. 

It seems like the age-old divide between an engineer and a mechanic. Yes, an engineer has much more technical knowledge than the mechanic and understands things that the mechanic doesn't even consider. But often mechanics have wisdom about the difficulties which arise based on years of use and wear or typical consumer mistakes that the engineer doesn't even think to consider.

This divide is extremely disheartening. In my opinion, our industries are two sides of the same coin and in-depth knowledge of the kinds of issues which arise in the application of products should be regarded as an over-all positive.

...but that's just like, my opinion man.

Anyways, I'd love to hear your thoughts on my situation and how best to tackle it! Thanks guys!

**TL;DR:** I have built a fantastic resume over the last 8 years, but based on this sub's discussions about ""technical support"" stereotypes.. I'm beginning to question even pursuing a BSCS degree.

So, will it hurt me? Help me? or not even matter? I'd hate to throw away a decade's worth of progress in a career.

He gave us each a free shirt the moment we walked in, showed us around, talked denim with us, showed us how all the machines worked, and even did some demonstrations for us. I told him about my cuffs ripping and a small crotch blowout forming and he offered to fix them for me  for free! I told him I might take him up on his offer in a little bit. Before we could leave, he gave us several yards of nice, neppy denim to ""make stuff with."" It was an amazing trip.

Fast forward to this weekend. We came up again to get the repairs done and hang out around the shop. When we walked up, the doors were closed and no one was there. I was extremely disappointed (especially since it was during posted store hours) and we left to go get coffee. While we were getting coffee, I texted him that we had stopped by and were sorry that we missed him. He texted me back quickly and said that he was so sorry and had to take care of an emergency and that he was on the way back to the shop.

We went back to the shop and talked to him for a while. It was a little past 6 (at this point) and he just kept talking to us and took a look at my denim. He repaired them on the spot while I was there, told my girlfriend about an internship he was going to have at his shop over the summer, and even did a couple of modifications to my denim at my request.

He stayed and worked on my denim until about 7:50 pm, 2 hours after his shop was supposed to close. He was so nice and accommodating the entire time (even tried to turn on march madness for us) and is just all around the kindest person I have ever met. Not to mention that **I have not given him a cent!**

He is just an amazing dude that loves people and denim. If you get a chance, just stop by the shop and talk to him. He is the coolest guy in the world, knows a ton, and might be willing to make your jeans into Billiam Hybrids as well, but only if you ask nicely ;)

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/r0b8M) are the repairs and modifications. Again, thank you so much Bill!"

I ask because my university's careers fairs are slowly ending and the job board on my engineering school's career center seems to have less and less open opportunities.

I've also been told that Indeed is still a very valuable source but was wondering if anyone else had other great sources/experiences/advice/etc?"

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

61pkir,1,2017-03-26,Commuting an hour to school - Worth it for a more valuable degree?,csvscisthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61pkir/commuting_an_hour_to_school_worth_it_for_a_more/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions, 

I'm currently about to finish up my second year in a Computer Information Systems program at a small state university. Since I was young, I've always wanted to do software development so I've declared a software development emphasis at my current school. 

However, I've recently been thinking about switching universities to a school with an actual Computer Science program to increase my chances of getting a dev job right out of college. I understand that CIS is often viewed as a lesser degree and therefore I have to work on personal projects and reach for internships a lot more than a CS student. 

The closest university near me with a computer science program is an hour away - more with heavy traffic or bad weather. I currently live at home and can not afford to live on campus, so my only choice would be to commute roughly two hours each day.

Is the commute worth the more valuable degree in the long run? Or would it be a better choice to stick it out at my current school and hope a CIS degree is enough to get me hired doing software development? 

Thanks guys! 

Edit: There is also the chance that a lot of my credits won't transfer. Some of them will, but I'm reasonably certain it would add at least another year to my graduation date."

This will be extremely expensive because not only is it an extra semester but its not full time which means I have to pay for each class individually.  
  
I just completed a final round interview for a summer internship/full time job (internship over summer, full time after I finish school) that should let me know by the end of next week. I am worried that telling them this after they offer me a position will seem suspicious or that I was lying on my resume. (Obviously not a problem if Im not offered anything) Although I should mention that it was almost never brought up in the interview and the vast majority of what I knew came from two prior jobs. (I only took two classes towards the minor)  
  
Can anyone let me know how serious this might be and how to avoid looking like a liar?"

61pt37,2,2017-03-26,End of Week 1 - A Great and Rough Start,FreydAlrek,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/61pt37/end_of_week_1_a_great_and_rough_start/,"So I am approaching the end of my first week of officially going NoFap.  I would like to try and post here every week or two, if I can, to give updates on what I experience week to week with NoFap.  I hope that by sharing here, I can have a kind of journal to look back on to keep myself motivated, and maybe to motivate others on their journey.  This will probably be a much longer post than successive posts, given that I will be giving some background about what my life was like before starting NoFap.  

For many years, even long before I heard of NoFap, I have hated the fact that I was addicted to masturbation.  Luckily for me, porn never really appealed to me for some reason, but I could never help but masturbate to the image of women (even fully clothed) that I found attractive (is anyone else here like this?).  I have tried before to quit, with very poor success, probably only capping out at around 21 days, and that was probably just luck.  However, when I heard about NoFap, it gave me a new determination to hear that my addiction may be the cause (or at least a large contributor) to my mental health problems.

I have suffered most of my life (I am 22) with crippling social anxiety.  In recent years, it has become worse to the point where I find myself in situations where I can barely function.  I have also noticed that I seem to have developed Tourette's-like symptoms, where I have multiple motor and vocal tics. Luckily, these mostly only show up when I am alone for some reason but they also get worse with stress.  Another thing I have noticed, is that I get really upset and anxious when I am in a room full of repetitive noises.  For instance, I had an internship last summer in a cubicle environment where I would hear people's voices, telephones ringing, etc. all day long.  I had to take several ""bathroom breaks"" in the day just to take a break from all the noise.  Sometimes the stress of an anxious life would leave me feeling ever so slightly dissociative, felling like ""life isn't real"".  So as you can see, I may be able to hold myself together enough to get through life right now, but I am a mess.

So now that I have given the baseline for what my life was like before NoFap, now to talk about my first week of NoFap.  The first three days were fairly uneventful.  They mostly consisted of the minor urges that I had become so accustom to giving in on before.  In the middle of day 4 however, I started experiencing incredibly intense urges that lasted about 24 hours minus the time I spent asleep.  It is as though my genitals were screaming at me for not giving them the pleasure that they had been given for years.  My anxiety was through the roof and I felt like I had quite a brain fog going on.  My feelings of loneliness were amplified making me feel like ""I will never get a girlfriend"".  In the middle of day 5, my urge calmed down, and towards the end of the day, I started getting really excited about the idea of talking to women (something entirely out of character for me).  I wanted so bad just to be able meet a girl that night and this lasted throughout much of the next day (day 6), but with college work going on and no opportunities to meet women, those feelings were never satisfied.  I really felt like I suddenly had some confidence in myself and felt quite euphoric.  If that was a placebo, then it was a darn good one.  I even decided to randomly go out for a walk, and was smiling quite a lot that day.  Overall, I can't remember ever feeling as happy as I did yesterday.  I still had some minor anxiety in certain situations during this happy episode, however it was much more manageable.  That brings us to today on day 7.  Today was a bit down hill from my happy episode.  My anxiety wasn't as manageable today when I was out at lunch with my family (the restaurant and the conversations were noisy).  I still feel the urge to meet women, but in a much less confident way, and that is pretty much where I am at now as of the writing of this.

Overall, this week has been great and terrible, however, I endured without touching myself sexually once.  I experienced emotions that I forgot I had, or may not have even known I had in the first place this week.  My happy episode of this week will be the motivation for many weeks to come.  I don't really have a goal for how long to do this so I guess my goal is just ""indefinite"".  Anyway, goodnight and stay fap-free my friends. :)"

I have a lot of questions and I thought this sub would give me a good range of answers.

The areas of specialization I'm most interested in are Computer Vision, Robotics, and Signal/Image Processing. Which ones have the strongest chance of me getting employment (with just the MS) and research opportunities? 

Also, what should I do to be successful in a Master's Program? Two years seems like a lot less time to develop useful skills. And I feel like networking is a lot more important, but I'm honestly not sure how to go about it. Any tips/advice?

Thesis or non-thesis? Industry job is the endgame, but I'm not opposed to doing a Phd if I could get funding. I'm leaning towards doing the thesis, but I'd love to hear opinions from a EE perspective. 

In undergrad, they really emphasized the importance of being active in clubs, both relevant to your major and otherwise. Does this same sort of thing apply in a graduate degree? In a similar note, are personal projects something people do? (Or are supposed to do?)

Are internships during the summer common? Or do people just work on research? And if I were to try and get an internship over the summer, what would I have to do to appear competent. Again, I feel like one year is not a lot of time, and I'm not sure how I'd show a company that I'm worth investing in in that short amount of time. 

Lastly, is there anything I should do/buy/learn/work on before starting the program to help set me up for success?

I'd appreciate any perspective on any of the questions. Thanks so much! "

Despite preforming well in school, it's never been my cup of tea and have really have only dealt with it because it's seemed like the best path. I love CS and learning in general, but for me college has always just felt so redundant, slow, unexciting, etc. I ended up dropping out of high school my second year for similar reasons. 

Anyways, I have an internship at a big4 company coming up this summer and I'm curious if it'd be realistic, possible even, to convert this into a full time position afterwards without going back to complete my degree. I'm pretty confident in my abilities, so I have no doubts about getting a return offer, but I assume it'd be contingent on finishing my degree? 

Just going through the motions at school has been making me pretty miserable lately, and at this point I don't really learn anything new or useful there. So I guess my specific concerns are 1) if and how I could actually make this happen, and 2) how much difference an uncompleted degree would make further down the line.

Thoughts? Has anyone done or wanted to do this, or am I just having some sort of existential crisis lol? I'd like to hear your opinions and advice!"

Feel free to give feedback/improve.

I have a major problem putting things off and not accomplishing small things. Things like cleaning up my room and doing 10 minute exercise. Often times it's not event that I don't want to do them. I just forget.

Usually those ""small things"" spill over to big things. Like making major decisions, applying for jobs/internship and such.

So I started making a day's goal in the morning. Things like ""Clean room"", ""Redo Resume"", ""Apply to 5 internships"". I write them down on a paper that I carry all throughout the day, and I look back on it to remind myself to do them. This helped out a lot.

Recently I upped the game by assigning scores on them. Out of 100 cleaning my room would be 5, spending 3h studying would be 30 so on and so forth. I try to be honest when I assign scores, so I don't cheat myself by giving me 100 for taking a shower. I try to assign enough tasks that in my usual days I'll get about 80 points done.

And at the end of the day I tally up the day's score and look back on it. Sometimes this will motivate me to get that final 5 points. Even if not it's always good to look back on how I did for the day.

I am in my last semester of senior year of college for undergrad. The winter semester was a nightmare with crazy stress levels from school and I had the roommates from hell. In the spring semester, a few moved out so I thought it would be better. Once the spring semester started, a string of bad events keep happening to me. It first started with my roommate's boyfriend becoming a live-in and on one night, he was having a bad day and decided to lash out on me for no reason. I didn't feel safe in my own apartment anymore because my roommate didn't see why she couldn't bring him around anymore. Cops didn't do anything and made me feel bad about myself for not calling the night of. My housing management told me they didn't want to get involved. I ended up moving out after finding a sublease to my old place. I lost two weeks of my life being in extreme distress and moving to a new environment. I became really behind in school and I wasn't sleeping or eating properly. I grew really restless and exhausted with life. I was constantly studying very late night at night and wasn't sleeping enough. On top of all that, I kept feeling the stress and pressure with finding an internship + full time jobs in different cities. I tried signing up with a therapist on campus but didn't get one until recently and I felt bad relying on my friends and family to vent. 

Because of dropping a class a year ago, it pushed back my graduation date so I am still in the city of my school trying to find an internship. But I keep getting denied because of my availability during the summer and full-time jobs back from where I am from keep denying me because I assume it's too far from now to when I can actually start. I already felt bad that I had to take a summer session but thought I could turn it around but seeing as a month of the semester is left. I am starting to get worried. 

I just found out a week ago too that I was the entire intern last summer who didn't get a full time offer out of 12, which really broke my heart because I truly loved that place. Recently, I was in the process of interviewing and then the company called me to tell me their entire internship program was pushing back to next summer and no longer having interns over the summer. I did an interview recently where I didn't get the 2nd round but my friend did (happy for her, disappointment for me; i thought it went well). Then my sublessor at my old place told me she wanted to back out and I don't have the funds to pay 2 rents. All in 3 days. 

To some, this may seem trivial or standard college stress but it's all too much at once for me. I am starting to feel like I am cursed. 

Bottom line: For those who are older or experienced something similar, does it ever stop? Does the string of bad luck stop? Because I don't feel like I can keep up with all of this unfortunate events. It's almost tearing me apart piece by piece. Every time I think something great is coming my way, I either get a small taste of it or it falls short. I speak to my therapist about it and it helps a bit but we just only had my 2nd session about it. I am starting to lose faith in life. "

I've been lurking through this forum for the past few months while embarking on my own journey of getting ready for the GMAT and applying for B school.

I have started to reach out to mentors, people that have went through B school and those currently in it to learn more about it, specifically in terms of relationships. I'm currently in a 1.5 year relationship, and will be moving in with the love of my life this summer. The only issue is that my girlfriend is fixed into the city that we currently live in due to a program she is in, and will likely have to do an internship after this.

The issue becomes this, I can apply to B schools this fall for entry in 2018, or apply next year for entry in 2019. If I apply this year we would be apart for three years, next year only two years. 

I'm looking for help into making a list of pros and cons for when I apply. Some current ones are length of time away from each other and my yearning to break into strategy earlier rather than later (might drive me nuts having to wait). My girlfriend also is recommending I take the extra year so I can beef up my application, with another year of experience and potential ECs. That would mean I'd enter B school having just turned ~27 years old.

My profile is a 3.4 GPA, 730 GMAT for a top 5 program for Chemical Engineering. I have worked for about 31 months at an F100 company in their R&amp;D labs, getting a promotion at roughly 24-25 months in. I am currently on 3 patents, with potential for more in the coming year. ECs involving teaching children at a Sunday school, involvement with United Way, and co-captain of work league v-ball team.

61scfc,1005,2017-03-27,Tomorrow is the day of reckoning. Uninstalling if its another week of stalling. (Cashgrab rant),MDEARING,forhonor,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/61scfc/tomorrow_is_the_day_of_reckoning_uninstalling_if/,"The amount of Deja Vu i'm having with Daybreak/KOTK is amazing. 

* On one hand you have an amazing IP with unlimited potential and a massive hungry market.

* On the other hand you are a shit hole company run by money grubbing overlords. 

Its been in your hands for a month now, you have all the hard *data* you need. I'm finding it really hard to believe you didn't fire all your core devs at launch and a handful of interns are running the office. Please prove me wrong. If tomorrows stream doesn't sound like a step in the right direction it'll be uninstalled before dinner. 

--------------------------------------------

I just realized the saddest part is the 'step in the right direction' that keeps most of us here are simply things we've already been promised or have been stripped away *since* launch. 

* Promised weekly content. Promise broken week **3**. No word from anyone. (Social media manager in 2017- Ubisoft must think they are Valve)

* Beating dead horse here, but seriously where the hell are our two Maps? I can't even come up with a word to describe how confused I am this is still not fixed. What joke of a *AAA* launches with 3.5 maps? ONE INDIVIDUAL PERSON COULD HAVE FIXED A MAP BY NOW- ITS BEEN A MONTH. Comments below wanted a source on the timeframe it should take to fix the map. We were given a bullshit excuse they were removed so I feel free to give a bullshit timeframe on their fix. It is my opinion that they are simply too lazy to open map editor and remove the weather effects while they were being investigated on the back end.  

* Class buffs/balancing. These things can take longer and I want them to be done correctly the first time, so not whining about these yet. A quickpatch could have come out three weeks ago about PK though, not sure how they can't hotfix **something** to temporarily gimp her light spam. The only gaming friend IRL that I could get into this game left two weeks ago waiting for a simple class balance. Devs waiting a week to hotfix something is one thing- but a month seems incompetent.

* UI QoL fixes. Again, pure incompetence. My gear indicators still being bugged a month after launch is the dumbest thing I've seen in years and again: It seems like they fired anyone with any coding experience. 

Everytime I log in I have new gear indicators, If I come back to the lobby after a game I have new gear indicators. Not working as intended (I hope.) Also PC players cannot type in chat after dying in combat stance. This carries through even to the next match. If I want to type ""glhf"" I actually need to roll my face across the keyboard eight times before my chat is usable. Prove me wrong Ubisoft and fix something trivial like this before 2018 (I double dog dare you) 

* It doesn't take a month to implement penalties for leaving/rage quitting games. If the excuse is the P2P model, than I don't know what the heck to tell yas. A solid percentage of dropped games are from salt-induced rage quits and I'm not convinced this system has a failsafe way of determining quitters from droppers. (I know someone will bring up a dev said he could in-fact determine the way someone left a game, but why the hell hasn't it already been implemented? Why wouldn't something like that be implemented from Alpha?) 

**TL:DR** The list of known bugs is disgusting for the $2 million dollar paycheck you cashed at launch. At least act like you care or lose your remaining population. We'll know by tomorrow afternoon how big of a cash grab/act this really is. 

Devs if you're reading this: start bringing this up with your Satan CEO. Make them all watch the movie ""Horrible Bosses"" and sit there sternly staring at them while they watch it. (you know, for the *implication*) **Do it**

61tj4r,7,2017-03-27,Job Anxiety,BabyGroot69,SoftwareEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/61tj4r/job_anxiety/,"Hello everyone,

I am almost finished with my associates in computer programming and plan to attend a different college to obtain my bachelors. I am having the school help me search for internships for the summer but as the title says I have been having extreme anxiety. 

I have done all the C++, Java and Visual Basic classes required and I use Java for my personal projects and it is the main language I use. I want to become really good with Java rather than know a little about each language as for a beginner I feel that would make me more valuable. I have been using Java for about 2 years. 

Looking back on my beginner projects its obvious that I have come far since then. I recently finished an ftp application and am now working on a bus business system. Some days I really think I am doing good but a lot of the time I never feel like I'll know enough when the time comes to shine. 

Anyone else experiencing or experienced this? Sorry if this is posted in the wrong place. It's my first post. 

Thanks!"
61tnfi,4,2017-03-27,I feel like I have hit rock bottom today,Shaldoz,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/61tnfi/i_feel_like_i_have_hit_rock_bottom_today/,"I don't think I have ever felt this terrible in my whole life.

21 years old male, I have been using speed (methamphetamines in pills form) for the past 3 years. For most of this time, I used the drug recreatively at parties and it felt amazing. I could keep on partying all night long and still fulfill my duties on the next day. The comedowns were bad, but I expected them so I was kind of planning my schedule consequentially, and I was only using speed once every 3 months or so. Back then, it was only a party thing to me, but soon my friends pointed out to me that I was using on most parties we went together. It should have been a warning sign, but I didn't feel wrong since I wasn't the only one in my friends circle doing it. This recreative use lasted for about 2 years, during which I was in college and used pretty much only during the summer vacation and holidays.

Fast forward 2 years, I am now in my final year of a web developer program. For the last 7 months I have been using speed increasingly. I live alone in an apartment and to be able to pay the rent and my expenses, I began working more than usual. I was working 30 hours a week, on top of my 35 hours of college classes, not counting the heavy load of homework I had too. I soon became too tired to either work or go to school, missing several days of school. I then resorted to using speed to help me out during these tough times. I gained access to a regular dealer through a friend of mine since I didn't know any dealers (before, I was buying only small quantities from friends at the parties I went to). My best friend was aware of my habit and we would use together from time to time. He warned me that this solution will work for a certain time, but eventually the addiction will catch up to me. I listened to his advice and tried to limit my intake, but my body built resistance and I increased my use over time. This worked for about 5 months. I was still performing good at school and at work, but I had a tougher time to hide it from my family. My personal life became a mess, I would shower about three times a week and stopped shaving. My apartment also started to reflect the life I was living. My health worsened and I developed social anxiety.

For the past 2 months, I realize today that I have been what I feared to become: an addict. I started doing speed binges for no reason at all, staying awake for 72 hours sometimes. I used speed everyday and the days I didn't, I couldn't get out of bed. I ate only a meal or two a day. I stopped cooking and ate fast food most of the time. My school performances dropped a lot but I was still passing. My mother started to worry for me, and told me the last time she saw me like this was when I had a suicidal crisis 4 years ago. She told me I didn't seem happy anymore and that I seem darker than ever before, and it frightened her. She wrote me a poem describing the erratic way I was acting lately and how much it worries her. I didn't have the balls to tell her the truth, fearing she would try to force me in rehab or something. I finished college 2 weeks ago, and I am now doing an 8 week internship in order to get my degree. 2 days in my internship, I figured out the toilets could be locked, so I use speed there too (I am snorting it so I needed a place where I couldn't be caught). My downwards slope in the bottomless pit of addiction accelerated greatly during the last week.

Last Tuesday, after my internship shift, I went to jam with my band. After our jam, I went out drinking with my bassist. We drank a lot during the night out at the bar and my friend suggested we buy cocaine. We bought a gram, and after the bar closed, we went to the cocaine dealer's place and played poker for the rest of the night. We snorted the whole gram from 2am to 6am, we went back to my bassist's place and I snorted some speed before heading back to my internship. The day was awfully long, and I can't remember what I did this Wednesday night. I used a lot of speed too on Thursday, and slept only for 3 hours only that night. On Friday afternoon, I went shopping with my mother and after about an hour, I blamed social anxiety and told her I needed to go back home. The real reason was that I was having a drug urge, and couldn't stand it any longer. I stayed awake from Friday 7am to Sunday at noon. The whole weekend I felt like I would have a heart attack at any second. On Sunday I had planned to go see my luthier for a guitar fix, but I dozed off and slept through the whole day. I woke up briefly at 10pm, ate a bit of pizza, and went back to sleep. This morning, I woke up at 7am with an excruciating migraine. The first thought I had today was ""I'd rather die than having to go through this day"". I managed to take a shower, and crushed 2 pills in my bathroom. I snorted half a pill and tried to put the rest in a bag, but I was shaking so much I couldn't hold the bag steady enough and most of it went on the floor. I then looked at myself in the mirror. My eyes were still watery from the pain in my nose, and I noticed some rashes on the skin of my face. I couldn't go out like this. I called in sick at my internship, put on some music and started writing this text.

This morning, I have realized I am not a functional addict anymore. I am paying the price of the substance abuse from the last few months. I have no idea how I will fix this, or if will ever succeed in repairing what I have done to myself. I feel ashamed and fear there will be no future. I still have 6 weeks of internship to complete, and from the start I intended to perform well so they might hire me afterwards. I cannot quit cold turkey, I have already tried and I stayed in bed for 3 whole days, so this doesn't seem like an option. Right now, my best bet is to try to slack my drug use a bit and manage to go through the pain for 6 more weeks."
61tng1,1,2017-03-27,"Advice on moving forward, sort of at a crossroads.",themoofinman,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/61tng1/advice_on_moving_forward_sort_of_at_a_crossroads/,"Hello! Would love a bit of advice from people that have gone through this process before. I’ve a self-taught developer that has only been coding for about year and a half. The main resource I’ve used has been the freecodecamp curriculum, and then supplemented with a bunch of books and videos.

Right before I finished the front end part of the project I landed an internship (sooner than I thought I would) in a startup doing full-stack work. It was unpaid, but I figured it’d be worth what I’d learn. It started slow and then rapidly increased. I learned more in that first 3 months than I did the year previously. I was hoping I’d finish the 3 month internship and be in a place where I could apply for dev jobs and land one. I’m switching careers so I’m working full-time in a different industry. Working full-time and doing my internship for an average of 25 hour a week just sucked. But I figured I needed to put in the time. Fast forward another couple months, about 40 applications, 15 phone interviews, and 3 in person interviews, I still don’t have a full-time gig. I’m still technically with the start up and working on a limited basis, but I’m not getting paid. I’m still learning from them, but I put so much of my work for them into a pretty large project that isn’t launched yet, so I can’t really put it in my portfolio. Also, during that whole time I dedicated everything to that project, so I wasn’t working on other side project. It seems that during my job interviews it looks like I’ve accomplished nothing. I don’t have cool side projects to talk about. I have one now that I’m doing since I’ve slacked off on the work for the startup, but I’m not sure how to move forward. Do I stop working with them and risk now learning from a team but building a portfolio, or do I stick with them to keep learning. I don’t get the job search so far. Some of the interviews I felt like I bombed I’ve made it to the 3rd round. Others that I felt like I did amazing, I never heard back. 

This whole process is draining. I feel like time spent prepping for interviews is taking away from my coding with the group, but I feel like if I don’t do that I’m not prepared. Advice on moving forward? Encouragement? 

TL:DR Working full-time, interning, and job search is wearing me out. Do I just suck it up and realize that is what I need to be doing?"

Tl;dr: Ive had seeming friendly concersarions with the security guard in my office building. But now he seems to want me, but I DO NOT like or want him. Now I feel mean because I don't want to return his texts or see him. Long  post below.

I've been working at my job's office three days a week since like December. I pass this security guard (as well as others) on my way in and always say hello. I always say goodbye. We recently just started actually having conversations and exchanged names. We joke and he seems very nice. Last week we were joking around, as I usually stop at the desk to chat. Security guy asked for my number and that we could grab lunch whenever I'm there early. The background for this request is that I mentioned to him that I'm usually an hour early to work so i can eat my lunch, as I don't have time at my internship. I also mentioned that I wanted to try the food from the restaurant that shares our building, but I haven't yet.

Anyway, I gave him my number. I am naive when it comes to reading if an interactiob is flirty or not. I really think I read the direction of our ""friendship"" wrong as it feels like he was flirting, after I thought about the conversation later. As I was leaving to go home, he was surprised I was leaving early. I felt the need to make up an excuse, because I didn't want to seem ""flirty"". He said to let him know I made it home safely. I said ""sure"" and scurried away.

He has texted me to say I forgot to tell him I was home. Now I think he's trying to ask me out based off of texts I just recieved. I want to casually mention a boyfriend just to make him back off. I feel mean and stupid at the same time. I also don't want to look silly by telling him to not flirt with me and to be told he was just veing nice and to not flatter myself (that's happened before). 

Am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable and how should I handle the situation."

They control the vast majority of the CSA's military assets, and for good reason - they are under constant attack from their Drakkar neighbors.

- Length of Year: 474 Days (~1.42 Earth Years)
- Mass: 1.1 Earth Masses
- Size (Radius): 6750 Kilometers (1.06 Earth Radii)
- Surface Gravity: 0.98 times Earth Gravity

#Appearance
The only difference in appearance between Siions and Earthians is the structure of their legs – they have an extra joint below their knee that bends in the opposite direction of the knee. Fully extended, this can put the average Siion at nearly seven or eight feet tall, but the natural position for their legs is to be bent at both knee joints, putting average height between six and six and a half feet.

The Siions’ militaristic nature has also led to the majority of Siions wearing above-the-shoulder hairdos and functional clothing over anything else. This gives the race a slightly more rugged look than others.

#Biology
Siions have tougher skin and higher pain tolerance than other races. They also tend to have faster reflexes and are capable of thinking faster in the moment than other races, though not as fast as the Citans. This is due to a sort of heightened and lengthened reaction to Adrenaline – however, as Siions have grown more and more powerful throughout the centuries, their “fight or flight” response has been rewritten to more or less just a “fight” response, resulting in the Siions becoming overly aggressive when threatened. Many a Siion has died because they unwisely fought in a situation from which they should have fled.

Otherwise, the only differences in Siion biology from Earthians is to compensate for their legs, which allow them to jump higher and run faster. They also allow them to become temporarily taller, which is an intimidation technique learned at a young age.

The Siion life expectancy is 176 years (250 Earth years).

#Date System
As with all other civilizations, each Siion planet has their own calendar based on the planet's day/night and year cycle, while the entire civilization has a standardized calendar to make interstellar relations easier to manage. However, whereas the Nimalians, Earthians, and Taizens base their civilization-wide calendar on their Homeworld's calendar, the entire Core Space Alliance has a single 300-day calendar, known as Standardized Galactic Time (SGT), that isn't truly based on anything. The calendar is not segmented into months, only days and years, with one year having 300 days and each day being 24 hours.

SGT dates are written as YYYYY.DDD

#History
Siion history has been rife with conflict all the way up to the point of space travel, which happened at around 4000 BC Earth time. Until that point the Siions were split between several different warring nation-states and remained that way until the planet’s resources began showing signs of depletion. After a devastating world war caused by the lack of resources the civilization wizened up and quickly consolidated into a handful of world powers so that they could more appropriately focus on space exploration. After spending almost a century colonizing their solar system they found an inactive Transpace orbiting about one AU out from the farthest planet from the sun and decided to activate it, not knowing what it was. After doing so the ship that was present was suddenly transported to a different system; the Transpace was then quickly exploited to start colonizing this new system.

Not long afterward, Siion scientists figured out that the second Transpace had yet another destination and were able to reach said destination, which was revealed to be yet another solar system. Intrigued by this discovery, the Siions gradually used discovered Transpaces to uncover new ones, expanding their space empire through their Galactic arm along the Transpace route. The discovery of several Interstellar Gates on various different planets through the galaxy assisted in this endeavor, but the Siions weren’t entirely sure how the coordinate system worked and were only able to figure out the coordinates of Interstellar Gates that they had already discovered.

After nearly two hundred years of undisturbed settling among the stars, a Siion scouting team had their first run in with the Drakkars on the edge of Siion space, nearest the Transpace World Gonaan. The scouting team successfully fled from the Drakkars, but not before half their members died and another several had their Ciei stolen. Realizing that this new race was a very real threat, the Siions very quickly began engineering space weaponry and outfitting their ships with said weaponry, as well as significantly increasing their ship production. Sure enough, the Exemplar Drakkars launched an attack on the worlds near Gonaan a mere five years later, leading to the very first Siion-Drakkar war. Eventually, the Drakkars withdrew on their own; the Siions would later learn that the withdrawal was due to a Sursum attack on Exemplar space at the same time. At the time of withdrawal, however, the Siions remained cautious, slowing their galactic expansion and taking care to protect their outer colonies.

After discovering five Transpaces and expanding their empire to cover the gaps, as well as fighting another two wars with the Drakkars, the Siions met the Dra’kis around 4560 SGT, or 2550 BC. This occurred when the Siions exploited the Lehmekarid Transpace and ended up finding a Dra'kis colony at Oriciid'kas. The scouting expedition very nearly attacked and wiped out the colony, but realized just before they did that the Dra'kis were an entirely different race from the Drakkars. Inter-racial dialogues soon began, upon which the Siions learned that the Dra'kis civilization was almost as large and advanced as the Siions themselves - yet had a significantly more diplomatic and peaceful approach to life. The two races then set up a trade coalition, recognizing that banding together would serve them well, especially in light of the Drakkars on the Siion border.

The coalition could not have been formed sooner, for the Drakkars launched their largest offensive yet on Siion space a mere fifty years later. The combined might of the Siions and Dra'kis was barely enough to hold off the Sursum forces, and the Drakkars actually succeeded in taking the world of Egdonikon two years later. The coalition was almost convinced they had lost - but just as the Drakkars closed in on Bowiisen, a Citan scouting party suddenly appeared at the Tau'cen Kii Transpace. The appearance of the new race startled everyone, but the Citans were quickly identified as non-Drakkar and the Dra'kis opened a dialogue with them. From the scouting party, the Siions and Dra'kis learned that the Citans had colonized their own region of space and had had their own run-in with the Drakkars multiple times. In fact, the Citans had created a powerful weapon to help counter the Drakkars - the first Deathnought. The Siions and Citans quickly worked out a deal to use the Deathnought to push back the Drakkars attacking Siion space, succeeding in taking back Egdonikon and fending off the Bowiisen attackers. Soon afterward the Drakkars retreated; elated by their apparent victory, the Siion forces attempted to follow the Drakkars, but found themselves trapped at the edge of Dead Space instead. The fleet quickly turned around and burned their way back toward known space until they could reach Chaos Energy-rich space again; it was during this time that the Siions learned of the differing Drakkar factions and their constant in-fighting by picking up on stray transmission signals. This information was relayed back to the main three civilizations when the fleet returned to known space five years later. Realizing the threat of the Drakkars, and that each of the races could learn and gain things from each other, the Siions, Dra'kis, and Citans banded together to form the Galactic Trade Coaltion - which evolved into the Core Space Alliance two millennia later.

Between the forming of the Galactic Trade Coalition (GTC) and the founding of the Core Space Alliance (CSA), the Siions began focusing on repairing and building up their planetary and interstellar infrastructure. They also began construction on their own Deathnought, which they completed fifty years later. This Deathnought, along with the Citan Deathnought, would serve as the deciding factors when the Exemplar and Sursum Drakkars forged a temporary alliance and attacked the Siions again, leading to a drawn out forty-year war. The Siions rushed a second Deathnought to completion in this time, and with the three Deathnaughts the GTC finally repelled the Drakkars. The ships received so much damage that they had to be decommissioned; the Siion Deathnoughts were scrapped but the Citan Deathnought was prepared as a memorial/museum near Citici. Following the joint Exemplar-Sursum offensive, the GTC reformed into the CSA, adopting Standardized Galactic Time and forming a centralized government for all three civilizations. All three races then began work on designing a second generation of Deathnoughts, eventually constructing one each a hundred years later. These Deathnaughts were the *Dakonis Raath*, *Abroshem*, and *On'esstin*, the same ships that saw action against the Nanocreatures in SGT 10231.

Upon founding the CSA, the three member civilizations decided to establish Oriciid'kas as the seat of CSA power, as it was the system that bordered all three races. The Siions established a second Primary Fortress World in the system, allowing them to more effectively protect Oriciid'kas and affirming their position as the CSA's protectors and enforcers. The new Fortress World, Siionkagh, became the most heavily defended Fortress World in all of CSA space within the mere span of 500 years, while the world of Oriciid'kas shot up into the most populous and wealthiest of CSA worlds in the same amount of time. To this day the Oriciid'kas system is the most heavily defended, yet most prosperous and populous system in not just all of CSA space, but the entire galaxy.

Several millennia later, around SGT 9000, the Siions finally deemed it safe to begin exploring the galaxy again and jumped to the Transpace beyond Bowiisen -- only to find themselves in the middle of an already settled system, Aykowin. The Siions and Nimalians quickly got along, but the CSA had grown confident in their own abilities and did not view the Nimalians as their equal (which was certainly true). As such the Nimalians were not offered a seat on the CSA. The Siions and Nimalians nonetheless opened up trade relations and there has been peace between the two civilizations ever since.

#Culture
Siions are a militaristic and straight-forward race, often committing themselves to their duties with a rigor that no other race could hope to match. Siions begin education at age 6 and go all the way up to 25, at which time they choose one of three paths – military service, scientific discovery, or public service. **Military service** is advocated the most and is the most chosen path; when it is chosen a Siion will spend time learning military basics for five years before joining the military police. After 10 to 20 years or a promotion they join the actual military, where they serve for up to 80 years; 120 if they are in top shape or otherwise desire to remain active. Afterward they enter the reserves and take some education in public service to enter the general workforce. If the **scientific discovery** path is chosen then the Siion will spend ten years in scientific education, and will then become assistants and/or interns for twenty years more. After that they are permitted to enter the scientific community of their own accord and work on their own projects until they die. If the **public service** path is chosen then the Siion will spend three years learning about the civilization’s infrastructure, and then another two to ten years learning about the profession they wish to take. After their education they will become assistants and/or interns for twenty to thirty years, after which they will enter the workforce on their own until they are allowed to retire at the Siion age of 150.

Favorite Siion pastimes include martial arts, hunting, and sports. Siions are also remarkably honorable and dependable; most Siions cannot even fathom cheating. Cheating and betrayal are regarded as the worst crimes a Siion could ever commit -- cheaters and betrayers are often exiled, usually with extreme prejudice. In fact, cheating and betrayal are considered such taboo that in murder or rape cases the perpetrator is often shamed more for the cheating and/or betrayal they did leading up to the murder or rape, as opposed to the final act itself. Siion crime rates are the lowest in the galaxy due to the civilization’s respect for the law, authority, and rules in general. It also helps that exiles are not considered USN citizens, and thus any further crimes they commit are not accounted for in the official crime rates.

Liberal arts are not considered interesting by the typical Siion, and neither are electronic means of recreation. If presented with a book or story of some kind they will quickly become bored; they only find being active themselves to be entertaining. Watching or reading or listening about fictional adventures is largely considered boring, but if there is truth to the tale then Siions will be significantly more willing to pay attention.

The average Siion will have a small, close-knit group of friends, which usually includes their mate. Romantic relationships aren’t as important to Siions as they are to many other civilizations -- while they do pay their mate more attention than their friends, there is rarely some kind of deep emotional connection between a Siion and their mate that they do not also share with their friends. If you threaten any of a Siion’s friends then they will not take it lightly (the comical day-to-day death threats of Earthians or Nimalians would earn you several deep glares from Siions), and if you actually injure their friends -- emotionally, mentally, or physically -- then they will hunt you down until they find you and exact justice. The Siion legal system explicitly permits this.

#Government
Siions are ruled by a Supreme Council which consists of three members: a Chancellor of the Military, a Chancellor of Science, and a Chancellor of the Public. These positions can be held until a chancellor either dies or resigns, upon which a new chancellor will be voted upon by the people in the respective field (ex. if the Chancellor of the Military steps down or dies, then Siions involved in military service will vote for the next chancellor). The three chancellors make all of the supreme decisions that involve the entire civilization, as well as important matters within their respective fields; to handle less important matters, each chancellor has a hand-picked board of six experts from their respective fields that handle different areas of their field. Individual planets generally have their own rulers as well, who serve as authority and caretakers for their own planet yet answer to the Supreme Council.

As of the creation of the Core Space Alliance, the Siions have two supreme representatives, just like the Dra’kis and the Citans. One representative is chosen personally by the Supreme Council while the other representative is voted upon by the entirety of the Siion race. The representative that the Council chooses remains in his seat until he either dies or resigns; the other representative holds his seat for twenty years at which point another election is held for his replacement. Additionally, as the Siions represent the strength of the CSA, they possess the largest space fleet in all of CSA space and act as enforcers for matters that affect the entire alliance.

Because of the Siion race holding honor and truthfulness in high regard, there is remarkably little corruption in the government.

#Economy
The Siion economy revolves largely around arms trading, though they also make money from martial arts and sports tournaments. Professional athletes earn large sums of money, which they often inject back into the Siion economy through either their respective sport or hunting.

Hunting also earns the Siions slight amounts of money, as licenses to hunt must be bought for a small fee. A Siion can also be charged for over-hunting, though this kind of misdemeanor rarely occurs.

Due to infantry deployments and the Siions’ thriving small arms trade, they use the Interstellar Gate network more than both the Dra’kis and the Citans; as such, they desire a high amount of ‘Gate security. The Citans are easily able to provide such technology in return for weapons, making the Citans and Siions important trade partners. The Siions are also the largest supplier of both small and large arms for the Dra’kis, who mostly pay back with credit and diplomatic favors.

The Siions also receive commissions and favors from both the Citans and Dra'kis for acting as the CSA's protectors and enforcers.

#Military Doctrine
Whenever Siions engage in war, they always ramp up into Total War status, gearing their entire civilization towards the cessation of conflict. They show no mercy to their enemies, but they rarely ever “shoot the messenger”, letting him go back to his own side as long as he doesn’t partake in an act of war himself. Siions are also in strong support of a “no man left behind” policy, often risking their lives to save a friend behind enemy lines or to extract P.O.W.s from the enemy. Siions also treat their own P.O.W.s fairly well for prisoners; they never resort to torture except in extreme situations. Siions are also trained to not give in to torture; to give in is considered betrayal, one of the largest taboos of the Siion civilization. As per CSA law, Siions never partake in scorched earth tactics, though their use of glassing is a point of contention with the Dra'kis and Citans.

#Religion
Siions no longer have a religion -- as a civilization they can be considered very secular. Siions do not believe in the existence of a higher being, nor do they believe in luck or destiny. The only thing that they believe in is their friends, their superiors, and their words, which they will never go back on. This way of thinking originated from the age of Siion space exploration, which, coupled with meeting the Dra’kis and Citans, completely shattered any previous religious beliefs.

#Miscellaneous Facts
- The entire Siion space navy consists of many hundreds of thousands of ships, over 30% of which are Capital ships. The Siions also have a total of fifteen Motherships and three Deathnoughts, though one Deathnaught - the *Dakonis Raath* - was destroyed during the Nanocreature War of 10231.
- The average Siion fleet size is 5500 ships.
- Siion schooling is much like boarding school, resulting in a society where everyone knows who their parents are but do not actually know them.
- Siions have a relatively low Chaotic potential when compared to the other two CSA races. Most Siion Chaotics are Introtechnics or Materiatechnics, though Navitastechnic or Extratechnic Siions are not wholly uncommon. Remarkably few Siions are Chaostechnics.

Here's the background:

* As a freshman, I applied online for company X and got immediately rejected (&lt; 2 days). 

* During fresh-soph summer, recruiter from company X contacts me out-of-the-blue and offers an interview for soph-junior summer. I get rejected after first phone interview, and recruiter offers me interview for another position at the same company. 

* I survive several rounds of phone interviews for 2nd position and make it to the onsite. I felt like I did well at onsite, but had trouble explaining some concepts clearly, and I got rejected.

Now, I'd like to re-apply to this company for a jun-sen summer internship. Is it weird if I email the recruiter and ask for an interview? Or should I re-apply online? (I'll wait and contact them during the summer when recruiting starts.)"
61uady,4,2017-03-27,School and Internships,electricpuzzle,MultipleSclerosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/61uady/school_and_internships/,"Hey all. I had a question for those with experience being in college and in the tricky time after college with job limbo. I am 28/F and had just gone back to school for Computer Science when I was diagnosed last May. I currently have a full time job but it's time to start looking at internships. The plus side is the pay for an internship will be better than what I have now (hooray!). The downside is more uncertainty than I would have normally had. A temporary internship doesn't guarantee a job at the end (though I am hopeful). I also assume it doesn't come with insurance, which means several months of being uninsured and with my medicine being $6K plus a month I am not sure I would be able to continue during that time, let alone if something like a relapse happened. 

Has anyone had any experience with this kind of situation or being temporarily unemployed and out of insurance? If I leave my current job and finish the internship without something lined up (which I will hopefully have) I might be out of luck for an indefinite about of time then as well. 

Any experiences would be very appreciated! Thank you"
61ueu3,1,2017-03-27,I (18F) am paying for myself to visit my boyfriend (21M) this summer and my dad freaked out,summertripthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/61ueu3/i_18f_am_paying_for_myself_to_visit_my_boyfriend/,"I have been together with my boyfriend for 4 years. I am now a senior in high school and will be attending college next fall across the country. My boyfriend has a great internship this summer for 9 weeks in the same city that I will be going to college. My boyfriend and I have made a plan for me to visit him during this summer, and we will be splitting all expenses ourselves. I have not asked my parents for any money.

My parents are quite conservative and traditional, and have trouble accepting the fact that I am an adult now. I have kept my my mom well informed with the plan of the trip for months now, and she has been okay with it since I am paying. I assumed she would tell my dad about it but she didn't until very recently. After she told my dad he confronted me, seemingly upset and uncomfortable about the situation. I told him I would keep him informed on the planning and details and that I am paying for it. Yesterday my boyfriend and I planned to buy our tickets that night because seats were running low and we wanted to get it done. I told my mom we were going to do this, sent her the itinerary, and asked if it all looked good (this was all over text because I was at work. I planned to go to my boyfriends immediately after work to purchase them). She said yes but that I need to talk to my dad before I purchase anything. So, on my way home from work last night I called my dad to tell him I was on my way to get the tickets with my boyfriend. I told him the times of the flights and the dates. He asked multiple questions such as where I will be staying (at my boyfriends rental), how I will be paying, and then he asked if I ever ""asked our permission."" I told him that i have kept my mom informed with all the plans and she has been fine with it all and that I am paying for this myself. He asks again ""did you ever ASK permission."" And said ""I don't really need your permission for this.."" He then begins to go off and yell on how I never asked permission and how now he knows how little respect I have for him, how weird I am acting in this situation, that I didn't even have the decency to discuss it in person etc. I apologized saying I'm sorry if I made him feel bad, that I do respect him, and that I would send him the itinerary so he could see all the details. He says ""right, because that's all I'm good for."" And then hung up. (?) Overall his argument really did not make sense and he was unnecessarily mean. I am an adult now and want to make my own decisions but he is refusing to except this. I understand it is hard to see your child grow up but you can't get mad at them for it. I am tired of this treatment but my dad is not one to change his mind and apologize. Both my parents want to have a ""talk"" today and I am not sure how to approach it. If I tell my dad I am an adult now and I am paying for this myself he gets mad and says that they are still in charge of me. I am beyond frustrated, but at the same time do not want him upset with me. I do not know how to approach this issue, any advice would be great!

TL;DR I am paying for myself to visit my boyfriend this summer during his internship. When my dad found out about it he freaked out saying I never asked permission and that I don't respect him. Don't know how to proceed."

I graduated from a top business school last year with a concentration in finance but wasn't able to land any gigs in the industry. (I transferred into the school junior year and had a tough time landing any junior year internships) I managed to get an administrative job over the summer at a bond rating agency (fitch) and then moved over to a boutique bond rating agency where I am a database administrator. I mostly use SQL to query the database, and some pre-loaded php scripts to enter them into the database. 

I want to pursue a career in data science but without a mathematics or CS degree I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to pick up enough skills to get hired. I've been slowly learning R on my downtime and have a little bit of programming work done. I took statistics and calculus in college but nowhere the level I would probably need to be at. 

I guess I'm just looking for anyone who might've had a similar path or some kind of guidance. Thanks"
61uuov,11,2017-03-27,(Brief Case Study) Don't Let Height Limit You Professionally,Green__Bananas,short,https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/61uuov/brief_case_study_dont_let_height_limit_you/,"I understand that a lot of people treat this sub as a place to vent, but I wanted to shed some positivity, especially for the younger guys. I made a similar comment a few months back about this but I think this deserves its own post. Yes, it sucks to be short sometimes, but it's just a negative feature that can be overcome, ESPECIALLY in the professional/corporate world.

We hear a lot about the often-cited study that the average CEO makes more and that there is a correlation between height and salary, especially in the business world. While this may have some truth to it, it does NOT mean that height will undoubtedly screw you over professionally. Height is just an obstacle to overcome, and one's intelligence, charisma, work ethic and EQ can help set them apart and make them successful. 

I'm a short guy at 5'7"", and it has not stopped me so far in my career. I am finishing up my undergrad at a top-ranked business school. Upon graduation in a couple months, I will be working at a global investment bank in their M&amp;A department (one of the hardest and well-paying jobs on wall street to get into), and this was all while being the shortest guy in the group. I interned with this group last summer and my height was not a detriment, because I was respected for my great work product. It's also not just me. At my school we have a decent amount of short guys in my year and a lot of them got internships in wall street, especially at the most prestigious banks (e.g. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc.). For reference, all of these guys were 5'5-5'7"".

Yes, I understand that these are just personal anecdotes, but there are several famous examples of short guys who have made it to the very top of the corporate world. Notice that the list includes people from industries where social influence is very important for success (which is why I left guys like CEO Mark Zuckerberg off). 

1) **Lloyd Blankfein:** 5'4"" -  CEO of Goldman Sachs, the most prestigious bank in the world.

2) **Michael Bloomberg:** 5'6 "" -  Founder and CEO of Bloomberg LP, NYC Mayor, $47.5B net worth.

3) **Steve Schwarzman** 5'6"" - Founder and CEO of BlackStone, one of the largest and premier private equity firms in the world. Net worth of $11.6B.

4) **Henry Kravis:** 5'6ish - Founder and CEO of KKR. Also one of the largest and arguably the most prestigious private equity firm in the world. Net worth of $5.0B.

5) **John Mack:** (unclear what is height is but he seems to be somewhat near Blankfein from photos. Played football in college so maybe a little taller) - Former CEO &amp; Chairman of Morgan Stanley. 

6) **Daymond John:** 5'7"" - Founder and CEO of FUBU. Seen on the TV show Shark Tank. 

7) **Robert Herjavec:** 5'8"" - CEO of the Herjavec Group and founder of BRAK Systems. Also seen on the TV show Shark Tank.

8) **Bernie Ecclestone:** 5'3"" - CEO of Formula One.

9) **Jordan Belfort:** 5'7"" - Former founder of Stratton Oakmont. Topic of the movie ""Wolf of Wall Street"". (Okay yeah, I know he was a piece of shit and not at all a role model, but at least he did big things despite his stature albeit illegally and grossly unethically).

10) **Jack Ma:** 5'1ish - Founder and Exec. chairman of Alibaba, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.

11) **Jeff Bezos:** 5'8"" - CEO of Amazon. 

Obviously these aren't all the examples, and there are far more short-statured guys in executive positions as well as middle-upper management on Wall Street and other F500 companies. One thing to note from the list above is that almost all of these guys above were not born into wealth. They fought and worked hard to get where they are today, just going to show that anyone can be successful if they have the drive.

Tl;dr - short stature won't hurt you too much in the business world if you don't let it. There are so many examples of successful people in business who are short. What matters most is competence, personality/EQ and work ethic."

Honestly I think networking might be my problem, because looking back at the (few) times people have offered me positions is when I know an employee.

Last thing about me is that TRULY TERRIFIES me is that it's so sad that people have said no to me so many times that I'm almost used to hearing people say it. I'm familiar with everything everyone says when they try to comfort me (""You'll get it next time, I'm sorry"").

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

I do want to get a M.S. in CS (in Computer Vision/Graphics to go into AR) and potentially an MBA farther off in the future in the future, and I'm not sure what to do and would like some advice on what to do in my last year to best solidify my undergrad career.

My current ""personal capital"":
Top CS school; 3.3 GPA (only thing that puts me in a bad spot); internships at top tech companies (Big 4 and Unicorn company); no research experience + no professor rec letter

My options for possible routes for the future:

1. I can apply for the 1 year M.S. CS program at Berkeley right after I finish this last year of my bachelors degree. 

        Pros: only 2 semesters long, cheap-ish (I can fund myself because of interning); 

        Cons: tbh I'm tired of UC Berkeley, would have to take GRE this year, need to pick up a research position to get a require rec letter; late start in industry 

2. Work in tech industry for several years -&gt; get my M.S. CS

3. Work in tech industry for 6 years -&gt; get joint MBA/MS CS

Which option would be the ""best"" in terms of (1) becoming a leader in the tech industry, (2) most time/money efficient? And should I try to do a research position before I graduate in order to get a publication/professor rec?"

I was offered admission to CSULB for CS back in February and yesterday I submitted my SIR.

proof: https://twitter.com/cashewtme/status/846194378959826944

As an incoming freshman I am very excited to be part of this school for the next 4-5 years.
I plan to live in the Parkside dorms (hoping I get a spot in the STEM [M] building!!) for the duration of my freshman year.

1) How would you STEM alumni and current STEM students rate your experience at CSULB as a whole?
2) How would any of you who have lived or are currently living at Parkside (if in the STEM building that's even better) rate your experience with the dorms?
3) Those of you CECS majors. Do you think it would be pretentious to believe there is a possibility to get an internship @ companies such as Blizzard or Obsidian? I plan on using my CS degree to work in the video game industry of which I know is large in Irvine and LA (both of which are nearby CSULB). And I am infinitely curious as to whether nurturing that dream will be a rigorous hyper-competitive hunt or not.
4) As far as roommates and finding one(s) goes. Part of me wants to go in blind and meet complete strangers the day I move in and take it all as college's adventure, the other wants me to really get to know the person before I live with them. Although I'm a gamer nerd and an awful pun enthusiast, I'm not socially derelict so I can adapt and speak to strangers if need be even if I'm not the best at it. What course of action would you guys recommend--go in blind? go with someone I know?...intensive vetting? xD

I'm looking forward to furthering my education, meeting new people, and finding a plethora of new opportunities at CSULB.

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read,
-Hunter

P.S. I know SOAR is supposed to help you find roommates and all that fun stuff. But I am also curious as to whether there are any tools you guys know about that will help find prospective roommates."

I'm currently applying for Fall of 2017 and was wondering if it possible to get in with only two letters of rec given my background. 

- Bachelor's in Mathematics from MIT (2016, 4.2/5.0 GPA)
- decent amount of relevant coursework during undergrad: Intro to Algorithms/Data Structures, Intermediate Algorithms, Intro Data Science, and Intro Machine Learning (all in Python)
- didn't do too well in these classes (B's, one C), but found the material very interesting
- never got close to professors so unable to ask for a letter of rec from school
- three internships all with the same tech company as an operations analyst, mainly wrote Python scripts to parse customer data and created visualization models

I currently have two letters of rec, one from an old mentor/teacher/employer who knows me very well personally and the second from one of my supervisors during my internship. I could potentially ask a secondary supervisor from the same company, but I didn't work extensively with him and I don't see a strong letter there. Would it be better for me to ask him anyways to have a third letter, or would it be fine for me proceed with just two?

I have around $7k in credit card debt from having to cash advance all of my cards to pay for tuition one semester.

I've transferred schools and now receive in-state tuition, and will be receiving a direct loan from the school for tuition in the fall. I've had an internship for a little over a year and have finally started saving a little bit of money.

Is it better for me to save this money for rent and tuition, or go ahead and try to pay off some of my CC debt in hopes of improving my credit score? My credit score is very low, as I couldn't afford payments for a few months, and one of my parents overdrew my personal checking account by $2k (no longer have any financial ties to this parent). I can't rent an apartment because of the credit check, so I think I will probably have to end up paying a few months rent up front.

My question is: is it better to pay these loans back now, or should I wait and make sure I have tuition and living in order? I found a debt management plan online with clearpoint, is my situation dire enough to warrant this? Will it improve my credit?"

I'm moving out on my own in a few months with a good friend and we are both very much interested in adopting a dog soon after. He has two small dogs of his own (most likely will not bring with him), but this will be my first. We will be moving into an apartment, and our original plan was to adopt a german shepherd puppy, but I am now aware that those are both breeds that are often restricted in apartments. We still intend to adopt a larger dog and have found a few potential apartments that allow it, but I'd like some suggestions for other medium-large apartment-friendly breeds to look into.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, although I've had some experience dog-sitting (maximum has been 6 days) and generally spending time around friends' dogs (sheltie, husky, pomeranian, chihuahuas, shihtzu...) including helping to teach basic commands. My roommate has two dogs, the oldest being around 6 years old I believe (adopted as a puppy), both of which have basic training.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am open to adopting a young dog (&lt;2 years) from a shelter/rescue, but my friend is most interested in adopting a puppy from a breeder, so that is our priority.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I've always been a huuuge dog lover ever since I was a child and have wanted a german shepherd or siberian husky ever since then (currently live at home and parents don't want a dog). With regards to my specific situation, a dog that could provide some family protection (a little weary around strangers, but no immediate aggression?) while still being apartment-friendly would be perfect. 

* In terms of physical appearances, I like medium to large breeds more so than smaller breeds. I like a lot of herding and working group breeds, and I've never been a huge fan of terriers, spaniels, poodles, chihuahuas, etc. although I'm sure I would love any dog I owned all the same, regardless of breed.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Specifically, I love german shepherds and siberian huskies as mentioned before. I've had a couple of friends/family that had them and I've absolutely fell in love with them. I know it differs from dog to dog, but between personal experience and the research I've done online, while they may not be the best breeds for me, they still seem to fit the criteria I am looking for - a good balance between being a family pet while remaining alert towards strangers and loyal to their owners. My friend is interested in saint bernards and bernese mountain dogs, although I think it's more of a physical liking, haha. EDIT: This is regarding our personal preferences on breeds and not at all taking into account our specific living situation.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Other than basic commands and other general training, we don't plan to have our dog work or show and won't need any extended training in that sense. We also don't intend to have it off-leash in any open environments (gated areas, dog parks, etc. is fine), but of course it would be best to be able to have them 'come' back regardless of a leash/gates/etc. Fancy tricks would be nice, but not necessary at all.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I will be a full time pharmacy school student and my friend has a full time job (3-4 days a week for 10+ hours), so while I am willing to put in the time into a new dog as well as regular exercise/training/etc., there will be some time constraints and would rather not have a dog that requires many hours of extremely intense exercise or anything like that. However, I am extremely willing to give my attention to the dog whenever I'm just at home relaxing - training, indoor play, whatever.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 2 hours max for any one session? 3 hours maximum daily of legitimate outside exercise, maybe? We will be moving to the Las Vegas area, and with the weather tending to be pretty hot maybe 80% of the year, that might interfere with the amount of continuous outside exercise we'd be able to provide. However, we are looking to find an apartment complex that offers an on-site dog park/exercise area. Balls, frisbees, maybe an obstacle course if we end up at a place that has one. My friend has also been into hiking lately and I'm sure he'd consider bringing the dog along sometimes.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* In home, as much as necessary, although I'd like to limit the amount of groomer visits.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large. Nothing over ~75 pounds.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I don't mind much. Barking I would like to keep to a minimum since we'll be living in an apartment complex and can't be too loud. Not a fan of slobber at all.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. I don't really plan to do that.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* In between would be perfect.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Probably leaning more towards eager-to-please, but it needs to also be able to play well on its own without needing my undivided attention at all times.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Initial barking and weariness at strangers entering my home is fine, but I would like for them to realize when someone is ""good,"" such as when I let them into the house, greet them, etc. I don't mind jumping if it's a smaller dog, but not by a bigger dog. Definitely no biting.

* I'd also like to be able to occasionally bring the dog out with me on errands or if I'm out eating at a restaurant with patio seating, so it would be nice if it was comfortable around people/kids/other dogs and be able to tell the difference between strangers entering our territory (apartment) vs. people in general (public), if possible.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* My friend may be bringing one of his current dogs with him (chihuahua mix) and if that's the case, the new dog must be able to get along with him. I'm also interested in having two dogs in the future, so I'd like a dog that gets along with other dogs.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Destruction of furniture. I know it kind of reflects off of the amount of exercise/attention/training the dog gets, I just would like to avoid any extra apartment fees, furniture replacement, etc. Also, no biting.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We will try to work our schedule around to make sure the dog isn't left at home alone too much, although we both don't know what our mixed schedule will be like yet (won't be getting a dog until we've settled). He has half the week off and will be able to spend time with the dog during those off days. I will have morning/day classes (3-6 hours?) on the weekdays and eventually intend to have an internship or part-time job as well.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Mentioned above. More or less equal involvement, although I think I might be the one spending more time with training.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two aquatic turtles (kept in tank at all times) and my friend may potentially be bringing his chihuahua mix. I'd like another dog down the road depending on my situation.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We are hoping to rent an apartment (~1200 sq. ft.) with no weight restriction or a less strict weight restriction (70-80 lbs). We will be making calls tomorrow to ask about the specific policies at the potential apartments, but most seem to have some sort of breed restriction. The ones that have their policy on the site list out the usual ""aggressive"" breeds... pit bulls, doberman, german shepherd, chow, malamutes, huskies, etc.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Las Vegas, NV (USA). I believe there's a law that prohibits breed discrimination.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 80-100F highs maybe 7 months of the year, down to the 50s during the winter. Only occasional rain and hardly any snow, if any.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I had an allergy test done by my doctor a while ago and tested positive for having a dog allergy (although I'm not sure if it's for slobber, dander, shedding...). However, I've spent a lot of time around different breeds, hours and hours at dog cafes where there are 20+ dogs running around at any point in time, and dog-sat (24/7) without any issue. I am fully aware that it depends on the breed, but I have never had any serious allergic reaction and am willing to put up with mild allergies if it means I can own a dog of my own. Nevertheless, I am completely aware that this is something that should still be considered.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* No other questions right now! Thank you to everyone in advance!"

I don't know what I should call it--  perhaps burnout? But basically, my mind isn't functioning like it used to, and it might ruin my life. 

I've been working in different chemistry labs since high school (starting with ochem prep assistant ---&gt; synthesis undergrad research that went nowhere but still experience ---&gt; internship in R&amp;D with a pretty big role ----&gt; my own quasi-project in an analytical chemistry subfield). I'm a good chemistry student (As and high Bs) and a pretty good everything else student, minus... physics. 

Physics is seriously sinking my GPA, to the point where I could lose my scholarship. I've never had to tackle a course like this before. I've never had trouble like this before. I passed the first class with a C, but I might legitimately fail this one. I've gone to tutors, office hours, you name it. I'm just not grasping it. It doesn't help that it takes me a long time to actually work out the problems (homework that takes most of the class maybe an hour takes me almost 4 hours at best), and our exams are less than an hour long (!). 

On top of that, I've been seriously struggling lately with some mental health issues. I developed pretty major depression last semester out of nowhere (although I've always dealt with anxiety and was familiar with mental health resources and therapy, but never have I ever needed it this much) and I started seeing a therapist once a week, on top of taking medication. But with all of my classes, plus research, plus dealing with a death in the family and some other minor health issues, I'm worn out. I'm even concerned that I'm not doing well in my other classes (analytical chem, diffeq) as I should because I just sort of freeze up sometimes. My mind is just exhausted. And I know, I sound like I'm making excuses, but I promise that I'm trying. I work. I study all weekend (if I'm not in the lab). Yet I'm still failing a class that freshmen thrive in and still spend any free time at all that I have sleeping or eating.

Possible solutions I've thought of: taking a break, going part time (if I can find financial aid to do that) and working part time, or just taking a break semester where I take easier classes. But if I lose my scholarship... talk about the most shameful thing that could ever happen to someone. All it would prove is that I never deserved to have it to begin with. And I'd be losing it by so little... a mere .02 at worst. And in that case... I don't know what I'd do. I don't usually think of suicide, but nobody has been able to give me an answer as to what I should do if I lose it. They just tell me not to lose it. But it's not that easy. I'm working so hard and it's not even paying off. Nothing is fulfilling anymore. I don't even like being in the lab as much as I used to because all I can think is ""what's the point, if I don't finish my degree I'll never work in a lab again"". 

Has anyone here graduated later than normal, lost a scholarship, anything? I don't want to feel like a lonely loser. I'm feeling so much intense self-hatred and I can't shake it. It's making me lose sight of what I love so much, which is chemistry. 

Also, if I might ask, are there jobs (even menial lab tech jobs) that hire people with an associates/associate level chemistry coursework? Especially if they have a lot of experience. Because my ideal situation would honestly be to take a break from school and work somewhere for a little while and come back, but I don't want to work 3 fast food jobs to get by or I'll never actually get a break. Thanks guys. "

**Coms Log of Bioengineering Department** 

Duuarn watched as the screen continued to compile the petabytes of data in front of him. The chemical compositions of every molecule in the nucleotide, fractions upon fractions.  Numbers in the billions of base pairs, numbers of an unadulterated strain. He revered those numbers. Duuarn reached for his medipen and slid the needle with ease under his wrist. He had been tampering his schedule times, claiming rest periods while stimming himself in secret. He couldn’t rest, how could he? Rest was for other people, people who didn’t have to worry about the fate of the universe at large, who clung to traditions for comfort. Schedules, protocols, request sheets, all of it was so tedious, how could they stand to uphold such frivolity when the salvation of the entire galaxy was being forced through a single Genome compiler??

Duuarns ground his toothplate, the stims twitching a tendon in his arm, a known side effect but he wasn’t worried, he had plenty of practise ignoring it. His team had only managed to analyse a quarter of the biopsy samples they had taken of the male. A single cell was all that was needed to extract the composition, but it was hours worth of processing time for each one. At this rate it would take [weeks] before they could properly fabricate an exact copy of the specimen. 

That was time he didn’t have.

Any number of things could go wrong,  The Raiders Isk was convinced existed could actually show up and attack, the specimens could die whilst in captivity, the Galactic Council could turn around and demand the specimens back. THAT was what Duuarn feared most, Essander was only a start up after all, barely 20 million employees, they had received the project on the basis they were the closest and the cheapest. The Galactic council, or any of the creator solidarity governments could demand access to the data he was working on, it was imperitive they finished the work as soon as possible before it was ripped from their hands. Larger Companies could buy them out, merge them into the larger entity and then drop them on some citizenry planetoid thinking that infinite credits would be enough for his silence and compliance.

He wouldn’t let the universe cheat him of his karmic work.

*He* was the one pouring himself into the work, *he* would be the one to be rewarded with his name forever pronounced in the Dynasty records.

Duuarn unclenched his jaw and sat on his desk stool. There was too much work to be done with so little equipment, they needed a larger facility. Uleesia was just too small, too far away from the resources it needed. When the engineers he requested from Head Quarters came and saw exactly the scope of what could be at stake, they would have no choice but to support his efforts. 
Maybe then he would be transferred, to Klona, Tarnend, *Clentesia*… 

The Humans may have been responsible for the copious phenotypes he was ogling, but creator species were just bureaucratic nightmares. The Universe was always changed when a new player entered the arena. Duuarn tapped his toothplate together. If this is what they did to their test subjects, what had they done to themselves?

“Bioengineering Department” The door chimed, Duuarn turned his head and frowned.

“Ceaan, where’s the specimen?”

The fellow Qzetillian was taken back, shocked that Duuarn was *still* in the lab.

“The living quarters…” The assistant answered flatly. 

“Why?-” Duuarn cut himself off and rose from his desk, he clenched his grey hands together in order to control the twitch which had now run rampant up his entire left arm. 

“The specimen has been confiscated by subject Jasmine for an undetermined amount of time”
Ceaan stood firm, but refused to move more than a foot away from the department door. 

“You know, I feel the word *‘Why’* isn't enough to express the exact amount of confusion your presence here conveys;” The department head made his way across the room, his tasteful lab coat billowed out with his strides “and repeating it in the multitude of questions I have is just going to insult both your intelligence and my integrity”

Ceaan narrowed his eyes towards his superior, extra stims made him extra obnoxious.

“I came here to submit the perception test results-”

“Because the *results* for a simple perceptions test far outweigh the specimens *where abouts* and *well being*.” Duuarn could barely contain the joy he derived from belittling his assistant, sarcasm on thick as he delivered the line “Ceaan, I’m *so* glad I hired someone of your forethought and judgement.”

“I felt it was the best course of action.” The assistant defended himself. “Subject Jasmine had no intention of hurting the thing-”

“But you had every *intention* of letting an unauthorised alien interfere with my work? What did you do? Just let her walk off with the specimen?!” Duuarn laughed.

“You weren’t there Duuarn, it was a tense situation, the human looked like she was about to spit her digestive acid on Nyk-”

“You *actually* just let her walk off with the specimen?...” Duuarn was dumbfounded.  “You’re supposed to be a willing and helpful assistant but not a complete *drone*!” Duuarn thrust his right arm behind him “Go and monitor the compliers analysis before I request your ‘nomes be culled from the company recruitment database” 

Ceaan gave a disagreeable toothplate snap, before following orders, standing in front of the compliers screen. Duaarn watched him, muttering a ‘tsk’ and storming over to his Coms terminal. 
How long was it going to take to clean up this mess?

**CMO Krydon**: CMO Krydon speaking-

**Dr Duuarn**: Chief, what happened to my specimen?!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CMO Krydon**: Oh, Duuarn, I was wondering how long it would be before you called, Ceean took his time getting back to your lab I see…

**Dr Duuarn**: As much I would love to discuss the incompetence of my staff, I'm here to discuss the incompetence of yours. Subject Jasmine and my specimens should never have crossed paths, how did you let this contamination happen?

**CMO Krydon**: Duuarn, your User specimens are not exactly willing patients, the male almost always needs a security escort and sedation which hampers the results. Your two females insist on pulling out their external translators and only growl refusals when asked why. The delays with their cooperation caused the test times to overlap.  Have them properly calibrated and maybe we’ll both be able to avoid these delays in the future.

**Dr Duuarn**: The translators calibrations are not the problem, they’ve never tried to remove them in the enclosure or the lab. Maybe they just don’t enjoy your lackluster procedural manner. 

**CMO Krydon**: Ah, there’s the sword tongue. Duuarn I’m not going to get into a snarl with you. I have other work to finish.

**Dr Duuarn**: Well I would be happily continuing my own work but now I have to Com around and figure out why the supposedly *professional* staff of this station allowed an *unauthorised, undocumented alien* to bypass all regulation and stride off with another specimen!!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CMO Krydon**: [snort] I’ll send you the footage Duuarn. Maybe you’ll figure it out and save us all the trouble of hearing you speak.

[*Link Terminated*]

Duuarn gave another ‘tsk’ and impatiently waited for the footage to arrive at his terminal. The file was less than 4 minutes long, his black eyes focused on the screen in front of him. First he hissed as he watched the intern Nyk restrain the specimen by the throat, lifting it off the ground. He’d have to be reprimanded for ignoring handling regulations but his eyes widened in shock as he reached the end of the video. The ‘Human’ demonstrated both Zenthi telepathy and Arvas frequency manipulation in simultaneity. He’d only seen such a combination of abilities in the GC’s Millitary gene archives and even then they were restricted to GCR special forces regiments. They were only to be used if the Rajava launched another attack on civilized space. Duuarn brought his left hand up to his chin and deliberated. So *that* is what the humans did to themselves...

***[One Message Received From Behavioral Studies]***


Duuarn sighed, his nimble fingers hovered over the acceptance key, he couldn’t answer Kyda’s message now, as much as he wanted to. He had to get his specimen back, Duuarn begrudgingly made the link to Security.

---

**CPT Rynard**: Security, Rynard speaking [yawn]

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, I need you to go the living quarters and retrieve my specimen from Subject Jasmine. (&lt;...&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: Huh?

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard for the sake of the universe would you just listen to-

**CPT Rynard**: Look, Dr Duuarn I know you like to think your job is more important than mine-

**Dr Duuarn**: -it *is*-

**CPT Rynard**: -But you gotta understand that you have to call Isk and not my direct line, I'm off duty and you just woke me from my sleep cycle, I *like* my 4 hours of peace.

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, Subject Jasmine has confiscated my specimen, she threatened the staff and has both Zenthi telepathy and ‘Royal’ frequency manipulation. She’s a danger to *everyone* on the station and I demand you get off your overpaid tail and retrieve it from her unharmed!(&lt;...&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: Whoa there… That's a lot of accusations, even for you.

**Dr Duuarn**: I'll send you the footage, I expect immediate compliance and an apology with my order!

Duuarn flitted over the short file and sent it to the witless security guards dataslate. Ryanrds Com link pinged, the corner of Duuarns mouth curved up, maybe Ryanrd had listened to reason.

**Dr Duuarn**: Bioengineering Dr Duuarn speaking-

**CPT Rynard**: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard, once again you have proven yourself less useful than a clogged bidet, this is serious- 

**CPT Rynard**: Oh ha ha, the universe weeps!! I forget how sheltered you *bulge brains* are!

**Dr Duuarn**: *Bulge brains*??!!(*&lt;insulted, infuriated&gt;*)

**CPT Rynard**: Yeah! That was the funniest thing I've seen since I got here! and that’s including when that one tentacle thing got stuck in the atmo’ vent! They all looked like they’re about to stiff it!! Ha ha ha.

**Dr Duuarn**: Rynard! How can you possibly see this as a joke?!

**CPT Rynard**: ‘Cause! It’s just like new recruits at basic hearing a Princess for the first time! They think they're so tough then Blam! Funny then and hilarious now! 

**Dr Duuarn**: There’s confrontation and then there’s overwhelming frequency aggression! You know, the thing we hired you to protect us from?!(&lt;Disbelief&gt;)

**CPT Rynard**: That was not Frequency aggression, well, maybe a little, but you science types have no idea! I’m actually kinda shocked you all have so little resolve! Might have to get you all to go through some aggression resistance training heh heh heh.

**Dr Duuarn**: We don’t have it because we don’t need it! What good is resistance to a researcher?! That’s what we hired you for, now go and do your *one job Rynard.*

**CPT Rynard**: Well, *I’m off duty*. Contact Isk if you want a guard, I’m going back to sleep! Heh Arc and Suk are going to love this-

*[Link Terminated]*

A fury drove the tremor in Duuarns arm up his neck and caused his head to shake unsettlingly. He was surrounded by incompetence and indifference. He steeled himself, he would actually have to send a request to the operations manager to get his captured specimen back. The Universe had better have a substantial Karmic reward for the amount of fecal matter it was dumping on him.

---

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Calm&gt;*) Operations Manager Isk Speaking.

**Dr Duuarn**: Isk, this is Dr Duuarn, i would like to make a formal request for security action.(&lt;...&gt;)

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug, Satisfied&gt;*) Nice to see you falling in line Duuarn, Now what was your request?

**Dr Duuarn**: I want a member of our overpaid and underworked security team to retrieve my specimen from the Subject Jasmine *Immediately*…(&lt;...&gt;)

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug&gt;*) Formal request has been Submitted... and Denied. Please reschedule your research quarters accordingly.

**Dr Duuarn**: What?!(*&lt;Infuriated&gt;*) 

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Smug&gt;*) Dr Xant has already informed the Director of the incident and I have received orders that nothing is to be done until the Director has met with the Subject Jasmine herself to negotiate an amicable solution. Answering aggression with aggression only leads to escalation Duuarn...


**Dr Duuarn**: The one time i follow procedure and you're denying me?! Need I remind you *Isk* that my specimen is pregnant? Her vitals and condition must be constantly monitored-

**OP Dr Isk**:(*&lt;Annoyed&gt;*) and they *are* being monitored. Subject Jasmine’s room has a camera installed and Krydon’s office hasn’t reported any vital distress signals from any of the offending parties health detectors… (&lt;Suspicious&gt;) Speaking of constantly monitored, this quarter is supposed to be your rest cycle, what are you doing in the Bioengineering department?

**Dr Duuarn**: I Instructed Ceaan to report to me immediately if there ever was a disruption with my research, even during rest cycles. This work will change the very dynamic of the Galactic Council Space and must have the highest of priorities, I thought someone of your *integrity* would understand that.

**OP Dr Isk**:(&lt;Confident&gt;) Oh I *understand* all too well Duuarn. Your dedication to your work is admirable, but your lack of professionalism is holding you back. Your research can wait half a [day] while we negotiate with the Human. I’ll send you the audio when the Director has finished, This Project isn’t just about *you*.

**Dr Duuarn**: I know it isn’t about *me*! It’s about the Universe… It’s about the *company*! If we can get these Pheono-types pattened before the Human Creators start claiming distribution rights we could be on the verge of restoring Qzetillian *lineage compatibility*. Esaander would be pronounced as a *Progenitor Company*!

**OP Dr Isk**:(&lt;Frustrated&gt;) Once again Duuarn you fail to see the herd from the prey, we need to keep the Humans who created your little specimens appeased. If letting half a [day] of research go wasted means that in the future; we’ll have access to their entire genetic library, then that’s a half a [day] I can overlook. You have two other specimens Duuarn, finish with them before your requested Bioengineers arrive on on station.

The tremor in Duuarns body finally ceased. He sat defeated in front of his Coms station. No one in this entire facility had any idea what they were doing. The Qzetillians would be indebted to yet another race if they waited for the Humans approval of the genetic material. No, they had all the information they needed right here, to fix the deterioration, why were they insisting on waiting on the whim of an unknown? Did the Creator Subject even have any understanding of the situation at all?! How long would it take to inform her? Would she even say yes?...

***[One Message From Behavioral Studies]***

The Coms terminal reminded him. Duuarn sighed, his nimble fingers allowing the message to play.

---

**Dr Jess**: Marsen. I know you're going to be very busy arguing to get your specimens back to take my advice now, so I’ll just leave a message for you to get back to me, I might have a way to make you the lead of the User and Creator projects. I'll be awaiting your transmission.

---

Duuarns lips curved into a smile. It was always nice to hear Kyda’s voice, especially when she sounded like she had a plan underway. 

“Ceaan, I’m going to my quarters” He announced unceremoniously, a bounce in his step as he walked. The last time Kyda had spoken a plan to him so breathlessly they had succeeded and accepted the positions as Department Heads together. He couldn’t wait to hear what she had come up with this time.

After my first watch many years ago, I decided I didn't for seasons 5 &amp; 6 so I always skipped them. But this time around when I finished S4 I couldn't really remember why I was avoiding S5 so I decided to get into it.

4 episodes in I remember why I've been avoiding it. It's like watching a slow trainwreck (for the characters that is) where nothing goes right. Everyone is fighting everyone and the dialog isn't particularly sophisticated (""I moved the meeting up because I didn't want you here.""). It's just hard to watch all your favorite characters slowly drive themselves into a deep hole.

It feels a lot like ""other TV"". This isn't what made the West Wing great. The show is at its best when it focused on politics and let the inter-personal stuff be a subtle undercurrent that bubbled up once every 4-5 episodes. In season 5 it feels like the whole thing is interpersonal drama. Abby hates Jed, Josh is getting into trouble because of the thing with Sen Carrick, Will is getting shade from Toby, Abby hates Leo, Amy is getting unfairly criticized by the President, Josh dislikes his new intern.

Don't get me wrong, it's still far better TV than most but the ""special charm"" is gone.

However, I come from a Computer Science background. From my knowledge, most STEM field resumes tend to prefer simple designs (serif font, no colors or graphics). [My resume](http://i.imgur.com/7OV1tCO.png), would style be considered too plain in the architecture world?


Do architecture employers prefer something a bit more fancy due to the field having more focus on aesthetics and design? Examples would be great so I can help out my friend.

61x9ip,3,2017-03-28,Advice requested: 25 y/o journalist considering career change to web design/development,paulo0292,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/61x9ip/advice_requested_25_yo_journalist_considering/,"Hi web_design redditers!

*TLDR: I'm 25 y/o working in journalism, and considering a career change to web design / front end development. What are my options? What is realistic? I'm considering a coding bootcamp – is that crazy?*

I'm hoping to pick y'all's minds about a career change I'm considering and how I might be able to go about executing it.

In short, I’m 25 years old and have been a journalist at the national and international level for about 7 years. I started when I was 18 as an intern at a big international company’s DC office, which quickly led to full-time freelance work and – later – a staff position.  I did this while completing a bachelor’s degree – eventually in government and politics, with a year-long detour in computer science, which I ultimately dropped because I couldn’t commit the time needed to it and to work.

I came to journalism by accident.  I was looking for a four-week internship that I needed to get my high school diploma, and no tech companies would take a high schooler – certainly not for that short of a time period.  The news company in question did, and I sort of never left.

However, over the past several years, I find my mind repeatedly being drawn back to web development.  For various reasons (work-life balance, geographic freedom, creative freedom, ability to speak my mind more freely, be more politically active in my private life, and more), I believe it would be more fulfilling than journalism.  At 25, I find myself burning out as a reporter and interested in how I could switch to web development.

I don’t take this decision lightly. I have been very fortunate in journalism, and do not take that for granted.  But I’m really desiring something different.

Lately, I have been looking into coding bootcamps – like General Assembly, NY Design and Code Academy, Galvanize, etc.  **I’m wondering how these bootcamps are seen within industry? I recognize that 3 months will hardly give you the knowledge of a four-year CS degree, but do these bootcamps actually prepare you for well-paying jobs where you can learn on-the-job?  Are ‘graduates’ of bootcamps stigmatized within industry? If so, what options would have in terms of traditional university education?**

From my time as a CS student in college, I have a general understanding of CS concepts, OOP, etc.  But could not truthfully claim to have programming knowledge.

I have about $20k or a little less in savings, and little to no family support.  Would such a career switch be possible (with financing of course)?

I recognize some of these questions are quite open-ended.  But I wanted to pick the brains of people actually working as designers/developers.  I’d love some constructive thoughts!

Best,
P"

The problem now is that I don't have an internship lined up for the summer. 

As an international student, it's recommended that I apply for jobs during my last year at college so I have offers before I graduate. I'll be applying for full time jobs in the Fall.

My plan right now is to spend the summer working on-campus as a web developer and also working on Leetcode problems. I know an internship would have been better but that's not an option for me at this point. 

I'm just looking for some advice on how I can make my resume stand out without having an internship. 

I'm also just looking for general guidance and tips on how to go from here. I'm really worried about not being able to secure a job before graduating.

Some additional details: I'm on the East coast and will be applying for jobs in Seattle, Boston, and New York. I'm a CompSci major with a decent GPA and some average side projects (a sentiment analysis tool, and an agent for the Google Home Assistant)

Haven't really had a CS internship before, so I'm scrambling trying to find something for this summer. I'd like to find something close to the area I'd like to get into, but I'm feeling a bit lost and confused in thinking about what exactly it is that I'd like to do


I'd love to take my CS major and apply it to the medical field somehow. I think doing something like helping improve medical technologies or improve treatment methods would be awesome and super fulfilling. The problem is that I get so lost when I start trying to look into this stuff. I've read about Health IT, Health Informatics, Computer Information and Research Science, and so on, but it's all so confusing and I don't really know where to start. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I want to do so I can (hopefully) find a summer internship closely related to that topic/area, I'm just having a lot of trouble narrowing everything down. I should mention that one potential issue is that I have pretty much no background in biology/chemistry/etc- I only realized that combining CS with something in the medical field could be a sweet combo fairly recently, and I hadn't taken much of anything in the life sciences. Only have 1 semester of college left, so it's a bit late to get into that as well


Apologies if I'm not doing a great job at explaining this stuff, every time I get into it there's just so many different fields with technical jargon and so many different options, hard to tell what's a job for a CS major vs. a biology major, and I just end up feeling more lost than when I started.

61xty9,58,2017-03-28,"My opinion on Halo 5 and a new ranked playlist ""Team HCS""",Clutchism3,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/61xty9/my_opinion_on_halo_5_and_a_new_ranked_playlist/,"For Context: We have NEVER had radar in competitive Halo settings until Halo 5. Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo Reach, Halo 4, Halo 2 Anv all had no radar in every variation of the competitive settings. Radar does not belong in competitive Halo settings.  
Therefore:  
  
  
**Step 1: Take out radar.**  
  
  
Removing radar completely causes a few gameplay problems. These are not a result of removing radar, because removing radar has too many positive gameplay alterations. We look deeper. What are the problems? The gameplay is too hectic, and seemingly random. What causes this? The increased mobility. Of the increased mobility what allows you to move across the map at increasingly faster speeds but has no innate benefit? Sprint.  
  
  
**Step 2: Take out sprint.**  
  
  
Now getting around the map takes too long. Gameplay has slowed down. The maps are too large. Setups are near impossible to break. How do we fix this? Increase move speed, but this time lets increase the base movespeed instead of adding sprint. This will increase gameplay speed at a rate that of which sprint could never do. By increasing the base movespeed, you allow for players to shoot while moving. You also allow players to strafe and cause enemies to aim a lot better to actually hit their shots. All of this is beneficial to gameplay.  
  
  
**Step 3: Increase base movespeed.**  
  
  
Next we determine that players are still able to pounce on bases and know where the other players are even without radar. We determine the cause for this is communication and spawn predicting. This is good. This takes teamwork and game knowledge and allows players to use situations to their advantage to press a lead against the other team. Then an intern pipes up and informs me that grenade hitmarkers are just as bad if not worse than radar. He tells me that giving free information to the players is generally a bad idea. The player should have to work to earn that information. Makes sense.  
  
  
**Step 4: Remove grenade hitmarkers.**  
  
  
So far were happy with the progress. Players are starting to play the game again and talk is picking up about the next HCS season. Players are starting to search matchmaking in the new Team HCS playlist and we couldn't be more pleased over here at 343i. We take a day to pat ourselves on the back. In the morning we decide to contact a few of the pro players and see if there are any other changes that could be made to further improve the game. At 4:45 PM Aaron ""Ace"" Elam finally wakes up to a missed call from our office. He calls back as were about to head out for the day, but decide to put in a little bit of overtime for our players. Aaron tells us about how automatic weapons, splinter grenades, and rifles on truth keep him up at night. We decide to call a couple other players to verify his statements. The majority of players have the same issues. We honestly had no idea! Evidently there's some sort of competitive community that exists on some beyond website or whatever that has been talking about this for a few years, but it had never reached us! I decided that enough was enough. They all had compelling arguments, so I got to work right away. I decided that removing autos just from the starting weapons would be too much. We should leave some on the ground as pickups. Maybe not too different than that of a plasma pistol. One per map should be fine.  
  
  
**Step 5: Remove automatics from starting weapons. Add an Assault Rifle to the bottom area of most maps. Remove Brute Plasma Rifles and Storm Rifles. Remove Splinter grenades. Remove Rifles from Truth or change their positioning.**  
  
Satisfied with my work for the week I decide to watch a few online scrims to see what players are thinking of the updates. All was well."
61yb7c,2,2017-03-28,Any advice?,ToCuCh,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/61yb7c/any_advice/,"Sorry for this super long post..  
  
So here's my story. I came out of high school with a 2.7 cumulative gpa and never took my life seriously. However, when I got to college I completely changed. I started to enjoy learning and I took my academics seriously. I always wanted to be a doctor but I was never sure if I was good enough. So I decided I'll pursue a career in the medical career, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet.  
  
so I majored in nursing my freshmen year and I got a 3.9 so I thought maybe I should purse to become a PA since I did pretty well in school ( I'm not trying to shit on nurses. I respect them dearly but this path was just not for me). Then every semester after my freshmen year I started to get 4.0's and I thought maybe I have a chance of getting into med school.   
  
**Here is where I am so far:**So I spent my first three years of college focusing purely on academics. I'm currently a 2nd semester junior with cGPA of 3.98 and sGPA of 4.0. However, I just started getting serious about pursuing med school and I just started to strengthen my resume. I became a secretary of a health science club for minorities to increase minority matriculation in the medical field. I am also a part of a journal clubI where the head of the department meets with like 5 other students to read and discuss research articles. I started to shadow doctors and research( our school provides a program when we can shadow doctors while doing research at same time for credit). I also started to do volunteering (a stem program at my school where we try to get high school/middle school excited about science).  
  
**Here is what I plan to do:**I can get an extremely well written LoR from the head of the science/biology department who is also a teacher at the med school I wish to attend. I am also super close to 90% of all the professors in the science department so I can probably get a well written LoR from one of them as well. Also the head of the department said he will be able to connect me with research opportunities for next semester/ summer. During the summer I plan to study for the MCATS(I'm taking it next summer) and possibly do research or try to do internships. Also I'm planning to do a ""bridge program"" where I will be mentored by a med student from the med school I wish to attend and also with this program i will get about 100+ volunteer hours at the hospital because that's a requirement. I will also be attending a conference at Yale with my club this semester.

Here's a summary of my progress.  
cGPA/sGPA:3.98/4.0  
Major: genetics/developmental biology.  
Volunteer hours @ a hospital: currently 0 but will have 100+ hours after next year because of the bridge program.  
Volunteer hours outside of hospital: 4 hours currently but I will do ALOT more next year.  
LoR: 2 well written LoR from a science teach and the other from the head of the department who is also a teacher at the med school.  
Clubs: secretary of a club for minorities to increase minority matriculation in the medical field. I will be going to a conference in Yale with them this semester to present. In a journal club where I meet with the head of the department, read a discuss research articles.  
Research: 32 hours atm but will have a lot more over summer and next year. (With a minimum of 96 hours after next year).  
Shadowing: 32 hours shadowing ER doctors(With a minimum of 96 hours after next year).(I also plan to be an ER physician because after shadowing the doctors, I fell in love with the ER). 
MCATS: I will start studying this summer and take it next summer.  
  
**My question is:**1. Will it hurt my chances of getting in to a med school since I started to build all my extra curricular/ non-grade related aspects of my resume so late?  
  
2.I'm not in the honors college and probably will not do a poster presentation for research... Will this significantly hurt my chances as well?  
  
3. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do next?"

I've an interview tomorrow and I don't know what I'm going to say when they'll ask for my salary.

I'm a recent graduate (BA Advertising) and the job position is Web &amp; Database Support Executive. I've almost a year of experience thanks to 3 previous internships (did when I was still studying).

I think I'm going to ask not less than £30k, but I'm really scared that they might reject me if I say such amount. It's not even that much money, to be honest: after taxes it's like £1900 per month.

The monthly rent for my apartment is £1100pm, so if I ask less than £30k it'd be difficult to live with less money (my parents are currently supporting me, but I don't want that to happen anymore).

What should I do? Is it normal for a recent graduate in London to ask for that kind of money right away?

Thank you!"

61z7ui,19,2017-03-28,DD - Northern Dynasty Minerals (~5 month play),CiderDad,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/61z7ui/dd_northern_dynasty_minerals_5_month_play/,"Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSEMKT: NAK) are a mining company which are the sole owners of the “Pebble Mine” in Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the largest untapped mineral deposits in the world. ([Link to the resources estimates](http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/i/pdf/ndm/NDM_MRES.htm)). Since 2011, $NAK has dropped from $21.75 to a low of 20 cents in Jan 2016. Right now, it’s trading at $1.46 having just plummeted down from $3.44 in recent weeks. Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on with this company, and why I think it’s a pretty interesting YOLO opportunity if you’re a maniac like me.

In the years leading up to 2011, NAK received heavy investment from numerous mining corporations to collaborate with surveying and preparing feasibility studies for the project. The problem is, the project is extremely controversial on the environmental side. That combined with the capital required to get it off the ground, NAK lost pretty much all of its partners. Mitsubishi Corporation sold its 9.1% stake in 2011 and it all pretty much went downhill from there.

Anglo-American struck a deal with NAK in 2007, agreeing to a 50% stake in the Pebble Project with NAK in exchange for funding and co-operation. They went on to spend around $600m on the project, before walking away from the deal, returning their 50% stake back to NAK in Dec 2013, also having to pay a fine of something like $300m for walking away from the deal. That’s how toxic this project is….

At least, that’s how it is at face value. When you look at the statement Angle-American made for walking away from this deal, it wasn’t “There is no money to be made here, we’re cutting our losses”, it was more along the lines of “Despite our belief that Pebble is a deposit of rare magnitude and quality, we have taken the decision to withdraw, following a thorough assessment of Anglo American's extensive pipeline of long-dated project options”. That’s the exact quote actually. It continues on as: “Our focus has been to prioritise capital to projects with the highest value and lowest risks within our portfolio and reduce the capital required to sustain such projects during the pre-approval phases of development”

So in summary, they walked away from the deal as it became too risky and required too much additional cash to keep afloat. The amount of money required, combined with the fact that the EPA may not even allow the project due to the potential impacts to Bristol Bay (something to do with 30-40 million Salmon or some shit), they couldn’t realistically be a part of the project.

So poor old NAK, with fuck all money in the bank and 100% ownership of one of the biggest deposits of buried money in the world, sank to 20 cents.
But things are different now. Donald Trump wrote an executive order for the go ahead of Keystone XL, which is considered to be only slightly more controversial that the Pebble Project. The EPA is now run by someone who doesn’t believe in climate change. This is why NAK went from 35 cents to $3.45 in about 3 months.

Now here’s where it gets juicey and where I think the real opportunity is here. NAK just dropped about ~60% after some intern at a fund decided to write a nasty report about them and brag about how they’re short. Here’s their site and their report for those interested: [Link](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/blog/?cat=short). And then NAK wrote a nice little rebuttal here: [Link](http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/NewsReleases.asp?ReportID=778879). The gist of it is the short seller made up some shit about why Anglo-American left and speculated that all the feasibility studies came back negative and were covered up. NAK attempt to refute it and explain that a deal with the EPA is expected in the first half of 2017.

Basically, what the play boils down to is whether the EPA approve of the Pebble Project or not. What I like about this play is that some random no-name fund have shorted the shit out of the stock and made it nice a cheap. I think this gives me a good price to get in. The bottom line is, if they get EPA approval this thing could shoot up top $5-$8, maybe even more. If they don’t its going back down to 20 cents.

My play will most likely be Aug17 4 Calls. This is a pretty much death or glory scenario so yeah…have fun. 

Another angle to approach this from is to long Salmon and Cream Cheese futures if the deal goes through.

TL;DR EPA expected to rule on whether NAK can build a mine and kill Salmon. Long Salmon and NAK.

Edit: I guess I should've done a search on WSB for this ticker, seems like there is a bit of NAK PTSD out there. I'll be buying my calls anyway for the hell of it so whatevs"

61zejk,1,2017-03-28,Me [25M] flirting with co-worker [22F]. Genuinely interested or friend-zoned?,wvmrtn,Friendzone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/61zejk/me_25m_flirting_with_coworker_22f_genuinely/,"Some backstory of me: I'm some Swiss engineer working in some research center, recently graduated last year. I've just got out of a 8-9 months relationship a month ago with a Czech girl who lived in Prague. We were doing the LDR thing and I found out she was cheating on me for two months when we were on holiday in New York for Valentine's.

Anyhow when I came back from NY, I was pretty f*cked up and depressed and impulsively booked a flight to Madrid in three weeks time (meaning last weekend). I had some friends I wanted to see and I had 2 unused coupons for some plane company that I had purchased to visit my now-ex in Prague. I had the attention of going alone until one of my Spanish friends found that weird, so I asked pretty much all my friends and co-workers in Switzerland but no-one could come with me last-minute.

Now here is where things get interesting. This new intern [22F] had just started working the day I came back from NY. The first week we just talked, got to know each other a little but nothing too fancy (mainly because of my depression). Two weeks in though, when I was looking for someone to come with me to Madrid, I sent her a text (yes I already had her number) asking if she wanted to fly to Madrid with me. The answer was a solid yes but I could sense she was hesitant, mainly because we barely knew each other. I offered her the second coupon but we split all the bills (Airbnb and all).

Some backstory of her: she just go out of a 5-year relationship (the day she started working as well). The guy wants to get back with her but her not at all. They're sill seeing each other from time to time but it's mostly him wanting to win her back. On top of that, she was 6 months in Brazil beforehand, where she had a LDR with him at first until doing a pause and finally going out with some Brazilian guy for a few months and unpausing her previous relationship after coming back home. The Brazilian guy and her are still in contact but she told me it won't go anywhere further (mainly because of the distance).

Anyway, fast-forward to our trip to Madrid. During our trip we got to talk about almost everything: family, friends, life stories, previous relationships you name it. And it sometimes went in full detail. We really got to know each other in such a short time, it was so easy to talk to one another, and we were not scared of small physical contact (hugs, a hand on the thigh etc...). Needless to say, I was starting to fall for her, hard. So hard I went for the kiss when we were coming back from drinking one night and taking the metro back to our Airbnb. She kind of refused the kiss and said, I quote: ""I want to stay faithful"". I'm the kind of guy that gives zero f*cks, so I apologized for my move and we continued having a good time together in Madrid. Things were not at all awkward.

Back home/at work now, we are still speaking to each other, a lot. We send snaps, emails at work about stupid and non-work-related things. I try to stay professional when seeing her in person but flirt like a hog by message. I suggested going on a road trip next month just her and me for a weekend, turned out to be a big positive yes.

Now, I'm pretty sure she's kind of interested in me but considering what happened in Madrid and her backstory I'm starting to consider a whole new-level of friend zone. Am I right to think about this or am I being paranoid? The ""I want to stay faithful"" move may have been a polite excuse or is actually true: she was very faithful to her 5-year ""ex"" when she was in Brazil because that Brazilian guy was trying for months before getting anything. And she may still feel attached in some way to both guys. Then I don't know if she is staying faithful to her 5 year-guy or the Brazilian dude, I'm confused. Anyway, she clearly knows I like her. I have given enough signals in Madrid and she doesn't seem to be backing off. Help?

TL;DR; : Known this co-worker for a month only, we travelled to Madrid together. We both have complicated pasts but we get along almost perfectly. Is she genuinely interested or am I being thrown in a new-level of friend zone ?

I've had three IT Internships, one of which was specifically data analytics with one of the Big Four. 

I would like to pursue a career as a data scientist, but I'm not qualified/knowledgeable enough for the role yet. I am looking to move to NYC after graduation and pursue a career there, eventually moving into data science. I'm deciding between these two options.

1. Pursue a data science internship over the summer, with the hope of getting my feet wet in data science and getting a full-time role in the fall as an entry-level data scientist.

2. Pursue a data analyst full-time role, learn data science on my own, then transition to data scientist after a couple years. 

What is the best route to get into data science, not coming from a strong data science background? "

Amintesc ca vorbim de spitale printre care Malaxa, Sfanta Maria, Obregia.

Proiectul USR de audit independent, functional si planificare integrata in baza a 20 de indicatori specifici a celor 19 spitale bucurestene, a primit acum 2 ore aviz negativ de la PSD in Comisia de Sanatate a Consiliului General, cu urmatoarele motivatii din timpul dezbaterilor:

- directorul ASSMB, Razvan Nitu: 

1. temerea mea personala este ca auditorul independent contractat prin licitatie, indiferent de clauzele de confidentialitate ale contractelor, va folosi informatiile primite din spitale, statistici etc, secrete, ca instrument de marketing catre competitori; 

2. exista deja un supracontrol la aceste spitale. Ele primesc controale de la Corpul de control al Primului Ministru, Corpul de Control al Primarului General, Auditul intern al PMB, Curtea de Conturi. Oamenii sunt deja controlati de peste tot, deja nu mai semneaza pe nimic.

- consilier general Daniela Raiciu, PSD: daca proiectul va fi semnat si de cativa profesori universitari, precum dr. Irinel Popescu, eu il voi lua in considerare. 

- consilier general Anca Florea, PSD: “distrusi ca voi m-au facut sa plec din medicina”.

Concluzia consilierilor PSD a fost ca in prezent totul merge struna in acele spitale, avem toate informatiile despre ce se intampla acolo, avem toate studiile comparate si cetatenilor nu le este folositor un plan integrat de imbunatatire a activitatii acestor spitale. 

Inca o data, printre aceste spitale vorbim de Malaxa, Obregia si Sf. Maria, unde investigatii jurnalistice si nu Corpul de Control al Primarului sau Curtea de Conturi au descoperit cum, cu banii spitalului platiti din taxele pe salariile noastre, managerul Secureanu isi construia casa, isi plimba partenera de viata ca sa ridice premii in numele Gabrielei Firea etc etc.

In schimb, a primit aviz favorabil infiintarea Companiei Municipale Medicale Bucuresti S.A., care va prelua mare parte din bugetul Administratiei celor 19 spitale (aproximativ 100 milioane euro/an), ai carei angajati nu vor mai fi fi angajati prin concurs, fiindca nu mai sunt functionari publici, nu vor mai raspunde pentru fapte de coruptie pe legea penala si care companie va avea declaratii de avere afisate publicului asa cum au si societatile pe actiuni ale lui Pandele de Voluntari (Va invit sa deschideti linkul de la declaratia de avere, de pe site-ul SC Apavol SA, a Primariei Voluntari, unde in loc de declaratie de avere director avem o poza graitoare: http://www.apavol.ro/informatii-publice/decralatii-avere).

I am 60 days from the beginning of the internship and I've started ""[field] boot camp"", checking out several books from the library, doubling down on programming practice, and attempting to finish strong in my current classes while also working 40 hours a week at my job. 

But I'm honestly scared sh*tless that I'll mess everything up and I'll be blacklisted from the field. My PI is a Big Deal, and she is friends with the head of [field] department at the school I'm applying for transfer. I applied for a bunch of internships mostly for the experience and I didn't think I would actually get a spot in one.

The post was downvoted hard, and it encouraged me to do my own research on the program. According to [APC](http://www.airlinepilotcentral.com/airlines/legacy/united_airlines)

&gt; United has implemented a Career Path Program (CPP) with three companies: CommutAir, ExpressJet's E-145 and Airline Training Center of Arizona (ATCA). 

The ATCA program makes no mention of the regional airlines as a pathway, and when interviewing for ATCA you undergo the same process that current CPP pilots at the regionals go through (United inteview process, the Hogan exam, etc.) According to [this forum post](https://www.airlinepilotforums.com/united/96405-lufthansa-united.html) this program will be (essentially) mirroring the unpopular Cape Air - JetBlue program. [This post](https://www.airlinepilot.life/t/united-airlines-career-path-program/2320/4) also seems to confirm that UAL will be hiring people without 121 experience in the future. I also spoke with a friend who was an intern at UAL last year and he confirmed that the ATCA CPP is exceptionally competitive and that it remains *possible* for people accepted into this program to bypass the regionals.

Important to note is that this isn't a flow, or a guaranteed job. [The ExpressJet page claims United has committed to hiring 1 in 4 pilots from the CPP when these pilots become eligible.](http://www.expressjet.com/careers/pilots/pathway-programs/)

Can anyone refute this with hard fact? The evidence I have is pointing towards a regional bypass. This seems to be in line with the current regional mindset of promoting cadet CFIs over people with more 'real-world' experience with seniority, etc."

Experience: 4 years total programming experience, 1 ½ years as full time software developer. 

- 3 month internship at web development agency (LAMP stack)

- 3 months of my own projects (continued LAMP stack)

- 1 ½  years working full time for a recruiting company on their internal software. Following a lot of best practices here, have learned a lot, and played a big role in our launch of new resume/candidate tracking software as they had outgrown their legacy system. Mix of PHP and Java. Doing mostly backend work as that is my strength. 

Recommendations: 3. 2 current supervisors, 1 formal supervisor. May reach out to one of my professors if needed.

Comments: Realized late in college career that CS was what I wanted to do, but was too late to switch majors so I stuck out Accounting. I stacked up and took about 4 more classes than I needed to for the minor, including: Software Engineering, Web Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

I am enjoying what I do but feel my time was cut a bit short on what I could learn while I was in school. Don’t want to stagnate and would love a chance to learn more and explore my interests further while also getting the official Master’s designation as a step up from the Minor. Just wondering what my chances are realistically since you guys seem to have a good idea of what it takes. I would love to get in for Fall but also realize that window is getting tight with a month left.

However since Im going to be applying to places in Toronto as thats where all the big companies are, I was wondering how to stand out against people who are attending more prestigious schools. I know everyone here says to upload some projects to Git, and I'm in the process of brainstorming some projects to tackle that will showcase what I can do, without looking too sketchy.

What other things would you suggest for someone that wants to get an internship in a company like IBM, AMD or the like

My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and she's a great girl - she's pretty, smart, sweet, can cook, and she has a lot in common with me i.e. we don't enjoy going out much or being in big groups, we both like science and comedy movies, and we both enjoy working out among other things. And her best quality is that she's extremely loyal and trustworthy.

The problem is we have differing political views. She's ultra left and I'm ultra right (not republican - more libertarian). We constantly fued over a number of issues and it's since taken a toll on me. I feel like I might be losing my attraction for her... and despite maintaining a good sex life with her,  I'm also starting to crave other girls sexually... 

I don't know what to do. I love her and I'm afraid if I decide to let her go that I may never find someone else like her (the grass may not be greener on the otherside), but at the same time, I can't shake these feeling I have about our differences. After we argue, I feel extremely empty and literally lose all attraction I have for her for a period of time after the argument. And when I get over the argument, I seem to come back with less love for her than I had before... 

We currently do not live together (she lives an hr away and I see her every weekend) but she's wanted to move in with me for some time... she's currently staying with me this week, however, because she is doing something in town for her internship. We've already had a spat and I'm feeling horribly empty right now...

I'm at a loss with what I should do. Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
- Keith

621ebr,44,2017-03-28,Why it pays to be nice to the Children (Part 1,McCainOffensive,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/621ebr/why_it_pays_to_be_nice_to_the_children_part_1/,"Okay, I need to lay down some ground rules. Recent events notwithstanding, I am legally bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement from hell. I cannot tell you where this happened, I will be circumspect about when it happened, and I cannot go into detail about the science behind what I witnessed working as an intern.

So why am I even writing something that could violate an agreement that will let a certain company own me, descendants, and our souls? Like I said, recent events have changed a few things. Just knowing the Children are still out there somewhere fills me with an indescribable dread because I know, better than anyone still alive, what they are capable of. 

This happened a long time ago, I was in high school then and I’m well out of college now. It started out innocuously, just a summer internship. They started putting up fliers about a month before school was out, advertising that summer intern positions would soon become available at a new research lab and that we should apply now. It would even count as a semester of science credit on top of paying well (to the tune of $10 an hour with a promised end of summer bonus if we stuck with it).

A lot of people applied, but only a handful of people were all called in for individual interviews with the man in charge, whom I will refer to as “Professor” or “the Professor” for reasons already outlined. He was friendly and disarming, and after what I thought had been a terrible interview was over, I was offered the position. 

The amount of paperwork I had to sign was daunting. The four of us, two girls and another guy plus me, spent the better part of three hours signing all of it with the assistance of the lab’s lawyers. One of girls, Gina, cramped her wrist about three quarters of the way through. We were frustrated, but this was only the beginning of the injuries we would see working here.

We started working on a Monday, and that was just to orient us to our new environment. We were paid for a full day even though we were only there for about four hours. Looking back, I realize what they were trying to do. They progressively introduced us to stranger, more complicated duties while also increasing the incentives to do so. The credit wouldn’t count unless we completed the entire summer internship, for one.

This lab was involved with some shady stuff, to put it mildly. The facility was relatively isolated but still within driving distance of suburbia. It was built on old government land, but I was surprised to find that the newer facility was built over a large underground complex that had been retrofitted and refurbished so it looked like a hospital, only cleaner.

Don’t try to find the name of this company. I need to say that, for your own protection if anything else. It doesn’t exist anymore, and even when it did I don’t think it was anything more than a shell company. Now it’s a trap. Trust me. 

I first met the Children about three weeks into the job. I was the one brought in to see them at first, why I’ll never know, but the Professor grabbed me from the station I had been cleaning and walked me to the elevator to the sub-levels. I asked him what we were doing but he wouldn’t say, just that, “It’ll be mind-blowing.”

I need to point out here that I didn’t come up with Professor. Most of the scientists addressed him that way and I won’t give the one name I heard. 

He ushered me out the elevator into the sub-levels and took me through multiple layers of security. If you understand the concept of an airlock, that’s what these checkpoints felt like. Professor would enter a code or give some kind of biometric verification, usually both, and the final layer actually had him answer a question Ravenclaw style. 

When we finally got through that last door my mind was racing, thinking about all the mad science that could possibly be going on down here, half believing it at this point, but nothing I came up with prepared me for what I saw. I was expecting an AI server farm, genetic mutants, people reading minds, bioweapons, that kind of stuff. 

Looking through an elevated window into a large viewing area, I at first thought I was viewing the aftermath of something. There were these large dark splotches of liquid that covered the wall, floor, and ceiling. 

As soon as I came up to the window and stopped, the dark stains *moved,* coalescing into blobs of what looked like oil as they rolled across surfaces, leaving no trails. 

A few the blobs climbed the wall and hung from the ceiling, looking like drops about to fall. I thought something must be inside that mass of oil, but the Professor assured me that they were composed entirely of that substance. 

“What are they?” I asked, not realizing I’d spoken.

“We don’t know exactly,” The Professor said. “When we first found the original sample, we thought it was an alien organism just because of how different it is, but evidence seems to show that the raw organic material oozed up from the mantle.”

“Whoa,” I said. “They’re organic?” I was thinking they were some kind of ultra-high tech liquid metal terminator. 

“Organic, yes,” Professor said. “But unlike anything that exists on the surface. This isn’t just a new animal, this an entirely new type of organism that doesn’t fall into the domains of Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea.”

You need to understand how surreal and dreamlike the Children seemed. They were basically living pools of oil that coalesced into large blobs. They moved in their area after they got bored with us and started, playing I guess. They were distinct from each other, and looking down I could see thirteen numbered tanks. The Children were identified by the number of the tank they came from. 

The scientists had tracking software that identified the Children when you viewed a feed through a computer rather than looking through a window. The window in question was about six inches thick and specifically constructed to fit that opening with as little space between window and mount as possible. 

“When we first let them out,” The Professor went on, “they couldn’t even do this. They were basically just a colony of cells, like the original sample, but they’ve grown since then. They can grip any surface, using the semi-fluid tissue in such a way as to fill in microscopic gaps and propel themselves along.”

One of the blobs extended its form into something resembling a worm or a snake. It shot up the wall and reached the ceiling, much faster than I thought was possible, reforming as a blob and hanging from a thread while it tried to do something else. 

They weren’t pitch black, there was a dark iridescence on the surface of their bodies, and a small circular indentation formed on the hanging blob. The indentation on the Child in front of me grew deeper and the hole closed around the hollow that was forming. 

The Professor didn’t like that. “Black out the window. Make certain no visible light enters through this opening.” 

The technician obeyed and the hanging blob pushed the air pocket out. It fell to the floor and landed with a thud, not a splat, which piped through the speakers.

“They learn quickly,” The Professor said, still looking out through the one way mirror. “But curiously, they learn at different rates. One is exceptional, though it tends to be less social than the others.”

I looked back at the blobs and saw that they were throwing themselves against each other and even though they enmeshed, they were still apparently distinct. After the combined blob thrashed around a little bit two small blobs disentangled and slid off in opposite directions. 

I also noticed how they were arranged. I could almost pick out three distinct groups, but two of the four loners stood out. The first was more active and inquisitive than the others and moved around significantly faster. This must have been One. It seemed to want us to realize that it was better than the rest, or was working hard to make that assertion a fact. 

*Strange that it seeks outside validation when it shouldn’t be able to understand that other life forms exist.* The Professor had explained that the Children had been born and raised in a sterile environment, no organic material aside from algae cultured to feed them.

As soon as I had the thought a curious thing happened that I never thought was important until now. The iridescence on the skin of a little more than half the Children seemed to brighten as One’s darkened just enough to be noticeable. At the time, I attributed it to the two way mirror because the eight or so Children that brightened were to my right and One was on the far left. I mistakenly thought polarized sunglasses and two way mirrors were the same kind of glass. 

Now I wonder. Were they aware even at that early age that there were other beings outside their little world?

Eleven, the other Child that stood out, simply hung from the top of its tank. It never came out or interacted with the others, and for the most part they left it alone. It stood out for the sole reason that it was the only Child that had never once moved or left its tank. 

The only Child that bothered Eleven was, as you might have guessed, One. One seemed to like taunting Eleven, wrapping around its tank and covering it completely, or later by tapping the glass and trying to dislodge it. 

Eleven was the Child who showed the scientists they had no idea what they were dealing with.

621gwv,8,2017-03-28,Is my lack of motivation just depression or a sign I should leave my doctoral program? Advice and similar stories welcome,egshef,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/621gwv/is_my_lack_of_motivation_just_depression_or_a/,"**tl;dr: 1st year PhD student on medical leave, chronically ill and depressed, lots of personal life struggles, unable to complete work and function in an academic environment, thinking of leaving this behind and working industry**


Hey /r/GradSchool, I've had a really challenging year and am debating leaving my PhD program. Here's why:  

2016 was a roller coaster year for me. With the ups, like acceptance to my dream PhD program, came with huge downs, like my mom being diagnosed with cancer. I had a lot go on and because of it my stress took off and so did my chronic illnesses, chronic sinusitis and endometriosis. 

This past August I was working industry for the first time. After a few weeks of impostor syndrome BS I settled into work, found my groove, and made a good enough of an impression where I was offered to continue interning (If I didn't already sign a lease I would have seriously considered staying at that job). It also felt really good to be competent in the workplace in case I didn't get or want a job in academia (when I applied I said I had teaching experience and enjoyed it but wasn't sure how much time I wanted to offer to teaching). 

The point of this, though, is that during that my internship I often had to leave to deal with my pain but it never made work totally unbearable, and worst case scenario I worked from home or made it up on a weekend. My sinus surgeon, who wanted to clean me out in September, let me wait until December so I could have surgery between semesters. I debated deferring but had no idea what that entailed or if I even could. I don't regret not deferring but in hindsight it would have been a smart move, and I think I was anxious to relocate and start this new part of my life. 

The Fall 2016 semester started off pretty strong but by October I slowly started to become a mess. My sinus symptoms worsened, my endometrosis started to bother me more, and it became difficult to do work. Some work I could power through but other work (like research I felt my advisor made me do for her out of my best interests) I just stopped doing and started making excuses. I began answering emails later and later and avoiding professors. This is when everything started to feel like it was going to hell both physically and professionally. 

Luckily my program director and professors understood that I did a really bad job explaining that I was sick and that what I needed desperately was a medical leave. I left the fall semester just focused on getting healthier and nothing else. The intention was that once I had recovered I would tie up any loose ends (I took incomplete for the semester) and restart full time again this fall. 

When I came back after surgery this February I was excited to work but started to lose interest quickly. The previous semester I attributed my inability to work and lack of motivation on illnesses, but now that I'm not as sick it doesn't make as much sense. I started sleeping more, putting off emails even later, and became a recluse. I actively avoided my cohort and professors and only did what I absolutely needed to for my job. My depression settled in along with random crying, feelings of hopelessness, and legitimately not caring if I could be dropped. I didn't want to do my PhD because I didn't want to do anything in life, let alone be alive. I started seeing a therapist because it got the point where getting out of bed and maintaining good hygiene seemed impossible. Endometriosis has definitely contributed to my poor life outlook, and a big blow was having a specialist close by have to reschedule my appointment 2 months later than I anticipated, delaying the pain relief I thought I would get sooner. 

I'm at the point now where I feel depressed but better, embarrassed to go on campus and talk to professors, unmotivated to work, and I don't know how I will get myself out of this hole. I feel like the only support I have is my boyfriend even though I'm certain everyone wants me to succeed. I know all I have to do is the work since a PhD is more about persistence and passion than intelligence but everything seems overwhelming. When I think about research it seems appealing and I'm still excited about theory and ideas but actually doing it just feels impossible as of this point.

I was supposed to schedule an annual evaluation with my professors and program head but have been putting it off. There are jobs in my area I could apply for and probably get, and if not I could work remotely. I'm seriously looking at one place hoping they hire me on as summer intern and possibly fully time once I have a better handle on my situation. I don't necessarily need a PhD for industry work but it will be a bit of an uphill battle and I'll need to prove myself more than the average candidate given my background. As of now I'm not sure if I want to teach but I don't want to close that door until I feel certain about my status in the program.

Sorry this was long and ranty at parts. Last year was one of huge personal growth and development and I just want perspective as to if why I feel the way I do is because of just depression and personal problems or if I should just make the jump to industry and forget about teaching. Thanks in advance.

I just started a new internship where I will be working on an internal app. The intern before me, who was new to web dev, programmed the first version with jQuery and Node. All things considered, he got the job done by doing what was asked, but the codebase is an unmaintainable mess.

No best practices are followed and the frontend file is 700 lines of jQuery hacked together.

Now, my new manager wants me to add-on some features, make an admin portal, the works. Currently, the site outputs some data into a few tables. I have experience making web apps and was thinking about doing a rewrite with Vue, but the majority of my experience is with Angular 1. 

It took the original guy two months to build what is currently there. I feel like a rewrite couldn't take more than two or three weeks.

My questions for you guys are:

- Is a few weeks realistic to rewrite this into maintainable code with Vue or some other framework/library?
- Do you think a rewrite to get rid of the jQuery would be worth it?
- How can I best justify using a couple of weeks to rewrite the project to my current manager?

Thank you for taking a look!

tl;dr: Please save me from jQuery spaghetti code."

I've never been a super reserved person, but I would definitely classify myself as more of an introvert. That being said, I'm pretty good at carrying a conversation if the responsibility falls to me... until lately anyway.

I don't know what's happened. Lately I just can't seem to generate or hold a conversation, and it's all I can think about when I'm in a social setting. I just feel like I have nothing interesting to say, and worry too much about awkward comments to do anything but sit in silence. Wouldn't bother me so much if this was only the case with strangers, but it's gotten to the point where I have problems talking to my closest friends whom I've known for years.

I think a lot of it may be due to working an internship these last few months where I don't really do much, and then fill my weekends at my part time job because I still have to put food on the table. So basically I'm working 7 days a week with only enough time to myself for the gym, dinner, and then maybe seeing a friend. I don't have time anymore to do the things I enjoy or be myself. Each day is pretty much a carbon copy of the last.

It just sucks because I worked so hard to overcome my problems with social anxiety over my university years, and now it's all started to come back again. I hope I'll be able to break out of this funk once my internship is over, and I have a bit more time to actually have a life again.

I've mentioned before that I go to TJHSST, one of the most competitive high schools. At TJ many people do things solely for college apps. There are so many people here who are not motivated by passions (and in many cases even by themselves), but because they do _so much_ for college apps, with 3 summers of internships and awards like ISEF or Regeneron, they get in to top schools anyway. I'm not saying what they do isn't impressive, but I feel extremely disadvantaged compared to them. I do almost everything of my own accord and on my own time, so while I'm really passionate about certain subjects, a lot of my ECs are quite ""unofficial"" and by TJ standards probably nonexistent. I'm gonna work my ass off to try and craft stellar essays and make myself stand out, but I don't have any big flashy awards. I could still try applying to competitions, but my environment would make it very difficult to win anything. My final question is: is intense passion for subjects and homegrown ECs unique or impressive enough, even in my competitive environment?    
P.S. I feel like I should bring up the cheating culture at TJ. In recent years, especially since I started, it's become a serious problem. In fact, within the past year violating the honor code has turned into a meme of sorts (""honor coding""). The kid that sits in front of me in my CS class has 30 honor code violations since the start of this year in that class alone (a bit ridiculous tbh actually, but it's a rumor). Anyway, back to my main point. While not cheating, like I said before, so many people do things just for college apps, and even if they don't get those awards, there's a chance that they'll say they got them anyway. It makes me feel so hopeless: I work very hard for my grades and for my activities, but these students go to better schools than I do in the end.     
P.P.S. I feel like this turned into a vent near the end. Sorry about that, but I needed to share my thoughts."

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

Naturally, I’m ecstatic because this means I will be able to stay with the company!

All’s well until a friend of mine in the web dev dept. tells me they may be looking for someone full time to do some front end stuff, am I interested?! Of course! I’d rather be working in dev because that’s what I actually do and am getting my degree for. But I’ve pretty much already accepted the other position and have even started some training :(

Still, I’m fairly new to the company, only two months in, and I don’t want to do anything that would make me look bad or unprofessional. 

Not to mention, the company is very small - 30 people max - and a friend in the social dept. joked that I was a 'social climber' when he heard me inquiring about the other position, presumably because I was pining over the social media position believing it was the only way to stay with the company.

Strong Excel knowledge (pivot tables, vlookups, advanced functions), SQL (worked with stored procedures, triggers, basic functions) and relational database design, basic project management in MS Project, broad general knowledge of IT and e-commerce strategies/technologies, and basic coding skills in HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, and C++.

I'm more interested in the business-side of IT so I think a business/systems analyst position would be a good fit but I'm really concerned that I don't have enough experience to get there.

Should I apply anyway, or is there another stepping stone that will help me get there? Basically, I want to know what I should be doing today so I can land an entry-level position. I might need something in the meantime to pay my bills but I have my living situation sorted until late July so I can dedicate 100% of my energy, barring finishing my degree, on taking the steps to find something and continue learning. Are there internship opportunities for post-grads that I should be looking at, or should I just apply to something like a QA-type position? I'm located in NYC if that makes any difference.

Edit: Also, my GPA is 3.4 and major GPA should be even higher, if that matters. Just trying to give as much information on my situation as possible."

I'm much more interested in lower level programming (systems, embedded), but I don't really see those sorts of positions available for interns and fresh college grads. I really want to work in this area, but I'm slightly concerned that I'll end up having to get whatever I can, and end up stuck doing web work anyway (not that that's so terrible, but it's not really what I want).   
  
I'm sure these positions out there, and I'm probably just not looking in the right place - this is what I could use some help with. If anyone has any advice on this, or general career advice for someone with my interests, I'd really appreciate it, thanks."

Thought to myself, why not apply for an internship?
Applied for an internship in the field of my major. Interview sucked, but they hired me part time with long term aspirations. I think they did this because right before I went for my interview two people had quit and they really needed somebody.

It's a small company but I'm earning experience in my field which will be valuable once I graduate.

They have started, recently, micromanaging me. 

What started with a small email here and they're turned into mandatory meetings every week.

From there on it turned into indirect phrases of discreditation.

At first I thought I was reading into things too much but now my coworkers have raised the same concerns that I had regarding to my treatment

It's come down to where I do not want to go to work anymore and I want to quit

I dread waking up every day going to work and it has made me somewhat miserable

What should I do? Should I write it out for another few months? Should I quit?
I'm also afraid that once I graduate I wouldn't find any other job and I would have to stick with this one

Any advice?"
624idv,2,2017-03-29,My [22M] GF [22F] of 2 years is acting weird after moving in and we are fighting about the past.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/624idv/my_22m_gf_22f_of_2_years_is_acting_weird_after/,"So my gf and I have been together for 2 years, and have known each other for 4 since freshman year of college.  We recently moved back to our college town after staying with our parents post graduation, and life has been pretty good.  I got a job in my major that pays a solid rate, she's working a low pay job but taking on an internship to get into her field, and we live in a beautiful amazing place that has fantastic access to all of our hobbies and is full of many friends.  However since moving in we have had some fights and I don't really understand where they are coming from.  We have had a great relationship and before moving in we were both on the same page and were spending basically every night together anyway (minus 1 or 2 occasionally).  

Since the move we have had a couple disagreements and maybe one or two fights.  This alone is really strange as we never really fought before at all, we have always had great communication and were able to calmly discuss things with level heads.  Especially weird was today, after she came home from work (I took the day off to work on my side projects).  She was tired as usual, but seemed in a good mood.  We had a couple drinks and began to make dinner, all the while she was very horny and talking about having sex (even though we did it the last two days straight), I wasn't in the mood and told her as much, but it kinda irked me that .  Then she starts talking about her co-worker's breakup and we get on the subject of breakups in past relationships.  I don't really care about her previous relationships but I know about them, she knows that i slept around a bit earlier in college but not every detail.  

What got weird was when we the conversation moved to us getting together, and she said that she felt like owes me something because I had feeling for her for two years while she was dating another guy who turned out to be emotionally abusive and stalked her after breaking up.  I have come to terms with our past, and honestly wasn't mature enough to handle a serious relationship when I had the chance to date her the first time anyway.  It just became this huge thing though, and I don't know why.

I just don't understand where she is coming from and why this is such a big thing.  I don't really like bringing up the past so it made me kinda angry that she kept pushing the questions about past relationships.  How can I resolve this?  I love this girl and at one point thought that I could marry her but now am unsure.

624mwy,366,2017-03-29,I've been fucking the office intern for the last few months [MF],cz4514,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/624mwy/ive_been_fucking_the_office_intern_for_the_last/,"A couple months ago I noticed one of the managers giving a tour to a new intern (let's call her Amy). I work in an office with a bunch of old fuckers so this fine young ~5'3"" Asian girl immediately caught my eye. They eventually stopped by my office where the manager introduced us, and Amy said hi and gave me a cute smile. I said hi back but I couldn't help myself from stealing glances at her gorgeous little body. She was wearing this tight grey office skirt that went down to her knees and she was in heels, her pink toenails visible through the holes in her shoes. The thing that caught my eye was her perfect figure. Everything about this girl was perfect, from her slender arms, cute little shoulders, beautiful face with pouty lips, her boobs weren't too small but not too big, her flat stomach, her wide hips, her thick thighs... And as they left she turned around to show off her big round ass. It's a good thing I was sitting down because I was really fucking hard and wanted nothing more than to lift up that dress and give her a welcome fuck right then and there over my desk. 

---- I'll fast-forward through the boring stuff. Found out she's 21, single, still in college. We made out in my car a couple of times then we hooked up at my place about 3 weeks later. Also found out she likes to be a kinky sub, which is perfect because I'm really into that.---- 

During work hours we mostly like to be business-like and professional towards each other, it's sort of a fun game we play and it really builds up the sexual tension... Watching this sexy girl and thinking about all of the things I want to do to her while I'm supposed to be working drives me absolutely insane! I say ""mostly professional"" because there are times when I just give in and call her into my office so I can tell tell her to crawl under my desk and start sucking my dick, to which she gladly complies. My office blinds are open because everyone else's is open too but she has yet to be caught slipping under my desk. Behind me is glass facing the rest of downtown, I have no idea if anyone has spotted me getting head while at work yet. There were a few times when people popped in to ask me something, and once her boss popped in to ask if I had seen her (yes Ken, she's under my desk sucking on my dick right now) but luckily I have not had to stand up yet. She wraps her sweet lips around my dick and sucks it until I explode in her mouth and then she keeps sucking, which drives me so absolutely wild that I can't help throwing my head back as the orgasm takes over my body. Then she crawls out from under my desk and goes about her day, but her smell lingers and I just end up getting hard again!  

About 3 times during the work week I ask her to ""work late"". This entails us staying til about 5:45-6 when all of the workaholics finally leave to go home and most of the lights are turned off on the floor. On Tuesdays and Thursdays the cleaning crew comes so we have to be quiet (harder for her than it is for me) but yesterday (Monday) I took her into my office, closed the blinds, locked the door behind us and then we ripped the clothes off of each other. I devoured her lips and ran my hands all over her tight body, taking in her curves and grabbing at her tits and ass, sucking and licking and biting on her delicate neck and nipples. All the while she's working my buttons off and loosening my belt as I grabbed two handfuls of hair and forced her to her knees ordering her to open her mouth. I grabbed two fistfuls of her hair and fucked her face for minutes on end minus the few seconds where I let her breathe, she makes a mess as she drools on herself and the floor. 

After she's panting and gasping for air I ordered her to bend over the desk and grab her arms behind her back, and while she did that I took off my belt from my pants and wrapped it around my hand. I walked over to the desk and grabbed a fistful of hair as I shoved my dick right back in her throat, and with the other hand I began whipping her ass, but not too hard. I love the feeling of absolute dominance over this girl, I thought to myself as I continued to fuck her throat and whip her ass. At this point she's whimpering and struggling to breathe (which turns me even more on). After a short while of this I take my dick out of her mouth and ask her if she's had enough to which she responded ""yes sir"", I asked her to clarify and she said ""I've had enough whipping sir, thank you sir"". I then used my belt to tie her hands behind her back, sometimes I tie her legs, sometimes I tie her neck with the belt to something (like the chair). Yesterday though I wanted to toss her around so I tied her hands behind her back. 

She was already dripping wet from the ""foreplay"" but I decided to tease her anyway, slowly thrusting my dick up and down her crack as I leaned over and put some weight on her. Into her ear I began whispering what was on my mind, how I've been wanting to fuck her all day, how sexy she was, how nice her ass/tits/legs/neck/hair was as I used my other hand to feel her up. I then asked her if she was ready for my dick to which she whispered ""yes sir I'm ready for you dick"", I made her say it louder, and I made her beg for it until I was rock hard and couldn't wait anymore. I grabbed my dick and slowly started putting it into her pussy, and even with me pinning her down she was able to move her ass back to take more of me in. It feels so fucking good to have my dick inside her tight pussy I wasn't sure how long I'd last. If I was fucking her at ""the cumming speed"" (guys probably know what I'm talking about) then I might've lasted 2 minutes tops, so I took her slow to get accustomed to her tight wet pussy. And all the while I'm still whispering into her ear about how her pussy feels and how much I wanted her. 

After about 5-10 minutes of me getting used to the feeling of being inside her sweet little pussy I grabbed her by her tied arms (what a convenient handle) and began to fuck her harder and harder, long-stroking and ramming hard into her. She was going wild and loved absolutely every second of it and of course shit's flying off my desk now (I have to lay the monitor flat before I do this). This went on for about half an hour, and during that time I untied her arms and wrapped my belt around her neck to make a leash, calling her my fuck toy and sex slave while using the other hand to either slap her ass (which was a deep red by now) or squeezing and rubbing her tits. She begged me to cum twice but I denied it to her. I stopped after the half hour because she can't take a long fucking and her pussy tends to dry up a bit. So I gave my dick a break by ordering her to her knees where I led her around the office while she was still leashed. After a few rounds around the office I stopped by the window and told her to suck my dick while holding her hair with both her hands, which she obliged. I stood there and got head from this beautiful kinky slut while watching the sun set over my city... the feeling is truly indescribable. After a short while of her sucking me I knew she was ready for more, and I confirmed it by asked her to which she replied ""yes sir I'm ready for more of your dick"". 

I ordered her to get back on the desk and to lay on her back and grab her legs (really wish there was a soft bed in my office). She was still leashed so I wrapped the other end around my hand and put my dick slowly inside of her again, fucking her slowly to feel her amazing wet pussy. Then I began to speed up little by little, and her moaning increased with the speed until she was nearly yelling. If there was anyone outside they would've known there's fucking happening in here. Watching her hold on to her legs, her tits bouncing back and forth, her ass jiggling from the pounding it was all too much and I wanted to cum right then and there but I knew I had to keep going. I said ""cum for me slut"" to which she responded ""yes sir, please fuck me harder"" so I let go of her leash and grabbed her thighs as I began to slam into her as fast and hard as I can. She gave up trying to control her legs and began to grab anything she could including my arms and the edge of the desk as she moaned ""can I please come sir"", I was so ready to explode I just managed to say ""yea"" as I kept pounding the living fuck out of her until she eventually closed her eyes, went limp, and got noticeably quieter... I knew she just came so I pulled out and came on her stomach and pussy to a mind-blowing orgasm. 

So with me on my chair and her still sprawled on my desk we panted and caught our breathe. She lay there for a while with her eyes closed as I stared at her perfect body and wondered what a girl's orgasm feels like. Then we eventually found the energy to put clothes on, clean up, and kiss each other good night. 

~~***Let me know if you guys want to see a picture of this sexy girl~~ Really sorry guys she vetoed this pretty hard and I will respect her privacy. Maybe in the future she'd be open to it. "

After all of this I've only learned COBOL/zOS/JCL, and JAVA.  An IT ""professional practice"" course, and a hardware/software course, and I'm currently in a couple of project management classes. 

In my free time I've been meaning to learn PHP (getting an intro via CodeAcademy)  but goddamn am I scatterbrained 

So I'm expected to do an internship this semester then I have 1 more semester (a full load) and then I would be eligible to graduate.

But the positions that are being offered now (pretty late at this point because no one previously wanted me) I'm not qualified for  and I'm not sure how to move forward from here

this post in 90% venting but I would gladly take any advice you all have moving forward

62512s,1,2017-03-29,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62512s/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
625a7a,10,2017-03-29,(spoilers) Locust dialogue?,sincereenfuego,darksouls3,https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/625a7a/spoilers_locust_dialogue/,"So I just finished the dlc and the one thing that it was amazing. Very reminiscent of both DS1 and DS2. There were many fun mysteries and easter eggs through out the entirety of the game but one thing that stood out to me that not too many have commented on were the locust and their dialogue.


So if you haven't beaten the Ringed City DLC I would recommend turning away now due to spoilers, otherwise, enjoy my deluded theories and tell me what you think. 


First, we have the dialogue of ""One was a wayfaring knight, on an endless, forbidden search. Only the Abyss granted closure, if not reunion with his beloved."" Now, the first thing that popped into my mind for this was Knight Artorias. He was sent by Gwyn to (forgive me but my DS1 lore is foggy) defeat the abyss. I can only assume he plunged into the abyss to fight the 4 kings/Manus and was intern consumed by the abyss. Maybe the abyss granted him a dream of him and Sif/Ciaran (I say Ciaran because I believe that it is agreed by some that both Artorias and her were in love).


Next up we have ""One poor girl slew her own kin, but even so, was embraced, enveloped by the Abyss. Twas a comfort that neither moon nor sunless sky afforded her before."" So first person to come to mind for me was Sieglinde of Catarina (daughter of Siegmeyer). My thoughts behind this one are as follows. Siegmeyer is on a grand adventure. If I remember correctly (again, sorry but a little foggy) he was trying to not go hollow by being on an adventure...and he was pretty bad at adventuring. You (being the chosen undead) basically help Siegmeyer throughout all of DS1 until he eventually breaks mentally due to you constantly saving him/progressing his quest. Intro Sieglinde  who eventually slays her own father (kin) who went hollow. She did this in ashen lake where there are neither sun nor moon. Don't know if that last part really matters but it seemed to fit.


""One met the dark with learning. But in the end, learned his knowledge was wanting. The world began without knowledge, and without knowledge will it end. Dost not this ring clear and true"". This has to be Big Hat Logan. You meet him in Sen's Fortress and eventually he ends up in The Duke's Archives where he reads and consumes all the books he can until he babbles incoherent nonsense and is presumed to have gone hollow/insane from knowledge he was never meant to read.


""And so, despite his weighty armour, he lived in fear. Of a delicate thing, little more than a girl. Where fire resideth, shadows twist and shrivel. But in the Abyss, there are shadows none."" Now this one had me stumped. It could obviously be talking about Eygon, but I also see a parallel to Lautrec. Eygon's is pretty easy to see but for Lautrec, it takes a little finagling to reach the conclusion. Lautrec was rescued from the undead perish. He ends up at the Shrine Bonfire and if you don't kill him, he kills the fire keeper there. Now the only thing I can think of as to the ""weighty armor"" was that he had faith in his goddess and didn't want to let her down. If you look closely at his armor in-game, it has a pair of arms draped across the chest. This is to symbolize his devout love and loyalty, hence the ""weighty"". Lastly, he lived in fear of disappointing his goddess and her not loving him. This one might be too far a stretch lore wise though...


The two lines I have yet to come to a conclusion on yet are as follows. ""Of all the Fingers, he alone was embraced by the Abyss. For he was human, and ne'er a grub."" Could be any of the fingers but for some reason I think it might tie to Kirk, whom devoted his existence (at least in DS1) to giving humanity to The Fair Lady. And lastly we have ""And so, she lived in fear. Of the dark, of the things that gnawed at her flesh. And yet! The Abyss hath yet to produce any such creature!"". This one most obviously points to Irina, but that seems too easy and I feel I am missing someone besides her that might fit this category.


Sorry for the wall of text. The lore is whatever you make it. This is all just my take. As someone that loves DS1 most of all, I am just trying to put a spin on the facts as I see them fall. You don't have to agree, and hell, if you have a better option or opinion, I would love to hear. As to why the locust refer to all these ""assumed to be dead/fallen/hollow"" NPCs, I have no clue.


Thanks for reading!


Edit 1: so, many are pointing out that alva is more likely the wayfaring knight but by definition wayfaring means travling by foot. This could easily apply to both alva and artorias  (yes I know alva is know as the wayfaring knight). But hear me out. Maybe there are more subtle underlying mirrored stories then we thought. I see a mirror in some of alva and artorias as well as sirris and Sieglinde. Maybe all the souls stories were more tied together than we thought? Go figure that a game about repeating cycles of fire and dar have repeating stories for NPCs. 

Edit 2: so the whole ""One poor girl slew her own kin, but even so, was embraced, enveloped by the Abyss. Twas a comfort that neither moon nor sunless sky afforded her before"" quote can apply sirris because it fits her storyline from ds3. However, it fits Sieglinde because she ended her quest in ashen lake where there was no sun or moon (as far as I remember) only crag. It also applies to the mirah knight from ds2 who slays her own brother (or is slain by him...up to interpretation).
Anyways, going to bed. Will be back to discuss tomorrow. Please keep talking though. I think we are on to something here."
625f5u,5,2017-03-29,"Long Time Reader, First Time Poster (Potential Triggers, But Nothing Too Bad)",SockPuppetSam,emetophobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/625f5u/long_time_reader_first_time_poster_potential/,"Hello everyone!

Wall of text coming. I'm sorry. 

This sub-Reddit has been a lifeline of mine for a while now, but I've never actually participated in the conversation. I thought I would just briefly tell my story (although it will sound familiar, I'm sure). 

I've been a self described emetophobe for literally as far back as I can remember. I would even say since before I knew what a phobia was. The earliest memory I have in my life is when I got sick in a room full of people at a church event. I was six years old, so this was 20 years ago, but I still remember it vividly to this day. 

For years after that event, I couldn't put a name on the feeling I had. In hindsight, I now realize it was anxiety, but as a dumb little six year old, I had no idea. So I would always say I had a headache. 

A six year old saying they have a headache everyday can become alarming...

Eventually, my parents took me to a neurologist who ordered an MRI and a CT Scan of my brain, all because I couldn't adequately describe the anxious feeling I had coursing through my brain. 

Unsurprisingly, the tests came back negative, and eventually the feeling subsided. For a little while at least. 

Five years later, I was a super awkward 11 year old trying to navigate my way through middle school. One day, a kid in the classroom across the hall from mine became ill, left his classroom and didn't make it to the restroom. The door to our classroom happened to be open, so the entire event played out for us as an auditory experience. 

Suddenly, I was back to being that scared six year old who had a ""headache.""

For the next few months, I spent more time in the nurses office than in the classroom. I again had difficulty describing my symptoms, but eventually my parents took me to a psychiatrist, and I began receiving therapy. I was prescribed Zoloft, and took it everyday for a few months. 

Eventually, I just got better. I don't know why, or how exactly (probably the Zoloft), but I was able to eventually be weened off the Zoloft.

The next nine years of my life went by with very few incidents. I would have the occasional panic attack because of the phobia, but I would describe them as acute. I thought I was passed it. 

But I wasn't. 

In fall of 2011, for pretty much no reason, I had a debilitating panic attack in the middle of a college English class. It was as if my brain had reverted itself back to the way it was a decade earlier. 

I would struggle with anxiety, OCD, and panic attacks for the next few months. It affected every aspect of my life. Every job, every relationship, every moment.

This time around, I didn't seek professional help. It wasn't as easy to do so because I was an adult, and more on my own than I was with my previous stints. My primary care physician did prescribe me Xanax to deal with the panic attacks, but that's the only medication that I took.

Eventually, this bout with anxiety subsided like the others, and I thought I was finally freed from this illness. 

But nope. Like a horror villain, this foe just wouldn't die. 

Fast forward to February 2016. I'm 25 at this point. I had just finished my Master's, and recently moved to D.C. for an internship. I had what I can only describe as an acid reflux attack from eating too quickly, which (trigger warning) caused me to v* mucus. Gross. I know. 

This sent me into a downward spiral, and kicked off my longest battle with emetophobia to date.

I put off getting help, which was a mistake. This allowed the disease to fester over the next few months, until eventually I could barely function on a day to day basis. In May of '16, I started my first real job with an organization that I had dreamed of working for, but my anxiety made it difficult just to make it into the office. 

Still, I put off getting help. 

I was again prescribed Xanax by my PCP, but in my brain, I had convinced myself that it would make me sick, so I never took it. Instead, I let myself suffer through panic attack after panic attack. 

I stopped eating. I lost 15 pounds. I missed an entire week of work. I had to leave every work meeting because of panic attacks. I was completely spiraling. 

In February of '17, on the one year anniversary of the event that kicked off this latest bout with emetophobia, I decided enough was enough. I needed to get help. 

I got a note from my PCP to take a month off of work (my job has great benefits; I'm incredibly lucky in this way) and began seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

My psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft, and I've now been taking it for over a month. 

I was very resistant to this at first. I had read a list of side effects that included nausea, and this turned me off to the whole idea of taking it. For the first two weeks, I had to take a Xanax every time I took the pill, just to keep myself from completely freaking out. Now, that fear is gone. 

I won't say I'm completely better yet; that will take some more time. But I'm definitely improving. 

Things that use to immediately kick off a massive panic attack, are much more benign now. I'm getting better with coping with this illness, although it still is very present in my mind. 

But to say I'm cured would be a dramatic overstatement. I still have panic attacks. I still have anxiety. Just less so. It's effect on my daily life is diminishing. 

So, what was the point of this post? I found writing it therapeutic, and now that I've finished it, I almost have a sense of catharsis.

I'm convinced that anxiety, like most things in life, is cyclical. I'd like to think that I'm at the tail end of a particularly bad cycle in my life. I hope it's my last bout with it, although that is probably unlikely. At least now I have a better toolkit for coping. 

This sub-Reddit has provided me with so much comfort and inspiration as I've dealt with this dreaded disease, and for that I want to thank every member of this community. 

For those of you struggling, just remember that it does get better. Panic attacks are temporary. Anxiety is temporary. Even when it doesn't feel like it, it is. 

Don't make the mistake that I did in delaying getting help. No one should have to fight this on their own.

I apologize for this wall of text. 

TL;DR — I'm just an emetophobe, posting in a forum full of emetophobes, asking them to love me. "

Hiya people of DKP. Today, I want to roleplay out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

I'm a 26 year old guy, currently working in an internship environment. I'm generally a quiet guy, and I deal with a lot of anxiety. On my first day I met her. 
She was an intern who had already worked there for awhile and showed me around.  Generally a really pleasant person to be around. 
At the time I was in a relationship so I kept my distance from her and everything was cool. 
The relationship I was in lasted over 3 years, and got to a point where I was constantly abused psychologically. 
I tried to hide this from work, figuring I shouldn't let it impact me too much in my professional life. 
After a few months of work there was some sort of conference, and all interns were invited. 
There were drinks afterwards, and me and the girl that showed me around were the last ones left. 
We got along, and considering I didn't really wanna go home she suggested we'd get more drinks somewhere else. 
We talked a lot that night, about everything in our lives. Our mutual hate for our boss, our personalities and issues we were struggling with, our pasts and where we came from. 
We bonded, and we were drinking buddies from there on out. Her internship was ending in a month and afterwards she had to move back to her own country. 
During that month we tried to squeeze in as much time to hang out as we could. We went out drinking, went to themeparks, stayed in and played games together. 
At work we'd time our lunches together and gossip about our co-workers. I was starting to fall for her. 
I had opened up about my abusive relationship to her, and she supported me when I broke that off. 
I felt like this girl was special, she had my back. But then came the day she had to leave. 
All of our coworkers threw her a going away party and it got a bit emotional at times. 
She gave me a big hug when she left and promised to stay in touch. This sucked ofcourse. 
We kept texting every day about anything really, partially because I was interested in her, but also to not lose contact. 
When you can't see eachother I feel it's hard to remain in contact like everything's normal. 
For newyears, I asked her if I could celebrate it with her and she invited me to her home. I met her family and I got along great. 
We got mad drunk and she was pretty much knocked out the next day. Sadly I had to go back home that day so I did not get much alone time with her. 
Back home I was immediately thinking of what to do next, how could I see her again? I was talking with her about doing a roadtrip in our time off and she was all for it. 
We started planning it more than a month in advance and we were really excited. When we were actually on the road something was different. 
I felt she was more distant. It was harder to talk to her. Unfortunately because of a medical emergency in the family I had to go home earlier, and i apologised extensively for it. 
She did not seem to mind it that much however. Afterwards I told her I was planning to ask her out during the trip, which thinking back on it now must have been a mistake. 
She broke down, saying that she had nothing but bad experiences with ex-boyfriends and that the entire dating/relationship thing was just not for her, even though her family kept trying to pressure her into it. 
This was a bit of a blow to me as well ofcourse, I was falling in love with this girl. I tried to brush it off, saying that it's cool and that I understood. 
Since then texting her has been harder. She was figuring out what to do with her life and decided to follow a master's course even further away. 
During the time that she needed to prepare for that she could not be communicated with. 
Apparently she was so anxious about it she tried to escape from everyone and everything by playing games and ignoring any messages. 
However, I did manage to get atleast a message a day out of her, just to let me know she was ok. 
Right now, she's doing her master's. She seems to be doing well, but only contacts me back once a week if I'm lucky.
What do I do? I think she lost interest in me, if she had any at any point at all. 
She's the only think I think of when I wake up in the morning and go to bed at night, but I'm probably the last thing on her mind now.
Should I move on and forget about her? Maybe she's keeping her distance to be considerate of me?"

I am receiving my master's degree in May and I'm still looking to find a job at a public library. I'm doing everything right: volunteering, internship, getting good grades, applying to everything I can get my hands on. I've been applying for jobs since October and have only gotten 2 interviews. Let's just say I'm a bit panicky.

Anyway, my entire life I've dreamed of living in Colorado, close to the Rocky Mountains. While visiting there over spring break, my aunt who lives in the general area where I've always wanted to live, invited me to live with her for 2 months as I try to find my feet out there. After hearing this, I applied to a local bookstore which I'm in love with and they told me I can start after I'm done with school. Mind you this is only a minimum wage job working part time. The upside to the job, however, is that they work hand in hand with many libraries in the area and it would provide great connections for me. I would also have time to volunteer and get my foot in the door to a library in the area. My plans were set to move in with my aunt and work this job while still applying until I got a phone call yesterday.

While in Colorado last week, I stayed in a town where I've always wanted to live. It's at the seat of the Rocky Mountain National Park and is where, since childhood, I always said I wanted to live. I talked with a small shop owner about jobs in the area and he said that he would be interested in me working at his store as a sales clerk. I filled out the application for the hell of it, not thinking much of it. It's a small store that mainly sells touristy t-shirts, but is trying its hardest to be more of a hiking store as the days go by. 

Well, I was sitting in class yesterday and the shop owner called me. He said that he was interested in my application and asked if I wouldn't mind talking about it. I was very ready to tell him that I found another job that was more aligned with my future career (book store), but then he told me that he was interested in hiring me full-time as an assistant manager. Now, I've never dreamed of being an assistant manager at a small touristy store, but this would be a full-time job in the town of my dreams. The pay, however, is bull shit (25k a year), but it would be better than working part-time minimum wage and would keep me on my feet. I'm afraid, though, that it would be soul-sucking and wouldn't leave me any time to keep applying for library jobs.

This is where I need help. It feels so right to be working in a book store to keep me on my feet as I volunteer and keep applying for library jobs. On the other hand, the assistant manager position at the touristy shop is a full-time job, would keep me a little bit comfortable, but, I suppose, would ultimately decrease the chances of getting a full-time library position. I would probably not have the time to keep volunteering in libraries, my time would be spent mostly at a store I wouldn't care about being in, and my library connections would slowly decay. I really just don't know what to do. Everything that feels ""right"", feels logically wrong, but the alternatives seem like a dead end. "

Now getting to the core, I recently was let go from my IT job. And by some miracle, a reference associate position opened up at the same library I worked at before. But the position is part time. It is a salaried position and has health benefits and such even part time.

I really would love to take a break from IT and focus on getting library experience. My resume as is will not make me stand out when I graduate unless applying for something IT related. I don't have much to boast about or compete with compared to somel other future librarians. This is unnerving in a very competitive field.

But being unemployed and needing experience, I have applied. However, I  need full time money to survive, if you all know what I mean lol. So, Do I take part time to make myself a good job candidate in a year (would pick up second gig to curve my pay loss)? Or do I be responsible and take a full time IT job and hope what little bit of library experience I have holds me over? And to be clear, not many IT positions are part time. I haven't found any aside from internships.

Overall looking for personal thoughts and experiences on taking a part time to gain experience instead of taking the safe route."

This puts me in a really tougher position in terms of self improvement, because right now, life is good. I'm 20, got $8k in the bank, I have $0 debt, I'm going abroad for an internship, I feel happy, and life is good.

And that's not the ideal situation for self improvement, me thinks. I don't need to take risks, I can just be relaxed and nothing will go wrong. I'm a good part of the country, safe and sound, and with this abroad internship coming up on the other side of the world, I got a massive adventure waiting for me, and I don't need to do shit for it. I quickly do my assignments for uni, and sometimes I enjoy them, and I usually get around a 7-8/10.

# I want to grind. I did it before, and loved it.

But I want to leave a legacy (might sound weird as a 20 year old). I've been watching Gary Vaynerchuck and I want that. I want to work the balls off of my body (already did this for a previous voice acting gig for a big company, got me $4k in 2 months, only job I've ever had). I want to have meetings left and right, sleep late in the office, etc. I've done this for that voice acting gig, and it was 2 of the best months of my life. I had a purpose, I had a goal. I had a mission.

Now? Nothing. I tell myself that one day I'm gonna reach 2 weeks of NoFap, but whenever an urge kicks in I start watching porn instantly, yet still I get plenty of female attention, and I don't really deep down feel the need to improve. 

I want to do shit. I want to *grind*. Like in those 2 months. But how? I tried looking for jobs, but as a communications student, what the hell can you do without work experience (internship)? 

Shit, fellas. It sounds like I'm in a great place, and I am, but damn man, I want it better.

**I want to feel the necessity. But I can't, because life is too good. FUCK!**

Thank you in advance.

I currently work for my local city government in an entry-level position which I've held for the past 2 years. I enjoy municipal work, and know that public sector is the right place for me. I've applied to higher positions within the city but so far no luck besides getting to the referral stage for those familiar with government work. 

I just turned 25 and feel like a Masters of Public Administration would help boost my career opportunities. My only worry is that even if I get a MPA it won't be enough for me to land a better job as I currently don't have any managerial experience. I'm lucky that I live in a big city and there are two great MPA programs in my metro area, and both programs require an internship if you lack managerial experience but I still have doubts about it. 

So my question is to those who are currently in a MPA program or have already graduated with one, do you think it would be better in my case to continue gaining more experience before applying to a MPA program? "
62844h,549,2017-03-29,I [23F] take care of my younger brother [17M] but I don't want to anymore.,2993,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62844h/i_23f_take_care_of_my_younger_brother_17m_but_i/,"Hi I will try and keep this as short as possible.. My dad went to prison and my parents lost their home in December 2015, forcing them to move into my older brother Jay's place. My little brother Ian was 16 at the time, and he moved into Jay's basement, where he was sleeping on a concrete slab so I decided to take him in. I was with my boyfriend of 2 years at the time, and we decided to take him in since we had an extra room. 

Some background info: My parents were neglectful alcoholics and never made my younger siblings clean or cleaned anything themselves. My parents had like 5 inbred chihuahuas and 10 cats, and the house was always a chaotic mess. My little brother spent most of his childhood just locked in his room playing video games. He dropped out of High School when he was 15 and I can't get him to get his GED and he won't go back to H.S.

So Ian started living with me in January 2016, but it has been getting harder and harder to deal with him since. My ex boyfriend cheated on me last July so I broke up with him, and I was essentially forced to take care of my little brother on my own. I have my own small business but it doesn't make a lot of profit, and he works with me as well, making $12 an hour. I now have a nice 2 bed/2 bath place so he has it really good here. He pays a 1/3 of the rent and also his half of utilities. I cook dinner 3-4 times a week by myself and buy groceries. He always has extra spending money for his own food but I keep everything stocked. 

I also pay for him to have his own phone and we have 5GB of data between us. But he always uses all the data and I have been charged so many times for going over the data, I've started turning off his data but then his behavior gets worse and he's mopey. He works for me so I can take it out of his pay, but then he can't afford rent. He also won't have the full amount of rent when it's due and tells me to just take it out of his pay, which is frustrating.

There just have been so so many issues and I am about at my breaking point. He used to set his drinks on the floor in the livingroom and spill them, and not clean it up. I would have to tell him multiple times to keep his drinks off the ground because i don't want my place turning into my parents. 

Then this Winter he wanted the temperature at 74* (!!), I keep it at 71* and told him and put a note on the thermostat to NOT turn it up. I came home from class and it was hot as hell, and lo and behold he turned it up again. I told him again very nicely not to turn up the thermostat, to which he called me multiple names (b****, austisic?) because his feet were cold and he felt he should be in charge of the thermostat. This happened right after I bought him a new PS4, so I took it away for a few days for his behavior. Since then he has kept it in his room (it was in the livingroom so we both could use it for games/movies) and he stays in his room all day playing games. 

The only times I see him are when I make dinner and yell that it's ready, or when we work together. Other than that he keeps to himself. He doesn't do any chores around the house (something we've talked about multiple times) and his bedroom and bathroom are always disgusting. Whenever I tell him to clean his room he won't. He hoards dishes in his room and there are empty soda cans all over the floor in his bedroom, and we are starting to have a serious ant problem now that the weather is warming up. These are just a few small instances but I feel like this is too much for me to handle. I am graduating in the Fall and am completing an internship, all while running a business and working and I feel completely stuck. I don't feel like I should have to put up with this, especially since he doesn't care about me at all. 

I've gained about 30 pounds over the last 3 months from all the stress and am so miserable. I am crying just typing all this out because it really seems unfair (but life isn't fair right?). I was in therapy for a few months last year for depression and anxiety and it helped immensly, but can no longer afford it as my little brother eats up a lot of my money. My older brother knows about what's going on and has talked to him a few times, but I'm starting to realize that Ian is just lazy. Jay has offered to take him in if it gets too rough and I'm thinking of taking him up on that offer, but I want to hear your guys thoughts and advice first. He turns 18 in November, so I don't know if I need to suffer until then, or if I should ask my older brother to take him in. My parents also don't contribute (mom doesn't work/is an alcoholic), and are living in an RV on a friends property. 

Thanks for reading.

  **tl;dr**: I have been taking care of my little brother for over a year now and feel forced to take care of him. My mental/emotional health is really suffering. He is very lazy and disrespectful and I want to live my own life. I don't know if I should ask my older brother to take him in or tough it out until he is 18."

I recently got a Software Engineering internship for a small company in my state.  The base pay is ~$17.50 an hour with a housing stipend of ~$4.50 an hour, totaling to ~$22.00 an hour.  
The city has decent costs of living, I am seeing apartments range from ~$400 - $800 a month.  Luckily, it is in a town with a community college, so it appears that there are many students looking to sublease for the summer.  I also know quite a few students from my University who go back home there in the summer.  Ideally I would be able to crash with someone I know for cheap, or get in contact with people I know in the Campus Ministry (I am in the same ministry, just a different campus). 

However, if all fails I may still need to rent an apartment at normal cost.  Yet, I also need would prefer to purchase a vehicle to get to-and-from work, or head home or to my university on weekends.  I am a bit nervous about looking for cars from craigslist, as I would like to find a car that would not require constant repairs, but is still within an affordable price range for a student.

The job will be full time for the three months in the summer.  During the school year I also work a part-time job for around 15 hours a week at ~$13.50 an hour.  

How would you all suggest I go about approaching housing/potential car payments, and how can I reach the end of the summer by getting by (food, clothes, ideally maybe $2000 in the bank).

Thanks!

EDIT: I also have about $300 in Credit Card / Taxes I need to pay off, but I should hopefully be paying that off this month."

It's been 12 years, every time I see a doctor I mention it. I get ""that's weird"" or ""don't do that"".
2004-5 I'm a govt intern.

I kept getting sinus infections while working in this building. So every few weeks I'm on some antibiotic.

I was an art major and was used to a little tendinitis and hand cramps in my right hand.

I have knee problems which is why I chose a path via college to work at a desk.(knee problem stems from weak arches). 

After about two-3 months at this internship my right arm was hurting more but in the forearm. I was also getting what looked like bug bites but only in the right forearm.

These red spots/bumps were the epicenters of pain. It was unreal and delayed the pain from when I would ""finger"". I say finger as using a hammer or throwing a ball is not an issue.

I decided to become left handed. Within a month the same thing is going on in my left arm. All the pain is solely in the forearms.
I got a govt job that I assumed would have less computer work. I tried to work through the pain. It is the worst pain I have ever known. But after a while my fingers will loose dexterity... and even get shaky.

The pain will subside if I stay away from use. But with over use can hurt for weeks/days afterwards. And it hurts the most after use.
One arm hurt constantly for ten years with various amounts of pain.
This combined with my bad knees has meant finding a career near impossible. I eventually became a bus/van driver. Which I hate as a career but now I can work outdoors in my cold climate due to another issue. My life is pretty fucked despite not making grave errors in judgement.

Has anyone any idea or can relate to something similar? I've read stuff about antibiotics but this was a period in my life with transition where I don't have solid records of what I was prescribed. Never took anything not prescribed.
Otherwise, advice on what to do with my life? Computer/finger time must be limited. Standing must be limited. Keep in mind I don't have $$$$$."

I'd love to take my CS major and apply it to the medical field somehow. I think doing something like helping improve medical technologies or improve treatment methods would be awesome and super fulfilling.

I'm trying to get a better idea of what I want to do so I can (hopefully) find a summer internship closely related to that topic/area, I'm just having a lot of trouble narrowing everything down. I should mention that one potential issue is that I have pretty much no background in biology/chemistry/etc- I only realized that combining CS with something in the medical field could be a sweet combo fairly recently, and I hadn't taken much of anything in the life sciences. Only have 1 semester of college left, so it's a bit late to get into that as well


Apologies if I'm not doing a great job at explaining this stuff, every time I get into it there's just so many different fields with technical jargon and so many different options, hard to tell what's a job for a CS major vs. a biology major, and I just end up feeling more lost than when I started.

6294dp,5,2017-03-29,CMSC250 Withdrawal Advice,cmsc250throwaway,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/6294dp/cmsc250_withdrawal_advice/,"(Specific questions are bulleted below)

I think I started off on the wrong foot with CMSC250. This was the very first time I ever worked with this type of theoretical math. I think I was just very unprepared, and the introduction to the course was pretty lackluster, for me, in saying what the class was about. The lack of practice problems also threw me off quite a bit. The homeworks were always pretty confusing for me and our section's homework grader was very slow, so it was hard to tell what my answers were supposed to look like. The whole course in general was just pretty mystifying at the beginning of the semester. Looking back, I realize that I should have studied more and asked my TA's for help more, but I don't think I realized how little I really knew until I was studying for the first midterm.

I am also enrolled in MATH241, which I also struggled with at the beginning of the semester.

I think the main reason I struggled in both of these courses is the lack of time I dedicated to them, not because I found them fundamentally difficult. Especially for 250, I do not think I took it seriously enough at the beginning of the semester and didn’t dedicate enough time to studying the content.

Now that I'm further into the semester, I've started to understand the purpose of CMSC250 more and what I'm doing in the course. I have started dedicating more time to doing the readings and studying in general.

However, my grade in 250 is pretty low because I bombed the first exam. It was way below average, and way lower than I expected. During midterm review Gasarch pretty much said that if you got below a certain score (which I did) you should drop the course. My homework and quiz averages are also pretty low. To get at least a 70 to pass the class for my major, I would have to get a 70+ on both the second midterm and final, as well as bringing up my quiz and homework grades a bit. This seems doable although risky.

However, if I continue to take 250, this would inevitably give me less time for MATH241, which I also need to bring my grade up for. I am pursuing a math minor (I realize that I should really get it together with my math classes) and it would be unlikely for me to get a B- in CMSC250, which I need to get in order to exempt me from having to take MATH310.

So I am considering the possibility of withdrawing from 250, to give me more time to work on 241 as well as my other classes (216 being one of them, although I am doing well in that class) and also giving me the chance to pass 250 with at least a B- when I retake it. If I did follow through with this, I was thinking of retaking 250 over the summer.

I would still be a fulltime student (I would be taking 12 credits) if I withdrew from 250.

I am not a freshman, so I could not take advantage of freshman forgiveness.

Here are some specific questions I have about all this:

* How bad does a “W” look on a transcript? Searching on this subreddit most people seem to say it’s not a huge deal for most. I don’t intend on going to grad school.

* Is there a way for me to just be signed up for the summer 250 class and not pay until I’m certain I will retake it over the summer as opposed to next semester? It doesn’t look like this is allowed (understandably so), as these are the consequences of not paying immediately (“...you risk being canceled or withdrawn for non-payment, blocked from future registration, and financially responsible for the course”). I do not want to pay early if there’s a chance I would not take the course (for example, if I get a good internship that is incompatible with the summer class times, which leads to the next question).

* One concern I have with taking 250 over the summer, is if I have a job or internship, would I be able to schedule around the class? For example, the 250 summer class right now says it would be from 12:30pm - 2:00pm. These seems like it would be right in the middle of a normal job. I've only ever had one job that was 9-5, so I am unfamiliar with the flexibility of hours.

* How would the summer class differ from the regular class? Would there still be TA’s helping students? It’s clear that the course would progress faster, on the flip side I would have much more time to study the content.

* If, when I complete 250, I get below a B- and have to take MATH310 in the future for my math minor, would MATH310 be less difficult after already taking 250?

* This might be hard to answer, since the course has changed quite a bit over time, but traditionally, are the topics/exams more challenging as the course progresses after the first midterm? Gasarch said that the course only gets harder,  and I did not do so well on the first part of the course already I don’t think it would be a great idea to continue.

* For current students: do you have any advice for doing well on the homeworks and quizzes? I feel like some students might be working together on these, but I do not know if that is allowed or not. Jason posted a pretty ambiguous announcement on this, and I guess I should email him about it. I've just assumed that this is not allowed though. Anyways it would be nice hear some general advice for the homeworks, quizzes, and practicing in general, as I will have to pass 250 eventually.

That's pretty much it. Thank you if you read this. I will appreciate any and all advice."
629bw7,3,2017-03-29,Is it better to take interesting courses or easy classes that will guarantee me a higher GPA?,pizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzza,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/629bw7/is_it_better_to_take_interesting_courses_or_easy/,"I have the option of taking a very interesting religion class about ethics in decision making (in healthcare, business, religion, etc) that has many difficult, dense readings or a very, very easy, somewhat interesting class about Asian development of languages and cultures.

I am also taking an intro to economics course that I want to focus on and do very well in and a class about American Dramas (which is also a fairly easy class, reading a play a day).

I don't know whether I should challenge myself with an interesting, thought-provoking class that I might not do extremely well in (as I've never taken any courses on religion and am not strong in the areas the class covers) or a class that I will be guaranteed an A in.

I'm worried that my GPA will drop with later, harder classes (I'm also a computer science major/minor), so should I take easy classes now to help me in the future or a harder class? How much does your GPA matter for internships and will companies/firms judge me poorly for taking easier classes with higher medians?

629hun,2,2017-03-29,Career Advice,rr14si,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/629hun/career_advice/,"I'm currently ""stuck"" in terms of career wise at this point and looking for some advise.

Background: I've been working as a Helpdesk member in a company for the last 3 years. I am 24 and get paid pretty crappy because this was an entry IT position that I got without a degree or any certs. I've been through another internship IT job before while I was in another school. I've taken programming, networking and security classes. C Programming was very interesting to me and I did like it but I hit a wall and stopped coding a couple of years ago. I've tried getting back into programming but find it hard because I find it hard to read books (more on this below). I will be finishing my degree in Computer Information Systems very soon so I will finally have my Bachelors along with experience. I want to work on certs next but don't know what to study/learn. 

Issue 1: I don't know how to move forward? I'm bored being a Helpdesk member as it's mostly the same things over and over. It's been the same since about 6 months into the job and never really saw a change. I like being challenged and learning new things. I find it fun to not know anything about something but in the end figure it out. Usually I'm one of the people they ask to do something when the rest of the team can't figure it out. I can literally spend hours trying to figure something out and don't like stopping until it's done/completed. I'm very persistent. But I have one major flaw, I really don't learn from reading books. I try and learn to code but I just get so bored. I like being active with my hands and I learn by learning from other people. The thing is that it isn't always an option. I find it really hard to sit down, read books and learn from them. I guess I have ADD because I have a very small attention span and can't sit still long enough to read.

Issue 2: IT in general has so many different and interesting opportunities that I don't know where to poke my head into next. I like Networking, Security, Programming, Virtualization, Administration, I mean I can go on and on. I was always the type of person to be neutral about everything and never really liked ONE thing. I've always had interest in many things. I don't know how to explain it lol

Anyways I'm looking for something that will be I guess ""future"" proof. Something that will be used in the future and I can learn, somehow. Also do you guys have any tips on what helps you guys learn? Maybe some reading tips that might work for me. What do you guys recommend I start trying to learn? What are good ways to learn if you're like me and find it hard to learn by reading books. What are good certs to pursue? I mean any advice would be helpful! I'm in a tough position and just feel stuck. I don't want to feel stuck anymore feel like I'm wasting my time in a way. Also staying in this company isn't an option as I don't really like the way they handle things. 

Thanks!"

Right now I have 5 offers for internship positions, one of those positions is a paid, 4 month Co-op position. 

I have essentially accepted the Co-op position, but I am nervous about declining all of the other positions because, well, what if the Co-op cancels or retracts their offer and I'm left with nothing? 

This work experience is mandatory to graduate from my course. 

The Co-op position is for a desktop technician at a government organization.

Are my fears valid? 

Thanks"
629rdf,2,2017-03-29,Help me decide between two offers?,datimsa,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/629rdf/help_me_decide_between_two_offers/,"Hey guys,

I'm currently going to school (Sacramento) 2 hours from my home (Bay Area). I recently got two offers: a summer tax internship at a private company in the Bay Area and a government student assistant part time job in Sacramento which will be full time during the summer. The student assistant position is in their accounting department.

If I take the tax internship I will have to move back home for the summer but will still have to pay my rent in Sacramento for the all three months. If I take the student assistant job, I'll have a job until I graduate (spring 2018). But the pay is severely lower for the student assistant position. And I'm not sure if I want to stay in tax.

In the future, I want to go into public accounting after I graduate (hopefully in Sacramento) so I will be going through the recruiting process in the fall again. 

Do you think it would be more beneficial for me to take the tax internship? Or the student assistant job where I'll be doing accounting? Please let me know your thoughts, as I'm currently stuck. Thanks so much in advance!"

I have been thogether with (now ex) girlfriend been for 7 years. We started dating when i was doing my one year military service and she was already in college. We went to the same highschool but didnt knew each other. It was the first relationship for both of us so we share a lot of ""firsts"".

We have been the happiest couple for all that time, althouh most of it was a long distant (4 years college, only weekends and time off). She finished her college two years into our relationship and worked full time ever since. 

Me on the other hand been stuck in my last phase of college for the last 2 years, all i needed to finish was an 2 month internship and writeing my Thesis. I began having serious problems with my test in the last year of my regular college time. I just couldnt get myself to study no matter how hard i tryed. After a couple of failed test i bearly finished all my courses. It took me 5 month to apply for the internship and another 2 month to get it. All this time my girlfriend supported my, both mentally and financially. I always worked part time, but she was earning a lot more of course. So every vacation etc. she would spend more (on her own will) so we could have a nice time.

A year ago the internship ended and i need a prof. at the college to give me a thesis. I was in another one of those phases. It took me 1 month to make the first trip to the campus and 2 more month to get my assignment. 

In the beginning it was going ok, but right before my big lab-test i got very ill for weeks, couldnt sleep, constant pain in my stomache. After 6 weeks they found out i had an inflammation of my gallblader and need an emergancy surgery. Just 12 hours later i had internal bleeding and need another emergancy surgery. 

All in all this took 2 month where i couldnt work on my thesis. And after that i just couldnt work on in anymore. I would do something for an hour and the quit for a week. This went on till one month before the due date and i still had not written a single page. (Most of the lab-test and research was done at least) 

Back to my girlfriend, she was noticeing i had trouble and tryed to help me everywhere she could but i was really good in covering up how much trouble i had. I was alone all day doing nothing and i would try to look busy when she came home from work. She finally said we need to get this started or i would miss my due date. So we did, we worked all weekend. It was very hard for me to even write a single word. But she would push me and we got something done, with that kind of aproach we would might have been able to finish it in time. This was a week before Day X.

I need to say now that she was having a very hard time at work for the last year. She would come home ever night being in a bad mood and hateing her job. We started making plans to switch her workplace. We already took aplication pictures for her 2 weeks before day X. 

Now comes day X: My girlfriend came home late at night from a night out with some friends (nothing unusal). It was maybe 2 am but i stayed up to wait for her to go to bed. She said she couldnt breath and was having a panic attack. The next day she was a different person, everything was making her panic. In the next night she woke up, couldnt breath, we spend the night in the hospital. 

Long story short, my girlfriend is suffering from depression and anxiety. It took her a month to get help because doctors wouldnt take her serious enough. She was having panic attacks 18h a day, no matter the time. Maybe sleep 1h max at a time. 

I was with her the whole time. For a month straight i would try to watch her as much as i could. A week after it started she told me she couldnt feel any love anymore. Not for me, not for her family, for nothing. But she said i dont need to worry, we make it work when she is healthy again. I would Drive her to every hospital / doctor to get her help, while still working part time. I was getting more and more exhausted, i would sleep even less then her. 

She finally got a place in a mental health clinic when the suicide whishes came more and more. That was 3 days before my due date of my thesis. I did nothing for it since that one weekend we worked on it together. Nothing. 

I wrote my prof. and told him that my girlfriend is sick and i couldnt make the due date, he gave me another 4 weeks. 

Now i was in our home alone (we lived together for 2,5 years at this point) and stared at the walls. I would visit her as often as i could. But the longer she was in there the only thing she would talk about is that she is so worried because all her love and all her feelings are gone. She would cry the whole day.

At this point i would spend my weeks working, visiting, and doing nothing. I played video games all day to make me feel better about doing nothing but that only made me forget that i will fail my college if i will keep going like this. 
Weeks go by, she would get sad and sader, and i would do less and less. She would ask how my thesis is going and i would tell her everything goes well. 

Its now 2 weeks past my new due date and she would ask me again if my thesis is done. I couldnt answer. I was done. I gave up. The little energy i had left i spent visiting and playing video games. 

A week later she said i need to move out. 

I would talk to our friends and everybody seem to know for weeks she was worried literally sick about my future. She was blaming me for being sick. I had no idea, and she never said something like this to me.

Two weeks later with no contact in between she said its over. 
She never talked about her worries to me. She offered all the help she could give when she was still healthy and we alway managed every problem. But not this one.

This was 2 month ago. I read a lot since then, talked to my family and i have a depression for the last 2 years at least and didnt get any help. 

Now the love of my life is gone. We never had any problems exapt her worries for my future and i feel she still has feelings. She says to me the pain is to much. We might never be together again.

Just so the story is complete, i talked to my prof. and he was very understanding. Today with the help of all my friends and family i turned in my thesis.

My (ex) girlfriend is still in the hospital and gets medication now, she will be there for at least another 2 month. I moved in to my grandparents.

I still hope we can start over again when we both recover, but i feel this is just wishfull thinking.
I think about her every 5 minutes. Good days follow days of sadness.

There is a lot more to this story but the text is long enough as it is

I posted this story in /r/relationships but i feel it also belongs in here: 

I have been thogether with (now ex) girlfriend been for 7 years. We started dating when i was doing my one year military service and she was already in college. We went to the same highschool but didnt knew each other. It was the first relationship for both of us so we share a lot of ""firsts"".

We have been the happiest couple for all that time, althouh most of it was a long distant (4 years college, only weekends and time off). She finished her college two years into our relationship and worked full time ever since.

Me on the other hand been stuck in my last phase of college for the last 2 years, all i needed to finish was an 2 month internship and writeing my Thesis. I began having serious problems with my test in the last year of my regular college time. I just couldnt get myself to study no matter how hard i tryed. After a couple of failed test i bearly finished all my courses.

 It took me 5 month to apply for the internship and another 2 month to get it. All this time my girlfriend supported my, both mentally and financially. I always worked part time, but she was earning a lot more of course. So every vacation etc. she would spend more (on her own will) so we could have a nice time.

A year ago the internship ended and i need a prof. at the college to give me a thesis. I was in another one of those phases. It took me 1 month to make the first trip to the campus and 2 more month to get my assignment. I was thinking of killing myself. ( Now i know this isn't normal, back then it didnt feel wrong, it felt like the only way without pain)

In the beginning it was going ok, but right before my big lab-test i got very ill for weeks, couldnt sleep, constant pain in my stomache. After 6 weeks they found out i had an inflammation of my gallblader and need an emergancy surgery. Just 12 hours later i had internal bleeding and need another emergancy surgery.

All in all this took 2 month where i couldnt work on my thesis. And after that i just couldnt work on in anymore. I would do something for an hour and the quit for a week.

62ahlo,24,2017-03-29,Practical advice for new CS students,advphx,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/62ahlo/practical_advice_for_new_cs_students/,"I've just passed the halfway mark in the program, and I just wanted to share some lessons learned and help others survive the steep learning curve at the beginning. Many questions on here revolve around new student advice, so I figured I'd chime in. These are things I wish I had known before starting the program. As always, YMMV.

* Learn how to study for computer science. I came from a social science undergrad, and I have an MBA as well. Those degrees encourage you to jump right into assignments, whether they are papers or business cases, or even accounting and math problems. With CS, that's exactly the WRONG approach. Understand the material clearly before you start programming. And then plan out the program in very specific terms. Otherwise, you'll only succeed through trial and error. (And you'll waste countless hours doing so, while having a higher likelihood of creating bugs.)

* As a corollary to the above, recognize when you have a knowledge gap. When that happens, try to google the answer or search Stack Overflow. Then, if applicable, read the relevant documentation online. If that fails, post a question on Piazza. Then take a break. For 99% of the problems you'll run into, this sequence of events will help you get there much faster

* Be patient, and realize you will run into frustrating roadblocks. It's part of the learning process. I can't think of a way to avoid this entirely. However, minimizing this feeling is key. Use frequent breaks to keep your mind fresh and frustration low.

* You will debate about quitting at times. I started this program and was only getting B's, with a hazy understanding of what I was doing. I wondered if I had the capacity to finish the program. I struggled with pointers in particular. Now I'm doing fairly well in all my courses. My secret? During any breaks between semesters, I studied what I felt like I missed from prior courses. It has made a world of difference.

* Start interviewing before you graduate. It'll give you practice and you'll understand what employers are actually looking for. Even if you aren't planning on a pure developer role.

* Plan your semesters smartly. Pair a difficult course with a less demanding course. Some classes have the workload of 2 classes, where others are fairly light on overall workload.

* Piazza is your friend--ask for clarification from professors and help from classmates. It's such a powerful resource that I don't think every student uses well. (Which is why you see so many duplicate questions and students who are still lost on the basics by week 8 or even later).

* Don't get caught up with finding the ""best"" IDE, or the ""best"" programming language. (I totally got sucked in when I started.) There's a ton of options, and no shortage of online arguments to lead you astray. During the program, I'm moved from Vim to XCode(started with a Mac), switched to Windows and used Visual Studio, and have recently been using Sublime Text. During the program, I've used C++, C, Assembly, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, a little PHP, and some Java. Each has a purpose but learning a new language is basically the same once you have a knowledge base.

* Computer Science does not equal Programming. You will not magically become a L33T-level programmer at the end of this program. You'll need to have your own side-projects or internship experience for that to happen. That said, it shouldn't take long for you to develop those skills, but the CS degree is not enough by itself.

* If you need to vent(respectfully), this reddit is a super-duper awesome place to do so. Lots of really good people on here, and the alumni can give you some great post-school advice.

62amlq,0,2017-03-29,I figured you strangers on the internet could help me figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life.,EpicBlargh,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/62amlq/i_figured_you_strangers_on_the_internet_could/,"So, I love Game development, I love programming, I love anything with computers on more of a ""I make things for other people to enjoy and/or use for learning and improvement purposes"" rather than ""I make things for companies to like other companies and make more money""...

Which, is what I've been doing for the past two summers. I've had the privilege of working at an awesome ciivl and electrical engineering firm, making a great amount of money for an intern, but literally worsened my depression and anxiety because of how much I didn't like the work. The people were great, but sadly that doesn't make a workplace for me. It was nothing but Autodesk software, lighting analysis, and electrical plan analysis.

Also, my major is Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science so that didn't line up too well... Even though I could do it.

I just got off of medication, and I'm feeling fine, but now I'm on the homestretch of my college career. I know of the general jobs that exist, but I feel like there are so many more that I have no idea I could've done. I'm not only doing this post, I'm also going to be talking to advisors and the career development center here. It just helps to have multiple people's opinions, especially those who have the same interests as I do.

Thank you for reading this if you've gotten this far!

TL;DR: I'm a Computer Engineering Major with a minor in Computer Science, I've worked a desk job doing CAD for the past two years and I can't stand it. What should I look into that would be more along the lines of something I can actually stand for the rest of my life?"
62ammc,4,2017-03-29,Lift Kit Fabrication,TheHairlessGorilla,Jeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/62ammc/lift_kit_fabrication/,"So I'll have access to some machine tools and several welders at my internship this summer, and I figured I could make a lift kit. I've been looking at buying a short arm lift for my TJ (something like the ones from currie enterprises, not a cheap one), something like 3"". The geometry of these parts is simple enough, and I could buy whatever I can't make (heim joints, drag link, etc). If it isn't too far of a reach, I'd far rather make it than buy it.

I like the sound of heim joints, but would good bushings be a better idea? I don't really care if the ride is much bumpier than it is, my TJ is at ~90K and the suspension is worn out by now. It's a daily and needs to stay reliable, but I'd like to be able to take it out to trails more often. So, basically, what are the pros/cons of heim joints as compared to good bushings? I'm trying to get an idea of what everything will cost."
62arst,24,2017-03-29,CS Quarter Life Crisis,Super_Sand_Lesbian_1,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/62arst/cs_quarter_life_crisis/,"I'm a Second Semester Junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Starting last semester, I began doubting my abilities and interest in the field after encountering harder courses and beginning serious searching for summer internships.

I came into college wanting to go into CS and enjoyed the lower level courses that involved learning programming concepts, object oriented programming, basic machine architecture, etc. However, upper level courses, such as Automata Theory, Operating Systems, and advanced architecture, I have found uninteresting and difficult to pay attention in, which is further compounded by the general natural dislike of just sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher drone on for an hour that I have had since grade school. Other related math classes I have had a similar experience with. 

Applying and interviewing for internships has been stressful, and I am very worried about not getting one for the summer despite not really looking forward to actually doing one. I have to work in the state for 5 years after graduating as a part of a STEM scholarship I have, and I don't know if I can get a job without any relevant experience. I'm applying everywhere I can, since I'm not sure what I would even enjoy doing and just need to try everything. I have aspirations to be a game developer, but that feels too lofty and insecure to be realistic goal, at least in the near future. 

To go along with that, I hate the general culture and lifestyle that seemingly goes along with being a CS major/professional. I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but a large amount of people that I have encountered in my field are overweight, eat poorly, and spend nearly all of their time doing work or projects related to CS. A friend of mine has also expressed similar concerns, has said ""I just don't know if I can just sit in front of a computer for the rest of my life,"" and has considered switching. What he said resonated with me. I am big fan of video games and spend a lot of my lazy time sitting at a computer of TV anyway, but recently I have picked up a number of other hobbies/interests that allow me to step away from the computer, but it often feels wrong that I am doing them. I have become very interested in working out and gaining a better, healthier body, but this can't be done when I need to sit on my ass in a computer lab until midnight to work a computer project that takes an indefinite amount of time. I am living on my own in an apartment, and have really been enjoying learning to cook and make healthy and tasty recipes, but these take time and often I need fast food just to get energy so I can work on some CS homework. I play electric bass and have recently composed music for an orchestra club I help run, but I could've used that time to instead practice coding questions and brush up on my running time complexities and data structures. Fun. 

Hackathons are the pinnacle of what I find wrong with this lifestyle, yet they are talked up as being one of he most important things a CS major can do. Stay up for 24 hours drinking soda and eating junk food while stitching together random APIs for random tech and software and then present it to random company representatives, only for them to say ""Huh. Cool."" Being at hackathons just makes me uncomfortable, as I am surrounded by these overzealous people who give you funny looks for not being interested in the latest CPU of SDK at 2AM when I would much rather be sleeping. I have forced myself to go to these to have at least SOMETHING to talk about and post on my GitHub for interviews, but I never look forward to going to these things. Coding challenge competitions have been better for me, but I am still surrounded by the same kind of people.

I just don't enjoy spending all of my time doing CS related things and want to pursue my other interests. I know that achieving a balance of these things takes time and work, but I find myself getting depressed when I have to sacrifice things like a workout session in order to study for a test or do homework for these classes. 

My current Operating Systems class has pushed my over the edge. I could not care less for the subject material, I hate the professor, the programs take forever, and the guizzes and tests I take just make me angry, and I perform appropriately. I just got a pretty low test grade. My overall and major GPAs(just CS classes) are 3.38 and 3.54 respectively, and the thought of them going down infuriates me, despite my inability to truly put all of my effort into doing well in the course. I am hoping to get into the B range for this course, but it just makes me feel terrible when I see these peers talk about their seemingly flawless grades. So many professors have said ""Grades don't matter in CS,"" and yet my peers love to flaunt them. I try to make grades not be the end all be all of my self worth, and yet a bad quiz or test grade brings me to my boiling point.  I surprisingly enjoy my Data and Design Algorithms class, and I am taking a cool Multimedia Systems class, and am doing well in both, so at least I am definitely still doing well overall. But again, I don't feel like pursuing more relevant information outside of what I am learning in those courses.

I just feel all of this pressure to do so many things that I don't feel like I signed up for with this major. I enjoy the act of coding and creating working elegant programs, but I hate low level architecture as well as really high level abstract concepts. I don't even want to imagine the idea of switching majors at this point, as the reaction from my parents and the prospect of doing even more school to switch makes me depressed. I feel like I don't belong at times, but I don't even have any idea of what I would do otherwise. I am on track to graduate a semester early, but I am considering getting a minor in math to fill in that extra semester and graduate on time. I don't know if it would be better for me to graduate early or do the minor for whatever the minor would be worth in the future.

I'm just rambling at this point, thank you for reading if you did, and sorry for posting something pretty negative about CS in a sub that is generally really positive about the field. "
62ax31,6,2017-03-29,But Do You Regret It?,garganchua,WorldofTanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/62ax31/but_do_you_regret_it/,"An Open Letter to the veteran players of WOT, who have been playing a long time and still are, have recently quit, or have quit a long time ago but still come here time to time. 

While we see posts about people quitting daily, today they seemed especially striking, maybe It was because they were more well written than the usual ""wah, I quit, fuck arty, bye"". 

But in my opinion, how it was written does not matter, a great quote I saw on Monday said ""End game score cards are like children, everyone thinks theirs is special"". I think that also applies to reasons for leaving, because everyone makes these kinds of posts, and strangely, they do not seem to ever get old because of how strongly people seem to sympathize with them. So that's what I wanted to touch on  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

********See, [we are all tired of dealing with certain mechanics](http://imgur.com/LncJFpD), but .... do any of you **RAGRET** it? ***************

The time you spent playing I mean. Sure many of you will regret ever spending money, but whether you agree with it or not, that money went on to support families (~~and the moon base~~ [apparently console gets to go to Mars?](http://imgur.com/b9bN51n)). Time, however, is the most valuable resource, you Can't get more of it, but you will always spend it (wow, that sounds like a reverse riddle). The time you could have been using on a more productive hobby like a guitar, or learning to invent something, volunteering at a shelter, more time to study for tests, exams and doing homework...but instead, you decided it was more worth your time to do the mission that will help you get a certain tank for free, or  was pushed by your clan to stay an extra hour every evening 5 nights a week for clan wars, not including the required post clan wars strongholds to make back some of the money you lost from gold spamming. 

That is where your time went. If you could go back, to replace those lost hours with something more productive, would you? it dosent have to be just WOT, this is just something I think to myself at 3am at night BECAUSE i CAN'T SLEEP. But maybe its GTA, or Runescape, Maple Story, any video game you feel like took your time from you, would you, if you could, take it all back so you can re-use it? like...Groundhogs Day? Honestly, I wouldn't. Sure I hate WOT, I have said [**alot**](http://i.imgur.com/C4Oao7G.png) of shit about it, and I would NOT recommend to my worst enemy, but I think what we are all missing, is the hindsight. WOT has taught you more than just how to hold the W,S,A,D keys and use a mouse, it can teach discipline, commitment, resourcefulness, to become more frugal (I hope for some of you). Maybe I should explain furthur?

1. Discipline: General change in attitude, over the years, you are no longer some kid who was telling people that you had sexual relations with their mothers. 

2. Resourcefulness: waiting for something to be on sale, choosing a faster, more efficient way to grind a tech tree, only playing with daily doubles, making the best use of gold coins so you dont need to open your wallet, being low on ammo so you switch to HE for the RHM and arty, then switch back to regular ap. Getting in the mindset of how to best use what you have at hand. 

3. Parsimonious (paste as plain text): Wow, thanks Theasorous.com. but yes, I am talking to you Mr. ""Tank collector"", hopefully through the strength of [**I DONT NEED IT**](http://i.imgur.com/RqOPA.jpg) you have learnt to say no to spending money. You dont need a new purse, a new pair of boots, and you definitely dont need a virtual tank thats more op than all the other tanks in the game (also fuck bundles) 


4. Commitment: 

First of all, It takes a lot of time and dedication to grind up to tier 10, as many of you know, this game is designed to push bad players away by making lower tiers so disgustingly bad to play that only the strongest, most driven people would be able to pass through it, not just once, but for every single tree, that takes willpower.  Instead of free-xp-ing past tanks like the pre-buff challenger, you actually play the whole thing, from stock to elite, and dont even use gold. Difficult,  and might even bring your wn8 down (actually the expected value is so low it's an easy wn8 padder) but if you can actually go through with this, I think you became a stronger person the the next person you talked to who laughed at you for doing that and took the easy way. 


Second, if you are in a clan, It is like a second job, except, more like an internship because ever since CW 2.0 theres like no money in it.  You wont like what you are doing, and the pay is next to nothing, but you do it because you have to. Except you dont, do you? It's just a video game, you can just leave, but the longer you can push yourself to stay, the more it helps you be a more committed person, a trait women look for in men (my eyes are up here, are you still paying attention to me? or did you stop reading half way through?). I think it also builds loyalty. 


There could still be so much more that have affected you, good or bad, as a result of you having spent all this time at your computer, you never know if one of those days that you spent playing wot, in an alternative universe you got hit by a car and were paralyzed neck down. 

TL;DR: If you actually read everything I said then thats shows that you really did learn something from wot.[ Except for being resourcefulness ofcourse, do you really have nothing else to do than read this wall of text?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FTS_voK2i7E/maxresdefault.jpg)"

 Im currently looking for IT job related experience. I have been applying to IT internships and entry level helpdesk positions on Indeed for the past month and a half now. I have yet to receive an interview. So, i am getting kinda worried now. I was hoping I could land a internship or job by summer then go back to school in the fall.

Right now the only IT experience I have is from school. So I was wondering how long does it typically take for a job recruiter to email you back or call you to set up an interview? Most of these jobs are for the summer so im thinking their is still hope.

Edit: Oh I did have one job recruiter from Fannie mae email me asking for more information on IT related skills. So the kind of boosted my confidence in the beginning.

1.  Can I really get a well-paying job, (at least at the median income of $65,000, or above), with a Masters Degree in Public Health, or would I need a Masters Degree specifically in Epidemiology in order to be competitive for these jobs?  Would I need a PhD?

2.  What are the job prospects for becoming an Epidemiologist?  Will it be impossible to find a job when I graduate?  I'm reading some daunting reports on the internet that this job field is not growing very fast in the near future.  

3.  Is there normally an internship required, is it paid or unpaid, and how long is it?  I'm a full-time working adult with a Bachelor's Degree, single and not living with parents, and I'm at a loss as to how I could afford to put my life on hold to work somewhere unpaid for 6 months to a year.

These are my main concerns.  If someone already working in the field could give me some insight, it would be much appreciated!!!"

This is targeted for the BCom (formerly BAS) students in YorkU's accounting internship program: have any of you found a summer internship via York's internship program? Or have any of you found an acct/fin internship externally?

I'm asking because I'm a third year accounting BCom student and I am struggling to secure an internship spot. I secured three interviews via the internship program, but I messed them all up. I was wondering if anyone else is in the same position or had success. If you had success, do you have any tips?

Thanks in advance.

62b9j0,70,2017-03-29,I started Shonda Rhimes' Screenwriting Masterclass. What would you like to know?,chrisched,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/62b9j0/i_started_shonda_rhimes_screenwriting_masterclass/,"This subreddit has helped me out so much over the past year (when I discovered it), I figured it's time I give something back! (Or at least try)

I pre-enrolled in ""Shonda Rhimes Teaches Writing for Television"" on Masterclass and I felt like doing this post for those who are interested, enrolled or wanted to enroll but did not.

I'll be updating this post with the things I learned, assignments I did and all that within every ""lesson"" (as they are called in this class). In the meantime, hit me with any questions you have and I'll be glad to answer! Now starting the Introduction video. Will be updating the post shortly (and regularly).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LESSON 1: INTRODUCTION**

• A 4-minute video that starts off with a script being typed on screen, introducing us to the setting (living room) and our main character (SHONDA). Shonda speaks about when she first discovered she wanted to be a writer, mentioning that she can't remember a specific time but she always knew she wanted to be a storyteller.

• I love that this is then cut to scripts of GREY'S ANATOMY and SCANDAL with Meredith and Olivia talking voice-over, respectively. The famous GREY'S music from the early seasons plays in the background, followed by Scandal's.

• Not much after that. We finally see Shonda sitting in a living room, talking about how awesome it feels to make money from writing. She says she wants to ""pass on"" everything she's learned, especially show-running because that's not something she was taught. [Off to lesson 2!]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LESSON 2: TEACH YOURSELF TV WRITING**

• Scene 1: TV vs Film. Shonda talks about some difference between the two mediums, particularly how the creative control is within the writer's hand in TV as opposed to it being with the director in Film.

• Scene 2: Read the news to learn storytelling. Shonda recommends reading a newspaper every day and reading or watching the news. Her personal favorites: Atlantic Monthly, NY Times, and Washington Post.

• Scene 3: Know your television. Shonda recommends watching old shows to know more about the history of television. She talks about The Wire and The West Wing, particularly the latter. In the PDF attached at the end of the 11-minute video, she lists some of her favorite shows: The Crown, Breaking Bad, St. Elsewhere, Game of Thrones and The West Wing.

• Scene 4: Read and dissect scripts. Nothing new so far, to be honest. Read pilot scripts. Watch pilots. Read BAD pilot scripts. Watch those too. See what doesn't work. She loves The West Wing a lot, particularly the dialogue. She says ""be original"" in dialogue and it's important to be smarter than the audience and to show that through your characters' dialogue.

• Scene 5: There are no more rules. Again, nothing groundbreaking. She says learn the difference between a procedural and a serialized show. The Hub (community where enrolled students discuss each lesson) is filled with some cool stories and it shows how excited people are for this class. I'll try to talk about those more in the future.

*I'll be more brief in future lessons because I don't want to waste anyone's time with stuff we basically already know. Here's hoping we all learn something from this!*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LESSON 3: FINDING AN IDEA**

• Things are picking up - this was better than the first two. We don't learn anything new (again) but I got a sense of how Shonda thinks. You can really tell she's a very creative person just by the way she talks and how passionate she is about storytelling. As someone who is currently struggling to find an idea (haven't written a word in 2 weeks now), I kind of needed this encouraging lesson.

• Scene 1: Your ideas should come from everywhere. Could be from a conversation, a fight you overheard while waiting in line to get coffee or from the obituaries.

• Scene 2: Have a place to keep your ideas. Keep a journal so you have something to write in if you get an idea in the middle of the night. She says that ""gladiators in a suit"" came from a note she left on her phone one day.

• Scene 3: TV ideas don't have endings. Now this was kind of interesting and I didn't necessarily agree with all of it. She says that if you can easily picture your character's journey or your story with an ending, then maybe it's best fit for film because you shouldn't have a conclusion for a TV show ready from the start. It's debatable, for sure, but she makes it more convincing later on as she discusses that ideas should be the basis for a healthy, long lasting TV show. Sidenote: Washington-based ""fixer"" Judy Smith was the inspiration behind Olivia Pope. Interesting.

• Scene 4: Good ideas are sticky. ""I know an idea is something real when it's like a song you can't get out of your head"". Tell people your ideas. Listen to their comments and pay attention to their questions.

• Scene 5: Ensure your idea is original. Write compelling main characters with compelling dilemmas (okay, Shonda). Don't be safe with your ideas but also don't come at it with that thought/intention in mind ""oh I wanna be creative, I wanna be different"". That's being bold for bold's sake.

• Scene 6: Consider your idea in the real world. Think of where we are (as a country) politically, where we are in the news to see if it's okay to write this show. Example: Scandal is a cynical show about metaphorical monsters which came at a ""Yes"" time when Obama was in the White House - it was an optimistic time, so Scandal was an entertaining yet acceptable escape. The West Wing, however, came at a more pessimistic time. (Thank God no Trump mention...yet).

• Scene 7: Know what the marketplace is looking for. As a writer, she likes having ""assignments"" or certain things to write about, it's a nice creative challenge. Before she wrote Grey's, she asked ""what does Bob Iger (Disney) want?"". She found out he wants a medical show, and she had an interest in surgeries so she wrote Grey's.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LESSON 4: DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT**

• My least favorite lesson so far. Everything taught in this 12-minute video is something you should already know WAY before you even start writing your own script (my personal opinion).

• Scene 1: An idea vs premise. She explains the major difference between these two, particularly how a premise is more detailed and specific than the former.

• Scene 2: Let the story inform the structure. Start with the characters. Let them drive the show and the story for you. Once you have an understanding of the characters and their journeys, finding a structure should be easier.

• Scene 3: Decide the tone of your show. Pretty self explanatory. She talks about Grey's having a lighter tone, especially in season 1 while Scandal being more dark and serious.

• Scene 4: Be thoughtful with your story bible. Attached with the video is a downloadable PDF of the Grey's Anatomy bible (which I have not read yet). It's 19 pages and probably the most helpful thing about this class so far (not sure if it's available on the internet). If anyone wants it, just PM me and I'll gladly send it over. She does mention to write a very detailed bible because once your show is picked up, you have very little time to be creative and think of ideas.

• Scene 5: Don't get hung up on titles or names. Shonda says she is terrible with names. She wanted to name Scandal ""Damage Control"". What is more important is being able to tell a good story. Character names will have to go through ""legal clearance"" (huh?) so don't get too obsessed or attached to yours, just in case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**LESSON 5: RESEARCHING YOUR STORY**

• This was a very compelling 16-minute video. While I'm not really learning anything new about the craft exactly, it's still very interesting to watch Shonda talk about her characters and her world and how it all came together for her.

• Scene 1: Start with the basic resources. The best way to bring your story to life, she says, is to do effective research. You need details to realistically portray a profession (medicine in Grey's case). The library is a great space to find what you need.

• Scene 2: Talk to people to gain invaluable details. I loved this one because she goes into detail about how she interviewed a surgical resident for hours to get a better understanding of how their lives work. Interns actually doing sutures on bananas, finding a safe space to hide (the basement in Grey's early seasons), having an intern help an attending on a surgery on day one (007)...it all helps understanding these characters' world. 

• Scene 3: Let your subject talk. Again, just let the world speak for itself. Leave your preconceptions about a profession out the door before researching.

• Scene 4: Take notes, but remember to listen. Interviewing actual people to get a better understanding of their profession is essential. Either record the conversation or take notes while the person speaks. Even better: take notes right after the conversation is over too.

• Scene 5: Case study: Grey's Anatomy. The resident she interviewed told her about an intern who screwed up on their first day (O'Malley!). She had to research how to do an appendectomy so she could make George screw up. It wasn't about a certain step that he skipped, it was about Burke needing to humiliate an intern on day one (never thought about it that way). The OR gallery was also eye-opening for Shonda, it gave her tons of material to write about. (Sidenote: Derek/Patrick Dempsey hasn't been mentioned even once so far!)

• Scene 6: Case study: Scandal. She was supposed to have a 15-minute interview with Judy Smith (the inspiration behind Olivia) but it went on for 4 hours. She found it intriguing that googling her right after the interview gave her VERY FEW results and only half-a-picture. She liked that, obviously.

• People in The Hub (comments section) mentioned a quote that she said, which I really loved too. ""A lot of people are stopped by the idea of perfection"".

*Edit: Soooo I'm gonna be taking this class more seriously now (aka actually going with the recommended schedule and doing the assignments and all since I got 2 very unpleasant PMs). Will be updating at a much slower pace now, then.*

*Edit 2: If anyone wants to work on the assignments as well, the one I'm starting off with is to come up with 10 ideas that could potentially be great for a TV series. Then, we will choose just one or two in a few days and move along with those for the rest of the course's duration.*"
62bbqg,3,2017-03-29,How much do companies take into account personality and social skills?,cab4444,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62bbqg/how_much_do_companies_take_into_account/,"I'm currently a freshman on a computer science/engineering track. I know it's early for these kinds of questions, but I was hoping I could hear from a couple people with a little more experience. I'm thinking about doing an internship after my sophomore year, and interviewing is on my mind a little bit. So, how much do interviewers care about things like likability? I guess my concerns are that I'm not a super genius or some kind of power robot that can pump out code like nothing, but does having people skills give someone an edge?"
62bhus,1,2017-03-29,When to apply for a Job,mackey88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62bhus/when_to_apply_for_a_job/,"I am currently finishing up my BS in CS from Oregon State's Online program. I am also in the military and have a security clearance. I am debating right now between getting out or staying in. My current job in the military has nothing to do with CS and I have no internships. Basically going to be a inexperienced new grad.

The issue is, I have to resign my commission 6 months before I would get out of the military which means in order to know what I can expect for a job I would need an of offer 6 months before starting to work. I know 1-3 month out is typical but that doesn't help me much here.

Maybe it is cocky but I am pretty sure I would be able to get a job however my concern is the location and pay. Right now live in a fairly low cost of living area and make around 90k. In order to make the best decision I feel like not knowing what offers I could get limits my ability to fully weigh my options.

So after all my ramblings, is it reasonable to apply for a job 7ish months out, or what is reasonable? Would the security clearance impact how far out I could get an offer? Any recommendations about transitoning from another career field or the military into CS?"
62bm1t,7,2017-03-29,"[PI] The Gray Imitation - FirstChapter - 4,377",zerf216,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/62bm1t/pi_the_gray_imitation_firstchapter_4377/,"I walked out of the room. The door whispered over the carpet as it closed, a sigh of relief upon my departure. My neck felt strangely liberated as it twisted and turned. No one occupied the wide hallway besides myself. The soft pat of the hard shoes on my feet made the only noise. I scratched at my neck in irritation. It seemed exposed and vulnerable.
	“Tie,” I muttered. My hands groped for the slim fabric, but they only brushed coarse hair and bare skin. “Shit.”
	I looked at the entrance to the room I had just exited. My open hand hovered inches from the embossed knob. It was golden and looked very hard. It was hard, and it was cold. But it did not turn. I knocked on the door quietly, just below the blunt numbers. They read two hundred and one.
	“Joanne,” I said. I barely heard my own voice. “Joanne.” I reached into my pocket. My wallet was a faded and crumbling black and my tie bled a deep purple. They did not match but it seemed that they were together. “Fucking whore. Joanne!” I flinched at the noise my fist created and at the fury in my voice and at the violent melody echoing in the hallway. “Joanne!”
	Relenting, I pulled up my shirtsleeve to check the time. I stared at my small wrist and pulled down my sleeve. The hallway was illuminated with artificial light that dizzied me as I walked the length of it twice. Then the click and squeak of a door covered the padding of my pacing and I moved toward it.
	“Joanne,” I said.
	The child’s eyes were very wide in her narrow face. The darkness of her thin hand on the door struck me.
	“Why are you making so much noise?”
	I stared at her. “She has my wallet.”
	“Who are you talking to? Why is the door open?”
	The demanding voice was followed by a man emerging from the shadow beyond the girl. He looked at me and stepped in front of her. “Get back to bed.” Her wide eyes jumped to him, but her hand lingered on the door. “Back to bed.” He put a hand on her shoulder and sent her into the dark interior of the room.
	“She shouldn’t be opening doors for strangers,” I said.
	“You’re coked up aren’t you?” he said. “And drunk too. Come by this door again and I’ll knock your teeth out.”
	I nodded. “Yeah.”
	The door slammed. I stood there staring at it. I looked for cracks or blemishes but it appeared unmarked. I laid the palm of my hand flat against it. It looked like the other doors in the hallway. My hand slid off it.
	I went to go knock on my door again, but as I raised my fist, I realized I didn’t know if it was mine or not. I looked around hesitantly. The door looked unfamiliar. They all did though and I couldn’t remember if I had left that family’s threshold or not. The man frightened me, and I didn’t want my teeth knocked out. I imagined Joanne watching me through every peephole I passed. I listened for mocking laughter and only heard my footsteps.
	“Hi,” I said to the woman at the front desk.
	She looked up. Her jaws churned, the sound of teeth grinding on rubber. “What do you need.”
	The woman’s voice was hostile. I squinted at her. She shouldn’t be antagonizing me. Yet her eyes hadn’t left the small screen they were intent upon, and her voice left me wary of bothering her. I recalled somebody threatening to tear my eyes out a few minutes before. I took a step back.
	“Hey, do you want something or not?” she said.
	The irritation in her voice stopped me. “Yes.”
	“Well,” she said after a few seconds. “What do you want?”
	I thought. “My wallet.”
	She stared at me. “I don’t have your wallet.” She set her phone down in a slow motion. “Look, I don’t like the vibe you’re giving me. Do you need something or not?”
	“It’s in my room. And I don’t have the key. It’s in there too. And Joanne won’t let me in.” I said this very quick because it had darted in front of me and I had caught it and needed to release it quickly to use it.
	“Oh,” she said drawing out the word and clacking her teeth. “You’re the one with the prostitute that came in earlier. Josh told me about that before he left.” She chuckled. “Bill would be pissed if he knew Josh let some whore in here. Josh said you tipped him big though.”
	“Yeah,” I said. “He had blonde hair.”
	“Yeah, that’s Josh.” She turned to the idle computer. “What’s your name? I’ll give you another key.”
	“Gray,” I said. “Dorian Gray.”
	I heard the sharp impact of finger striking keyboard. “Dorian Gray, Dorian Gray. I don’t see a Dorian Gray on here.”
	“Sorry,” I said. “That’s not my name.” I frowned, shaking my head. “I don’t know why I said that.” I raised my hand and ran it over my face. The skin was smooth except for where sharp hairs dragged against my probe.
	“Then what’s your name?” she asked. She sounded extremely annoyed.
	“Sorry,” I said. “My name is John Ney. John D. Ney.”
	She cocked her head. “John D.? Did you say John D. Ney?”
	“Yes,” I said. I wondered if that was the wrong name too.
	She scrutinized me and her eyebrows raised. “Holy shit! You’re that John D. from that big newspaper!” She sounded very excited and I tried to manage a smile. It must not have been very successful because her grin faded and the light in her eyes dimmed. “Wow. Um. Lemme get your key.”
	She stood so quickly her chair rolled back and she stumbled over it. Her back was to me as she opened a box and rifled through it. A burnished and battered key lay in her hand as she proffered it to me. I raised my gaze from it and noticed she was looking past me. I turned my head but there was nothing there. When I looked back her eyes were looking down at the surface of the desk between us.
	I took the key and walked to where my room was. Two hundred and one, I recited before checking the dangling tag. My head was clearing. I felt dread at the prospect.
	“Hey.” Her voice stopped me. “You’re not actually in there with a prostitute, are you?”
	I turned and retraced my steps to the desk. I set the key on the desk and looked her in the eyes. The tenuous hope in her voice aggravated me and I returned the barb she had pierced me with.
	“I was in there with three. The other two came in through the window. And I’m high on coke and drunk on shit liquor.”
	The lack of cold as I stepped outside surprised me. Instead, an oppressive heat smothered me. I stripped off my shirt, casting it to the ground as I advanced down the street. There was no breeze to cool the fire burning in my chest, and the dry air only stoked it. I needed to drown the flames with alcohol and suffocate it with hard drugs. I gnashed my teeth and locked my fingers together and tossed my head. No store would be open this late. The light from the streetlamps made little pools of light. I was approaching one and I altered my path to move around it. I reached for my phone. Then I remembered I hadn’t had a phone in three years. They distracted me too much from my writing. I liked to write with pen and paper. But I struggled to put the pen to paper, and when I did it moved too slowly and I didn’t like the way the letters looked. I resigned myself to typing because for some reason my thoughts looked better on a screen than on paper. Yet typing on a computer allowed the desire for distraction to flourish and my screen displayed things other than my word processor. I would play music on my phone to create an environment of art and creation. But that was just an excuse to bring my phone and then I would be on my phone instead of writing. So I made the decision to abandon my phone to limit potential diversions. My writing quality and quantity had improved after that decision. Betsy had been very impressed.
	My hand found my phone in my pocket, and I stopped. My fingers ran over smooth plastic. I pulled it out and turned it on. The lock screen showed I had six missed calls. There was a text message that read “where r u? tomorrow is”. I didn’t feel like opening my phone to read the rest of the message. I didn’t feel like reading the message at all.
	The phone clattered against the pavement and groaned under the heel of my shoe. “I don’t need a fucking phone,” I muttered. “Damn things are a nuisance. A fucking pestilence. A goddamn depressant.” A car passed. “Ten million words and I cannot use them.”
	I continued down the street, avoiding the bright pools and staying close to the fronts of buildings. My feet began to ache in the tight dress shoes. I stooped and unlaced the shoes. Rising, I kicked off my right shoe in a fluid motion. My left presented more of a difficulty. I sprawled to the ground several times before I grumbled my surrender and limped on.
	The sudden brightness to my right startled me. I peered through the window. There were rows and rows of products ranging from chips and candy to novelty items. I spotted a foam shape that resembled a state—I couldn’t recall which one. Refrigerators lined one wall.
	I pushed open the door, looking up at the ringing bell. The attendant looked at me with some intensity. I nodded at him and wandered to the candy aisle. I picked up a chocolate bar then set it down. I moved to the liquor area. It was pitifully small.
	“And a pack of those cigarettes.” I pointed because the writing was too small for me to make out and I’ve never stuck to one brand.
	He looked at the case of beer on the counter and then over his shoulder at the cigarettes I was pointing at. With a glance at me, he retrieved them and placed the package on top of the beer case.
	“Total will be thirty dollars.”
	I shook my head. “Thirty? They’re really raising the prices. Used to be a man could grab a pack for a dollar.”
	“A dollar?” he exclaimed. “They were maybe three that I remember and I’m at least twenty years older than you!”
	“They were sometime, though,” I said with a shrug. “A dollar, I mean.”
	“Time was you could puff a smoke in peace, too,” he said. “Now you have to skulk like some criminal or you’ll have people giving you dirty looks. Like smoking a cig’s some crime. Huh.” He shook his head. “World’s goin to hell. When you got teenagers—kids that can’t even grow any hair on their face—telling you that you’re ‘polluting the environment’ or some shit, like I’m a goddamn rapist screwing Mother Earth or something. The kids are the worst. The adults, they might not like it but they know enough to respect a man’s own business is a man’s own business. These kids though, they’re just trying to make a name for themselves, butt in where they’re not wanted. Think they know everything because they went to some smart-ass school. Well, I went to college too. Dropped out after the first year though. Waste of time and money. Nothing I can learn there that I can’t learn somewhere else.”
	I nodded. “Well said.”
	He squinted. “Look past the fact that you don’t got a shirt on and I might think you went to some fancy college too.”
“What do you mean?”
There was a slight movement around his eyes, and I realized my voice had had an edge to
it. 
“Just that you talk like it, is all,” he said. “Now, thirty dollars, please.”
	“I’m sorry,” I said. “I don’t have thirty bucks. I don’t even have one.”
	He stared at me incredulously. “Then what the hell are you doing yammering at me for?”
	I thought for a moment. “Lonely, I suppose.”
	“Go be lonely somewhere else,” he responded pointing at the door. “Don’t want no loiterers around here.”
	“Will do,” I said.
	I looked over my shoulder as the bell rang. Two men entered. They walked toward the counter with a very distinctive walk, an arrogant and tense saunter that advertised their intentions as thoroughly as the guns in their hands did. They weren’t wearing masks though. And then I realized the implications of that.
	The muzzles had begun to level when I barreled past them and out the door. I heard the crack of gunfire and the shattering of glass and the raised voices of those engaged in violence. Their car was still running and I flowed to it. The passenger door flew open under my persuasive touch, and I scrambled in. 
	“What the hell?” the man in the driver seat shouted.
	My head rebounded against the window. The door swung open. I tumbled out. Loud pops resounded in my ear. I heard a screech of metal behind me and then there was a cascade of explosive noise from all directions. The air above me hissed and snarled and the car I had just exited shrieked with pain.
	I escaped all of it on my hands and knees. My right hand slapped the rough concrete. The left followed it, skin stinging. Then my legs dragged themselves forward. And my right hand would extend and then my left and I crawled and pulled myself away from the loud conflict, away from it all. My breath exited in great heaving gasps. Every inch I covered added to the distance, but as the inches accumulated into feet I expected to hear the stomping of footsteps and angry shouts and the roaring of rifles. The void was closer than when I purposefully taunted it—dousing myself in depressants and dullness. Now it stood in front of me, a great blackness, stepping backwards as I crawled toward it, moving more slowly the farther I advanced. And then it flashed red and blue and my fingers brushed its thick boot.
	“Hey! Hey! Reynolds! We got a guy shot over here!”
	The shoe retreated out of my reach, replaced by a thick knee. “Hey, stay with me. Reynolds! He’s got it pretty bad! Blood all over him!”
	“Not mine,” I said or thought. “Blood’s not mine.”
	The man kneeling in front of me kept yelling for Reynolds. He touched my shoulder and rambled assurances that I would be all right, that I had nothing to worry about. His hands searched my body, flitting over my chest and abdomen with a buzzing desperation that left scratches and red welts.
	“Leave me alone,” I said. “Let me die.”
	“You’re gonna be all right. Just hang on. Reynolds! Reynolds!”
	I heard a grinding crackle and a jumbled and excited voice. The popping resumed in the distance.
	“Shit,” the cop said. “Shit. You just hold on, you hear me? I’ll be right back.”
	He stood up and rushed off. The sound of his boots on the pavement got softer the farther he went. After a while I couldn’t hear them anymore. The gunshots got louder and more frequent.
	I rolled over onto my back. I put my hands on my bare chest and lifted them to my face. I couldn’t see anything, but they felt very wet. Pain stung my torso, but it was a superficial feeling. Nothing wracked me with deep agony. Though I’d never been shot before, so maybe I was just in shock and incapable of feeling anything. 
	With a groan, I lifted myself to my feet. My hands burned and my chest felt poked full of needles. I walked in the direction the cop had rushed to, the one loose shoe destabilizing the rhythm of my pace and giving me a shambling limp. I hoped the man who had shouted for Reynolds was all right. I ambled faster. The echoes of the gunshots had stopped a few minutes back. 
The consequences of them remained though. A man was kneeling over a body much as I imagined the cop had stooped over mine. Except as I got closer, I realized that the prostrate man was motionless. Only his dark boots at the ends of his thick legs were visible behind the weeping man.
	“He died saving me,” the man said as he heard my approach. His eyes were wet and his cheeks were lined with smudged teardrops. “They had me pinned down and he charged in and saved my life.”
	I walked past Reynolds and around the prone form of the dead cop. The bell rang cheerily as I entered the store. The attendant was not behind the counter. The case of beer I had selected was shoved to one side to make way for the jutting drawer of the cash register. I didn’t see my cigarettes. The cash drawer was empty. The floor behind the counter was not. I tore open the case and grabbed two beers. I ripped the bell off its perch before I walked back out.
	Reynolds was still cradling his partner’s body. I sat down, back against the hard wall of the convenience store. When I popped open the first beer Reynold’s head snapped up. He looked at me. I took a long sip of the still cold drink. He looked at me for a little while longer then bowed his head. The thought of offering him the second had crossed my mind, but a man shouldn’t run away from his emotion. Especially not grief. I tilted my head back and took a longer drink.
	It was strangely quiet. The shallow breaths of Reynolds. The contemplative gulps of my throat. It would have been the best part of my day if not for the death.
	The wailing of sirens shattered the silence. They sounded far way, but they grew louder every second. It was always an odd feeling, listening to the vehicles shriek their impatience as they hurtled toward you. They were like a clock without the second hand. Their arrival was preordained, but the speed varied. I had never liked the feeling. It reminded me of sitting in class and the couple of times I had messed up so badly and they were required to clean up my mess. I did not envy them their jobs, always racing toward chaos and sorrow. I couldn’t hear the click of the second beer opening.
	Only one police vehicle pulled over to the side of the road. A few minutes passed of me watching it and sloshing the warm beer around in the can. Reynolds was also observing the squad car, his head craned over his shoulder in what looked to be a very uncomfortable position. I noticed a body, illuminated by the squad car’s bright lights, lying haphazardly near the street. It was near where the getaway car had been idling. The blood was a dark stain around the body.
	The slam of a car door jerked my attention back to the police car and a fat man came hustling over to Reynolds.
	“Reynolds,” he called. Reynolds had turned back to the body. “What the hell happened here?”
	“Jimmy’s dead,” Reynolds said. “I was pinned down and he saved my life. The bastards killed him.”
	The fat man stood a few feet away from Reynolds, apparently unsure how to proceed. His mouth opened and closed a few times and he rubbed his left arm vigorously.
	“Jesus Christ,” I said. The new arrival jumped and looked around wildly until he placed me. His hand groped for his holster. “The varsity on vacation or something? Where’s the fucking cavalry? We got three dead here.”
	“Who the hell are you?” he said, his hand relaxing. “And three dead? God almighty. Are you all right? You’re covered in blood!”
	“I’m fine,” I responded. “But he’s not. And what is this shit, we’ve a dead cop and civilian and they send you.”
	“Dead civilian,” he said. He looked around. “Is that him over there?”
	“No, that’d be one of the dead gangbangers who shot this place up.” I jerked my head backward. It grazed the brick wall and fire blazed along the impacted area. “The fucking attendant. You don’t see him anywhere, do you?”
	He moved as if to go into the store. He stopped. “I’m gonna radio and get an ambulance over here.”
	“Good idea,” I said to his retreating back. “Maybe they’ll send over the fucking interns and a blind driver! Wouldn’t surprise me. Not one fucking bit.” I threw the bell after him. It rattled as it hit the ground. “Reynolds. Get away from him and do something. Your friend’s dead. He ran in like an idiot and got himself killed. He’s not a hero, he’s a dumbass. No wonder this state’s going to hell. Cops can’t even handle the goddamn chaff. How the hell are they supposed to stop the drug lords setting up shop here?” I received a baleful look from Reynolds, and then his lip quivered and he began to sob in earnest. “Unfuckingbelievable.” I put the can to my lips, but it was devoid of any liquid. I threw it at Reynolds. It flew over his shoulder.
	The fat cop came back. He looked at Reynolds and then at me. “I radioed them,” he said. “Local hospital will be sending us an ambulance. Won’t be seeing any backup though. Lot of activity tonight.”
“On a Wednesday night,” I said. “I can’t imagine how you manage on the weekends.” 
He frowned. “It’s Friday night. Or Saturday morning now.” He kicked the ground. “It’s the damn Mexicans coming over the border. All the drug dealers and illegals coming over here to flood us with drugs. If the government would’ve finished that wall we wouldn’t be having this problem.”
“Yeah, the lack of a wall’s the problem,” I said. “Those Mexicans would just stare at it and turn right back. Damn gringos, too smart for us.” I snorted. “A wall only exacerbates the deeper issue. You want to piss them off? Go ahead and build your wall.”
	“And who are you to know anything?” he retorted. “You probably get your meals at the soup kitchen where my wife works at. I bet you don’t even have a job.”
	“Who am I,” I said. “Who am I. Quien soy? Yo soy mexicano, tu gringo estupido. I know more about Mexico than you and your whole precinct together. My dissertation on illegal immigration has been on your senator’s desk. Do you even know who your senator is?”
	“Watch your mouth,” he warned. He put his hand on the butt of his gun, making sure I registered the movement. “I’m a cop of the United States of America and you’ll watch your mouth.”
	“Real smart,” I said. “Shoot me and you’ve got two dead civilians and a dead cop. The media’s already going to rip you idiots a new one for this fiasco.”
	“Just shut up,” Reynolds said. We looked at him. “Three people are dead and you two stand there arguing about stuff that doesn’t matter. Jimmy’s dead, and you two bicker about a wall. Go to hell, the both of you.”
	“Ah, Reynolds,” the fat cop said. “I’m sorry.” He clasped his hands and looked at them. “Three dead. Dear God.”
	“God’s got nothing to do with it,” I muttered, but I said it too softly for them to hear.
	We sat in silence until the bawling of the ambulance drifted through the street. It settled in front of the police vehicle and two men exited. They sprinted over to our small group.
	“Three dead,” the fat cop informed them. He pointed out the dead gangbanger. “And then the guy behind the counter in there.”
	“What about them?” One pointed at Reynolds and me.
	“I scraped myself up pretty badly,” I said. “He’s going to need some attention.” I patted my head. “Just watched his friend die.”
	“I’m fine,” Reynolds said. He rose to his feet. “I’ll wait here for the clean-up crew.” He looked at his friend’s corpse then walked into the convenience store.
	The two responders glanced at each other and then turned their gaze toward me. “We’ll take you to the ER. You don’t look too good at all.”
	“As you will.” I stood, wincing at the general pain and followed them to the ambulance.
	I sat down on the edge of the bed. The vehicle rumbled to a start and moved into the street at a subdued pace. Rubbing my aching head, I closed my eyes and rested my face between my elbows.
	“What happened there, anyway?”
	“Nothing good,” I said through my arms.
	He didn’t press me any further. I was thankful for that. My head was throbbing from the abrasion and my hangover, and I was coming off a cocaine fueled high. The thoughts floating in my concussed head were not lucid, but they were transparent enough that I could not pretend to ignore them any longer. They laid claim to my consciousness like little parasites, gripping and grasping for my attention. They demanded my immediate examination and interpretation, reflection and subsequent action. I felt faculties of logic and morality surface like rocks under a receding tide. I sensed reproach; I could inundate them in intoxicants, I could batter at them until they were as dull as butter knives. But they would always regain their former potency and I could not flee them. Only death held sanctuary for me, and my mind knew I was not quite ready to start that contest. I played a dangerous game of chicken with myself, and I always seemed to lose.

62bndr,31,2017-03-29,Graduated - My Journey,AJmtnsWA,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/62bndr/graduated_my_journey/,"I completed the program (yay!) so I thought I'd share my personal journey through it and finding a new job. I started Winter 2015 and took 2.25 years (9 quarters straight) to complete it.    

###Background    

Throughout the entire program I worked full time as an engineer, 40+ hours per week plus 1 - 2 hours of commute time per day. I am married with a very understanding/patient spouse and no kids. My social life became more nonexistent as the program went on. I finished my first degree 6.5 years before starting this program and it was in aerospace engineering. I had some exposure to programming during this degree using Matlab and Fortran, so I was comfortable with the very basic concepts but nothing object oriented. I’m not going to talk about my admission process because it sounds much different than it currently is.    

###Schedule    

Here is the schedule of classes I took, my estimated average time commitment for each per week, general balance of workload throughout the quarter, and the drop rate that I kept track of (I &lt;3 data). 

|Class  |  Term   |   Hrs/Week  |  Workload  |  Dropped|
|:-----:|:---------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
|161   |   Win15 |   20  |    Consistent  |   23%  |
|162   |   Spr15 |   25  |    Consistent  |   27%   |
|225   |   Spr15 |   10    |    Consistent   |    31%    | 
|261   |   Sum15|  15 - 20   |   Consistent   |   10%   |
|290   |   Fall15  |  15 - 20  |    Heavy last 2 weeks  |    9%  |
|340   |   Fall15  |  5  |    Heavy last 3 weeks   |    4%  |
|271   |   Win16 |   15 - 20  |    Slightly lighter at end   |   1%  |
|352   |   Win16  |  5 - 10  |    Consistent  |   12%  |
|325   |   Spr16  |  20 - 25  |    Little lighter second half  |   10%  |
|361   |   Spr16  |   3    |    Heavy last 3 weeks (15hrs)   |    0%  |
|344   |   Sum16 |  15 - 20   |    Consistent   |     6.5%  |
|362*   |   Fall16 |  5 - 10   |    Consistent   |     17%  |
|496   |   Fall16 |  20   |    Little lighter second half   |     10%  |
|372   |   Win17 |  15   |    Consistent   |     2.8%  |
|467   |   Win17 |  15   |    Consistent   |    1.3%  |    

*362 was java based this quarter    

###Resume Building    

During 290 I decided to do a side project and recreated the game I had made for my final project in 162 as a web based application. This was all I had before searching for internships.     

Throughout the first 2/3’s of 2016 I also worked on another personal website that has an in-depth search feature for what’s basically a blog. It utilized a NoSQL db through Firebase. Nothing spectacular, but it gave me something to talk about in phone screens and interviews. I was passionate about my project and I think that made it easier to express that passion/excitement in interviews too.    

I did a hackathon at the beginning of spring quarter 2016. It was a great experience and I encourage everyone to participate in one if you have any interest, don’t let perceived abilities/experience hold you back. You’ll be able to contribute something and you’ll learn a lot, and hopefully have fun.    

Last, for my full time job search, I think the biggest resume boost I had was my internship. Certainly talked about that experience in my interviews.    

###Job Search    

I live in Seattle so all of my job searches were solely in the Seattle area. I feel pretty grateful to have landed some opportunities. My advice: be persistent and apply to everything that you can.    

I applied for internships fall 2015 so I had completed 161/162/225/261 and was in the process of 290/340, which I completed in time for the actual interviews. Having 290 really helped for my interview as it was project based. The numbers: I submitted 24 applications to 17 companies. I got 2 interviews and 1 offer. I interned summer 2016.    

I planned to graduate winter quarter 2017 so I applied for full time jobs August 2016 through November 2016. I read most of CTCI and did a handful of problems on leetcode in preparation. Admittedly I would have liked to do more problems but I just didn’t have the time outside of work and two classes. I also started reading /r/cscareerquestions. It helped give me an idea of some interview processes and hear about others’ experiences. The numbers: I submitted 25 applications to 18 companies. I got 5 online coding challenges, 3 phone screens, 1 virtual interview, 1 onsite interview, and 3 offers (one was from my internship). Note, not every company followed the entire process of online challenge to phone screen to interview.     


Thanks for reading this far. I'll do my best to answer questions and good luck to everyone!"

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

Stupid Garcias, always coming up in my town. I met a Garcia once. No, I didn’t, that was a lie. Tricked you, you punk. Don’t put that in, intern. I know you like to write down stuff I tell you not to write down because it’s “funny”. You know what’s funny? My foot in your ass, you two-bit punk.

#The Singles Rankings (feat. “Big Bad” Barry Coronado)

1. **Maverick (WC)** - Damn Pibbster’s gonna run wild, unfortunately he got beaten by a girl. Damn birds. Always breaking into people’s houses and claiming things happened without their consent. There was no proof, damn it! No proof, I tell ya! She didn’t tell me she was twenty-three, she said she was sixteen! Actually, scratch that last part, intern. I’d put him down a rank, but then I’d have to put a Canadian on top. 

2. **Dalidus Nova (UIC)** - He’s had to face the numbers game all month as he fights off the Unoriginals from his title. That’s something you can respect, having to fight off three sides at once. He’s a modern day Nazi Germany and that’s something I respect.

3. The Mark Dutch - The Swede’s used some gecko to get a better shot at the title. Now, I’m all for using people to get a better advantage to get championships, but an Italian doing it? Now that’s downright villainous. 

14. Andrade Allegra - Sanchez’s used his gang tactic to gain the advantage on Dalidus Nova. After he stole the title shot from my boy. Grumble. Now, that’s some classic strategy, but when this fool’s done it I’m against it.

25. Jack Anchor - Anchor’s the comeback kid. He recruited the top boy of the Strays to be his personal man-buddy. He’s been causing chaos all ‘round these parts, kidnapping a woman to sell to Abu Dhabi Do. Now, I’m not against the Flintstones, but there are dinosaurs there. That’s dangerous.

2.  Los Unoriginals de Violated Copyrighto - They’re everywhere. They’re like sand. They’re rough and they’re coarse and they get everywhere. I think we should ban these fools from the titles, they’ll just ruin the prestige of ‘em. Wait, Gen Mex had them? Yeah, they can have a shot at it.

3. H.E.R.O. - These kids are trying to fight off that dastardly duo of Jack Flash and CJ, and trying to keep their lady friend from going off to the Saudis. Damn Saudis. Always Shanghaiing women.

62cd5r,2,2017-03-30,i hate the life i made,Heartseeker90,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/62cd5r/i_hate_the_life_i_made/,"Hello,
iam 27 years old - male, i have social anxiety, still a stupid virgin - i dont even know how french kissing works, wasted most my life with video games and i feel like the loneliness is starting to develop into a serious depression.


When i was a kid i was the entertainer on family meetings. I thought of myself that iam good in making friends. But all that changed sooner than later.


In 6th grade i mistreated my longest friend who i knew from kindergarten. Because of pure jealously i stole a fucking Pokemon card from him. In the process the card took damage. Somehow he found out so i gave him his card back - damaged. He never forgave me and managed to get all our friends on his site to ignore me. I became the outsider in school - the thief.


A Year later i got chronic tinnitus on my right ear, its a high pitch tone very hard to describe. Ever since sleeping is very hard for me. I have to occupy my ears 24/7, there is no way i can fall a sleep without something to listen to.


With the age of 14/15 everyone started to drink and to smoke. Thats illegal for kids under the age of 16 in my country. I was extremely against this behaviour. And thats how i lost connection to my friends i knew from hobbies. I think they thought why invite him to the party if he doesnt drink anyway - or maybe they just didnt like me at all. My generation was all about smoking and drinking all the time. 


The Year 2004 - i think i had one good friend left who i knew from elementaryschool, he went to another highschool than me so nobody could tell him how bad of a person i am. We started to play World of Warcraft - retrospective one of my biggest mistakes i ever made. That was the beginning of the development of my social anxiety. School, World of Warcraft, sleep and repeat. I quit all my other hobbies and did nothing else than play this stupid ass game with my only true friend left. 


I was never stupid or anything i was and still am the laziest motherfucker on earth. World of Warcraft was my only interest and thats why i had to redo 9th grade. Maybe that wasnt a bad thing, it was an opportunity to make new friends. But i had to realize that my old friends knew someone in my new class and obviously they told them what i did. So the biggest group of friends in the new class were already sceptical towards me. I got along with 2-3 other people from the new class but it was never really friendship. Maybe one of them was interested to be my friend at first. We would sometimes meet up to do sports and he took me with him to the gym to work out. Somewhere along the way he must have noticed that iam socialy akward, i think he tried to help me to get more confidence but at some point it was just hopeless. 


All day everyday nothing but World of Warcraft. After 10th grade my friend who played the game with me lost interest and moved on. We never did anything together other than video games and when he realized that videos games are stupid we lost contact real fast. 


By the way i made my older brother to play World of Warcraft when he was in his last year of highschool. He got into it as much as i did and had to redo the last year. He was always a very good student, always good grades unlike me. In the second attempt he got it but with very bad grade. From there things went south for my brother, but thats another story. I destroyed not only my own life with World of Warcraft but also the life of my brother. FeelsBadMan.


After 10th grade i switched School and made new friends. They were like me, very interested in video games. At this time my social anxiety was growing faster. I started to fear to answer the door - even when i was waiting for a delivery, i began to avoid family meetings and hide in my room when they visit my family. I even began to ignore the telephone. 


In my last year of highschool i realized that the computer is going to destroy my life. I tried to find something for college that would have nothing to do with a stupid computer. But all my friends signed up for Buisness Information Systems. I didnt have a third language because i picked a computer related course in highschool because i thought computer are so fun yay - Playing video games all day. Pathetic. Without a third language many doors are closed for you in my country.
So my retarded ass brain convinced me to follow my friends to avoid to being all alone again in a new environment - at this time i would avoid any contact to people i dont know. 


September 2010 the start of college Buisness Information System. After the first week i already thought what the fuck is this shit. It was so annoying i already knew that i will never like this shit. But i did nothing about it. I thought its better to be with the people i know than being on my own. We were a group of 5 people. It was always only us while everybody else in our semester would make freinds with each other. After the second semester one of us quit because he failed to many exams. Only 4 to go. The next one we lost after the 5th Semester. He realized that he doesnt like this shit and started something different. Only 3 to go. The third finished college after 8 Semester. Me and the last guy finished it in 12 Semester. Normally you finish Buisness Information System in 6 Semester. We both kinda pushed each other to think its okay if we take our time.


I passed all tests on the first try but i wasted to much time by not signing up for exams because i was afraid of the internship we had to do before the final exam. It took me almost a year (2 semester) to finally submit my application to the internship. 


I think i quit World of Warcraft early 2010 but i never quit PC Gaming. There was always another game to play and always more important than everything else. 


And here i am 3 month after graduation with a degree i never wanted, i feel like a fraud because i feel like i have nothing learned in the past 6 years. Its already a shame that it took me twice as long as normal. The main profession with this degree is IT-Consultant. The irony man. The 2 things i hate the most combined - talking to people and Computer. 


Now comes the worst part. At the end of 2016 i lost all interest in video games. The emptiness that got filled by video games is now filled with the feel of loneliness. Since 11th grade i was only in classes with males. Even in College there was not a single female in my class. Well i dont think that would have changed anything because we were kinda the outsider group anyway but at least in 11 12 and 13th grade i think i could have talked to a girl if there were any in my class. This and my Social Anxiety are the reasons why a 12 year old nowadays has more experience with women than me. 


But hold on it gets even more pathetic. Since i dont play video games anymore all i do is surf the web - mainly youtube. Today i found a prank video where a guy pretended to be sad and a random girl came up to ask whats up. She was so nice to him and tried to help. I thought ""wow i would give anything to be with a woman like that"". That was the moment i realized how fucked up i am and how big i screwed my life already. 


The last 3 Month are dominated by the feel of loneliness and its getting worse with every week.
Everytime i get reminded that i wasted my life. I missed out on so many experiences.


I still live in my parents house. If i want to get to know a girl i need my own place, for that i need a job, but my social anxiety is blocking me from submitting applications and on top of that i fucking hate the jobs i could get with my degree - assumed there is someone who would hire me with my ridiculous 12 semester degree :(. Therefore the loneliness continues and the loop of doom is perfect.


I live with the tinnitus for about 12 years now and i still get a breakdown from time to time when i realize i dont even know anymore what silence feels like. The fear of never getting a job or to have to do something i dont want to do for the rest of my life and the rising feel of loneliness making everything even harder. 


So far i was able to handle these things one by one. But what am i going to do when all these things hit me at once ?


I need a time machine please!

I need a reboot.

62d9pa,58,2017-03-30,i just have to share my first day as teaching alone.,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/62d9pa/i_just_have_to_share_my_first_day_as_teaching/,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/5zx1aw/updated_from_i_dont_care_give_me_a_f/

So Im currently doing my internship for 6 weeks. Today was my first day being 100 % alone with the classes. Ive previously posted about some troubles, mostly due to being placed in lower ages than Im supposed to be with and such.


Its my 3rd week now. So Ive had some connection with them, however.. Ive never really held a lesson yet due to having a lot of reading / text discussions etc so its been planned for a while.


----------------

As the lesson start, they ask where the real teacher is. I tell them shes gone for the day and I hear people cheer ""Yeaaah, we can chill"". 


This class, the older one. Has never heard me speak with my real voice, nor heard me raise it. 


So once they all sat down. I raised my voice and said ""So, now were starting. Get to your places."" 

(Note: Not yelling, I have a habit to lower my voice due to people saying I sound mad when I speak with my normal voice. So I often use a softer voice as normal voice). 

I said, youre all on your correct places? Because in 10 sec, Im gonna take up the sheet and everyone on the wrong place. Will get late attendence. 


People started to see that I did not fuck around. 


Started to talk about source criticism. Which they found boring as fk. However, as I started to use real exampels (""Alternative facts"", how its on university and such), let them read some facts thats just sound like bullshit and news articals, they started to really listen. 


After some time, I showed a few videos about fake news and sites etc and I said, you have all behaved great, if you want and have no questions, we can end 10min earlier. They had loads and loads of questions (I knew this),  so those 10min turned into 2min. 


They asked if we could begin next lesson ealier and end it earlier, which I agreed. 


But before the lesson, I told them. This is your one and only chance. Show me you can behave, show me you can respect me and I will respect you. If you want me to keep letting you have some freedom, end earlier sometimes when possible and come up with super fun lessons. SHow me you can handle it. Show me youre about to be an adult. 

Lesson started and they had a free period (Not my subject) to study for their test. 


After 5-10min and they settled down. I turned on some music (piano study music I use for my own studies), and some said ""Youre not allowed to play music"", which I told them... When you behave, you get privileges. 


The classroom was dead silent. They all studied with 100 % focus. 


A few students left for group rooms and when it was 10 min left, I told them to come back. When they entered some students noticed that they were talking, which 90 % of the class didnt like. So I told them all, so either show me you can handle the stuff I told you about before, or you can stay with me for the whole lesson. 



After 10min, I told them. Get to your correct places calmly. They all went to their places without making a SOUND. I couldnt believe it. 


Here we had a class, which all teachers ive spoken with... said were the loudest. being 100 % silent. 



So I told them, you have earned these 10min, wasnt this a nice lesson? Youve done more today than you do on two lessons. 


Which you know what? They didnt leave. 


They wanted to stay the extra 10min. Everyone. 




When they left, I heard them talk about how this was the best lesson ever. They have never been this calm and they wish ever lesson was like this. Some students came to me and said they wanted me to start working here. I told them I still have 3 years, but its likley Ill have you in high school. 



When they were in the ""break room"" or whatever, they were so calm. A few teachers came to me and asked if something had happened. Because, they are never this calm. Some couldnt believe me and thought I was bullshitting when I discussed what happened at the lunch room. 


I had some cheat, due to the loudest student was sick today. But still... 

---------------------------------


So what have I taken from this? 


I know this wont be every lesson.  But after these two, hearing them discuss when they thought I wasent near. Felt me with some feeling that Im home. Its strange to explain, most of the time I dislike the kids, I get frustrated, I hate the school admins.


But still.. Im home. Ive found my place in the world and its to be a teacher. Through all the shit, through all the hate, Im where I am supposed to be. 


And I know Im finally on my way to finding myself. What kind of teacher I am going to be. 



EDIT:


I wrote this during my lunch break. After my lunch, I had a lesson with the younger kids (which I wrote about in the link). Same thing here, I gave them the option, even tho its a boring reading lesson (AGAIN. But my teacher didnt want me to start something brand new with them, so they got to read) that if they behave, I might let them go earlier. I drew two lines on the white board and told them ""Each line is 5min. Im not gonna raise my voice once, instead, I'm gonna start removing the lines until you get quiet"". I only had to remove 1/3 of a line, which meant, they got 7min to spare. Expect, they had loads of questions also so they got 2min. 



But what was so great here, is that... The ""trouble"" kids, wanted to change books. So I gave them a suggestion. They got the book and read 40 pages! 40 fucking pages! They normally dont even open the book. 


After the lesson, they quit for the day and fooled around, I had to tell them off because they were running into other classrooms and stuff... But they had a discussion about the book! Can you fucking believe it?! 

The first one I suggested the book, was further ahead. The ones starting today told him not to spoil anything, they wanted to read it. 


I told them that there is a harder version, which they wanted to read after they had read this ""easy read"" version and they even wanted to watch the movie later on. 


Same thing here.. The students were so relaxed and enjoyed the lesson so much because it was quiet. They didnt mind reading because some even got through 5 chapters, when they normally only read 1-2.  



Students that normally disrupts the class, where telling others to be quiet. It was amazing to see.



EDIT 2: 

After all lessons, I was almost drenched in sweat. But I kept my cool, because I knew that one moment could destroy the whole great atmosphere"
62dazh,40,2017-03-30,Gendernomics: Orbiters and Options,Blacklabellogics,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/62dazh/gendernomics_orbiters_and_options/,"Options within the financial industry are in essence securities that give you certain rights related to other securities. The most common being Call options that give you the right to buy a set amount of an underlying security at a set price known as the strike price, and Put options that give you the right to sell a set amount of an underlying security at a set price. These financial instruments can be used in a variety of ways the most common being hedging risk exposure and taking leveraged positions in the underlying security. The former is quite common among hedge funds, the latter among traders. The underlying basis for options is that the underwriter and the buyer have differing views on how the asset will develop going forward. In the case of a Call option, the option writer thinks the stock will fall and the buyer thinks the stock will rise, in the case of a Put option, the underwriter thinks the stock will rise, and the buyer thinks the stock will fall.

I've previously written on risk in the sexual market place and while men often neglect risks completely when it comes to sexual relationships, women are consummate risk managers who seek to guard in for most eventualities within the market place. It is not uncommon to see wealthy men go ""all in"" on a marriage working on, not just once but twice and thrice before realizing that they are really buying expensive hookers paid after the fact.

The inherent ability of women to risk manage within the sexual market place is a function of hypergamy and solipsism, in that hypergamy represents the drive to maximize the gain from her SMV over a relatively short lifetime, much in the same manner that a professional athlete needs to maximize the value of his ability over a short period of time, while solipsism permits her to do whatever is necessary in order to achieve this goal. Via solipsism a woman can justify any action she perceives as required in order to maximize her outcomes.

**Orbiters and Risk Hedging**

The first meeting most men have with female risk hedging in the sexual market place is the prevalence of orbiters, orbiters being the men who circle a woman waiting for her present relationship to end, or alternatively waiting for her to realize their value. The female portfolio of Orbiters can have many different instruments the most common being the ex-boyfriends who she keeps around to play dread games with her new boyfriend, the hapless betas who are waiting for her to realize that she needs a nice guy and the hard-friendzoned men who she keeps around for resource gains.

The distinction between the latter two being that a woman once she reaches her epiphany phase may settle down with one of the Betas, whereas those men who are hard-friendzoned will never be able to escape the category.

Each man type of man within her orbit represent different forms of risk hedging. The ex-boyfriends are there to be tools for dread game against her present boyfriend, or as tools in jealously plots with a man she is seeking to lock down. They also represent both a call option for a future relationship/sexual encounter and a put option on her present relationship, in that she can always call up an ex, when she offloads her present relationship. I've seen this called ""The Slingback Effect"", wherein a woman will seek to return to a previous mate as a result of either waning fortunes on her end, or great fortune on his end.

The hapless betas are her defense against ending up alone, perhaps the most obvious examples are the ""if neither of us are married by 40, let's get hitched"" wherein a woman secures provision through what is in essence a call option. The hapless betas along with the HFZ (hard-friendzone) men also serve as a form of Bond, in that they provide the woman with a stream of validation and ""boyfriend internships"" where they attempt to demonstrate what great boyfriends they would be based on equity and expectancy theory. In a sense, these men are ""boyfriend-interns"" in that they are performing the duties of boyfriend when she requires, without compensation.

In essence, by structuring her circle in this manner, consisting of a mixture of the 3 categories, this gives her a put option on her present romantic interest(s), and call options on the remaining men in the stable. It mitigates her risk if she were to discard her present, as she has men who will step up and fill his role, however it also assists in driving up her own value, as she appears very much in demand.

Both just said they weren't going to continue my consideration with no feedback despite my request. I felt like I did amazing on both interviews and the engineers seemed impressed.

I've applied to every company you can think of. I have a normal resume, the job I did in high school and a personal project I've worked on since freshman year that I've slowly been building up. I definitely don't have anything weird that would stave off recruiters and all the career advisors here have told my me resume is as good as it can be without work experience.

I did my level 1 nearly a year ago, did a 6 month internship and also have an Olympic Lifting certification.

I emailed a number of boxes in my area last week, explaining who I was, my experience and that I was looking to learn off new coaches and that I'm extremely passionate about crossfit. One box got back to me very quickly and said he'd love to meet me and we could discuss a few options. 

I'm really impressed with his social media and from what I can see he has a great community, a growing number of members and his programming is really well thought out. Another plus is that the box is open nearly 4 years now. The box is in a really good location 10 minutes from the city and this could be a really good opportunity for me. Plus he seems to be a really nice guy from what I can see.

My question is: I'm hoping that this could lead to potential hours down the line. I've looked through his timetable and he doesn't seem to have any dedicated weightlifting class.

I guess I'm not extremely surprised I got rejected, considering that I have a somewhat unrelated degree to computer science (actuarial science).  I received my bachelor's in actuarial science from a small, unknown US school with a very high GPA (3.9+) and passing 3 actuarial exams, but having not been a CS student in undergrad, I feel like my transcript has big holes which might have doomed me.  I also don't have any research experience in undergrad due to the nature of the actuarial program (head down, studying for actuarial exams and working internships).  I realized after finishing my undergrad that I didn't really want to be an actuary, so I took a bunch of online courses (udemy, udacity, saylor, etc.) for programming, data structures and algorithms, etc. to build a knowledge base (I had always enjoyed programming since High School and had kept up a little bit with it and wanted to make a run at switching my career to that).  I was able to land a job as a developer, but I have further aspirations.  A part of the actuarial world that I really enjoyed was being able to analyze and make sense of data sets.  I'm really interested in and excited about using computers to make sense of that data with machine learning and was hoping to be able to pursue that further, through grad school.  After now being rejected from my US options, I was wondering what I should do next.  I'm considering going overseas (Australia, perhaps) for postgrad (if I can get in overseas somewhere), but I'm not sure if there are many (any?) good/comparable programs outside of the US.  I've also been considering the Udacity nanodegree programs or one of the online master's programs (I've GT and Columbia have decent online master's programs, any others?), but I think I would benefit a lot more from being in a university setting than remote online.  The thing that excites me most about machine learning is it's potential applications in healthcare, which I feel like I would need to be at a university to be able to learn and research a lot of the health related ideas.  I would really not like to have to push my whole life off another year to wait and apply again (I decided to go to grad school just after the application deadlines for a lot of schools two years ago so I had already kind of been pushing everything off for a year to apply this year).  I'm not sure waiting to reapply again next year would provide me much better of a chance to get in considering my odd background.  Do I need to go back and earn another bachelor's degree, this time in CS?

I'm rambling quite a bit, so my apologies, but I'm just generally a bit lost as to how to get where I want to go, given these rejections.  Is it worthwhile to take the online route or overseas route?  Is it a better option to go back for another bachelor's and then reapply next year?  Are there any schools with spring enrollment for these programs (most of the ones I found were fall enrollment only) that I could apply to still now?"

I got degree in History with the intent of going into teaching, but that never panned out (no money in it, decent paying college level too competitive). I've been coasting from job to job ever since, trying to find a career that works for me.

I'm 26 now and currently a mortgage banker with a fairly large company, been here a year and a half, and I've quickly found that sales just isn't for me. LOVE working with people, HATE trying to convince them to do things they normally wouldn't do. So I'm looking for a change.

My biggest regret is getting such a useless degree, I don't feel qualified for anything, and I'm worried about being left adrift with no marketable skills if the economy tanks again.

My idea is to head back to school for computer science. Programming is something I think I'd be interested in, it's relevant to today's economy, and it's definitely a marketable skill with high income potential. I'm getting married this summer however, and plan on having children soon, so I think my best bet would to be to go full nuclear: Work a waiting job or something similar (relatively high income with flexible hours) and get as many credits per semester as possible, intern, the works. Basically do everything I can to make it happen as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Basically, find the holes in this plan. I want to make sure I've considered it from every possible angle before pulling any triggers, and I'm sure I've missed something.

Thanks for the help.

Quick PS, I've looked into Programming boot camps, they don't seem to be the best way to go. My brother has been in programming for five years and told me employers prefer degrees and experience (school and internships) over boot campers."
62e0ou,11,2017-03-30,"[Long Post] Got my first salaried job and have been here for two months. Slow pace and lack of tasks is not working for me, and I feel guilty for job searching. What should I do?",boardingtheplane,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/62e0ou/long_post_got_my_first_salaried_job_and_have_been/,"also posted in /r/careerguidance 

Hi all, I don't really know how to make this more concise, but I'll include a TL;DR.

I graduated with a BS in Urban Planning June 2016, and had been job searching for the last 6 or 7 months. In February, thanks to pure luck, I was hired to work at a small but successful engineering firm. I ran into a high school friend and her dad. We caught up for a few and when I mentioned I was looking for a job in transportation planning, her dad gave me his card. (not sure if it's worth noting, but he's VP/COO of the firm. His father is CEO and has recently stepped down from a daily role.)

I interviewed and had a job offer within a week! I am extremely grateful for the opportunity he's given me and I like being here, but of course, the honeymoon phase is over.
I'm basically a glorified intern. I'm on a 9-month seasonal contract making $35k (or about $17/hr)- so no benefits yet. I get along with all of my coworkers, but there's obviously a disconnect. I don't mind it much right now, but if there's been no change in the last two months, what's to come?

I've learned a lot about the industry, and have managed to get some training, but there's a lot of things they won't give me permission to do at this time. I had a direct supervisor that always had something for me to do/learn about, but she left about a month ago on maternity leave... Since then, I've gotten assigned about 1/5 of the amount of tasks I used to have.
Most of the work I've submitted has never been fully looked-over. Presentations and reports I've prepared for my supervisors have been set aside and I've been told ""great job! Sorry I can't look at this right now, but we'll get to it later!""

I've taken it upon myself to start doing some training during this downtime. I'm currently learning how to use AutoDesk AutoCAD- even though I've asked and they won't let me use the program at work. I've just been taking a video course and following along at home. I've asked about other things, but they claim that they aren't ready for me to do any of that unless the licensing is affordable and can be easily transferred to my desktop.
The firm I work for deals with rail engineering, like the NYC Subway, LA's MetroLink, Amtrak, etc. I thought this would be a great stepping stone towards where I really want to be. My real passions are for aviation and transit planning. My dream is to have a career working in airport/airline management, or anything that would put me right in the heart of a major airport and its operations. I believe I can make a horizontal shift to similar work in the aviation industry.

I was job searching yesterday and came across a job posting for this exact position, but at another firm, dealing with aviation planning, and for about 50% more money than what I'm getting paid right now. This made me think if it's even worth it for me to stick it out here until at least October, or just start job searching again.

**TL;DR: I got my first salaried job out of college and I'm bored to tears here. I feel like I'm wasting their time and mine by being here. I get paid more than $100 a day to read articles and do powerpoints. At this time, I am feeling unchallenged, supervisors are not willing to let me learn useful skills (like drafting programs), and I have no relationships with coworkers. I'd like to move to a job in aviation planning or airport management.**

*It seems like the situation won't improve any time soon, so should I just start looking for better options? How bad of form is it to leave a position like this after only a few months into a contract?*

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice."

My last year was hard. The courses were damn tough but I also had personal problems and set backs that crushed my worldview and my dreams/aspirations...

To make matters worse, my interest in CS started to wane at the end of third year. I had an internship at a bank and lots of concepts were very difficult and I felt like not being intelligent enough to get how things work. Also, I found that after around 5 hrs in front of computer I am very dead tired and want nothing to do with computers after that.

Now, I was diagnosed with depression by my doctor and therapist. I'd it is combination of stuff that crushed my worldview, realization that maybe I study something that does not come naturally to me (I studied with people of probably 130+ IQ across the class) and felt rather dumb compared to them. Due to all these worries, I can't sleep for more than 4hrs a night and live my life in brain fog that ruins my performance in interviews. I seem to get them and was told my resume is strong but my brain just don't want to function. I solved over 100 Leetcode problems and still fail interviews that may even be variation of problem I did on Leetcode...

I am honestly not sure what it is. Is it me really disliking the field or is it my depression and tiredness talking.

I do all the right things: cook my food lift weights, have friends(no gf though) and simply see no point in life after graduation. I feel like last 4 years at uni was a waste of my time. I don't feel more intelligent or like accomplishing something.

Did anyone feel like this in their senior year? I am feeling rather conflicted. Failing interviews mean I lack skills but then I can't find motivation to become better in this field. What is crazy is that I can get lost in coding for hours when feeling like it but still feel rather dumb frequently. I wrote C language compiler on my own so I am not hopeless case but still feel like it is nothing and I am inferior to others out there."

A little about me: I'm an Interdisciplinary Health Services student at Western Michigan University where I have a minor in social work. I have over 3 years of experience working in child care, as well as other volunteer positions and am completing an internship at American Red Cross this summer which my recruiter told me to put on my resume. 
 I've been wanting to apply to PC for a long time, and did last round of applications and had an interview for the YiD position in Fiji but didn't get accepted. 
Obviously I want to apply to Peace Corps again so I've rewritten my motivation statement and am looking for some tips here. I've had friends look over it but I think advice from RPCV's or those who have been invited are obviously more beneficial. I'm looking at the open programs in Myanmar, Thailand, and Samoa all for education or YiD. 
Let me know what ya think:

The most meaningful service experience I have had is the opportunity to be a part of WMU’s Flint Water Task Force, where I am responsible for delivering water to families with no access to uncontaminated water in Flint, MI. During monthly trips I am able to meet with Flint residents and explore the intolerable level of hardship they have endured with the current water crisis. Volunteering with this team and seeing the impact that unequal access to resources has on a community has granted me an understanding of the importance of the Peace Corps’ mission to aid communities confronting these issues globally, and increased my already present desire to serve.
Researching the Peace Corps, I saw the projects and relationships that volunteers pour their hearts into and I strongly feel an urge to do the same. I am what Sargent Shriver once described Peace Corps Volunteers as full of: “enthusiasm and a crusading spirit”. I desire to satiate the thirst I have for a deeper understanding of communities of the world, and as a Peace Corps volunteer I am excited to be immersed in an unfamiliar culture where I can become a friend, neighbor, and contributing member. I aim to do this by teaching local citizens about my culture and learning from theirs, turning every interaction into an exchange of knowledge and then applying what I have learned to projects in the community.
	Considering that the Peace Corps requires a 27 month commitment, I understand that it is no small undertaking. There are many challenges that I will face throughout service, but I feel the biggest one will be the levels of discomfort I will encounter while subjected to the unfamiliar culture of the community in which I am selected to serve. I plan to overcome the challenges by embracing the opportunity to learn from a culture by being immersed in it, while also keeping in contact with my American community when appropriate. Expounding upon my experience by educating my peers about life overseas will bridge some of the gap between me, and my American community while allowing me to overcome perceived challenges and fulfill the 3rd mission of a Peace Corps volunteer.  The challenge of culture shock I will face will be overcome in time by the immense support and encouragement from friends I will make with other Peace Corps Volunteers and members of my community.
	I know that I will face many challenges during my service in the Peace Corps, but with these will come unique learning experiences and treasured memories. The opportunity to live, serve, and learn from a community as a Peace Corps volunteer will be a great privilege, and because the challenges that I will encounter reap such valuable rewards I look forward to facing them."

I've seen you mature from kids who seemingly only care about prestige and where you get in and writing obnoxious braggy essays, to young adults who are giving each other truly awesome advice and pieces of wisdom. It has been an amazing process to watch. Your support for each other is real. I'd never been part of an online community before or spent any time online actually, and I had no idea what to expect, but i certainly wasn't expecting this level of bonding and care for each other.  You all are incredible kids. You really need to remember that today. And tomorrow. And next week. And next year. 

So, I want you to do me a favor today. Gonna take the focus off college acceptances for just a few minutes and mods, I hope you'll bear with me here. I want each one of you to write to me today and for the next few days or the next week or hell, forever, and tell me three things in your life you are grateful for.  You can respond here or pm me if you'd rather. You come from around the world and so many different circumstances, and I know many of you have struggled with parts of your lives. I've heard your stories, but today I want to focus on the good stuff. So tell me three things you are thankful for. Big or small. 

(Please feel free to respond even if you're not a senior!)

I'll go first. 
1. I'm so happy that my son suggested that I see if there was a subReddit for college applications. I have learned more here from you all (my Reddit kiddoes) and all the moderators and admissions officers than from all the books I've read and classes I've taken. Thank you for that!

2. I'm thankful for my own kids. They are a little wacky. All very different  and from them I've learned that there is no one certain way to live life. I have my oldest son who's going the path-following route and becoming a doctor. And I have my middle who's turning down Columbia law school to follow a career in comedy. And then my baby who is a happy college kid, looking for summer internships in the music industry but really who knows? They are all smart, yes, but I'm most thankful for the fact that they are nice. 

3. I'm thankful today that I had a mom who supported me no matter what decisions I made or whether she agreed with them or not. I miss her a lot because she died two years ago, but she taught me a lot about caring for others. She was dedicated to helping low income first generation college kids get an education.  I have been on here with you all this year partly in honor of her. She taught me that I am In control of my future and that life sucks sometimes, but that doesn't mean I can be or will be a sucky person.  My mom had some bad shit happen to her; her life wasn't perfect. She graduated from college at age 44 and then went on to get her masters.  After that she developed and was the head of the early childhood department at her local college until she died. 

Those are some of my big things. I have lots of little things I'm gonna add in the next few days.  Now it's your turn. I can't wait to hear from you.  

Edit - forgot to remind you to breathe😊!"
62febm,0,2017-03-30,What was she thinking [20F]? Was I [21M] wrong? Will I ever hear from her again?,hauntedsaint,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62febm/what_was_she_thinking_20f_was_i_21m_wrong_will_i/,"Hey all,

I am writing to you 2 and a half months after my first relationship fell apart.  If I had been in a financially stable position, I would have asked her to marry me, and I am confident she would have said yes.  But as a 21 year old college student, I allowed society to dictate when that will happen and will have to live with the regrets and haunting thoughts plagued with ""what ifs"".  In the following paragraphs I will explain the events that caused the break up and the different stages it underwent over time.

An inherent instinct all us men have to some degree is that of isolating our woman from advancing towards or receiving the advances of another male that is romantically interested.  Expression of this instinct manifests itself as behavior that is perceived as controlling and coming from a emotional position of weakness, jealousy, and fear, which will drive women away 100% of the time.  I felt this instinct one night while we were at my place after dinner when I saw a text message on her phone from a guy she had just been talking about in a dreamy, positive light.  She also was bitchy, cold, and distant that night, which just added fuel to my insecurity.  I saw from the conversation that she had asked him to come visit (he lives a few hours away) over Thanksgiving break.  He ended up not coming, but over thanksgiving break updated his facebook profile and cover pic, both of which she distinguished herself by ""loving"". 

One night right after winter break in my bed her usual alarm goes off and I get up to turn it off.  When I do, I notice a text from the same guy, and I proceed to ask her if they are good friends and what the conversation is about.  At first she tried to downplay it as nothing, but then reveals after some pestering that she is in the process of scheduling a week long trip to Europe with him that will involve traveling across the continent with him alone, and ending at the city she will have her summer long internship in.  All over winter break, I had been reflecting on our relationship and was not sure this was the right girl for me due to her actions that I perceived as advancements towards this other guy, so this pushed me over the edge.  After some arguing, I gave her an ultimatum of cancel this trip now with this guy and we will remain together, or go with this guy and we are done.  She asked for time to think about it to which I said no, as I wanted her to choose me over some friend she barely knew.  She said she chooses Europe, to which I said too bad, let me know if you change your mind.

A few days go by and I receive a text from her while at home for the weekend to check my mailbox, as she had sent a letter.  I let my impatience and emotions get the best of me and called her right after receiving this.  We had a long conversation in which I revealed my insecurities and restated my position.  After another few days of not hearing from her, I arrive back at school and read the letter she had sent.  In it she was adamant that she had no feelings for this guy and she was only going with him because she couldn't find anyone else to go with and wanted to save going on a trip like this with her significant other for when she was engaged.  She said that she needed me in her life and that I had nothing to worry about.  After reading this, I believe I made a mistake based on jealousy and insecurity, called her, got no response, and sent a text saying that I was sorry, and that I was wrong.  A month and a half went by with no response.  I sent her a letter saying that I was sorry and that I didn't consider her point of view at all when issuing the ultimatum, that her letter clarified her position to me, and asked her out to dinner.  After a day she texted me saying that she believes it is best for us to not get back together after all that has been said.  I told her to let me know if she changes her mind again, and haven't contacted her since.

I believe the instinct of possessing a woman and reading too much into certain situations caused this to happen.  If I were to just calm down, trust her, and allow her to be free to interact with her male friends, our relationship would have progressed.  But instead I have to live with receiving her letter 48 hours too late.  

Do you guys think she will change her mind again, or should I not expect anything else in the future?  How could she go from saying I need you in my life to not wanting to talk to me in one phone conversation?  I would appreciate any feedback and any stories of similar situations.

TLDR: Girlfriend not interested anymore after saying she needed me after I revealed my insecurities.  "

1) Dropped two courses so I need to repeat another year. Benefit? An opportunity for an internship possibly and to structure my time management skills better (in engineering)

2)Decided to improve my communication skill since the media portrays the college life so glamorous, the solution, to go to public speaking organization with a bunch of 30-50 year olds (yay)

3)Tried to approach a girl whom was either way into your league or out of you league (she was taller than me)

4) Learned alot not much about the materials taught in class, but simply how to learn

5) Read self help books to enhance my life overall

6)Yoga and exercise

This is my uni life summed up so far, i am 22 and i feel no regrets even though 3) was a painful experience lol. If i had to start over again, that is to not engage too much social media, video games, and xXx crap (that ruins your brain). No drugs and alcohol:)"

62foio,1,2017-03-30,Considering a career on the nonprofit sector,GreedyGenerous,Nonprofit_Jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonprofit_Jobs/comments/62foio/considering_a_career_on_the_nonprofit_sector/,"Hi everyone.


After doing an internship on a non-profit, I found the experience so pleasing and life changing, I decided to keep volunteering while reflecting about where I should focus my professional career. Previously, I was strongly determined to work at the startup sector. However, after my internship, I don't feel the same interest as before.

My tasks have mainly consisted of administrative ones, and interviewing as well people in risk of social exclusion, in order to know more about their personal situation. Actually, interviewing these people, hearing them, showing them empathy and comprehension, and observing the possitive impact the non-profit had on their lifes, was what made me ""click"" and consider a career on the sector.

Concerning my education, I hold a double major in Business and Law.

On one side, I would like to ask you what type of position do you think I could be a good fit, considering my background. Despite carrying administrative tasks, I have learnt too much about the inner workings of a non profit. However, I feel that I could actually bring more value if I carried other kind of tasks.

My ""coworkers"" are responsible for projects in order to help vulnerable collectives find a job. That's for example one position I would actually enjoy, as I could carry bigger responsabilities, and would be in touch with other people.

On the other side, I think I am relatively young (25 years old), and I could always try to switch to another sector on the future. I just wouldn't like sticking to the original thought I had on mind since day one (startup sector), not feeling truly passionate about what I do. I also believe working on a non-profit could be a good way to learn more about its inner working, become more socially conscious, and even in the future start a social venture. 

In fact, what motivated me for a career on the startup sector was learning the maximum I could, and starting one on the future. However, my approach was more leaned towards profit, rather than social impact.

I would really appreciate your feedback. ;)"

62g7z7,5,2017-03-30,Econ or Stats?,scurtis28,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/62g7z7/econ_or_stats/,"Hey guys,

So to give some quick background:
I'm a sophomore non-target in the undergrad b-school CURRENTLY double majoring in finance and econ (with a minor in stats). I interned last summer in IB with a boutique shop, I interned in the winter at a L/S equity HF in an ER-type role, and I'll be doing a shadow type internship at an MM in NY in their consumer retail coverage group this upcoming summer post sophomore year.
My question is do I stick with my current majors in finance and economics OR do I keep finance and take on statistics as a second major? 

My long term goal would IDEALLY be to work in HF, obviously short term goals being to go somewhere in IB/ER and even S&amp;T (which all have some level of opps to go to HF). Considering I'm from a non target and need to stand out as much as possible, stats seems appealing as well as the idea that it'll give me a quantitative edge in S&amp;T type spots. Another pro is that the HF field is becoming far more ""quant-natured"" and while I'm not looking to be a full on quant/algo developer, people I've connected with across the HF industry have said there's substance to a more quant based degree.


That being said, the cons are:
1) Statistics major is harder than Economics, may take a toll on my GPA and
2) It may lead IB/ER guys to question why I studied statistics to which I probably won't have a great answer


Obviously, an easy solution would be to either target solely S&amp;T jobs or IB/ER jobs BUT I'm trying to keep my search and networking efforts as broad as possible and I'm very interested in all 3. Considering there's only one or two BB's that do recruit at my school (for a VERY limited amount of IB spots) and how HF jobs out of undergrad are incredibly hard to come by (esp. from non-target), I figured a broad approach to getting to the long-term goal would make more sense.

I'd love any insight! Thanks!"
62g9bp,1541,2017-03-30,How I almost joined Amway - a warning against joining MLM companies,AsylumJim,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62g9bp/how_i_almost_joined_amway_a_warning_against/,"Posted this to tifu, got removed because nothing significantly bad happened, so I'll put it here. A couple of years ago, when I was an undergrad, I worked retail on the side. One busyish day, as I was ringing up a guy for his purchase, he asked me if I was a student and what my major was. Figuring he was just trying to make small talk, I told him I was a pre-med student. Right away, he started telling me he worked for a company where he worked with a lot of doctors and that it helped a lot of undergrads get high-paying jobs right out of college. He was really talkative and strangely enthusiastic for someone promoting a company to a stranger he just started talking to. 

He made it sound like a company that set people up with internships and jobs for pre-med people and then told me about one of the company's orientations that was taking place at a nearby hotel a couple of days later. Without even asking him the name of the company, I decided it was worth a shot, so he gave me the address and suggested that I wear business casual clothes. For reasons I can't remember, my parents had to drop me off. This gets relevant later. I decided to go all out and wear a suit and paid good money to get it dry cleaned and pressed. I thought it was a sure thing.

When I got to the hotel and the orientation started, holy fuckbuckets, it wasn't what I thought it would be. The main speaker at the orientation talked about how a person can make boatloads of money without even really trying, showing us a slideshow that looked like it belonged in a child's school project. The speaker didn't mention how a person that joined the company was supposed to make any of this money at all. At this point, I still thought it was a potentially lucrative offer, so I kept listening. 

After the speech ended, he called on a bunch of slightly creepy, wide-eyed people to talk about their individual experiences with the company. They used the same nebulous tone the speaker gave, but again, I still had dollar signs in my eyes. After they were done talking, the guy who invited me to the orientation came up to me and started introducing me to the aforementioned creepy people, and as they talked to me about their supposed success stories, all I could think while I was nodding my head pretending to listen was, ""What kind of creepy ass cult meeting did I get dragged in to?"" But just like before, I kept listening for more info instead of noping out of there.

 After talking with a bunch of people, the guy who invited me came with me to the lobby of the hotel and gave me a bunch of promotional materials with an Amway logo on them. I had zero idea what Amway was or what it did, no thanks to the orientation speech. The guy then brought out some registration forms and asked me, ""So how would you like to pay for your registration? Cash? Check?"" I was still open to the possibility of joining, but decided to give the decision more time and told him as much. He was really insistent about my joining and gave me his number and asked to call him back later when I've made up my mind. 

When my dad came to pick me up, the guy came outside with me and talked to my dad for a little while. He didn't mention Amway to my dad. On the ride back, as soon as I mentioned the word ""Amway,"" my dad said, ""Oh shit, do you know what you just got yourself into?"" He then told me that Amway is a company where employees are expected to buy products from the company and sell them door-to-door. Employees are also supposed to recruit new employees and make commission based off of what the recruits sell. They actively go out and talk to random strangers, a lot of the times young college-aged people, trying to recruit them into their business like they did with me. My dad then told me that when he and my mom were just married, they were recruited by Amway similarly to how I was and lost a lot of money because of the registration fee and because they weren't able to sell enough stuff. Some of my parent's relatives and friends also lost money joining Amway. Obviously, I decided not to join. The kicker is that if my dad didn't have to drive me, I'm not sure I would have mentioned the word Amway to my parents until I'd already joined, and at that point, getting out probably would have been a lot harder. In the end, I still lost money on getting the suit cleaned for nothing, but I think I dodged a bullet.

TL;DR - Didn't listen to my gut several times, almost joined fucking Amway.

Edit - Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! "
62gaj5,3,2017-03-30,Heading off to grad school this summer - What are my health insurance options?,Neverending-Horizons,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62gaj5/heading_off_to_grad_school_this_summer_what_are/,"Hello /r/personalfinance. I am budgeting for grad school and looking into my healthcare options. Wondering if anyone can help. Some facts:

* I live in CA and will be going to grad school in CA.
* Still currently working and on employer plan but I anticipate I'll be quitting in the next couple of months. By then I will have made about $17,000 - $20,000, which is above the medi-cal line in CA.
* I do not expect any income for the rest of the year. I did not receive any scholarships or grants for school.
* I am over 26, single with no children.
* I do expect to work next summer through an internship (I'm in an MBA program). 
* School requires health insurance coverage and the plan they offer is about $350/mo.

My questions are:

1. I plan on quitting my job a couple months before school starts. Can I immediately sign up for ACA/Obamacare after I quit? If so, do I put the earnings I have made so far this year ($17,000-$20,000) as my ""annual income""? Looking at the plans, I will only have to pay $50 per month for a cheap plan compared to the $350/mo plan my school offers.

2. Can I just go without health insurance for those two gap months before starting school since I can apply for COBRA retroactively if anything happens? And then sign up for obamacare once school starts? Will I have to pay a penalty for those two months?

3. Are there any cheaper alternatives? Not sure I will qualify under medi-cal this year since I believe I'll be making over the income limit. What about catastrophic plans? Or is this what is already offered when I searched the marketplace?

4. With unpredictable income during my second year of grad school, what would happen if I signed up for medi-cal or heavily subsidized obamacare plan and end up making over the income limits?

Thanks for the help!"

So here we go:

I am in my last year of undergraduate in a health science program. I am minoring in health informatics at my university, so I do have some coding experience (or I will have some coding experience (Python and C++) at the end of my UG). I am also currently taking CS50x online. I do this on the side because I have a full-time internship as an analyst in the health field.

I enjoy programming a lot and I love to problem solve. This is why I feel extremely unhappy in my program and wish I had pursued CS from high school. Unfortunately, such is life :/

My end goal is to work in the tech industry. With that, I am not sure what my next steps are. Compared to other people my age, I am obviously under-developed as a programmer - and I do not have the same job experience. At the same time, I don't think going into a second undergraduate degree in CS is practical financially. I thought about getting a Master's degree in Health Informatics /Bioinformatics, but that would mean learning strictly from a health/science perspective, something I am not sure I am down for - but it seems like the only option for me right now. 

Does anyone in this subreddit have any advice to offer? How does one just break into the tech industry without a CS background? What are things I can do to make myself employable in the industry? Or is there a degree I can that that would help? I am not sure if there is anything out there. But any advice will help. 

Thank you to all who replied in advance, I truly appreciate it."

Here's the situation:

- Age 30, currently making $63k at a job I've been at almost 5 years
- I attend grad school part-time which is how I got connected with this internship. Same type of work but in a more interesting field with better growth opportunities.
- internship pays $36/hr with no benefits
- if they choose to take me on full-time afterwards, salary would start around $95k
- overall financials are in good shape (30k in cash, about 350k in the market, no car, no house, no debt, no kids)
- they are interested in eventually getting interns into a full-time position... they've said they'll keep paying me if I keep showing up after the 10 weeks, but no guarantee that I'll get a full-time offer immediately after. 

The Obamacare penalty kicks in if you go 3 full months without insurance, and at my income my options are either to sign up and pay ~$230 per month on the exchange, or take a tax penalty of ~$1,500 for 2017. I would have to enroll by August so that monthly premium would be cheaper than the penalty, but that's still over 3x what I pay with my current employer. My COBRA rates would be over $450 a month so that's not gonna work either. I could maybe look into joining my partner's health care plan but we're not married so it could be complicated.

I should also mention that fortunately, I have no prescriptions, conditions, or immediate needs for insurance aside from the fact that the law mandates it.

Anyone have any advice? Is there any option that I'm missing? This is a calculated risk for me that I'm expecting to pay off 6-9 months from now salary-wise, but it puts me in a weird limbo for a few months."

I don't hate programming, but I hate the interviews and I don't think I would enjoy being a software engineer in the long run. I've interviewed for both types of roles and I enjoyed the product management interviews a lot more. I actually had fun doing them and didn't feel the same crippling anxiety I feel during coding interviews. That said, I was sadly rejected by a startup in California that I had high hopes for because I had passed the first three rounds and was flown onsite. I did well on all the interviews onsite except for the last one but I thought I still had a shot. However, they told me they were interviewing other candidates so they likely found someone with an MBA degree or prior PM experience. I was still proud of myself for getting to the onsite interview with only a college background. But, now I'm panicking because it is already April and I am left with no job leads (please no one tell me about the ""window being closed"" because I am aware of my time running out and I see that a lot on here). I have been feeling depressed since I got that rejection because I was really hoping I could finally end my job search and work at a company I actually really like. The fact that I was so close makes it even harder to stomach, and I've been interviewing and job searching for a few months now so it's hard not to feel like I am simply unemployable and that there's something wrong with me. 

I have also been applying to all PM jobs that I would qualify for, but I know that PM is difficult to get into as a college grad (though not impossible). If I cannot get a direct PM job, I am willing to take on positions that can help me gain experience so that it is easier the next time I apply. What kind of positions should I look out for? Are there any steps I should definitely take? Should I try to email/send LinkedIn messages to recruiters and ask if they have anything for me? Also, I realize there is a stigma around this, but if I could get a well-paying internship in PM that could lead to a full-time job I am open to that as well. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has gone through a similar transition before."

However, I am also in talks with a few startups for internships this summer and although they're not as prestigious and pay jack, I hope to learn a lot.

TLDR: Want to recruit in Fall, don't want to take summer classes. choices: Take decent/good fall job offer and summer classes OR work at startup this and try for a BigN in the fall.

I'm leaning towards the startup route however I don't know how much companies will care about me working at an unknown startup vs at a pretty well known tech company when it comes to recruiting. Thoughts?"

If anyone has any suggestions where to look or what I can do please share.

THANKS!

I'm limited to 20 hours a week so I have been looking for another job for over the summer. I just got off the phone with American Eagle and they offered me a job which I accepted. 

I got off the phone and got onto my computer and noticed an email from an internship near my family offering me a job. I obviously want the internship because it pays a lot more than my IT job and American Eagle, but I literally just got off the phone accepting the position at American Eagle. 

What should I do? Should I explain the situation to American Eagle and see if I can work until the internship starts and possibly transfer to a store near my parents? They said that is a thing that could happen to the group during the interview but I doubt they meant so quickly after hire. I didn't mention the possibility of an internship during the interview and said I'd be in the area for the summer. I'd really enjoy working at American Eagle so I wouldn't mind working there alongside my internship to help save up money. I know this is the best bad situation I could imagine but I'm not sure how to handle it. "

62gu8y,2,2017-03-30,New grad in CS seeking to go into PM but struggling. Any advice would be appreciated.,darkphoenix188,ProductManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/62gu8y/new_grad_in_cs_seeking_to_go_into_pm_but/,"I know this question has been asked before but I am hoping to get some more specific advice because I realized this school year that I am more passionate about product management and the responsibilities it entails than I am with software engineering. I don't hate programming, but I hate the interviews and I don't think I would enjoy being a software engineer in the long run. I've interviewed for both types of roles and I enjoyed the product management interviews a lot more. I actually had fun doing them and didn't feel the same crippling anxiety I feel during coding interviews. That said, I was sadly rejected by a startup in California that I had high hopes for because I had passed the first three rounds and was flown onsite. I did well on all the interviews onsite except for the last one but I thought I still had a shot. However, they told me they were interviewing other candidates so they likely found someone with an MBA degree or prior PM experience. I was still proud of myself for getting to the onsite interview with only a college background. 

But, now I'm panicking because it is already April and I am left with no job leads (please no one tell me about the ""window being closed"" because I am aware of my time running out and I see that a lot on here). I have been feeling depressed since I got that rejection because I was really hoping I could finally end my job search and work at a company I actually really like. The fact that I was so close makes it even harder to stomach, and I've been interviewing and job searching for a few months now so it's hard not to feel like I am simply unemployable and that there's something wrong with me.

I have also been applying to all PM jobs that I would qualify for, but I know that PM is difficult to get into as a college grad (though not impossible). If I cannot get a direct PM job, I am willing to take on positions that can help me gain experience so that it is easier the next time I apply. What kind of positions should I look out for? Are there any steps I should definitely take? Should I try to email/send LinkedIn messages to recruiters and ask if they have anything for me? Also, I realize there is a stigma around this, but if I could get a well-paying internship in PM that could lead to a full-time job I am open to that as well. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has gone through a similar transition before."

** *Introduction of NOT_QUEEN (the new community manager) **


She's a small time streamer who has over 1000h in the game. She has experience in management and event planning/design. She is also local, meaning she will actually will be able to ~~shout~~ talk with the devs in the office as she will be working there. So Basically she is the bridge between the community and the devs. She'll be the voice of the community and we wish her best of luck.

**New PTB**


New PTB will be available on the 4th of April (tuesday). ""We have a new huge patch coming. It's 1.5. We usually put a whole number when it's a little significant (really Mathieu? I would have never guessed :D ). As you all know we are heading to a new chapter. ...&gt; &lt;... We want to really migrate everything we been working on into the live branch ...&gt; &lt;... So the patch notes for 1.5 are pretty big I will go through some of the stuff ...&gt; &lt;... So the new PTB next week is not going to show you anything from the new chapter. No new killer. No new survivor. No new map. However all the changes we have, bug fixes, the new content and that's what we need your help to test and make sure it solid, so then we can push the 1.5 patch. Once we are satisfied that this is very solid and it's live and everyone is enjoying it. Then we can release our DLC.""



He also mentions he dosen't have a date for the DLC as if they aren't satisfied with the PBE they won't push it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Patch notes (not shown, just a few things mentioned)**


* Full controller support for the game
* UI reworked
* Localization for Korean
* Info status effect display in the hud ""which should probably require a lot more explanation then that. But essentially we are getting to a point in the game we have so many states that you can be in because of the perks, add-ons and powers and what's nots. So what we did was a bit of design rework where we could sort of bunch together a few of the things that so we have status effects that are a little bit general"" Mathieu then proceeds to give an example of sprint burst,adrelanine and balancing landing sharing the same ""exhausted"" state after use. So while it's on, any perks that uses it, can't be activated.
* Surprise bear trap change ( look at first Q&amp;A question. wink wink nudge nudge)
* Bear trap sabotage time increased from 8s to 16s
* Bear disarm time from 5s to 2.5s
* Bear trap and hag trap placement time reduced by 2s (1s of beginning animation and 1s of ending animation)
* Adjusted rarities for perks and probabilities in the bloodweb
* Crows now circle around survivors much closer
* NOED is now Hex:NOED. Noed activates on any unactivated totem (* cleansing totems intensifies) 
* Nerfed iron grasp (as killer player: GASP!!! )
* **BUT** Hooks repair after 3min (180s)
* Removed firecrackers, they wont spawn in chest or bloodweb. But they will still be available if you have them in your inventory.
* Save the best for last changed
* Lightborn/Shadowborn changed???
* Fixed a bug where players got stuck on pulsating when accepting a invitation to a private lobby
* Fixed moonwalking (BOOO!!!)
* Fixed camera
* Fix killer floating after window vault


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Q&amp;A**


* **""Question about traps under hooks"" - NOT_QUEEN**


""Yes, that's the next one here it says: removed the ability for killers to place bear traps under hooks"" - Mathieu


""There we are"" - NOT_QUEEN


""Boom"" -Mathieu


( [Enough said](https://media.giphy.com/media/rl0FOxdz7CcxO/giphy.gif) )


* **""Fix on pallet looping?**


They want to implement a new mechanic called rage ""title work in progress""-Mathieu. In a nutshell, the longer the chase, the faster the killer becomes. Might not be in PBE.


* **Any fix on SWF?**


In a nutshell, they changed how it works. Before it worked that killer lobby would open up to more ranks when time goes on. They added this to survivor side now as well.


* **Do you take internships**


Yes, they take talented. Go to schools for them. Internship paid. (May as well include this one)


* **Any news about the PS4 version**


""As we said in the past, the console version is coming to PS4 and XBOX one and they are coming this summer. I can not be more precise than that.""


* **DLC paid or free**


""Marketing doesn't let me say that""


* **Are you going to buff a lot of survivor/killer perks?**


""Shaved the best for last (oh Mathieu XD"") which is being reworked in the current patch notes. Devour hope (1 token removed, 2 token faster movement from hooks). Thrill on the hunt is being reworked."" They won't all be completely reworked. I don't think he mentioned all perks as he said ""many of them will be reworked"" (Or I could be wrong here).


* **Fix for killer fov coming?**


""So that's not FOV bug, but camera position...&gt; &lt;... There has been no progess on this right now.""


* **Are you considering hosting an event where DBD players have a chance to play with and/or against the dev of the game**


""Second day on the job, and Im already trying to officialize (yea not a real word) DBD tournaments. So we are going to have a set of rules which will be strict. And then we are going to have assets that we are giving the organizers. And then we are going to give them rewards, of course. ...&gt; &lt;...Soon™ . ""


* **You done a lot of stuffs to Twitch streamers. Are you going to do something for Youtubers?**


""We do have something we want to do for youtubers, but right now we are waiting for an approval from youtube.""


* **What about other ways for survivors to escape killer: doors, vents, etc.**


""Yea.. later. It's on the big board. So many months later, not soon™, but months later.""


* **Will firecrackers be available in KYF?**


""Very good question that I don't have the answer""


* **Are you planning or working on a new Macmillian Estate map? And when can we expect the new killer cosmetics?.**


""Yes"" (for first question).
""We do have new cosmetics. But we can't show them"".


* **Will you ever make depipping a ban-able offense?**


* **What are you views on survivors working with the killer?**


They want to do temporally ban. But they can only currently do a pernament ban. They want to do: ""Let's say the first offense is 24h, the second 7 days, then a month and then whatever we decide"". They don't agree on that playstyle, but they don't want to perma ban them either.


* **What do you think the length of games?**


""Games are too short, we want them to last a bit longer ...&gt; &lt;... We don't want to force it ...&gt;"".


* **Scratchmarks?**


""It din't make it to the patch"" ( BOOO!!!)


* **Are you planning to do anything with your 1 year anniversary? **


They don't have a solid plan for this. But would love to do something.


* **Double bloodpoint weekends?**


""There are no double bloodpoint weekends scheduled for the next.... 2 days"". (k then...)


* **Will you allow trapper to place traps close to one another (basically to set trap on ground when you have one)**


Short answer: no


* **Chase music covers footstep and other sounds**


Works as intended. So it's ""harder to focus"" while in the chase.


* **Left 4 dead black shirts when?**


Soon™


* **Rewards for rank 1**


They are reworking the ranks system, so not right now.


* **Can there be an ultra-rare perk that makes so hooks unbreakable?**


""Yea, that's rly rly cool. It's funny cause I took this pile of questions and turned to Dave and ok Dave, lighting round. And I just asked all these questions super fast to get answer and he said OH that would be super cool ...&gt; Also when I turned around like this *shows turning* at the lighting round... that's when I broke his mug. And then I ran outside and went to the store and got the same mug and placed it on his desk"".


* **When is the lunge range bug for the wraith is going to be fixed?**


*Looking at paper for bug fixes intensifies* (No rly... they actually did that)


* **Muffle sounds? **


Muffle sounds fixed


* **Are you going to buff totems?**


"" ...&gt; It's a design question and I don't have an answer""


* **Can you reduce the amount of perks by combining some?""


So maybe some of the perks might be reworked and combined.


* **Smaller level 50 bloodweb? Cause hard to get perks**


""Good question, good idea""


* **How many devs working in team? **


8-10 ""you got to realize, it's a small team"" - NOT_QUEEN


* **Fix swamp map, it's too small**


""Fix swamp map, it's too small. *sarcastically* CHA!""


* **Hillbilly flick?**


""No""

I'd say I am doing ok against my peers, scoring above average on my exams.  not struggling or failing out out by any means, but I am feeling seriously overworked and exhausted right now.  

By that metric, Id say I am prepared for the workplace,  But after being denied from serval internship positions in a row this week, I cant help but feel that I am barely staying afloat in a sea of geniuses entering the workforce.  This overwhelming sense of dread that I am falling behind and I will never catch up is hitting me and I cant kick it.

What advice could you give to a soon-to-be graduated engineer that is beginning to lose hope in his abilities?

How did you differentiate yourself to land that first big internship?

What steps can I take while I am still in school to arm myself for my future as an engineer?

62h65n,10,2017-03-30,Admitted. Is Penn the right place for me?,5_9_0_8,UPenn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/62h65n/admitted_is_penn_the_right_place_for_me/,"I know the post sounds incredibly entitled right off the bat - but bear with me. 

I've been admitted with the class of 2021 to the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. I applied for economics, but in reality I'm closer to undecided - my interests are basically a broad cluster around the social sciences. 

I've done the research up and down, and academically Penn just amazes me. I think I might choose PPE, and programs like PIK are pretty interesting. It's also the only school I know of that offers a Behavioural Econ major (even if in Wharton, not CAS). I also know that Penn is actually top 5 in some humanities fields, and not just in business/engg. But at the same time, I've come across some anecdotal (both personal and secondhand) evidence that I... might not love Penn. 

Maybe a heuristic to capture my worries is this https://newrepublic.com/article/120185/inside-americas-number-1-party-school-university-pennsylvania which I've been told isn't very reliable, but which I'm looking to you to shed some light on. Either way, I'd say the essence of my worries is that Penn is a) pre-professional b) exceedingly social. On a), I don't think I would be comfortable in a pre-professional environment with pervasive peer pressure to get that next internship. Just a personal preference, not a value judgment. On b), I'm fairly introverted - and obviously what worries me is not ""is Penn social"" (obviously yes) but more like ""if you are not exceedingly social then is Penn difficult"" for which I'd particularly like to hear from introverted Penn students and whether they feel like they can't find a space. 

In addition, does the economics major at Penn play second fiddle to business? I've heard this is generally true at places with a strong business program, eg. Penn, NYU, Stanford.

I know I come off as exceedingly negative, but I'm honestly looking to have my view changed. I know the reliability of my understanding is suspect, so if you have a way to address my concerns, I'd love it if you could.

Thanks!"

I'm also interested in potentially pursuing computer or electrical engineering rather than CS if I choose Brown, but I'm happy with CS at Berkeley if I choose to go there. I'm interested in going to grad school later on too and I'd like to have undergraduate research opportunities (ideally in AI or robotics) wherever I go along with internship opportunities. If I don't end up going to grad school, I'd like to work in Silicon Valley.

If anyone has strong opinions about the following schools, let me know - SLO for CS, USC for CSE, UVA for CS. I was also waitlisted at CMU (SCS), Cornell, and Columbia, but the odds are pretty slim that those are gonna change.

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside sthw fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

I'm a freshman CS major. I did fairly well in my first quarter, but absolutely messed up my second. Surprisingly, got a C+ in Math and I'm expecting less in Physics. I hope I can get a B in CS. 


I'm sure that these grades aren't a reflection of my ability. After doing poorly on a CS midterm and project, my confidence was totally shattered and I guess I let that fear get to me. I was doing okay in everything until the last 3 weeks. But the combination of fear, poor planning and low self confidence mean that I had basically given up during the most crucial part of the term. I poured everything into a desperate attempt to save my CS grade but my Math and Physics suffered as a result, and my CS Projects didn't turn out too well either. As a result I bombed my Math and Physics finals. 

What I'd like to know is
1) How much will this crappy quarter hurt my chances of landing a decent internship in 2018?
2) Did anyone have a similar situation and manage to bounce back?

I apologize for the negative post, but I feel like my career is crashing before it even starts. I'm putting everything into this next quarter in the hope of bouncing back. I really do enjoy computer science, even the theoretical stuff. I really want to be the best engineer I can be. 
Thanks for reading, it means a lot."
62icn6,0,2017-03-30,"I [21 M] was talking to a girl [21 F] that goes to my college last week, and then I texted her a bit on Sunday and asked her to get lunch, suddenly she stopped responding. Should I just give up?",sergsr432,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62icn6/i_21_m_was_talking_to_a_girl_21_f_that_goes_to_my/,"First some context.

This girl was in one of my classes last semester. I crushed on her from afar for a while, and finally towards the very end of the semester (December) I finally decided to sit next to her and start talking to her. We talked a bit and I asked her if she had a study group for the final, she said yes and gave me her number, and I ended up studying with her a few days later. Honestly after this we had still barely had much in the way of real conversation, so I wanted to ask her to lunch to get to know her more. I realize during finals week isn't the best time for things like this, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway since I knew she was a senior (I'm a junior) and I might not get another chance with her after this.

I texted her basically asking if she'd like to get lunch after the pressure was off from the exam since ""you seem like a cool person and I'd like the chance to get to know you more"". She responded saying that she was flattered, but that she wouldn't have time, and she said ""maybe sometime in the future as friends"".

Anyway, that was basically it for a while, but this semester (about a month ago) I saw that she was running a booth to promote an on-campus organization she was starting, and I went up and talked to her. She was friendly and gave me info about it, I decided to start going to their events and talked to her a bit more there. Last Thursday I was at an event that she was at, and afterwards during the reception I talked to her some more, and stuck around until we were the last two people there, and then I walked with her as she went to the library to study, before I went back to my room. It wasn't *that* much time spent talking to her, and it was still mostly small talk and casual conversation, but I felt like it went reasonably well, and at the end she said that it was nice talking to me again.

A few days later (Sunday) I decided to text her to get some info about an internship that she had mentioned on Thursday (it was one she had done the previous summer that worked out well for her), since I was still looking for stuff to do over the summer. She responded pretty quickly (less than 10 minutes) and gave me some helpful info, and I then asked a followup question and again she answered quickly with a paragraph of text. After this I decided to give asking her to lunch another shot. I figured even if she wasn't interested in dating she might want to go as friends (as she had previously indicated back in December), and to be honest I wouldn't mind being friends with her since she seems like a really cool person (though obviously I'd prefer to date her if she was interested). So I just texted her thanking her for the info, and then said ""by the way, if you're not too busy, do you want to meet up for lunch sometime this week?"". I figured this way she could interpret it either as getting lunch just as friends if that's what she preferred, or as something more like a date if she had become more interested since last semester.

But she never responded to that, and now it's been four days, so I figure I'm probably not getting a response at this point. I realize the obvious advice is probably to just move on, but I was wondering if there's anything else I can do here. I might end up seeing her at another event for that organization in the near future (though I'm not sure when their next event will be) so I might end up talking to her again in person. I figure it would be a little awkward to talk to her knowing she had straight up ignored or forgotten to respond to my text about lunch (unless there was some technical error and the text never went through, but I'm pretty sure it did).

So yeah, is there any way to salvage this, even just to get to hang out with her as a friend? Is there any sort of followup text I can send without seeming desperate/cringey/entitled? Should I just wait until I see her again in person? If I do talk to her in person should I bring it up in any way, or should I just act like I never texted her that?

The main issue is that she graduates in less than 2 months, so if I want this to go anywhere (either dating or even just being friends) I've got to do something relatively soon, or I'm probably just never gonna see her again.

And yes I realize sometimes these things just don't work out and it's best to just move on, so I don't want you guys to think I'm overly obsessed or anything. It's just that she's a really cool and attractive girl and I wouldn't want to miss the chance to have her in my life in some way.

Thanks for the advice. (And sorry for the wall of text.)
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Met a girl I had a crush on in a class last semester during finals, I asked her to lunch and she said she was too busy during finals, but maybe sometime in the future as friends. This semester we talked some more and I tried asking her to lunch again (ambiguous as to if it was a date or a friend thing), she never responded to my text. Now I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to salvage the situation (even if it just leads to us being friends, which IMO would be better than nothing) or if I should just move on.

EDIT: I'm not going to text her and I'm not going to go out of my way to talk to her again. Though if I happen to run into her again at some point I don't see any reason to deliberately avoid talking to her."

I'm a freshman CS major. I did fairly well in my first quarter, but absolutely messed up my second. Surprisingly, got a C+ in Math and I'm expecting less in Physics. I hope I can get a B in CS.

I'm sure that these grades aren't a reflection of my ability. After doing poorly on a CS midterm and project, my confidence was totally shattered and I guess I let that fear get to me. I was doing okay in everything until the last 3 weeks. But the combination of fear, poor planning and low self confidence mean that I had basically given up during the most crucial part of the term. I poured everything into a desperate attempt to save my CS grade but my Math and Physics suffered as a result, and my CS Projects didn't turn out too well either. As a result I bombed my Math and Physics finals.

What I'd like to know is 1) How much will this crappy quarter hurt my chances of landing a decent internship in 2018? 2) Did anyone have a similar situation and manage to bounce back?

I apologize for the negative post, but I feel like my career is crashing before it even starts. I'm putting everything into this next quarter in the hope of bouncing back. I really do enjoy computer science, even the theoretical stuff. I really want to be the best engineer I can be. Thanks for reading, it means a lot."

While I have yet to sign on the dotted line, I will likely be doing an engineering internship this Summer in DC. I'm super excited about the opportunity and the adventure of it, but have some apprehensions.

I'm currently looking at renting an AirBNB for the summer at a decent rate about 4 miles from downtown.  The owner seems cool and it seems like I should have a great time living there. However, by living in non-intern specific housing I run into the issue that I will only be interning with one other person, and as such have a very limited social outlook.

While I haven't talked with my co-intern yet, I'm hoping we get along, of course. He's a local and hopefully can show me around a bit and introduce me to his friends. However, given the (hopefully unlikely) scenario that we don't get along and I can't buddy up with him, I'd like to not live the introvert life while in our nation's capital and surrounded by a ton of things to do!

Would anyone here have advice on things I can look into to meet people? I don't currently use any social apps (Tinder, etc.) because I'm not a fan of the premise, but I may break down and get one just for the trip. Also, I know there's thousands and thousands of interns in the city during Summer, so I feel like there has got to be some kind of venue for meeting outside your work group.

Just looking for any thoughts you all might have on it. Thanks!"

I hope that this post can be only encouragement for new kids looking at this sub who want to start working in the tech field, wherever that may be (Networking/Programming/Administration). 

My father died a couple years ago from cancer and it put of a lot of perspective on my life in terms of what I wanted to do as a profession. My first two years of college I was a business student studying marketing (I was 20 at the time) with no idea what I was going to do in the future. I was very scared as to what I would do to support myself in the future because I instantly knew that I would have to help my Mom as well. 

At first, I was obsessed with the Anonymous movement on social media, which I quickly realized was totally ridiculous, and starting reading real posts from people here saying, ""If you really want to be a hacker, get your CCNA first and develop a true understanding of Networking before you even attempt to write/use programs to infiltrate networks."" No advice could have been better for me in terms of developing a career. I instantly realized that there was a whole different side to ""hacking"", which was defending networks and having a true understanding of networks to where you could program your own tools and not be a ""script kiddie"". 

This instantly got me hooked and I committed myself to get my CCNA Security and learn Python in and out. I can say that I have never been guided in a more right direction than getting the feedback from people here on this device. I still consider myself a complete amateur in Network Security but achieved my CCNA Security and have written several Python IPV6 petnest tools in the last couple years and could not have done it without this sub-reddit.

I officially got an internship with Cisco starting this next January and I broke down when I got the confirmation. I could not have done any of this without you all and hope you know that your advice, even on little things, has been such a help in a world that I still am learning. 

Cheers!

To anyone looking to enter the field:

Work hard and be humble. never be afraid to ask others for advice and learn constantly. My favorite resources are this sub, Stack overflow (for programming) and Cisco DevNet for learning automation. If you are someone who wants to enter Cyber Security (Infosec), I highly recommend getting a Sec+ and learning Python well.

62jzug,3,2017-03-31,Sorting Oneself Out,jp_fan,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/62jzug/sorting_oneself_out/,"I am lost in my thoughts these days. Currently, 24 and graduating from prestigious university in Computer Science. I found JP in December and since then was enamoured by his materials. One of the topics he emphasised is to sort oneself out.

I support JP on Patreon and have been given access to self-authoring programs. My plan is to submit my dissertation and then spend inordinate amounts of time writing.

My problems are multi-faceted. I did an internship last summer at a bank as software engineer. Felt pretty stupid and just could not muster enough interest. I felt rather dead after working with computer whole day and felt like a slave to be honest. I hoped to have it different by applying to smaller places but their tech interviews are very difficult and having done around 6 already, I can't get invited myself to onsites.

Truth be told, I feel like having wasted 4 years of my life in a subject that is not that important to me. I am not sure what it is: losing interest in the field or other issues. These include depression, lack of sleep(can't sleep longer than 4 hrs a night for years), brain fog and tiredness. Anxiety. I went to a bunch of doctors to only have been told it is depression, take SSRIs and hope for the best.

I consider myself okayish IQ, around 120 definitely but it seems to not be enough for programming jobs. Most people at my uni are smarter than me and seem more interested in life.

JP mentioned in his talks that one cannot help depressed person when: unemployed, no friends, no relationships, no purpose, bad diet/health/exercise regime. If any of 3 are combined, then until they are fixed, no one can help that person.

I am currently meeting first 4 criteria. I have some friends but they are not close. Never was in a relationship because no one really showed interest.

The last point in JP list, I exercise and eat healthy but still feel like crap every day. I went to therapy for relationship issues. It somewhat shed the light on my issues but did not improve my situation in this area.

So, in summary, I feel unwell, without purpose, relationships and find it hard to even obtain a job in my field I trained for 4 years. Do you guys have any advice? I want to sort myself out but besides self-authoring, I am in the void."

I just need to vent or rant, or just tell some people that might understand my physical cringe, so I'm sorry if I'm being terribly negative or whatnot.

So little backstory, my GF and me (21/27), have been together over 2 years, happy as rainbow farting unicorns. We are both 110% Childfree, Marriagefree, cleared that up as early as second date (?) ""We'll simply buy a Bentley instead"". I even showed her this sub and she reads it much more frequently than I ever did.
--&gt; HI G!
Basically the only thing that keeps us both from getting fixed are concerns about side effects from the procedures (I still feel the effect of what had been a ""small error during a routine operation"")

Anyway after a brief but definitive position in ""Corporate consulting hell"" I am currently in a kind of ""trial time""(convince investors and boss lady that I have the balls and experience) for a managing position at a startup.

Now since this startup is trying really hard to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" and of course ""feature a company culture like google"" (None of which goes beneath the surface), my current workplace is at a large 6 person table. Kind of like a shared office, two or three people from other startups or companies often sit at the same table, as this startup currently only consists of bosslady, intern M and me.

So these two other people. Lets call them tryhard cool dude and Mombie stereotype ""look at me, im working too"". 

I really thought tryhard cool dude was an ok guy at first. I mean cool beard, tats on his arms. He just behaved a little strange and ""lifeless"", you know as if any joy or energy had faded from his face and eyes long ago. However it wasn't long until he urged everyone to marvel at how he made a close-up portrait of his ""baby"" doing ""stuff"" his wallpaper. We're talking a 17inch screen with an image of this thing screeching or whatever. Was this ANY other kind of human or pet one would have deleted this photo right away for being shitty and visually unappealing. But hey, look its a baby. and so cute. So lets instead stare at a painfully enlarged version of it for hours. Nightmare fuel.

But we haven't even come to the best part yet.

Introducing Mombie ""IM WORKING"".
Up to 4 days per week this person will show up for 3-5 hours to ""work"". Intern M and I agree, that we've never really seen her doing any actual work for longer than maybe 30mins. Most of her time is spent on social media and taking breaks to ""go for a walk"".
Imho this is one of those ""people"" that went into their adult life thinking ""I don't need to do sh1t ever anyway, I'll just find some poor bastard, chain him to me, poop out babeeeees and be a **fulltime mom**"" but then we're faced with the awkward social obligation to pick up some kind of alibi working activity because their parasite doesn't require round the clock surveillance after all. So to put their psychology / history / art degree to good use they pick up some kind of part-time job. So shell come in to work irregularly and pretend to contribute to society.  

But most of the time shes talking to the aforementioned baby wallpaper dude. And they only have one. single. topic. of. conversation.

Nothing else, ALL THEY TALK ABOUT ARE THE UNGODLY RESULTS OF THEIR BLINDLY HORMONE-DRIVEN PROCREATION.

It all started when one day both of them had what I can only call ""a pissing contest who gets the least sleep, because both of their crotchgoblins for some reason deem 3:15am a decent time to get up in the morning"".
I simply focussed on work until mombie apparently felt the need to include the third person in the room in the discussion about how it's SOOOO GREAT to go to bed at 21:00. ""How I manage to sleep so much"". Ohgodwhy.png

Trying really hard to stay as neutral / calm as possible I explained to her how I probably wouldn't be able to get any sleep at such a time (I have issues falling asleep in general, sleeping prior to 00:00 would be almost impossible) and how I enjoy social activities or gaming in the evenings.

""So when do you plan on having kids"" OHGODWHY.GIF

(Trying to be polite) ""My GF and I are very clear on this subject, we won't be facing sleep shedule issues because of offspring""

(I knew what was coming before she even opened her mouth""

""How old is your.....""
""No that's not the issue, we've agreed on PERMANENT SOLUTIONS"" (Serious facial expression, strong eye contact)

After that luckily neither of them tried to introduce me into their baby talk again.

I mean Babymom is seriously trying to introduce that single topic of conversation in each and every F+cking circumstance.

-Me talking to Bosslady about an artist for our plattform- ""...I've collected some of her work here, looks pretty good. However apparently she is in paid maternity leave right now -"" 

""OH THOSE ARE JUST ALWAYS THE BEST""

""...""

Yeah, the ability to reproduce is clearly a very special / unique trait and should be the single quality making this candidate eligible. 

jesusf+ckingchrist

Bosslady and Intern aren't working here today, I arrived to the pleasant sight of Mombieworker and tatoodude talking about the joy of giving birth, mixed in with ""what are the best presents to give for conception and birth"".

I mean. 

WAT.

Help me.

I recently graduated college a year ago and a short while before that i was employed as a network technician and loved it but the pay wasnt great. At the start of this year i decided to get a new job and hopefully get paid enough to move out. 

I managed to get a job at a small company after two successful interviews and the pay was alot for someone with my lack of experience and so i was optimistic. I spoke to the person in charge and in the interview and when i first started they spoke positively about the company growing and expanding rapidly and me becoming a senior member. 

I quickly noticed early on that i wouldn't be involved in anything like i have before and this position was more about giving presentations (which i suck at), project management and writing system processes  to use when dealing with customers. 

I didn't lie in my interview and even showed them examples of what I've done (set servers up, write scripts etc). I don't have business written anywhere on my resume.

Depsite this i thought I'll try my best to see if i could get good at this and saw it as a challenge. 

Fast forward to today and it's really getting me down. If my boss doesn't call me into his office at least 3 times a day to criticise me or micromanage me i view it as a good day.

My boss called me in today and bought my work up(writing business processes) and said this work is useless to us and all your previous work is and my interns did a better job and basically suggested if i need to improve quickly. I ask for help but all i get is i don't want to show you how to do things i want you to come up with new ideas but i feel stupid because i don't know.

I'm not an emotional person but after this when i was alone i burst into tears at how stupid I look.

In my previous job i was the goto guy for help but here I feel like nothing i know applies and i feel worthless.

Am i being too sensitive? Or should i look for a new job and put moving out on hold?"

The Guardian is planning to lose ~$100MM this year in cash after losses of around $250MM last year. They're making some pretty drastic cuts in people, office space, and operations. All is not lost however as they are funded by a trust who still has over $900MM in the bank. 

&amp;nbsp;


**My Take**

Out of context the news that a big publisher was suing Rubicon seemed like a sign of the times for the dumpster fire that has become Rubicon. But this to me smells more like a desperate move by The Guardian's executives, one of those ""if you don't like the conversation, change the topic"" type moves. Regardless it'll be interesting to see what (if anything) we can glean from the case on how this particular SSP makes their margins.

Until recently ads for Chase were showing up on 400k sites a month. Ever since the brouhaha around ads next to terrible Youtube content and fake news and the like Chase decided to audit those sites. It took only the 12k where people interacted with the ads and... and I'm not making this part up... made an intern click on and categorize all 12,000 of those links. In the end they found that only 5k of those sites were ""brand safe"" enough for them. In the weeks that followed their KPIs didn't drop. 

*Ya don't fucking say? The real news here is that in 2017 Chase still wasn't running any sort of whitelist on its programmatic selling (or auditing it in any way). One other nit from me... in 2017 and they're still using the click the determine site worth. When will we get past this? Also that intern deserves a fucking medal.*

62luhw,2,2017-03-31,[Question]Campus IT Job Vs Internship,PhlyingHigh,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/62luhw/questioncampus_it_job_vs_internship/,"I am currently a Junior in college and plan on graduating May 2018. I am a Computer Science major but have gotten into IT work on campus and really enjoy it and will most likely peruse it after college. 

I currently work for my college's IT department as Desktop Support for the college of Education, biggest college on campus. It is a great part time job and I am getting a lot of experience, it is a Tier 2 IT position. The manager has talked about how a few of the workers graduated from the college in my position and instantly got a classified job with the University.

I got an offer from an nonprofit HR development company to be apart of their IT support staff. I have not asked what tier IT it would be considered(Should I ask that?) but from the description and what they have told me it sounds like I'll be answering phones and helping troubleshoot for other companies using the HR software. The pay is about $5 more an hour which would be nice, but my end goal is to get a job out of college not make an extra buck right now.

When a company is looking at my resume for a job after college would they prefer to see 1 year Tier 1 IT, 10 months of Tier 2 IT, and a summer internship of Tier 1 or 1 year Tier 1 IT and 1 year of Tier 2 IT?"
62lzvb,2,2017-03-31,"24 yrs old - In a Financial Disaster, Going to college, and Trying to become a better person",terpredpill,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/62lzvb/24_yrs_old_in_a_financial_disaster_going_to/,"I don't want to make this post long so ill cut right to the chase.

I've been reading and learning about TRP for about 3 years(When I first turned 21). However, I first started changing my life with women when I was 19 after getting into RSD and the whole ""pick-up"" community. Which was a nice way to begin my transformation but not a permanent solution like TRP.

When I was 18 my father took out a credit card in my name(Because we have the same name). and I Okayed it because he said he would pay the money back and take care of it. I trusted him.

A few months later I told I see that he is starting to miss payments and I begin to worry. Next thing that happens is he was convicted of a felon and sent to jail for the next 12 years. Leaving me with $3,000 to pay on a credit card. 

By then my credit had already started to take a hit. I had already had another credit card that he convinced my to take out through discover card that was $1,000. I ended up maxing it out mainly because of him and other things that just pilled up. 

Next thing I know I am on my own. My mother has 5 other kids and can't help me with anything and there is really no other family that is able to provide financial support. 

So I am on my own. Father is in jail for the next 12 years and I did not have anywhere to go or turn. So I lived with a friend for a few months and worked and heavy lifting type job lifting equipment and I decided to apply to go to University. I was accepted and able to go to school full-time and took out a few student loans and lots of financial aid to cover the cost

The creditors eventually became very aggressive demanding I pay such and such amount that I did not have. By this time my credit had gone to complete shit. 

This all happened when I was about 21-22. Now I am in my second year of University and feel very down about my SMV when it comes to my finances and not just SMV but my wellbeing in the future. 

I am studying computer science and have potential internships lined up for the summer but nothing set yet. God knows I need it. 

So my question for you guys would be this...(Especially RP'ers who are 30 and over or out of their 20s)

 I work a side job but that only pays regular wages that comes up to about 100$ or so every two weeks or so.

I am also still trying not to be a complete loser and maintain and small social life with women and friends(Although this is a bare minimum). With women even though all of my shit is fucked up(pretty much) I still manage to attract pretty high quality females. I think this is mainly because the proven fact women are attracted to drive, ambition, willpower, and where you are going versus where you are. Unless you have already built a successful situation then women of course love this because SMV. But still that ambition and drive and moving forward needs to be there.


Anyway, What would be some advice to me about this situation? How do I get my financial life on Track while still finishing my computer science degree(Which is very tough by the way, at a top 10 comp sci school).

All advice is welcome!

62m76m,2,2017-03-31,Do I bother asking for raise when I have very little leverage? Need to figure out before the end of the day.,throwaway123123322,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62m76m/do_i_bother_asking_for_raise_when_i_have_very/,"I'm a high school senior who interned last summer at a local software engineering startup as a software engineer. The startup is doing quite well right now, dozen employees and business is ramping up. The CEO is pretty chill, he offered to pay me even though I initially was cool with doing an unpaid internship. 

I was being paid $15 an hour, which to me at the time was quite reasonable considering I had 0 experience working in software at a company level. I worked extremely slowly on projects because I essentially had to figure everything out for the first time. CEO and coworkers were always willing to help me out and teach me new things and I appreciated that a lot. I had only taken two computer science courses at my high school, AP Computer Science and a data structures class. Overall though, when I made my final presentation covering everything I did that summer, I realized that I actually provided a decent amount of value to the company because I worked on a few projects that have saved our engineers a lot of time since they were implemented last summer.  

I accepted an offer to work again part time during this school year and during the summer. Pay hasn't come up, but I'm almost certain I'll be paid; he asked for the hours I worked this month for payroll work today.

So this is my dilemma. I'm heading into college next year, and my family is paying $35k a year for education (cs degree obviously) at a top uni in the US. I'd like to help them out obviously so I want to earn as much money as I can this year. Plus having extra money to spend on random stuff is nice. I am perfectly fine with working for $15 an hour, but if I could get a raise that would be amazing. I've read the entirety of http://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/ , but I've already accepted the job, not to mention I don't really have much leverage as a high schooler with no degree and little experience. I literally do not have any sort of BATNA. I got really lucky finding this internship and I don't trust my luck in finding another one. However, I am confident that my work output will be much higher than it was last year. I definitely don't want to come off as ungrateful/risk losing this job though. So if you think that I will come off this way, please let me know. 

So three questions, do I ask for a raise, and if so, how do I go about doing so tactfully (help with wording would be appreciated), and how much do I ask for? I was thinking of sending over my hours as requested and including a note about a possible raise over email to the CEO. I feel like all I have going for me is my perception that I'm better than I was last year. Any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks guys!

62magt,15,2017-03-31,Should I Choose Cleveland State?,nihilistviolet,Cleveland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/62magt/should_i_choose_cleveland_state/,"I made a similar post in the Ohio subreddit, but I'd like another set of opinions on this: I'm a soon-to-be 22-year-old entering college for the first time.  Up until recently, I was certain that I wanted to go to Cleveland State University due to its relative affordability, location, and internship opportunities.  However, I've also been accepted at Wright State University, which is closer to home (I live near Cincinnati) and slightly cheaper, and I'm starting to reconsider my choice.  I don't drive (currently), so going to Cleveland State would mean being isolated from my family pretty much completely.  On the other hand, going to Wright State would mean living in Dayton, a city which I hate with little to do and near-zero public transit.  So, even though I'd be closer to my family and would have an easier time returning for home visits, I'd be marooned on the campus if I don't manage to get my license by the start of the school year.  I think it's important to add here, and to be brutally honest about myself, that I'm a very shy, late-bloomer female with social anxiety disorder, which is why I have a little trepidation about going to Cleveland State, even though it seems more exciting.  It could turn out that being farther away from my family would force me to get out of my shell more than being closer to my family would, but it could also turn out to be a disaster.  Advice from people with experience with either college or city would be greatly appreciated!"

If this would be easier to put together in a script, I can try that too. I'm a beginner in terms of python, so while it would be a great opportunity, I don't know how to set up and run a script . I know how to write a for-loop, and I  know some basic syntax rules,  so I can definitely learn it. It's just real-world implementation and testing that I've never seen!

Any tips with this? Or some online walkthroughs for more complex models or GIS scripting? Most of the people I work with don't use any scripting or modeling, so I don't have any mentors that can point me in the right direction."

But I study differently from my peers. I have a learning disability.

When it comes to projects or case studies I have no issues. No stress, and I can knock them out fairly quickly.

When it comes to exams however, its a different story.

I study about 3-4 times as much as my peers to retain the same amount of info as they do. I always end up with a good grade on exams (90-100). But I definitely study WAY more and stress about it WAY more than my peers. If I don't study properly, or cant find the right time, I usually end up with around a 75. 

I hate taking exams for this reason, Most of my classes are all exam based and are made up of 500 or so points with 400 being 4, 100 point exams. the build up and uncertainty of not knowing or possibly failing and ruining my grade, having to retake it, pay tons of money, stay in school for longer and starting work later, etc. stresses me out. But I always end up doing okay!

If I have a Monday exam I will obsessively study for 30+ hours that weekend if I can find the time, going over problems multiple times and hoping I get it when it comes to test time. 

In reality, exams really are the only thing that stress me out.

I have no issue working long hours, Despite my stress when it comes to exams, I am good in a work environment that requires me to learn things as I do them. (I have had to do so with previous jobs computer systems and whatnot).

Anyways, I have 2 audit internships at a small to mid sized firm of around a 130 people coming up this summer and next spring. I decided B4 may not be the way to go because of my personality. I am just curious if anyone has insight as to how someone like me will handle the audit environment.

If I can expect to get as stressed as I do around exams, I think I might have a heart attack.

edit: I have had a stressful job in the past that required long hours, multitasking, and a very fast demand from many sources that stressed me out. BUT it was a totally different type of stress. That stress just wore me out for the day (or couple days if it involved a project) but I would just get it done because it was PROJECT related and I knew I was capable of doing it, and even if I wasn't, I could learn while doing it or work with my team and rely on them for help. That was something that I could probably live with. 

When it comes to exams, the stress that I am unsure if I am capable or not is part of what I have trouble with."

&gt; Thank you for contacting me to express your views regarding the Trump Administration. As always, I appreciate hearing your thoughts on issues critical to our city and nation.

&gt;President Trump has a responsibility to try to bring Americans together – not to continue to fan the flames of division and bigotry. Since taking office, his dangerous, incompetent policies and actions have jeopardized our national security, our economy, and our values. President Trump has sent alarming signals that he remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.

&gt;Democrats are committed to finding common ground for hard-working families, yet we will refuse to collaborate with an administration that undermines our values of diversity, inclusion and openness. Rather than create good-paying jobs and focus on protecting our national security, the President has enacted policies that tear families a part and make Americans less safe. While doubling down on a plan to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall that Mexico will never pay for, House Democrats are fighting for comprehensive immigration reform and pressing for the withdrawal of the President’s Muslim ban. Furthermore, we will not abandon the progress we have achieved under the Obama Administration, including on health care reform.

&gt;In the new Congress, President Trump and House Republicans have made clear they plan to place a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at the top of their agenda. Repealing the ACA would have severe consequences for the health of American families and would leave millions out in the cold without coverage. Not only would Americans see their premiums soar and their coverage collapse without the ACA, but any repeal would be responsible for the loss of roughly 2.6 million jobs throughout the country. We will not stand by and allow the dismantling of this historic law that continues to empower millions of Americans with the health security and economic freedom.

&gt;Every day the American people see new evidence of the financial, personal, and political grip the Russian government has on the President. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on American democracy was political thuggery in support of Donald Trump and there must be consequences. Yet, while House Democrats are unanimously standing up to protect the integrity of our elections, President Trump continues to praise Putin and tries to discredit, disparage and dismantle the U.S. Intelligence Community. Defending the sanctity of American democracy is more important than any partisan consideration. There must be a bipartisan, independent outside commission to understand how Russia hacked into our democratic institutions and to ensure it never happens again.

&gt;After failing to release his tax returns, the Congress has a responsibility to hold President Trump accountable for his conflicts of interest. Thus far, House Republicans have refused to join us in requiring the release of tax returns and starting an investigation into the Administration’s conflicts of interests. The American people deserve to know the President’s massive business entanglements and all potential conflicts of interests.

&gt;Only by recognizing and respecting the important contributions that all Americans make to our country’s success can we build an inclusive and stronger future. We refuse to normalize any egregious appointees or nominees who compromise our values. Simultaneously, we will continue to demand an independent investigation into the Russian hack and hold the Trump Administration accountable for the sprawling conflicts of interests. Our first responsibility is to protect and defend the American people.

&gt;Thank you, again, for contacting me. I hope you will continue to communicate with me on matters of concern to you. For more information on this or other issues affecting our city and our nation, please visit my website at http://www.pelosi.house.gov/ or sign up to receive e-mail updates at https://pelosi.house.gov/contact-me/newsletter-sign-up. 


.... and if you made it to the end, I congratulate you! Total word soup without even referencing Single Payer or how she intends to offer voters something. She (or rather, her interns) still managed to reference Russia, tax returns and Trump's cronyism though...

And for bonus points, she managed to get the gender of my honorific in the email incorrect (!).

I've realised I want to become a postman, preferably in a rural area but I don't mind doing it in a city. Currently, I can't find any vacancies for the city I'm in and I'm wondering how I actually become a postman?

62ntle,3,2017-03-31,Telling a kids mom he really wanted a gaming computer,pandaman0828,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/62ntle/telling_a_kids_mom_he_really_wanted_a_gaming/,"So this was my first time having a ""job"" (really it was an unpaid internship). So I got this gig at a computer repair and resale store (mainly to teach me how to care for and repair computers). This was in 2012 and at the shop we mainly had early 2000 desktop pcs meant only for menial tasks like word processing and the like. None of them had dedicated graphics and any ""newer"" computers we would salvage so they only had the minimum requirements for basic office programs. Taking extra ram sticks and dedicated graphics cards out and replacing them if with the lowest end ones we had if they didn't already have an on-board graphics chip. But back to the title... It was my first day being out in the front to do some sales and a mother and her, I'm guessing 12yr old, son came in looking for ""a computer for school"". When I asked what kind of programs it would be running since we had some that could handle low level Photoshop style programs the mother looked to the son and the son told me ""Steam"". Already being a pc gamer I asked who the publisher of the program was, making sure there wasn't a program that I didn't know about out there called steam not used for gaming. The boy responded ""valve"". And instantly I knew he was trying to get his mom to get him a pc to game on. Well the compassion center of my brain must have been shut off that day and I straight up said we don't have any decent pcs for gaming here, although if you want we can build a list of parts and put it together for you. His mom heard this and asked me what I meant. I told her that steam, a program by valve, was used to buy download and manage games. She looked to get son with the fire of hell in her eyes and slapped him in front of me. The horror of what I had just done began to wash over me as she began beratting him for tricking her and her husband into believing that he had NEEDED a computer for school, which he might HAVE needed it for school but was trying to juice it up for personal entertainment, but it was too late for him. I watched as he was dragged out by the ear, crying, saying he was sorry. But the damage was done. To the little boy whose pc gaming childhood I ruined, I'm sorry. I hope you eventually managed to get the gaming pc you were looking for to play the games you wanted."

Pied Piper* is the hot company in the Valley right now. Nobody's really sure what we do, but we're really good at it. We are a young, hard-charging, painfully trendy, tech firm. As such, we live up to all the stereotypes. Ping pong tables in the office, bean bags, a snack bar, ... and a ""unique"" corporate culture ... of which you're going to be a key part....

So who are you? The older buttoned-down corporate lawyer / office Mom who just wants to fit in? A young intern, who'll do what she's told? A useless programmer we can't fire but are determined to get our money's worth from? The HR person who has happiness as their only KPI?

Whatever character you choose, the idea is that you will end up as the office plaything, or at least mine, available to be teased, demeaned, degraded and humiliated. The details of that can be discussed, I have some specifics in mind, but it's what you find most interesting that I'm interested in exploring....

62oqi9,8,2017-03-31,"I do not believe accounting is right for my personality. I have done projects using SAP and XERO, and they gave me constant headaches. However I feel stuck from changing and my cognitively abilities are declining. Any suggestions?",college_change,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/62oqi9/i_do_not_believe_accounting_is_right_for_my/,"A little history about my choices: 

* At 18 I get forced into college by my dad and my own schooling addiction. I pick computer science because computers, video games, math, and physics are really relaxing to learn about.  

* During my school work, I get yelled at by poor teachers.  The books suck. The examples are terrible. I do not feel like I am learning at all. I have to modify my own school schedule so that my dad can pick me up from my classes. I made no friends. 

* When the summers hit, I just crash. Sleep, eat, and play video games all day for the most part. I only really start to think about college again within two weeks of it actually happening. I feel like a failure since I have zero direction or internship experience. I have no clue how to get them. Who would hire me?

* I keep switching majors: CS to CE to EE (electrical engineering). I finally feel overwhelmed and need a tutor. But they are too expensive, so I cannot get one. I freeze and skip the semester. 

* During my semester off I'm just crying and extremely sad by how much of a failure I am. I end up getting a part-time job. Work and making money helps to relieve my stress but the work itself was taxing. I needed another job. 

* However, the only way I knew how to get a job was be lucky or go to college. So I go back to college as a form of coping and try the engineering classes with some business courses. I feel like a failure because there are still no places to study on campus that are peaceful and the engineering statistics class was watered down (it followed the examples to a T) but I felt like a complete failure grade wise. 

* I switched to accounting without really understanding what it meant. First I took the courses and felt I was learning something. Then basically put my guilt and emotion into the grades. ""Made a B in an easy engineering course and a A in an accounting class. I feel that accounting is the better choice."" Ultimately, however, I used reddit to make my decision for me. It boiled down to there being more girls in accounting and that was the final major factor. 

* Three years studying accounting and I concluded that the topic isn't interesting at all. It gave me anxiety issues, PTSD, and mental ""vomit."" Before when I was in my engineering classes, I could go the entire semester without speaking much at all. But now, in the business courses especially, I had to do group assignments and presentations. I actually enjoyed the speaking presentations but the overall mental stress hit me considerably. 

* I danced between many, many majors: computer science, EE, CS, CE, mechanical engineering, physics, history, philosophy minor, logic minor, accounting, economics, finance, information technology systems. This is in part due to aspergers and not wanting to ""tie myself down."" However, I had to make a choice due to extreme penalties and consequences. 

* I picked accounting out of fear, anxiety, and nerves. I was done. I made my choice. I am an accountant and always will be an accountant. I never dated, never exercised, and never took any chances/risks. Another reason accounting was a good fit at the time in my perspective.
