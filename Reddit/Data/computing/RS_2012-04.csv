The requirements for the position are to be well versed with:xhtml/css, javascript/ajax, mySQL, and PHP.

While I have code snibbits from practice and projects here and there from different classes I have been in, I would rather put together a project that demonstrates proficiency with all the technologies above.  I need some ideas that would be easy enough to create in a few days time but would also show that I have a grasp on the languages.  Any ideas?

rnrty,0,2012-04-01,What should I do over the summer? (Currently a CS 1st-year undergrad),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnrty/what_should_i_do_over_the_summer_currently_a_cs/,"An internship would be best, I assume, but I didn't actually bother going to any of the career fairs since I was told (by several different professors) that companies basically never took on freshmen, and getting dressed up and going through the bother of missing classes (plus the inevitable anxiety) just didn't seem worth it. I'll need to begin attending them next year though, I know.

So, over the summer I suppose my two options are to either get a menial minimum-wage job, probably at our local movie theater since I already know two people working there, or skip the job and just focus on teaching myself something cool, like Clojure maybe, over the summer and keeping up 1-3 projects.

Right now I've only got one major side project going on, I've been working on it for about 6 months now in free time, but it's [a plugin for Minecraft SMP using the Bukkit API](https://github.com/Everdras/MCTowns), which is probably a bit too childish to actually mention specifically on a resume/application, so any projects I did would probably be iOS or Android apps, or if I actually find a need, a desktop application.

As for programming background, I've been coding in Java since mid-high school and just picked up C++ during college, as that's the language my uni uses as they teach basic programming and data structures. I also know a smattering of Ruby  (no Rails, unfortunately) and python. So I can probably teach myself anything I'd need to use for any project I took on.

I've never actually had a job before, so I just wasn't sure if it would look better on an application/resume to say ""I worked this summer at [local theater]"" or ""I spent this summer learning clojure and working on [1-3 GPL-licensed github projects]"".

So, what should I do this summer? Thanks in advance for reading. I know I tend to be long-winded."

I'm a college student who is weeks away from completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and have spent the last three years working feverishly as a Software Development Intern (30 hours a week) and student. I've been paid well and out of sheer fortune, have been employed at this company for 2 years (Since my second semester in college). I have a strong GPA (3.7) and am among the top students in all of my classes. My manager at work appreciates the work I do and intends to hire me as a full time Software Developer with a very competitive salary (at a well respected company) when I graduate. 

I'm a logical person, however, I feel like these accomplishments aren't that exceptional. I feel like I'm lazy, and should work harder and learn faster. That I could be so much further along if I had pushed myself. That I should have been an EE major or an ME major, something with more rigor, with more respect. I feel like because I did poorly in high school, that I will never be able to distinguish myself from the herd, and yet, I try so desperately to do so. 

My question to you is this:

How can I get over this feeling that I NEED to differentiate myself?
How can I feel happy with my accomplishments, instead of constantly feeling like I need to reach higher and further?
Is this just natural? Does everyone feel this way?

Thanks. "

I can't seem to pick between the two. They each have their pros and cons.

Ringling has a top notch reputation as being a hub for talented animators; however, I will get zero financial aid (32k per year!) and they seem to 'force' their students into working in a Pixar/Disney style. While I have no qualms about working in the mainstream style, I kind of want to do my own thing too (at least in my free time) and I'm worried about the lack of creative freedom. SCAD doesn't seem to have as good of a reputation (and the student work is not quite on par with Ringling's) but I can probably graduate in three years with 60k of debt and the chance to study abroad. I've also heard that their career services is not as good since the program is so huge. However, I have to say that I am leaning towards SCAD because of their aid package.

Are any of you guys grads of either programs? If you are, how did your job searches start out? If you are professionally working, have you got any tips for this starry-eyed student, whether it be about schools, internships or jobs?

Cheers! Thanks a bunch!"

rndil,2,2012-04-01,"After a week of ""no contact,"" I've gone numb...",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/rndil/after_a_week_of_no_contact_ive_gone_numb/,"This is a long one so if you're not in it for the long haul, feel free to skip to the end where the question is...

So here's the story, my ex (22F) broke up with me (24M) almost 3 months ago.  We met about 8 years ago and became friends.  We lived in different states, but her father lived near me and we would see each other when she came out to visit him around holidays and over the summers.  We had various ""flings"" over the years and maintained a lighthearted ""flirty"" friendship.  Almost 2 years ago now, I decided to fly out and visit her.  Feelings resurfaced on both sides and after a hectic summer we both admitted that we had fallen in love.  She still had a year of college left and I was now entering a phase of jumping from internship to internship until someone would hopefully hire me. Over the next year and a half we carried on our long distance relationship.  She finished school and moved to a big city where she got a ""grown-up job,"" I continued to jump from internship to internship in various states.  We would spend a few hours on the phone together everyday and we would see each other in person over varying lengths of time.  In January, while I was spending one last visit with her shortly before i moved out of state for another 3 months, she told me she couldn't handle the distance anymore and that we had to break up.  She said that ""it never felt like a real relationship,"" that she was ""growing to resent"" me, and that she couldn't keep waiting for me anymore.

After I moved away again she would still call me on her drive home from work like she always did.  She told me that she couldn't just cut me out of her life because I was her best friend.   On a couple of relatively humiliating occasions, I broke down and told her how badly I wanted to be with her again but she always replied that she had to do what was best for her and that even though it doesn't seem like it, breaking things off now was the best choice in the long run.  

She seemed to be doing fine with everything, but over the next 2 and a half months I felt worse everyday. Every time I hung up the phone, after talking to her, I was on the verge of tears.  My self-confidence (something I've always struggled with) was at an absolute all-time low.  I couldn't tell her how miserable I was because I couldn't handle hearing her say ""this is best"" again.  She was still my ""best friend"" but I couldn't tell her what was on my mind anymore.  
Eventually I decided that my last chance at getting past anything would be to go into ""no contact.""  I sent her a long winded e-mail explaining everything I was feeling.  I told her how miserable I was, how angry I was with her, and how humiliated I was.  I told her she could call me that night if she wanted, but the next morning I would be cutting all lines of communication.
She called that night and we spent a long phone call and skype conversation just kinda spilling our feeling to each other. I was surprised that she admitted that she still loved me and that she stills wants to be with me, but once again, the distance made things impossible.  She didn't want to do no contact but she accepted that it was what I wanted and that she would give me all the time I needed.

That was a week ago, so where am I now?  Honestly, I feel numb.  I feel completely emotionless.  I don't really feel sad anymore, I don't feel happy anymore either.  I am completely disinterested in the world around me.  I don't talk to people unless or leave the house I have to. There's a couple people in my life encouraging me to get out and be social again but I just don't have any will to do so. 
If I had typed this post a week ago, I wouldn't have been able to see through me tears, and now as far as my emotions are concerned, I'm writing a lab report.
And the strangest thing? Two days ago I was asked to fly out to her city for a job interview.

So my question is this: After a week of ""no contact"" I went from being a crying, miserable, wreck to a completely numb, emotionless, anti-social shell.  Is this improvement or regression?"

rn2ee,3,2012-03-31,Should I end it or keep working on it?,teersofhops,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rn2ee/should_i_end_it_or_keep_working_on_it/,"Hopefully he doesn't see this as he is also a redditor, but I don't think he comes to this subreddit. Anyway, this is a little bit lengthy, but I hope you'll read it.

Firstly, some background- I am 23(F) and he is 28. 
We first met five years ago, but only started dating about a year and 10 months ago. Our relationship moved pretty fast- we were basically living together for a while and were fairly serious. He helped through some really tough times (I had PTSD and was recovering from an assault I had faced at the hands of a peer). He has been very supportive and protective of me in the while we stayed together. We had a fairly loving relationship, and were almost playing house I guess.

-

We've been LDR for the last 8 months. I was living across the country (or continent, rather, since we're Canadian but I was down in the States) from September to December for an internship opportunity. Then, by a twist of fate, we swapped places as he went down there raise capital for his startup while I came back to school.

-


Anyway, some problems we've faced: firstly, I'm of Indian origin and he isn't. My family wouldn't mind him, except that he has been utterly disdainful of them from the beginning, and now they don't like him. In addition to this, he sees Indian culture as backwards, never wants to go there, and scoffed at my vegetarianism until recently. He said he changed his mind recently, but only after he sensed I was pulling away. 

-


Secondly, he recently decided he wasn't going to finish his undergrad until an indefinite later date. He started his undergrad at the same time I did, but was obviously about four years older than I am. We were both in a fairly specialized (&gt; 4 years) electrical engineering program when he decided to drop out, then changed faculties a bunch of times before deciding to do his startup. He is a really smart guy, but this has left me feel super disappointed, as I am almost done. The one thing big thing here is that I will likely be working abroad full time once I am done, but won't be able to sponsor him, and he may not be able to get an appropriate visa without an undergrad. I also don't really know what to say to my family, who were already not too happy that he switched out of engineering. 

-

My future earning power is also much higher than his now and because of this, he would make me spend on tickets and hotels for him to come visit me even though I couldn't afford it due to school. He later told me he just wanted to see me and keep me company, and I understand that.

-


Those are the two main problems. Others have included the fact that being with him started to become isolating. He didn't like me hanging out and drinking with my male friends (even though they were my friends out of necessity, being in engineering). He accused me of cheating a few times over the last 8 months, though I convinced him I wasn't and he believed me. He would argue with me frequently over trivial things, like using Linux over OSX (he preferred the latter) and would often tell me to get out or make me sleep on the couch. He would frequently ask me to choose between my family and him, saying if he wanted a traditional Indian girl who wanted her family, he wouldn't have dated me. He is fairly argumentative in general, and has gotten up in my friends' faces for disagreeing with him in the past (he can pull it off because he is a big guy), and would also get upset at me for telling him to stop.

-

I don't know what to do. I've been unhappy for a while, but I love him. We talked recently and he cried profusely, saying he was willing to change if I gave him a chance. He says he loves me and asked me remember all the good times we've had. His startup recently received a lot of funding (a LOT), and I think he's been using that to try and reel me back in, but I don't know. I love him so much. I really do. But this relationship stresses me out to the point that I am no longer attracted to him and I am scared that I'll be isolated from my friends and family.

What do I do? I am so scared. He comes back from the States this Thursday and I have to give him an answer.

**TL;DR** BF doesn't like my family/culture, dropped out of undergrad, does other things to stress me out. What do?"

There doesn't really seem to be a system in place to properly manage how Windows goes about starting up critical services when it's rebooted.  As it stands all I see is the system booting and all services making a bat-shit crazy dash for resources to get started. It's fucking stupid.

This is something I've been struggling with lately.  We're looking to implement completely automated Windows and AV updates on all of our machines using WSUS, Group Policy, and our AV Admin services.  THe problem I'm facing is that Windows only offers two options for starting services: Automatic and Automatic(Delayed), which translates to ""Mad Dash for Resources"" and ""Wait until those morons quit fighting, then start.""  This is obnoxious because it turns what could be a minute long process into a five to ten minute long process.  What's more obnoxious is that Linux can reboot in about a minute and have Apache, PHP, SQL, and FTP running.  

My question is this: is there anything I can do about this at all?  Are there any third-party services out there I can implement into our system to help manage this issue?

EDIT:
First off, before I start getting flamed out the ass, understand that I'm basically a junior system admin.  This is my first system admin job, and it's a small company and the people running it before were devs doing extra work.  I came in as an internship to help straighten things out and lightne their loads.  This is all shit I don't really understand and am trying to without schooling, which I'm actually in for Network Administration.  This is just temporary and I'd like to understand more."

Maybe I deserve it. I'm 20 years old, I haven't accomplished anything. I don't have a paying job(fucking intern), I don't have any degree. I'm going to be stuck living with this jerk forever and it isn't worth it. 

Everything is fucked up. I hate myself. She's made me hate myself. She laughs at everything I try to do, as condescending as possible. Oh, I'm trying to make it in graphic design? She'll laugh and ask how it's possible that anyone will pay me for my stupid childish hobby. 

It gets worse every day and I want to die. I can't move out. i don't have ANYTHING. No good experience, nothing. Who the fuck would hire me, anyways? I look like a stupid fucking hobo and everyone will probably laugh at me and think I'm disgusting.

My sister laughs at me, too. She often agrees with my mom. That whenever I get upset over this stuff I'm being dramatic, sensitive, and paranoid. And she calls me selfish every time I ever need anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to do everything they want!

I'm doing everything wrong. Maybe if I was the kind of daughter my mom wanted then I'd be ok. Maybe she'd even help me with the other shit that I'm going through. That's the worst thing. That the only help I really need from her she'll never give me. I don't know what I want anymore.

I am continuing my education and will be getting a Bachelors in CS here in 2 years, if all goes as planned. 

I would love to spend a year or two in japan working and exploring but it seems that all the information I have collected is random at best.

I am a native English speaker who has lived in the pacific northwest for all of my life and have very clear and precise pronunciation. I am Germanic, tall, blond, blu-eyed and a male just about to turn 20.

My understanding is that I need to be 21 and have a 4 year bachelors degree? But it seems many have gotten in on an AS degree but its mainly luck.

Is it worth getting a teaching certificate and attempting to look for work? What will increase my chances of getting work?

I would like to be able to do this before I graduate so that I can spend my last summer with an internship at Microsoft and get my foot in the door there as that's where I would like to start my career. 

Anyone have experience or advice? Thanks in advance! "

What I've noticed while working here one cannot even function at the univ without a computer...there has to be something there I just don't know how to pitch or word it.

I mean I'd be willing to do anything, especially sales (almost every job I've had in my life has been related to selling), but how useful will that be to a startup? If I could just get my foot in the door I'm sure that will lead to bigger and better opportunities.  
   
So what do you guys think? Should I try something like an internship, even if it's unpaid? I do have bills &amp; rent to pay, so should I work for free for a couple months just so it could lead to an opportunity with the company? I wouldn't mind working two jobs for a few months in order to do this? Any advice you could offer?

rrgzj,4,2012-04-03,Love the job-- But don't see a future. Help? (x post from KitchenConfidential),Dogwithrabiez,Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/rrgzj/love_the_job_but_dont_see_a_future_help_x_post/,"A bit ranty, I apologize.

I'm 19 years old, and went to culinary school directly after graduating high school. After an accelerated 6 month course, I worked as an intern at a one Michelin Star restaurant, and got hired after a couple months as garde manger.

I've been working at this place for a year now. The trouble is, I'm starting to realize that I don't see a future in doing this. No matter how much I love cooking and working the line, I just don't have a dream of running a kitchen of my own-- Not a real dream, anyway, if that makes sense. I realized that the want of running a kitchen as a chef was an ""expected"" dream that I sort of ran with because I figured that's what you did later on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I work the station faster than anyone, can plate three station's stuff, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment. I have a lot of passion for what I do, and always want to learn and always am excited to see new things.

It's hard though, to see myself really running a restaurant. Not because I don't want to do it, nor that I don't think I can do it a decade down the line, but just that it's not something I jump at. It's odd, and hard to explain, but... I just don't see a happy future as a chef. I've no trouble with long hours and low pay right now, but as I hear, hours only get longer and the pay doesn't get very much better later on(though money is honestly a non-issue). I guess what I'm most scared of is never seeing friends and family and regretting it later on in life.

Should I quit out while I'm ahead, go back to college for who-knows-what with the money I've saved from working, or should I push on and hope that I'll truly want to have a kitchen of my own someday, and that it'll turn out alright?

**tl;dr Love my job and being a cook, don't see a future as a chef. Should I go back to college or stick with culinary?**

rrbon,9,2012-04-03,Internships post graduating,Duffelbag,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/rrbon/internships_post_graduating/,"Hello /engineering!

I am an ME senior graduating soon in May. I have done an internship in the past; I applied for a full-time rotational position there but they went with someone with a better background and experience. I have continued to apply for entry-level positions I find but it gets frustrating not hearing back about any of the opportunities. 

My question now is: what is the general opinion about applying for internships after graduating? The company I interned with before liked me and they have several internships available this summer, in process engineering and other relevant fields. I feel I would get excellent experience out of several of these opportunities, and since I have yet to hear back about serious job opportunities, would it be frowned upon for me to try and do another internship?

Thoughts and opinions on this subject? Thanks /engineering, I hope to spark discussion on this"

[Where do you get the ideas for all of the lists you guys do? Also, how much time and effort goes into fact-checking? How much control over the content of the website do you have? Is cracked.com owned by a larger parent company or is is pretty much its own entity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47przp?context=5)|That's a lot of questions!
 |Are articles are generate by the person who's name you see in the byline. Usually that's a freelancer who pitches us an idea in the writers' workshop.
 |We require sources for every article and we have a good sense of what's reliable and what isn't just from experience. We have a black list essentially of sources we don't allow. We also have a few fact checkers just to make sure nothing is egregious.
 |The editors will touch every article and video that goes up on the site. That doesn't mean we'll change anything but we all have a say.
 |Cracked is owned by a company called Demand Media but it functions differently than all the other sites owned by Demand Media.
[***Are** articles are **generate** by the person **who's** name you see in the byline.*  Wait a sec, you're an *editor?* &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qskl?context=5)|Eeesh.

That guy's Canadian and the maple leaf on their flag is red. Who do they think they're fooling?
[Have you ever smacked the shit out of Swaim?  How was making out with Katie during the Batman After Hours episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pwm6?context=5)|Making out with anyone on camera is not what you think. There are tons of people standing around holding a camera and holding a boom, and they are all tired and waiting for you to just fucking kiss so they can go home. There's nothing all that special about it.
[Is working for Cracked.com as awesome as I imagine it to be? Any highlights of your working day/week??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxce?context=5)|Yes it is. The highlights are when Dan manages to hurt himself with a Nerf football at least once every four days.
[What's the weirdest conversation you've had on the set of After Hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pwos?context=5)|We've talked about whether Bill Murray ever raped Andie Macdowell's character in Ground Hog Day. That didn't make it into an episode.
[Is it possible to intern at Cracked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q1fh?context=5)|Yes, we've had interns before. I have no idea how you would go about applying. I guess send an email to the general inbox. I'm worthless when it comes to this sort of thing. 
[Also, boxers or briefs? I just have to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q1fh?context=5)|Boxer-briefs. I like structure in my life.

[What is your stance on sexual encounters with attractive strangers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxx2?context=5)|I am, sadly, against. I'm the type of guy who likes to know middle names. Also I am engaged.
[Thanks for being one of the few sites/mags with some original content.  The old writers for Mad and Cracked seemed to be geniuses, are any of them still around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pr9a?context=5)|Sadly, the writers from Cracked magazine (or the Cracked magazine you probably remember) are all gone. I'm sorry. You're stuck with us.
[Are you more of a dog person or cat person? Also which of your co-workers would be the most likely to rob a bank? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q2n4?context=5)|I am a dog person. I do not trust cats at all. But I will begrudgingly pet one if it presents itself to me. I would choose to rob a bank with Seanbaby. He seems fast and I don't think he'd hesitate to shoot anyone who stepped out of line. In fact, those are generally the characteristics I look for in a friend.
[I started reading Cracked about 2 years ago, and you are my favorite writer on there. You always get me to laugh one way or another. I liked the article where you kept sending livestock overseas through the charity program; pure gold. Where do you come up with this stuff? Do you just start with one small aspect and build on it, or do you usually have a plan for things when you start writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pyaa?context=5)|I can't speak for all the columnists, but I panic for about four days without anything to write and then I'll finally settle on something and just do it. Once I start writing it gets a little easier, I realize where the jokes are supposed to be.
[How awkward was the kiss with Katie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxul?context=5)|It was good. She was very gentle, which is something I need.
[What is swaim like IRL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pv3h?context=5)|He's tall. Also he talks with his hands and wears a fedora.
[If you could fight one extinct creature, what would it be? Would you use that creature for a pizza topping? Based on this comment alone, would you write me a letter of recommendation for grad-school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pz8e?context=5)|If I could fight one creature it would be the pterodactyl. I don't really like my odds but, man, what would people even SAY at the wake?
[What's John Cheese like in person? I love his articles, but it seems like he'd be one of those guys that can really suck all the fun out of the room with a single anecdote.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q6pj?context=5)|I've never actually met him in person. I've heard that when he and David Wong are together it's like Abbott and Costello. Is that not a timely enough reference? 
 |They're like, uh, Ash and that one girl he hangs out with in Pokemon.
[Are you at all related to David Bowie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q8ot?context=5)|Only spiritually.

[If you weren't in the writing business, what would you see yourself doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pyck?context=5)|Leading wilderness trips. I'm a climber and a hiker.
[How did you come up with your 'character' that you use in your articles? And is everyone's 'character' a kind of over-exaggerated version of themselves or a certain part of their personality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pyxj?context=5)|It just seemed to fit really well and no one else was doing it. I can't really get away with the self effacing stuff because everyone's immediate reaction is, ""Oh, fuck you."" So I went all the way in the other direction. Also I grew up in Aspen.
[What is David Wong like? And how does one ""Squancho""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q1ap?context=5)|David Wong is the smartest person I've ever met in my entire life. He not only catalogs information in his brain but he knows how to develop unique ideas and strange hypotheses around it. He's incredibly analytical.
[""After Hours"" is awesome and hilarious, who writes what on that show? Do you each write your parts?  Basically, how does an episode of After Hours go from Inception to what we see on screen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pzt6?context=5)|You can always see the writer of each episode in the credits. The writers are usually Jack O'Brien, Dan O'brien, Michael Swaim or me. Robert Brockway wrote a phenomenal episode and throughout the process of rehearsal Katie Willert does a significant amount of work as well. 
[Soren are you working on anything ouside of Cracked.com? Like a book? Or a movie? Or videos? I really loved all of your 5 minute videos on Youtube. Please do more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q8y2?context=5)|I wrote a book but no one wants to publish it. It's about a family that goes to the desert one summer and it gets so hot that dogs start eating each other. There's also a sexual predator who stands outside a girl's window each night. It's very funny.
[Why don't Cracked.com articles ever fit on a single page?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxyv?context=5)|We spread the lists across two pages because people are more likely to read something when it's bite-sized chunks. It's the same reason we write lists. There's less of a commitment when your scroller isn't the size of a pinhead, and we feel like we can win you over through the first page because our content is good. 
 |On a bigger a note, I guess I don't understand what the problem is. It's literally as easy as the push of a button to read the rest of the article. Is everyone so jaded that pushing a button sounds like too much work?
[Are there cubicles? Are they personalized? Is there photo-documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvye?context=5)|Yes, there is an ID scan so don't bother trying to break in.
[Is this because O'Brien is too shit faced to do one?   How hard is it to get started in your industry? Like, let's say I wasn't funny but had a winning smile? Anyone like that at the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47py6b?context=5)|I feel like this is probably an insult directed at me. But I also generally assume the world revolves around me on account of the winning smile.
[How much can you bench press? I'm going to be a little disappointed if it's not at least 100x my body weight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pw1b?context=5)|Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. But I can only do three reps.
[Do you get very much man-on-the-street recognition? Swarms of fangirls swooning at your feet?  Do the girls always end up asking for Swaim's number by the end of the convo?  Can I have Swaim's number?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qazr?context=5)|We get recognized sometimes. I get it a lot less than Dan and Michael. Crowds will form around Michael, it's incredible. I've even taken pictures for people of Michael. It's a nice humbling moment.
[Aside from your own, whose writing do you generally like the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q35e?context=5)|I think Dan O'Brien and Seanbaby are consistently the funniest writers on Cracked but David Wong writes articles that will change the way you see the world. Brockway is still my favorite though because his goal is always to terrify you just a little bit while making you laugh, and I really appreciate that.
[Are there actual (non-acting) people around when you guys film After Hours? Do people ever get up in your business when you film? I would ask if internet fame has ever gotten you laid, but if your articles are any indication then that's a silly question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q101?context=5)|We film After Hours from about 6pm to 6am. The place is closed while we film so the only people around are crew and extas. It would be impossible to film while the restaurant was open. Not because we're famous or anything, but because plates and people are really loud.
[Did the crash of Digg have an effect on Cracked traffic at all?  Cracked was always front page when Digg was at it's peak.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q893?context=5)|Not really. At first we saw a dip but by that point we weren't really relying on Digg for the majority of our traffic. Now if Facebook crumbled today, we would probably be in trouble.
[Why do most people on the internet seem functionally retarded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q809?context=5)|Because you're only seeing the worst and the worst people just happen to be loud. Just remember that nothing is personal and that there's a very specific reason everyone feels the need to troll or tear something down.
 |Unless you're including me in that statement, in which case I can't tell you for sure. Probably on account of the retardedness. 
[Are the Cracked columnists friends in real life or do you all secretly hate each other? Or openly hate each other? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q4b0?context=5)|We are all really good friends. At least those of us who live in the same area. Sometimes Seanbaby will come down to visit and that's always fun. 
[Where do you film Cracked After Hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvdm?context=5)|We film at a restaurant called the Los Feliz Cafe in Atwater Village, Los Angeles.
[If you, Swaim, and O'Brien all had to switch bodies with each other for the rest of your lives, and you got to to decide who gets which body, what would you do? Would you choose for your own benefit, or to spite Swaim and/or O'Brien?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q9xa?context=5)|I would do the selfless thing and let them decide, then I would take whatever was left over. I've had it pretty good until now, I think I could turn one of those other busted heaps into something useable.
 |Honestly though, Dan is more in shape and probably stronger than I am now. He runs marathons and everything. That might be an upgrade minus the freakishly long torso.
[The subjects of the articles written by you and the other writers varies so much, which topics tend to get the most interest and feedback?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q0rv?context=5)|The ""X things you didn't know about being ______."" Do really really well because people are genuinely interested. When I write about fighting turkeys or the best kinds of monkeys, usually those aren't huge traffic drivers but I still love doing them.
[How much do you edit their article when a user submits? Is it a ""you aren't funny, let me try"" or do you leave them as is?  And also, what are some of the dumbest articles you've received? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pzkb?context=5)|We usually work with the writers from the pitch stage so we know that they have great ideas to start with. From there, I'm always impressed with how well they understand the voice of the site and the sophistication of their humor. We've had to do completely rewrites before but we also have some articles that we barely have to touch.

I had previously started [this AmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi//comments/ro21r/i_used_to_intern_for_syfy_amaa/) about when I used to intern for Syfy.

I wanted to start this thread to be a constructive discussion of what Syfy should be. I know most people (including me sometimes) are frustrated with the channel, but I want to concentrate on real solutions. What things can be done to make the channel what it SHOULD be.

I ask because I am in the television industry and am a huge Sci-Fi fan. I'd love to spend my career working on great science fiction programming and hopefully we can influence Syfy to be the channel we all want it to be. 

If we get good constructive suggestions, I will attempt to share them with my contacts at the network.

Thanks!

I told them I wanted to take some time to think about things (since I was holding out for a position at another non-profit). I went to do the interview for the 2nd place yesterday and I might have shot myself in the foot because I ended up mentioning other positions that I was looking at and essentially might have made it seem like I was more interested in other positions. At the end of the interview we basically decided to try to work something out with a research program I'm in so that I would be working for them but not for the duration of a full internship. If this didn't work out, I would go on board with them for the full internship position. After I left I realized how ridiculous and confusing I was being so I sent her an email asking to just go on full time in the internship program.

Still haven't heard back from her but I really need to get back to the first internship people that offered me a position. I'm worried that if I tell internship #1 I found something else, internship #2 will decide not to give me the full position and I'll be left with nothing. Should I risk it?"

I'm a sophomore CS major. Much to my dismay, I've so far been unable to land an internship this summer. I think I've gotten close a few times, but haven't quite been able to seal the deal. I'm feeling a bit discouraged because I spent a lot of time over the past few months sending applications &amp; interviewing with different companies.

I have a pretty good GPA (~3.5), I'm attending a well regarded university, and I'm a full semester ahead in the CS track. However, my lack of real world programming experience seems to be my Achilles heel.

What I need are ideas for things to do over the summer to help ensure that I'll be able to land an internship next summer. I really don't want to end up graduating without an internship under my belt... Unfortunately, I'll probably end up having to work a typical min wage summer-job, but hopefully I'll have a little time to invest in a programming project.

I've been wondering what doors are open because of my UK citizenship. Pretty much, what does this citizenship mean i can do? 

My idea was that after school here, move to the UK for cheaper post grad school (looking for a PhD in Economics, or maybe a Masters), and also to get out of the US. But i have no idea how this works. I remember my mom saying that for you to really be recognized as a citizen in the UK, you actually have to live there for about a year to get all the benefits. 

I'm also thinking about just moving to England after i graduate, and either trying to land a basic job with my Bachelors, or trying to get an internship at a relevant company to my major. Grad schools seem to like it if you don't go directly into your post grad work, so moving to England for a year before to get used to the culture, and to get myself settle could be a good plan. Where would one go to find jobs/internship openings within the UK, specifically for economics?

So my basic question to you reddit is, with my British citizenship, what are my options after i graduate? Would i be able to attend a British university as a British citizen, or would i still be a foreign student, and not get the same tuition?"

I see stuff like this all the time:

[The Founding Fathers believed, and the evidence still shows, that industriousness, marriage and religion are a very important basis for male empowerment and achievement. We may need to say to a number of our twenty-something men, ""Get off the video games five hours a day, get yourself together, get a challenging job and get married."" It's time for men to man up.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/04/opinion/bennett-men-in-trouble/index.html)

and this:

[Burress, a cute, short, African American 24-year-old grad student who is getting a doctor-of-pharmacy degree, had many of the same complaints I heard from other young women. Guys high-five each other when they get a C, while girls beat themselves up over a B-minus. Guys play video games in each other’s rooms, while girls crowd the study hall. Girls get their degrees with no drama, while guys seem always in danger of drifting away. “In 2012, I will be Dr. Burress,” she said. “Will I have to deal with guys who don’t even have a bachelor’s degree? I would like to date, but I’m putting myself in a really small pool.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/2/)

It seems like there is this societal consensus that men who play video games are lazy, useless and un-marriageable.

I am a man. I am 22. I am married. I have two bachelor's degrees, one in Computer Science and one in Mathematics. I graduated college in three years, because I clamped down and studied super hard. I took classes spring, fall, intercession and summer, every year until I was done. I also did research which was published by BYU and attended numerous math conferences. I held a 20 hour a week, minimum wage job during my first two years, and during the third, I did a 20 hour a week corporate internship.

During all of that, if I didn't play at least 4 hours of video games a day, it was a bad day. I usually played SNES and NES games on my retro-duo. Kung Fu and Killer Instinct got played through more times than I can count.

I was being actively courted by graduate schools for math when I finished my degrees, but decided to go into the workforce. Upon graduating, I took a job as a software developer. My starting salary was $62k/yr. With my first paycheck, I bought wedding rings, paid a an Italian restaurant to feed everyone at the wedding reception and bought an xBox 360 and a Kinect. I married my girlfriend of several years pretty quickly thereafter, and began paying her college tuition so she could have a degree too. I pay all the bills, she studies, maintains our apartment and cooks meals. Sometimes I work crazy hours, but every day, when I get back from work a couple of hours either go to StarCraft II, World of Tanks or something on the 360.

Last year, I started my own business. Pretty quickly I was down about $3k. I held with it for four profitless months, then started making pretty good money. Now I'm up $70k. If things get much better, I'll quit the software developer job and work on my business full time.

Through that whole adventure, I played Halo III with my wife and my old roommate every night and drank many beers.

Don't try to tell me that playing videogames is a problem or that it leads to lazy unsuccessful men. Video games are what my generation likes to do. Surprise, surprise, different generations have different pass times.

**tl;dr:** It's a bad week if I don't game as much as I worked and I'm pretty damn alpha."

Since all the other questions I wanted to ask have been asked in the AMA so far, I am wondering if you have any salient memories about your time in Ohio, or stories about what it was like trying to live with next to nothing... if I recall, this was before the minimum wage was increased, so I think you guys were making like $5 something an hour. What was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rrhx2/i_am_morgan_spurlock_time_to_ask_me_anything/c482di0?context=5)|Was difficult making that show.  My girlfriend and I have since split up, my work being one of the contributing factors, but I love Ohio.  We've shot there many times.  I think its a great representation of the country, so we will shoot things there because I think they translate well to a large audience.
[Wow, thanks for responding! Sorry to hear about you and your lady :-\  I agree that Ohio is very representative of the everyman, we used to get a lot of product trials in Columbus because it apparently provides a good cross-section of consumer acceptance of a new product or service. Apparently we also have generic accents.   Just out of curiosity, what do you think about the minimum wage increases? I remember making $5.15 an hour working at Radio Shack in the late 90s, and I find it unconscionable that it didn't increase until 2007 (at least on the national level).

- Intern

- Junior Developer

- Senior Developer

- Architect 

- Guru (not sure if this is a real title)

Now can somebody explain the difference between these titles? How does a JR developer know when he's at Senior level? How many years of experience do you need for each level?"

I recently started a new internship and I am being asked to do some things that are way outside my range of knowledge. I will try to explain as best as I can.

What I am looking at is comparing two average results from different branches from 2003 and 2005. However, some branches lack results from 2003, and some rows lack from 2005. When a branch lacks a result from 2003 it usually means it hadn't opened, and I need excel to report ""not opened"", and when it lacks a result in 2005, it usually means it closed and I need to report ""Closed"".

If there are data for both years, I need to compare them and have excel report whether the data in 2005 shows an improvement or if it has declined. 

My boss wants me to write different macros for this, and have the macro highlight the row in which each (""not yet opened"", ""closed"", ""improved"", ""declined"") occur.

I've literally spent 8 hours online trying to figure this out, but I've never used excel before so I'm having a really hard time.

Let me know if my explanation doesn't make sense, and I'll try to explain better.

Thanks!"

ruza4,5,2012-04-05,Day 1 ... Thank you /r/leaves for opening my eyes so I could reassess my situation,StrangeDaze17,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ruza4/day_1_thank_you_rleaves_for_opening_my_eyes_so_i/,"Hello all,

I wanted to post my story as a way to vent, and also to show my appreciation to this subreddit - which ultimately forced me to take a look at my habit and reassess my situation.

It all started freshman year of college. My dorm roommate was getting into MJ and me being the adventurous type, I figured I'll give it a try. From there I only would smoke on special occasions, most of my efforts were concentrated on getting hammered and living college life to the ""fullest"" in that respect. Despite the heavy partying, I was still able to make deans list for both semesters that year. Then sophomore year came and I moved into a house with my dorm roommate and a couple other friends from high school. EVERYONE was toking up regularly except me..because I was pre-med and I needed to get shit done. Well, needless to say that didn't last long..before I knew it I was smoking everyday, playing lots of Halo. Hell, our house was renamed ""the cave"" because it was usually dark, musty and smoky ALL the time. Each semester my grades went lower, and my motivation to succeed diminished. Also, from experience various clubs and volunteering activities I decided I did NOT want to go to med school. Im sure MJ had some influence on this, but in hindsight I am really glad I decided not to pursue med school. Anyway, this gave me the excuse to smoke more..My train of thought went from ""Med school here I come!"" to "" wellll ... As long as I graduate I'll be fine"". Luckily for me, I had enough brain power to receive passing grades w/o EVER going to class. At the end of my junior year I hit bottom..but there was light .. I scored an internship with a respected Pharma company, and I met my wife.. Because of fear of a drug test and my new romance, I was easily distracted from MJ. I quit cold turkey. I would smoke once every few months if I was around old friends but that's it -- it stayed this way for about 2 years. 

In late 2009 I got reacquainted with an old college buddy who was just getting into it. We would hangout once a week and smoke. It was not long before I convinced my fiancé that it was OK for me to do it at the house. 

Here is where it gets interesting.. I have been vaping pretty much everyday since the start of 2010 - except for several extended vacations and work travel. Weird thing is, during this time, I have really advanced my career, invested in real estate, and broadened my knowledge in Music (I play), politics, economics, and science. It's almost like MJ has reinvigorated my love for learning new things. I have not neglected relationships either..And last year I lost over 50 lbs from good eating and lots of exercise. It almost seems that 2011 was my most accomplished year..in fact a lot of friends and family look up to me as an accomplished individual..but then again, none of them know exactly HOW MUCH I smoke. 

It's weird, in my mind, it seems like a problem, but the results do not tell the same story. This subreddit has really helped me identify some issues I am having:

* I depend on it for sleep. Can't fall asleep fast without it.
* find myself in the reward loop .."" well if I do this, then I can smoke""
* I am more irritable when I do not smoke
* think about toking up a lot!
* guilty conscience sometimes when I smoke

I guess before I saw this subreddit, I had the mindset of, ""we'll MJ isn't a REAL drug, it's basically harmless."" and ""well it is better than drinking, who needs all those calories"". However, after reading some stories on here it really opened my eyes to the fact that people do really struggle with MJ addiction.

I have been thinking of taking a break or possibly giving it up for good over the past couple weeks. I stumbled upon this subreddit last night, and to my dismay discovered that, I proabably do have a problem. I immediately decided not to smoke before bed, and then I flushed what MJ I had left down the toilet this morning. 

So here I am, day 1 of an extended t-break or perhaps giving it up forever. Wish me luck! I fear that stopping this time around will be more difficult because I don't have the major distraction/replacement I had back in college.

Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and experiences, it truly is a great thing to have a community like this. Comments and questions are welcome!

rutgt,7,2012-04-05,Need some advice...,Protagoris,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/rutgt/need_some_advice/,"First, we are an American couple. My SO is a little over 20 weeks pregnant now. I'm currently in a masters program for secondary education, and frankly don't have enough time to work. Especially when my internship and student teaching starts this fall.  Currently my parents help me (because they can, and they're wonderful) to cover all the bills. My SO lives with me, and works full time at a daycare.  However, the job is an hours drive to and from every day on a toll road, and with gas prices right now she spends anywhere from 100-125 dollars in travel every week.  Also, daycare work pays about 8 dollars an hour. It's not great. So she basically pays her car payment, gas, tolls, insurance, credit cards, and student loans, and barely has anything left over.

Every day she comes home depressed and too tired to do anything. I do all the cooking, most of the cleaning. I don't mind doing all this work to take care of her. I see it as part of my duty as her SO, but she feels guilty for not being bale to help more.

She hates her job, dreads it, and cries almost every day because of it.  She's afraid of what all this stress and depression is doing to our baby, and her own health.

Her contract with the school is up late May, but every day it seems like she is about to quit. The only problem is, if she quits, she can't cover her finances. I have some savings and my parents can help for awhile, but it can only go so far. I already feel bad for not being able to just take care of her, and that I'm having to sustain us off my parents.  My SO doesn't help with rent, food costs, and I cover her phone bill. (Don't get the impression that I'm complaining. I don't mind any of this, do my best to not make her feel guilty, do everything I can to support her).

On weekends she's a completely different person. Excited, full of life, and energy.

I'm afraid of her pushing herself too much, and I worry about her being on a busy high way for two hours a day in a fairly small car. If she quits she's afraid no one else will hire her, and that she wont be able to get unemployment.

We're thinking about asking her doctor for some sort of note, but not sure on how to go about it.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Does anyone have advice?

TL;DR - My SO hates her job and it seems to ruin her mental health. Afraid of not being hired, not getting unemployment, and may ask doctor for a note. Any advice?"

I'm a junior majoring business admin, double concentrating in accounting and finance. 

I plan to have the 30 extra accounting hours and 150 total hours by the time I graduate to be completely CPA eligible (other than the working part of course). This is on my resume by the way.

My culm. GPA is mediocre/bad because I switched majors and the last one really hit me hard. My 'major' GPA is a bit above 3.2, that's counting only business classes, if I counted only accounting/finance courses it  would be a bit higher, I haven't gotten anything less than a B in these courses.

Now the problem is I can't get an internship, I have zero experience, and I have pretty much withdrawn from campus life because I'm just so anxious and insecure about my position. So my resume looks even worse. 

I'm going into my senior year next year, and I'll be finishing up the few accounting/finance courses I have left. Recruiting season is in early fall, all of the Big 4 come to recruit but do I even have a chance? Smaller firms come as well. 

I'm just dying from anxiety at this point every day. Anyone have any ideas in mind that could help?"

Soon, it will have been a year since I made a life-altering decision. A decision that I felt was right, and I will never regret fighting for what I felt was the right thing. The side effects are what hurt worst though. When I made this decision, most of my friends left me. One stayed, but a few months ago she just quit talking to me. So I do without. My family turned their back on me as well. I have a couple of siblings left and that's all. I know it all seems so petty, but I've always been about the little things. They make me happy, but when a lot of little things go wrong, they overshadow the good. I try to focus on the good, but my mind just keeps slipping away from it.

The word ""friend"" feels very hollow now. I use it sometimes, but I don't mean it in the same way. After seeing all of my ""friends"" suddenly and gradually turn on me, it's hard to build up a relationship with anyone now. I haven't had a girlfriend in a year and really haven't had the desire to be in a relationship either.
There are a lot of people who look up to me. They see the big accomplishments that I've done, and I am grateful for that. I see them too and they make me feel good, but I just break up like this sometimes. I feel like a skyscraper whose foundation is crumbling. No one sees the foundation, they just see the big accomplishments. Meanwhile, I'm deteriorating beneath.

No, I don't want to die. But my life feels useless. Hollow. I have limited relationships with the people around me. I've been working to better myself by going to college and applying for internships, public speaking, appearing on podcasts and radio shows and trying to turn my initially bad experience a year ago into something positive, but my life doesn't feel right. I have meaning in my life, don't get me wrong. I just have no connections with people. I work four days a week, play video games the rest of the days, and only interact with housemates.

I miss having a friend to talk to. A lot of people offer assistance, but it doesn't compare. I don't know them and I don't want to for some reason. I want someone I can connect with, and for now I just feel disconnected from everyone. I guess I'm done whining."
ructe,6,2012-04-05,"Frankly, I'm not even sure if this warrants attention.",lenavis,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ructe/frankly_im_not_even_sure_if_this_warrants/,"I go through the motions of living every day, but lately it seems as though even that is too much. I wake each day looking forward to only the moment that I can lay down again and go to sleep. I find that my happiest moments during the day occur during that brief period of relief before my eyes shut.

I'm a sophomore in a very expensive university right now, and I thoroughly feel that I have wasted my life. My grades have been on the low side of mediocre, and I think that the majors that I have since switched to will leave me as one of the many chronically unemployed degree holders in this country. I'm not a member or contributor to any bit of the social life on campus. I have only a handful of acquaintances here. I haven't landed any internships - haven't even put in the effort for applying to them out of the very reasonable expectation that I'll be declined.

I've descended to the point that I no longer attend class regularly because I simply haven't the energy or willpower to rouse myself and walk those 50 steps to the classroom. I ignore assignments and disregard homework. My motivation for schoolwork seems to have wholly disappeared.

I wasn't always this way. I used to be extremely driven in high school, and though I have always been socially anxious, kept a a reasonable number of close friends with whom I generally had a pretty fun time with, and had an avid interest in literature and science. Although I have always struggled with long bouts of depression and anxiety, it seems that my entrance to college has only worsened these problems.

My personal interests have dulled and have been largely thrown aside. When I pick up a book or begin to sketch out a picture, I no longer find the enjoyment that I once had. I feel completely out of my social element here and suffer from a constant sense of inferiority. Am I as intelligent as the students around me? Am I maybe just very boring and stupid? Why don't people like me? Why do people never approach me to speak to me? Is there something inherently ""off"" about me?

Every day, the possible methods run themselves through my head like a comforting litany. I could find some cyanide somewhere. I could buy a rope and go into the woods. I could find a high place to jump from or find a gun or slit my wrists - the possibilities are many. But I'll probably never do it, I conclude, because I am a coward. Because as an atheist, the prospect of an eternal void terrifies me. And yet, these obsessive thoughts continue, somehow deeply comforting me as a convenient end solution and a way of escaping responsibility.

Suicide is selfish. I try to tell myself so.

I have a brilliant, beautifully understanding and comforting boyfriend who is my only source of comfort in this place. I have friends who would probably be at least shocked and horrified with my death. I have a family to whom I owe masses of support (both financial and emotional) to. I have a really great RA currently who would probably lose his position if one of his residents decided to off herself.

And yet, I twist these sources of comfort into incentives.

My boyfriend deserves far better than me - he deserves someone who is truly up to his caliber and who is able to support him as much as he supports me. He doesn't need a cling little bitch to constantly pat on the head. My parents have wasted too much money already by sending me to this university and have gotten little to show for it. I've always been the ""failure child"", the one whom my sister has been explicitly told not to imitate, lest she ""turn out like me."" My friends have moved on, into larger circles and away from me. I am probably nothing more than an afterthought. My RA...well yeah, that's going to be pretty shitty for him. Sorry.

I don't know if this is even a legitimate post for this subreddit. Maybe this is nothing more than an extenuated whine for attention. Maybe all I was looking for was a few pats on the head. But these thoughts persist to the point that they linger daily as small reminders, and I don't know what to do about them. 

I'm tired. I'm really just very tired at this point.

This was a pretty long post. Sorry for taking up your time if you did end up reading the whole thing. And thanks."

Here's my story, I got accepted for a very well paying computer science internship for this summer at a fortune 100 company, and I stopped my daily 'after 10pm' MFLB sessions of 2-3 inhales a night in preparation for the pre-employment drug test 6 weeks from now (and also for focusing on school). The weed is not a real big issue, it's inconvenient that I can't vape a little weed after ~8 hours of straight studying and going to bed with a tired out mind, but I obviously HAVE to pass this test and I know my priorities so I know with time this goes away. The thing is, is that every night since I stopped, I've been having dreams related to acid, shrooms, drug tests, hash oil, etc. I'm not used to remembering my dreams so much because I used to always fall asleep high, but it's been a common recurrence that all my dreams are related to drugs in one way or another. Last night I had a dream my drug test was supposed to happen at that very moment in time, and although I could possibly pass the weed test, I was worried about failing the amphetamines test for taking aderall the day before. Another dream I had decided to eat an eighth of shrooms, while being at my house with my parents around asking me to do chores for them, which also had me worried.

A key factor that plays a role in these dreams and something I should mention, is that a week AFTER my drug test and a week BEFORE my internship begins, there is a huge music festival I've been anticipating for a while. I plan to spend the weekend of the festival in a totally different dimension, mescaline one day, shrooms another, candyflipping the last. I've bought all this stuff in advance, and it's all tucked away in a safe 20 miles away at home. I do plan on smoking that weekend, having taken the drug test the week before, but once I begin my internship and thus beginning my future career, I can't say weed will be in my life anymore and I plan to quit for good. I don't look like a hippie, nor do I act like one, and I don't want to be doing the things I've been doing at my age for the next stage of my life, so I've come to accept it.

I'm being distracted all day thinking about this festival, and once I sleep I am literally dreaming it too. I'm not sure what I'm trying to ask you guys, other than how do I keep this off my mind."
rtv5z,2,2012-04-04,FA Summer: What should I do this Summer?,TheNoi,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/rtv5z/fa_summer_what_should_i_do_this_summer/,"**BackStory:** Previous summers my brother and I would do all sorts of adventurous things, (hiking, swimming, bouldering, fishing, etc...). Long story short, he moved out of state last year. Since he was the real motivational driver to do these things (always been a gamer myself) I find myself in a quandary as to how I could motivate myself to do these things on my own or a comparable activity to fill the void. So far I've come up with three options:

A) I could man up and go it alone. 

B) Maybe a companion, specifically a dog, who could partially take the place of my brother as adventure encouragement to get back into the wilderness (though my brother was more the leader and I the tag along). 

C) Give up and just play video games like last summer.

**What I think:**

A) Going it alone seems like the most practical solution, except that I find myself giving up and admitting defeat rather easily without some outside encouragement. I know all about the 'set your mind to it', 'man up and do it', but past experience has shown my resolve probably won't see it through.

B) Getting a dog is certainly one of my goals ever since my brother's/mine died while I was a junior in high school. They are awesome adventuring companions. The problem is that during fall and spring semesters I really don't have the time to properly care for a dog. Is it okay to get a dog, but semi abandon it for 40-60 hours of the week when school starts up again? Are there any FAers who have had a dog and not had a problem with leaving it alone for long periods of time during the week? Any tips on raising a dog not to have seperation anxiety when you aren't capable of giving it a large amount of time?


C) I don't have a problem with playing video games all summer, I rather like them. Lately they just haven't had the same draw as they use to.

I guess I just wanted to see what reddit thinks or if you guys have any additional insight in how to fill up the free time of summer? I do have some summer classes and hopefully an internship, so its unlikely I'll be able to travel (or I would go stay with my brother for the summer). 

What other options do I have?

I wanted to share this with you guys, although I'm not sure how interesting it is to people other than me. It's relevant for journalists or anyone else looking to build their resume.

I wrote music reviews and the occasional feature as an intern for Performer Magazine in 2010. There were no problems, whatsoever. My writing was printed verbatim (a bit weird in itself), and the EIC and I got along fine. It was a remote internship, as I live in Washington and Performer is an East Coast publication.

After my internship, I asked for a letter of reference (what else is an unpaid internship good for?). The Editor in Chief said he would get it to me the following week. At first I was very patient, but he never delivered. Weeks passed, possibly months before I wrote him again. He told me had, in fact, already written my letter and that he would email it to me as a .pdf after he wrapped up the current issue of Performer. I wanted to ask why he didn't just attach the letter in the email he was writing to me at the time, but I simply said ""sure,"" and waited some more. That was several months ago — the last I ever heard from them. I have called and written them numerous times to no response over the months.

My new employer, lacking a letter of reference to check after my job interview, called Performer Magazine and left a message. They never returned my employer's message. I have no idea why Performer started avoiding me, but they left me high and dry when i needed a reference.

A couple days ago, after more unanswered emails and calls, I realized I was never going to get a reference from them. So, I took to posting on their facebook page. Nothing offensive, no swearing, just kind of bugging them. I knew they weren't going to give me any letter at this point, but I also knew they couldn't do anything to me. Every time I posted a comment, Performer deleted it immediately. Stuff like ""What would you do if I actually showed up to your office? Would you hide behind the curtains until I walked away?"" or, ""I wonder how long it will take for this to be deleted?"" got removed within minutes. Pretty uneventful, sure, until...

LO AND BEHOLD, Yesterday I got a response to one of my wall posts! It went as follows: ""Kevin, our company wishes to have no further communication with you. Please stop calling, emailing and posting to our social media sites. Further attempts by you to contact us will be ignored.""

...and then they deleted that post as well. I took a screenshot this time, it's in the album.

**TL; DR: 6 MONTHS OF FREE WORK AND PERFORMER MAGAZINE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A REFERENCE, EVEN AFTER CLAIMING THEY ALREADY WROTE IT FOR ME. THEY IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER'S CALLS FOR A REFERENCE, EITHER.**

So, DAE want to troll Performer Magazine's facebook page? I was thinking it would be cool if everyone wrote something like ""Hey Ben, where's my reference letter?"" Or whatever tickles your fancy. If you ""Like"" Performer Magazine's facebook page, you can post on their wall. It would make my day GLORIOUS, FOR **I HATE THESE PRICKS.** *And admit it, you're bored as fuck right now.*

Someone I really trusted threw me out like trash after confessing some form of love to me. It destroyed me. I trusted him so much. I relied on him more than I realized, and with him suddenly gone, I just couldn't keep it together. 

I was overwhelmed. All of my applications for study abroad and leadership positions were denied by my honors college even though I was overly qualified for all of them. My grandmother passed away. I ended up having to drop a class because I couldn't handle the stress. All of my friends began avoiding me because I was always so busy and irritable because all I could only ever think of the work that I needed to do. It was terrible.

My self confidence vanished. I didn't find myself attractive anymore. I hated my body. I hated everything about myself. I would cry myself to sleep every night feeling completely alone and heartbroken. My desire to write completely vanished, and with it, a piece of myself died. 

Now, six months later, I feel good about myself. I found out today that I didn't get the positions because of a fluke in the system, and I was invited to apply again next year with the promise that I would probably get the positions. One of the heads of the honors college admitted that she adored me and wanted me to be an active part in it. I've also become a major part of the Honors Congress, and I plan to join a committee and run for a position next semester. 

I changed my major to biology, and the department head is excited to get me on track so that I can take the classes that I want. He's working with me to get an internship at the local conservancy. I've started making new friends and actively going out of my way to greet people. It feels wonderful. 

I fall asleep every night with a smile on my face now, and I am genuinely happy. My life is really turning around, and today was the first day that I finally admitted it. After all of those months of hell, I'm better of then when it started. "

rwkqj,23,2012-04-06,"When my mother asked my therapist if he could help me work on focus &amp; follow up, he said ""That's Aspergers,"" and we should ""Probably try to get your son on disability.""",unholyprawn,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/rwkqj/when_my_mother_asked_my_therapist_if_he_could/,"Sorry in advance as this post is mostly me venting my spleen. 

For the past 4 months, I have been seeing a new therapist to help me work on my depression and my Aspergers. So far, we have gotten my depression under control and now we are working on what is for me, (and so I have heard many with AS) is a major problem and so far the largest impediment to my success; focus &amp; follow up.

In the past month I have been doing poorly at school and have not found a new job (my prior internship ended on 3 March on good terms). Because of the relatively poor direction my life is taking, my mother thought it would be wise to reach out to my therapist in order to help me work on those two issues. The therapist told her that we would try upping the dosage of the ADHD medicine, but not to expect much because ""That's Aspergers, and we really can't do much about it."" He also suggested that we (myself, my mother, him, and his assistant) should ""Try to get your son on disability.""

I honestly don't know weather to be more enraged, upset, or disappointed. To think that a professional doctor in the heart of New York City would be so defeatist stuns me. It is common knowledge that people with AS can hold very good jobs, do well in school and so much more, and that he would just dismiss me is so wrong. Making matters worse is that he and I have only met once (normally I deal with his assistant), and during that time he kept checking his watch frequently. 

I end this post with a couple of questions.

1) Does anyone else on this subreddit have difficulty with focus and followup? If so, how have you managed to overcome this?

2) Are the beliefs held by my former therapist common?

3) Does anyone have any recommendations for a psychologist/psychiatrist/neurologist in New York City who has expertise in Aspergers/Depression/Family issues? I know it may be a stretch to ask this question, but any help is appreciated. "

I smoked weed extremely sparsely for a couple years, maybe once every couple months, but quit using it a while ago(about a year ago or so) . I'm gonna be upfront and tell the truth on my forms, but I'm still terrified I'm gonna lose this awesome opportunity because of something I did in my past. I've seriously quit and thrown my stuff away, but I'm still worried. 

If anyone can shed some light on this, I'd be pretty appreciative. This has been bugging me ever since I found out. I just hope I'm not as screwed as I think I am. 

Thanks.

rw3aq,16,2012-04-06,"Going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow for adderall, considering talking about anxiety problems instead.",Oliphauntintheroom,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/rw3aq/going_to_see_a_psychiatrist_tomorrow_for_adderall/,"Over the past couple years i've come to suspect that what I thought was a mild life long depression, really could be Generalized anxiety disorder. I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people.

When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying. I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it. Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away. My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again. 

After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again. It was something that I hardly thought about. In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college. 

When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed. I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades. After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall. 

Adderall ended up really helping me for a while. In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me. Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before. After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it. 
Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it. Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week.

 I'm at a very challenging time for me right now. I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships. I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has. 
I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall. I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety. Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc. 

Reddit, what should I do? I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment. 

I'd really appreciate peoples opinions, just found this subreddit, but it seems like a really great resource. "
rvvdf,4,2012-04-06,10 Things Every Parent Should Know About College by Michelle Crouch,voxpupil,personaleducation,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaleducation/comments/rvvdf/10_things_every_parent_should_know_about_college/,"If you’re the parent of a high-achieving high school student prepared to spend whatever it takes to send your kid to an Ivy League college, authors Claudia Dreifus and Andrew Hacker have some unlikely advice: Don’t do it.

Dreifus, a New York Times writer and an adjunct professor at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, and Hacker, a veteran political science professor at Queens College in New York, spent three years interviewing faculty, students, and administrators and crunching statistics for their book, Higher Education? How Colleges Are Wasting Our Money and Failing Our Kids — And What We Can Do About It. Their finding? That many of America’s colleges and universities — especially the elite — aren’t worth their tuition and serve faculty over their undergrads.

More outrageous, they say, is that tuition nationwide has jumped at more than twice the rate of inflation since 1982, so many kids graduate deeply in debt. “Tuition is probably the second-largest item you’ll buy in your lifetime, after your home,” Dreifus says. Given that, the authors suggest you consider the following as you bear down on the decision of where your child will spend the next four (or more) years.

1. Beginning adulthood without debt is worth far more than a designer diploma.

The authors’ No. 1 rule for parents: Don’t let your child go into debt for college. In 2010, almost two thirds of undergraduates borrowed money, and student-loan debt outpaced credit card debt for the first time. The College Board likes to say that a typical senior graduates with “only” $24,000 in debt, but with interest, collection charges, and penalties for postponed payments, the amounts owed can exceed $100,000. If you ever default on a federal student loan (and the rate of defaults is rising), you’ll be hounded for life. Lenders can garnish your wages, intercept your tax refunds, and have your professional license revoked. You can’t work for the government or collect your social security. “People have been sold this propaganda: ‘The rates are so low; just get a loan,’ ” Dreifus says. “The long-term effect is to cripple your children.”

2. Research universities are no place for undergraduates.

Professors at big research universities are often more interested in doing research and working with graduate students than teaching your child because their prestige (and their university’s) depends on publishing. So they tend to host huge lectures and then foist undergrads off on teaching assistants who may or may not be supervised. “At Harvard, we ran into students who said they never had a professor who had enough of a relationship with them to write a recommendation for grad school,” Dreifus says. How to avoid that? Go to a school that’s completely dedicated to teaching, like a four-year liberal arts college with little to no research. “Look for seminars where 15 to 20 people sit around a table,” Dreifus says. “The big question we want parents to ask: Is this a place that’s about developing my child’s mind?”

3. Colleges are overrun by administrators.

Student-to-faculty ratios are important, of course. But it might also be wise to ask about the proportion of administrators to students. Between 1976 and 2007, that ratio has doubled at colleges nationwide, the authors say, with bureaucrats serving in such roles as “babysitting coordinator,” “dietetic internship director,” and “residential communications coordinator.” Such services may be useful, but are they really necessary? “You should ask yourself, Is this really a college, or is this a giant multiversity with a lot of extraneous functions? Because that’s going to end up costing you,” Hacker says. “It’s a big reason tuition can now run a quarter-million dollars for four years.”

4. The star professors touted in college brochures probably won’t be teaching your kid.

Universities and colleges are increasingly relying on underpaid, part-time instructors to lead undergraduate courses. Contingent teachers, including paid-by-the-course adjunct professors, now do 70 percent of college teaching, up from 43 percent in 1975. (The elites aren’t immune: At Yale, the figure is 70 percent.) Most adjuncts don’t even have an office on campus, and because they make on average only about $3,000 a course, they often teach at three or four different colleges. “It’s hard to be a great teacher and to be there for your students when you’re juggling that many jobs,” Dreifus says.

5. The college’s best professors may not even be on campus.

Though they get their summers off and breaks during the school year, tenured faculty at many universities are encouraged to take frequent sabbaticals. What will that mean for your undergrad? At Harvard, where senior professors get a sabbatical every three years, 10 of the 48 professors in the history department — more than one in five — were off doing research in 2010/2011. During a recent year at Williams College, another school with a great reputation, a third of the professors in the religion department were on leave. If you choose a school that gives its faculty a lot of time for research, your son or daughter might find that his or her senior-thesis adviser is on sabbatical in Tuscany.

6. Don’t be seduced by the luxuries they show you on the tour.

Today’s students get suites, private bathrooms, and food courts with chefs that make sushi and Dijon chicken, not to mention jumbo Jacuzzis and five-story climbing walls. It’s all part of an extravagant amenities race that’s helping to push up tuition rates. “When we sneaked in on parent/student tours across the country, we were shocked at the number of questions parents asked about amenities,” Dreifus says. “A college doesn’t have to look like Club Med. In fact, I’d say you should be suspicious if a school has a lot of amenities. When a college has every kind of plaything, that tells you something about its priorities.”

7. Your tuition may be subsidizing a college president’s $1 million-plus salary.

College presidents create a tone and a direction for an institution, so take a look at the person at the top. Does he look like an educator? Has he switched to a new college every few years? What’s his salary? A growing number of higher education leaders are making more than $1 million a year. “When a president is remunerated the same way as a CEO, that’s a sign that the school has embraced the corporate model of doing things,” says Dreifus. “This should be a public service. A university president should not make more than the president of the United States.”

8. High-powered athletic programs drain money from academics.

Only a handful of athletic departments actually pay for themselves. The rest rely on your tuition and fees to help pay for coaches, trainers, equipment, and travel and lodging expenses for the players. Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama has more football coaches (seven) than it has professors in its history department (four). “If you didn’t have football, you could hire more history professors,” Hacker says. The other problem is that once colleges get into big-time sports, corruption tends to follow. Even Princeton recently had an alumnus who paid tuition for a tennis player in violation of NCAA rules, Hacker says. (The student agreed to repay the money to charity.) He acknowledges that some teenagers love the excitement of painting their faces in team colors and cheering for the home team. “How can I argue with that?” he says. “Except to say that you should recognize the trade-off: It’s depleting the quality of your education.”

9. Going to an elite university does not guarantee success.

To prove this point, Hacker and Dreifus tracked the 900-odd students who graduated from Princeton in 1973 to see if the school was delivering on its promise “to prepare students for positions of leadership,” whether in business, public service, or the arts, which Princeton administrators claim as their goal. “We were very disappointed,” Hacker says. “There were only a handful of recognized names in that class of 900. What that tells us is simply this: In America, if you put your talents to their best use, by the age of 35 or 36, you’ll be passing people from Princeton, no matter where you went to school.” Sure, the authors acknowledge, a designer degree might help you get into medical school or law school at Harvard, Stanford, or Yale. That’s a nice bonus if you can pay the full sticker price, they say, but not enough of an edge to saddle your child with many thousands of dollars in debt.

10. Honors colleges at public universities can offer as fine an education as the Ivy League.

The honors colleges at City University of New York, Arizona State, and the University of Mississippi, to name a few, offer the intimacy of a liberal arts college at state-school prices. “These students get first pick of classes and have special classes to themselves, and at Arizona State, they have their own dorms,” Dreifus says. “We met students in those honors colleges who got into Harvard and other elite schools, but they said they didn’t want to burden their parents with that kind of expense. Now that’s a smart kid.”

rvl52,0,2012-04-05,"At what point did you stop being a boy/girl. Also, at what point did you become a man/woman? I'll start...",AnonymousCourage,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rvl52/at_what_point_did_you_stop_being_a_boygirl_also/,"It occurred to me one day that the point you stop being a boy and the point you become a man might not be the same. I thought of it more and found for me it was different and the order was 

the reverse of what I was expecting.

**THIS IS A LONG STORY. YOU CAN IGNORE THE STORY AND JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH YOUR OWN ANSWER :)** 

Everyone will have different definitions of being a boy/man and some of you will roll your eyes at my personal experience since it is tied strongly with my romantic relationships growing up 

but here we go:  


**The point I became a man: 19 years old**

When I was 16, I got an unrecognized contact request on MSN. I accepted it and it was someone who had tried to add someone else whose email was very similar to mine but made a typo. By chance we found out we lived in the same city and then through one of the most statistically unlikely events I've ever had in my life we pinpointed each other down to the fact that we both had taken the same summer school course a month earlier. I sat at the table with my male, public school posse. She sat at the table beside us with her female private school posse. It was funny because they had nicknames for each of us at the guy table while I know our table didn't care for any of that because we were too busy discussing the finer points of Diablo 2 min/max stats. One of her friends who sat at the table got added to the conversation, her name was Sally. That night Sally and I talked until 6am on a school night. I felt the kind of connection that only naive teenagers could feel that night and I was so sure She Was The One.

I fell head over heels for her, and she did for me as well. We were both very shy so we were indirect about it in that ""*well, if you have nobody to go to Winter Formal with, I **guess** I can go with you*"" kind of way. We chatted every night until the break of dawn and I think those 8 months or so were the happiest times of my life.

I met some of her friends, and her cousin who she was very close with. I became aquaintences of her friend and a close friend/confidant of her cousin **Vera** who had some serious emotional issues and found it easy to talk to me. This will be important later.

Sally was my second girlfriend I ever had but after the winter formal she disappeared without a trace. I did not commit any horrible faux pas at the formal so it's not like I drove her away. Just all of a sudden one day I lost all contact with her. We didn't go to the same school (her school was very far away) and her friends all similarly disappeared. It would be 3 years before I saw her again.

The question always on my mind was: why did Sally disappear? What did I do? How did I screw up so bad and not realize it? Why was it something that couldn't be at least explained to me instead of breaking off all contact with me and telling her friends to also break off all contact? Why? I wanted ""The Answer"".

In those three years I did not find another girlfriend. I went to my prom stag. I always felt miserable inside. I would sometimes think I saw her around town but then when I looked again I wasn't sure if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. We went to the same university but it was a very large campus and we were in different disciplines so sightings on campus didn't happen (or maybe did, and I didn't think it was her?). I had some interesting dates in university but I never allowed anything real to develop from them. I never called back, and I never so much as kissed a girl in those three years though I had lots of opportunities to do so.

Vera was my only link to Sally but she refused to divulge anything. I didn't push her because she was very fragile emotionally and was in a borderline abusive relationship. I got a lot of 4am phone calls in those three years and had to go pick her up when she was drunk or crying on the street and was constantly afraid she would follow through on one of her many suicide threats. 

One day when I was 19 years old, Vera called me and told me she wanted to talk over some coffee. I was used to this routine by now: something bad had happened between her boyfriend again and needed someone to talk to. Strangely this time she said she would drive over and pick me up. 

I noticed that there was someone in the front seat when she arrived and I climbed into the back seat. I leaned forward to introduce myself and I froze because there was Sally sitting in the passenger seat. ""GUESS WHO I BROUGHT???"" screech Vera estatically. It was a very awkward ride to the cafe as both Sally and I had been tricked into ""coffee"". 

At the cafe we talked about our high school days and tried to catch up on what happened in the past three years. Eventually Vera left and we had a private moment and we finally talked about the elephant in the room.

Sally: I'm really sorry about what I did to you

Me: I don't think you need to apologize... I feel like I am the one who should apologize. 

Sally: really? I always imagined this moment, I would be apologizing for... disappearing on you like that. Aren't you curious, like what happened?

This was the moment I had been waiting for for three years, and yet somehow, what came out of my mouth was completely not what I expected.

Me: I always thought you must have had your own reasons for disappearing. I'm sorry if it was something I did. 

And that was it. It felt so surreal because in the past three years ""why did you disappear?"" was everything to me. And when I finally had the answer within reach I somehow let it go and was satisfied with it. We never talked about it again. 

Looking back, this was the moment I became a man. When I could let go of the one thing I wanted most and walk away.

Sally and I would chat occasionally but it was never the same anymore. We had become different people in those three years and we eventually drifted.

I am closer with and still good friends today with Vera (who is doing much better now!) and I will forever be in her debt for what she did for me that day.



**The day I was no longer a boy: 22 years old**

This story relates to my first girlfriend, let's call her Gina. 

Gina and I met when I was 15. We started a relationship that was cute, happy and in retrospect the definition of puppy love. If it had run its course normally then it would have had little impact on my life. Unfortunately she had strict parents and when they found out about me, they threated to send her back to her home country unless we ended it. I was not a bad boy (quite the opposite, I had straight A's and never smoked/drank) but *parents, amirite?* We decided to end it and there were a lot of tears. I was quite upset and thought the whole thing super unfair. I missed pretending to be embarassed when she covered my entire locker with post-it notes with hearts on it and I missed holding her hand and I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself at lunch, after school or on weekends anymore.

Fast forward: I am now 22 years old. Sally matter had run its course. Guess who is in town? It's Gina. She went away for University (I went to a local university) and she needed someone to pick her up at the airport as she nolonger knew many people here. I agreed and picked her up. We went for some dinner and reminisced a lot. She was staying at her uncle's place because her parents had now moved back to her home country. Her uncle hated her and made her sleep on the floor and basically made her life awful during her return to our town. I helped by driving her to buy some proper bedding and pillows and ate out/hung out with her a lot that summer. I picked her up when her shifts at a local cafe were done and we spent every day of summer almost exclusively with each other.

One day someone had eyes on her at the cafe she was at and gave her his number. She discussed it with me and I told her to go for it! I didn't have any romantic thoughts of Gina and although this guy seemed a little creepy, I told her if she was interested she should go for it but use common sense. I told her she could call me if anything went wrong. Gina and Michael dated for a while although after I met him I did not like him because he seemed like a very petty person. He knew I was Gina's ex and he would ""turn up the bravado"" when I was around (eg: feed her food in front of everyone like she was a baby). Gina thought it was ridiculous too. 

Then one day the heartbreak happens: Michael dumps her. Gina is really upset and calls me at work. I was a programming intern at the time so I was expecting to stay overtime until 11PM. Instead at 4:30PM I grabbed my coat and left immediately. I found her crying on the grass at a local park, little kids pointing at her from the playground. We sat there for a while and I cheered her up the best I could. We went for dinner and a movie and went to watch airplanes at the airport while sitting in my car. This was something that Michael had always promised they would do but never did. That night she fell asleep on my shoulder and I didn't want to wake her so we just slept there. In retrospect, this is my favourite memory of a single night in my life.

For the rest of summer we went back to our pre-Michael ways of hanging out every day until summer ended and we both went back to our universities. I dropped her off at the airport and as I drove away I realized that this was my favourite summer in quite a long time (first summer not ruined by Sally and ""The Answer""). As classes went on, I realized how much I looked forward to summer. How much I looked forward to seeing Gina again. We talked a lot by skype and MSN but it just wasn't quite the same.

I revealed this to Vera, who suggested that I definitely had a thing for Gina. Hearing it from someone else made me realize that indeed I hadn't felt this way in a long time. I was saddened though. She lived on the other side of the continent. ""You'll find a way"", Vera said. And I was inspired.

I took on two extra jobs, with my classes and saved every penny I could. I also worked extremely hard to finish all my school projects early and a week before Thanksgiving I handed in all my term projects which other students would take probably another 3~4 weeks to finish. I went online and spent all my hard earned money on airplane tickets to her city for Thanksgiving. I had never worked so hard in my life for a single purpose and put everything on the line in such a crazy manner. My friends all thought I was foolish and that this would end in heartbreak but I didn't care. I've had plenty of heartbreak and this couldn't be worse than the past three years. 

I arrived and surprised Gina at her dorm. She was excited and happy that I suddenly arrived out of nowhere to visit her and I stayed for about a week. During this week we hung out and had a great time. I slept in her dorm and she showed me around her campus and she was really glad I came because everyone she knew had disappeared over thanksgiving break. The last night of the visit, I told her honestly I realized I had fallen in love with her over the past summer and if she would consider starting a relationship again. She was quiet and told me that she had to think about it.

The next day as I got ready to go past the security at the airport, she told me that she loved me back when she was 15 and when she came back at 22 we had become different people and that incredibly, she loved me again as a different person. However, she felt a relationship would be a bad idea. It was long distance. Her parents were still an issue (Her Mom eventually warmed to me but her Dad will hate me forever) and she wanted to focus on her career. She went to the United States to study because she was ambitious and wanted to succeed professionally. I was a smart guy who could have went to my pick of universities in the US but I chose to stay because of my friends, family, and I did not have big ambitious dreams. I understood what she meant and we gave each other one small kiss and I walked through the terminal. 

On that day, I ceased to be a boy. I knew I stopped being a boy because I would ever again be able to summon the boyish naivete that allowed me to drop everything and put all my effort and 

energy into chasing such a optimistic quest.

Gina and I kept in contact for quite a while after this, but eventually she hit the corporate ladder and got too busy and we drifted. We both got into relationships and last I heard she is working her way up in a big financial firm in New York. 

**Today**

I am turning 26 years old in a couple of weeks and I will be spending it with my girlfriend of 3 years. I am lucky to be a man with a job he loves, a lovely ladyfriend, surrounded by friends that make every weekend seem like it passed too fast. When I think back though, these two experiences are what made me into the man I am today. I have no regrets and will always cherish these memories.

I can't even tell you how happy I am that I get to hug him and kiss him tomorrow. This is the longest I've gone without seeing him since we met over a year ago, and it's been hard. I won't see him again till June, unless something works out. Our LDR will end in August, so not too bad, but still hard.

I can't wait! I might go to bed right now, just so I'm that much closer!"
rvj9h,22,2012-04-05,Long overdue rant,Welcome-To-Heartbrea,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rvj9h/long_overdue_rant/,"   Ok, before I kick this off, I just wanted to let you know, this might get long. It will also probably be downvoted to oblivion, as my complaints probably are insignificant compared to other legitimate posts. It might not even be downvoted as people will probably already be moving on to the next post, seeing as how I'm rambling even here. By all means, do what you have to do. This is, after all, a self-post, and meta-Hivemind dictates we not care about karma.  

So, I have no clue where to start this off, but I guess it could be this, seeing as I just got into an argument about it. A few weeks ago, my parents left the country for a week, business on my dad's part, shopping on my mom's. My grandmother, from my mother's side of the family, stayed with me and my younger sister during that week, as to drive my sister where she needed driving, etc. Now, I never really had anything against my grandmother. She's been in a different city, a few houses away from my uncle, for almost ten years. Lost contact, and having moved to a different country for about five years on two different occasions, I just plain didn't have much to do with her. I've never even been her tech kid. I'm everyone's tech kid. (This sentence sounds dumb as shit, but what I meant to convey is, if something went up with your computer, I'd get called over to reboot it, thus fixing the problem on 99% of occasions). She would always entrust this to my cousin, her other grandson, who is two years older than me, never did too great in school, but managed to get into college after two years of trying (college is messed up here. if you're interested, look up Vestibular, it's what's used to select kids into colleges here). I did it in my first try, but I got into a much better, paid albeit, college than him. He's going to a great one too, but it's free, harder to get in, etc.     

I hope you're not going to hate me, but before this next part, I'm going to need to give you a bit more background. So, I'm a sophomore in college, studying to be an engineer. I have just started an internship in February. Like I briefly went over, I have always been a hard working student. I study my ass off, especially near midterms or finals, even more so now that I have that internship. If I fail a class, I have to retake it the following semester, and since my classes are either all in the morning or all in the afternoon, if I fail a class, that means I have to retake it in the period I have free, which I am using for the internship. So I don't allow myself to not study, especially when I know I need it. My daily schedule goes a bit like this: wake up at 5:00, get ready, go to school at 6:00, last class ends around 13:00, go to internship that starts at 14:00, ends at 18:00, arrive home at 19:30, eat and have free time from 20:00 to about 22:00, which is when I force myself to sleep. The two-hour period I told you I have free, is basically useless. I try to use it to study what I had that day, so I don't have to cram too much near finals (which always ends up happening, always), however, I'm a bit exhausted around that time, and often go to bed then.   


Ok, back to when she was staying over; she stays on my case for the duration of the first day, just telling me over and over how I should be balancing my life. Mind you that this is two weeks prior to my midterms, and I'm beginning my crazy study schedule. This means I study about everyday for as long as I can, without that interfering with my sleep schedules though. No one fucks with my sleep. So, she's telling me, hey, Welcome-To-Heartbrea (fuck, I just noticed I missed a ""t""), why don't you go to a bar with your friends or something? Why don't you have more friends? Why do you just stay in all the time? (By now, I fully expect you to all be on her side, because I'm coming off as an extremely spoiled brat with an awesome grandma. Well, you're probably right...) I tell her calmly why I have to study so hard these weeks, and that I understand her point. That would have been great had it stayed like that, except for the fact it carried on for the whole week.   And one day, she's talking to me about how she ran into a distant family member I've never met, and I tell her I don't know who she's talking about. She randomly gets ticked off and starts calling me anti-social. For not knowing someone. Right. I get pissed, talk back, and that was about the last time I talked to her for that week, until today, which is when I get the news I'm visiting her this weekend, even though I hadn't been consulted about this, and this is my first weekend after midterms and was really looking forward to relaxing, etc. I didn't take this too kindly with my mother, and asked why I hadn't been consulted, and that I'm not sure I want to go. Discussion ensues.  

So, here's part two:  
I am numb. Numb in the sense I shut off some emotions. My life's been a mix of two songs lately: ""[Cat's in the Cradle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwjNBjqR-c)"", by Harry Chapin, and ""[Welcome to Heartbreak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMH0e8kIZtE)"", by Kanye West. If you know them at all, you know what I mean. If you don't, take a second to listen to them, both are great songs. If you don't feel like it, but for some odd reason, want to hear what I have to say about it, well, here goes: I strive to succeed. What does that mean? Shit, you got me. I used to know. I used to think it was all about being the boss-man at the end of the day. Heck, I still think that. But then again, I never thought that, and I still don't. I knew way back then that the most successful person was usually the one working his ass off the most, and not having a family, a proper weekend, a life. The one with the average salary, on the other hand, had a proper life, with friends and everything's all giddy like According to Jim. You've got a banging wife and friend to keep you company.  

I honestly don't know anymore what I want to be. I see myself not having 10% of the day to myself, and out of every 10 weekends, taking 6-7 to study the whole time.  
I have grown apart from my closes high-school friends. I have moved countries back and forth and I just don't have a sense of belonging. I grow attached to a place, I get it taken from me. I hate change. I finally adapt after a year at that new high school of not having any friends, get friends, get separated from them. I've lost track of how many times I've had to shed friends. And I hate that. Ever read that one text from Mary Schmich, [Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column), also known as 'Wear Sunscreen'? There's a bit that says ""friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on"". That few has come down to one person, and I thank whatever there is to thank that I'm still friends with him. Awesome friend, but we haven't been talking as much, since we graduated.  
And the numbness I refer to is my love-life, or rather, the lack thereof.  
I've never had a girlfriend. Never kissed, never touched, never had a romantic moment, never asked out, never went beyond just staring her and hoping she'd magically walk over and kiss me, we'd start dating, she'd be the one, and we'd get married and life happily ever after. But fuck, I want that to change. And I know I'm smart enough to give myself all the advice on how to succeed. Everything that gets posted to r/GetMotivated, for example, is stuff my brain could come up with all the time, and I'm never willing to listen to it. After getting into college, this being an engineering-only college, there are close to no girls in it, but last year, I managed to somehow become friends with this nice girl that I quickly became interested in. She was, however, dating, and was deeply in love with this fucker. I'd give up my free time, after I'd already passed the test and had been on vacation, to get on skype and help her with her questions, all the while she would make out with her boyfriend on the other end of the call. There were also occasions in which she blew me off when she arranged something, treated me like I was just any one else, and that was great, because I got to realizing she wasn't that awesome as I had made her out to be in my head. Really, I just don't get much talk or get to know any girls, so when one comes along, I hold on for my dear life. The girl is now single, has been for some months. I could pathetically attempt to make a move, but now that she's single, obviously, I'm not interested anymore. Fucking brain.   

Truth is, I have everything in life I could ask for. I have nice parents who provide, and extremely well, for me. They are not abusive, and if I say so myself, did a great job of raising me. I am, however, surrounded by money. They never spoiled me, but always gave me the means to spoil myself. And so I did. I surrounded myself with an Xbox, a smart phone and a computer. What else do I need to numb the wounds?  Heck, I'm even with a foot in the industry, and pretty much have a guaranteed job after I graduate (note: this is because my country really lacks engineers, not because I consider myself an apostle, or some shit). I have that one friendship at least that I'll cherish for a long time, the money to keep me entertained and well fed, a new career. But then, I realize my grandma wasn't so wrong after all. Where's the balance? What's this all about if I can't share this journey with someone?   

That's all I can remember for now. If you've stuck around, I'm glad, I suppose. "
rydo1,3,2012-04-07,I think I'm losing it,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rydo1/i_think_im_losing_it/,"I've had depression since I was 11 or so, much of it due to abuse as a child. I'm 22 in a few weeks and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I was going to attempt suicide in the 10th grade, but someone found out and reported it. Went to a counselor, but I lied and said everything was ok. They don't really care about anything so long as you can pay. 

I've lost interest in everything. I'm a runner, but I hate it now. I can't get myself to go run, go to the gym, or even draw anymore. All the things I enjoyed over the years - I've just lost interest as time went on. Now, I'm just angry. Angry at myself. I hear voices and I can't help but get pissed off. I can't keep a train of thought going. I can't remember things that happened 30 minutes ago...and I used to have photographic memory. I can't stand being around people, even my own family. I've come to hate people's voices. It annoys me to no end when I hear people talking and I want to tell them to shut the hell up. I don't know anything but anger, though I wouldn't hurt a fly. Hell, I can't even cry anymore.

By no means am I unsuccessful. Maybe I'm stupid and selfish for feeling this way as I graduated college a year early despite failing my first year. My internship was no more - they offered me a full time position instead. These things would make anyone happy, but not me. Then we have the whole 'I've never had a gf, kiss, etc.' ordeal. I went on a date last week, though, and thought things would actually change. I gave her a hug upon meeting her and we had a blast that afternoon. I can honestly say it was the happiest day of my life. I went home happier than I had ever been. Happier than when I got the job or when I graduated college. But it was all a joke. Now she's pulling strings and playing games. At least that's what I feel like is happening.

This week has been especially bad for me. I haven't been able to sleep properly. I've had gruesome nightmares, and I've lost weight (as if I wasn't slim enough). My desire to cease existing has never been stronger. I'm not strong enough to go through with it, though. I'm a coward like that. 

I wish I had friends, *real* friends who I could go out with. My mom keeps telling me I should go join some sports club or something at the Y. Easy for her to say when after paying some of their bills every month on top of my car and everything else, I don't exactly have a ton to spend. 

I feel like the only thing that can make me genuinely happy is to be in a relationship and having genuine people in my life. But I know it's not going to happen. I've come to terms with it, though it's difficult to deal with. I wish the voices would stop. I wish I weren't so angry and didn't feel like this all the time. I don't intend on seeing a counselor. I'm not paying $200+ a session for someone to pretend to care. I can't believe this is going to be me for the rest of my life. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm sure this was all poorly structured, etc., but I just can't focus on any one thing anymore. My head is constantly hurting and...I just don't know."

I tried learning programming on my own after not being able to really find a real job, and really enjoyed it.  I decided since I had some access to more loan money, I may as well go back to college.  I am currently on a CS track (first semester), but after talking to an adviser in that school, it looks like it will take longer to complete than I originally thought.

However, I did get a business minor with my Psychology degree, and my school does have an IS degree available there.  I could complete the degree faster since some of my business classes are already done, and from what I understand it could get my foot in the door in IT.

My question is, is how do I make it so that I am actually marketable candidate for jobs once I get out of college (should only take 2 years seeing I already have all my gen eds done from previous degree)?  

I already plan on getting an internship no matter what.  But, are there any certificates I should aim for or any personal projects I should do on my own time that would help me out?

Again, I really love programming, but I don't think I will have the loan money to pursue a CS degree.  

Can I get a job pursuing a IS degree?  And what should I do between now and graduation to ""guarantee"" that I land a job pretty easily?

rxzl6,6,2012-04-07,Jumpstarting a Programming Career,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxzl6/jumpstarting_a_programming_career/,"I want to program. I have experience in IT support and some programming  from a few years back. I'm working to complete a night class BS-IT program which I will focus on programming in. I also have a good background in Math and Science and have taken some more traditional theoretical CS classes in the past. Here are a few questions I'd like to posit to the community:

**1. How do I not get typecast as a IT support guy?** 

I spent 2 years doing that sort of work full time. While there I did get to do a modicum of programming so I will try to focus around that in my resume. I still fear that I will be viewed as best in a support role. Besides my work full time work with support, most of my other part-time jobs were similarly help-desk or system level support and I know that isn't really the career I want to pursue.

**2. BS-IT V. CS?** 

Due to various time personal factors and time constraints I am taking a degree in BS-IT, with a math minor, as opposed to CS. I have no doubt that CS provides stronger fundamentals, yet I am also glad to be able to take more practical classes, than those that constitute a CS degree. The program I'm in is pretty good, requiring a descent amount of math like Discrete Structures. I've supplemented this with classes in Physics and Math, I used to be a physics major, so I think I have comparable amount of knowledge to a CS grad in all areas besides high level stuff that won't play a part in my career: compilers, functional languages, assembly, and OS level programming. I know, or knew and can refresh, on concepts such as efficiency, O-notation, linked listed, data structures,etc. **Sub-question, what would be a good way to refresh my knowledge of this stuff for interviews?**

**3. iOS V. Web Development?** 

I am very interested in iOS and see the app economy as a good place to start a career. I'd like opinions as to how career development in iOS will compare to more traditional web development. I have some past experience in web development so I could leverage that to help get my foot in the door, but I think I am more passionate about iOS and see a brighter future there. I realize that all trends pass and that having the fundamentals and ability to learn are more important in the long run. But let's face: most jobs ask for a highly specific skill set so to be practical I need to start developing it ASAP.

**4. Getting my foot in the door.**

Sort of the capstone question. Given my past experience and interests how do I get my foot in the door. I need to start work sooner rather than later but I'd hate to settle for an IT support job that might further typecast me, just because it will be easier to get in the short term. My current plan is to brush up on what I do know, then learn about iOS development and try to build out a basic app that I can bring to an interview to prove I'm competent. Any advice for going about this? Any other ways to approach it? If I need to get my feet wet with internships or even free work at first I'm will to do it. I think based on my experience I could get an employable programmer within a few months of refreshing and learning.

Thanks!"
rxmts,3,2012-04-07,Questions about CS?,Esotericity,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/rxmts/questions_about_cs/,"So I'm going to be a freshman CS major this coming fall, and I had a couple of questions:

1. What programming languages are typically used in the CS classes? Also, do classes tend to be only theoretical at first, or can I expect to have actual coding assignments my first year?

2. What non-CS classes do students usually end up taking their first year (such as Physics)? 

3. How hard is it to land a paid CS-related (such as coding?) internship during the summer after freshman year? I'm pretty motivated and willing to work my ass off to obtain the skills that an internship would require. Is it really uncommon for a freshman to get an internship?

I've tried my hand at a couple of languages over the years, but I haven't really ""excelled"" at one, so I sort of want to spend summer to really get a sort of headstart for college classes, as well as work on the skills I'll need to hopefully land an internship!

rxlpq,0,2012-04-07,Need help deciding on which internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxlpq/need_help_deciding_on_which_internship/,"I have been offered two internships and I'm unsure which will lead to the most future success.


The first will have me working with other interns on a project using MySQL and JavaEE writing a web application from the ground up.


The second is focused on cyber security and will have me doing related work with C and a little Python.


The first company seems like it will allow me to put more marketable skills on my CV, while the second seems to have a better overall employee satisfaction online and better prospects for future employment(at the same company). From what I've seen online, Enterprise Java programmers seem to get paid quite a bit more on average compared to C/C++ developers, is this true? It also seems like it will be easier to move onto another job having developed applied skills outside of class with Java and SQL.

How much weight should I give to employee reviews on GlassDoor? the first company is around a 2.3 while the second has about a 3.4


Both pay around $22-23/hr(which is pretty good, I don't live in a very expensive area like in NY/CA)"

1. How available are internships/job opportunities in DC for poli sci majors? Is it tough to find/secure those internships?

rxd8d,1,2012-04-06,Need some advice for an upcoming interview.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rxd8d/need_some_advice_for_an_upcoming_interview/,"So I have a job interview next week for a position I REALLY want. I'm going to try to keep this relatively vague but the position is for the assistant to the head of PR for a record label. When I was finishing up college, I interned at a different label where this guy had been working. Therefore, the interview is with someone I already know and who already knows a lot of my work ethic.

This isn't bad by any means. When I was an intern he gave me a lot of tasks to do that I was able to get done quickly and efficiently and he actually helped me land my first job in the industry, which I unfortunately got laid off from. I'm nervous simply because I don't want to come off as too chummy during the interview but at the same time I don't want to be too formal. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Or does anyone have any advice in general?"

[What is your feedback to pepole saying they hate unity and want gnome back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957tg?context=5)|Gnome the upstream moved on from Gnome 2.x. Unity did not take it away, it's simply that the sun has set on Gnome, at least for the upstream developers and maintainers.
 |I don't know how you can hate Unity. I find it highly efficient and a pleasure to use on my netbook and my workstation.
[It's so pretty, beautiful, elegant, promising! But FUCK, it was as buggy as KDE 3.9.9.9.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49dned?context=5)|I'm not going to say anything here that might offend KDE 3.9.9.3 developers.
 |I can say, again, that there has been a huge focus on robustness in 12.04 for all of Canonical developed code that lands on Ubuntu, not just Unity. We will probably make one last Unity upload this Monday, so if you want to give it a spin on Tuesday there *shouldn't* be any new bad Unity bugs. However, experience tells me there will be. So if you could help verify that it works perfectly, or help us suss out those last critical issues ... that would be great.
[Can you give us some of the major differences you noticed immediately in the environment between working for Microsoft and Canonical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The differences between the environments could not be bigger. On the whole, I find Canonical engineering staff to be smarter than Microsoft engineers. Canonical engineers are, as a group, the most humble group of engineers I've ever encountered. Microsoft thrives on conflict, Canonical thrives on mutual support.
[Is it almost like going from working in a corporation to a small office environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The Ubuntu Engineering team is a home-based work force, so my office is small indeed (part of my bedroom)! :) Working from home is much different than working in an office, in ways that would take too long to go into.
[What do you think is holding back any Linux (including Ubuntu) from being on more desktops for home users? I personally think its due to not being easy to get certain tasks done as easily as in Windows since half of the time you have to enter the terminal to do what you need. What do you think Ubuntu can learn from Windows (which everyone uses)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495a0c?context=5)|I think that people are used to Windows and there are misperceptions that Linux based systems are harder to use.
 |For example, you don't, in fact, need to use the terminal in Ubuntu to do normal things. There are GUI ways to do anything. Similarly, there are some tasks on Windows that require their command line. I think Ubuntu is easier to use than Windows.
 |I also think that Microsoft and Apple have marketing budgets that are orders of magnitude larger than Canonical's entire budget.
[Who and how decides on stuff like using Unity instead of Gnome(for Ubuntu), and what were the primary reasons to abandon using Gnome to use something not nearly as much tested and arguably reliable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957mj?context=5)|There wasn't a single moment when sabdfl suddenly annonuced to us ""we are making Unity"". These things evolve slowly. Unity started during the netbook craze. Canonical's OEM team started a project called ""Ubuntu Netbook Remix"" because OEMs wanted something with more consumer appeal than GNOME offered. Slowly over time, we realized that we could create something better than GNOME. Obviously GNOME upstream came to the same conclusion because they went on to create gnome-shell.
[Can I have a *free* copy of Ubuntu?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496kz4?context=5)|Yes, if you send $5 I will send you a free copy/
 |I just occurred to me that maybe you weren't being snarky. Just in case my sarcasm detectors were overly sensitive, Ubuntu is free to use and share, and always will be. You can download it from ubuntu.com.
[Do you think all Android smartphones constructors will embrace Ubuntu for Android and produce smartphones running Android and Ubuntu? How is the process going for now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495af6?context=5)|Yes, I believe that Ubuntu for Android will be pretty standard on higher end phones in the coming years.

I like the openess of it relative to iOS (I will never by an iPhone under the current circumstances).

[How does one profit from providing free software? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4964jd?context=5)|Canonical strives to make money from Ubuntu by ""providing services in and around Ubuntu"". I have friends who earn a living providing training for free software. Many Free software vendors provide support and consulting (see [Link to blue-mind.net](http://blue-mind.net) for example). However they do it, apparantly Red Hat now pulls down $1billion a year! So, it can be done.
[A charge often levelled at Canonical is of a lack of ""giving back"" to upstream communities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|When one chooses to write Free software (in the sense of the 4 freedoms) one does so for the benefits that accrue to the users of the software, not themselves. In other words, we make our software free to bestow freedom upon those who use our software. There are responsibilities encoded in the licenses for users of Free software though, and those are pretty simple, keep the software Free.
[What responsibilities would you say that companies such as Canonical have to the wider Free Software community and do you think that Canonical does enough in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of making money from the Ubuntu Archive, there are lots of ways to do that. Affiliates codes, as in the Banshee case, are a good example of how you can do that. You can also straight up sell your software. For all of the money that Canonical spends on Ubuntu, I think it's only logical that they claim a slice of revenue to continue to support it.
[A bit relatedly, an issue for third parties is how they can make money out of products in the Ubuntu archive. Canonical has shown with the Banshee Amazon move that it is willing to take a slice of this kind of revenue for itself. Do you think there are/should be any boundaries to this kind of activity on Canonical's side? How can upstream projects be sure that they will be able to make money from products in the Ubuntu archive when Canonical reserves the right to divert this away from them? (Is this just a part of the deal that you accept when writing free software?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of diverting, this is, indeed part of writing Free software. People can and do choose to use it to make money. For commercial projects, such as Firefox, there are different approaches, like reserving the trademark, etc...
[I have a question about Ubuntu for Android. Which of the new and upcomming SOCs would you recommend for Ubuntu for Android? Tegra 3, Qualcomm S4, Huawei K3V2, OMAP5, the new Exynos?  And a second Question.

I think there was some initial confusion about this because Canonical is not making a ""Ubuntu for Android Edition"", because there is so much handset specific work required that an Eiditon would not make sense.

 |Compared to Windows and OS X, I think Ubuntu 12.04 is better in every way.

[How do you gather community feedback aside from user-submitted sources?  What I'm specifically getting at is, do you occasionally read blog posts or articles or reviews to see what critics/reviewers/users think, and is that feedback taken in?

I, personally, suspect that there will be multiple technologies that are well supported for this. I think QML and HTML5 are going to be good choices. Personally, I am currently working on a new Quickly template to make it easy to write HTML5 front ends, with Python backends.
 |In terms of major changes ... I think it will take a while for it to sink in for people just how rock solid the Ubuntu client has become.

 |I feel that my top responsibility is to continually drive improvements to how we build and deliver Ubuntu so we can meet and exceed user expectations for quality and robustness.
 |Just realized that I didn't answer your question. How can *we* help Ubuntu's market share?
 |I would say, using Ubuntu is a good start :) Share Ubuntu. Share your knowledge. Most of all follow the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. I think the CoC is one of the strongest things that Ubuntu has going for it. If people know they can participate in the Ubuntu community without fear, more people will take the plunge.

[I, personally, would really like to see applications become more Ubuntu-ish. For example Libreoffice or Firefox being cross-platform beasts at heart, have nice, but not full integration. Esp. compared to other applications, such as the more-gnome-ish Abiword, Gnucalc or Midori. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Firefox and LibreOffice as upstreams both see themselves as cross platform, and the portability of their experience across platforms is important to them. We do cooperate, and they do listen. We also offer patches. We carry distro patches where necessary.  From a community perspective, I think having more Ubuntu advocates in those upstream communities would help. Also, just having more users in general make Ubuntu more important to them, so just being a user helps :)
[Does the engineering team invest time and effort into integration of such third-party applications? And how to do do that? Do you coöperate with the upstream developers? Are upstream developers of Firefox and Libreoffice listening to Canonicals suggestions, changes and integration-issues? Is there something we, the community can do to ease your work there? E.g. vote on upstream patches, mail upstream developers and so on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Canonical puts a lot of effort into making these apps integrate with Ubuntu.

Consider how many packages are an ""integral"" part of Ubuntu. Then calculate how many engineers wold have to working on those packages for Ubuntu to be on the top contributor list for those projects. We'd never have time to write Ubuntu!
 |Anyway, that misses the point. What Ubuntu brings to Free software is critically important. Every six months Ubuntu allows you to access the latest and greatest Free software in an integrated user experience. We make Free software matter to people who would never otherwise consider using it. That's our role. It's an important role. It is a role that I am very proud to be part of.

It's just something that the release manager wrote in release notes for a beta. To be honest, I was glad to hear that someone even read the release notes.

In other words, there is only one distribution, but any of the major desktop environments can be installed.   It seems like out of all of the distributions out there, Ubuntu could gain the most from this philosophy. They could capitalize on being being the ubiquitous distribution, but cater to the various tastes as far as workflow and desktop organization.

I'd always thought Kubuntu was a great product and a credit to the project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49bnuo?context=5)|It's actually not accurate to say that paid development of Kubuntu stopped. There are many flavors in the flavors community, and only Kubuntu had a dedicated person. This was strange because while Kubutu is great, it is not one of the more popular flavors. Also, it didn't make business sense anymore of Canonical to offer paid support for Kubuntu. Therefore, we changed the way we support flavors so that all flavors (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, UbuntuStudio, etc...) all have access to the same resources.
 |Note that there was exactly one person who was paid to work on Kubuntu, and Kubuntu is a largish community. I really don't expect that you'll see any difference in the quality of the project.
 |At 12.10 UDS I would like us to revisit how we manage flavors and see if we can be providing better infastructure and services to make it easier for them to do what they want to do, rather than just keep doing it the way we have been for years without thinking.

rx5ko,3,2012-04-06,How do other people find and get internships?  (Chemical/Biomedical),[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rx5ko/how_do_other_people_find_and_get_internships/,"I'm a female sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, biomedical option (my university doesn't have stand alone biomedical engineering, it's chemical engineering plus some specialized classes).  I have been trying to find and apply for internships since the fall.  I have looked all over the internet with no success.  The few I did find were not relevant to my interests and I was denied anyway.  My university's career services center is not helpful to me; they exclusively help chemical engineers get internships at oil and natural gas companies, which is useless to me as I want to be a biomedical engineer.  I don't even know what companies I should be looking at for biomedical engineering internships besides the few I have found through internet research that do not accept undergraduate interns.

Am I not a strong candidate?  I am a female sophomore as I said, but I started college with 32 hours from AP credits so I have junior standing.  I have had some chemical and general engineering classes (if it makes a difference, specifically chem e fundamentals, chem e computing, chem e fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, statics, electromechanical systems...).  The chemical engineering classes are only offered fall or spring and must be sequential so I'm forced into a 4 year degree, which just means I'll only be taking minimum hours to be a full time student the next two years.  I have a 4.0 GPA (yes, straight As), work as a research assistant in the chemistry department, am in my university's honors college (which means extra classes and honors classes), have three years of programming under my belt in java and Excel visual basic, have been involved in my university's orchestra playing the bassoon, and have been involved in robotics club.  I'm taking 18 hours this semester and working and literally have no time to do anything else.  So, why can't I find or get an internship?"

Most people say that your school doesn't really matter in CS, so long as you're smart, know the material, and have enough background and projects to prove that you're smart and know the material.

But at the same time, in that damn UT thread I'm reading people going ""Yeah lol me and my 3 friends all got internships at Facebook"" and the guy after that going ""Hurr durr I got an internship at Amazon as a freshman"" and I'm going, how the fuck did you get that opportunity. 

I've been writing code since I was 12, I have literally dozens of projects, and I'd like to think I know this material pretty damn well. How the fuck did I miss out on that opportunity.

ryq22,0,2012-04-07,"Asking for ""Friend Zone"" advice, I promise no whining!",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ryq22/asking_for_friend_zone_advice_i_promise_no_whining/,"I promise this isn’t complaining about the “friend zone” because I fully admit I put myself there.  I’m more curious if I can pull myself out.


Back story made short – I dated a girl for 7 years, and the last 6 months of that we were engaged.  Then she left me for some really shitty reasons.  That’s a whole other story.


Shortly after my S.O. left me, I was chatting up this girl I was friends with and see often (We’ll call her Allie, not her real name).  She’s a bit younger than me, but not creepy younger, less than 10 years younger.  Or at least I feel that’s less than creepy.  Anywho, through an internship I get free tickets to orchestra concerts and the other stuff affiliated with the orchestra.  There was a big band concert close to Valentines Day and my BFF who was supposed to join me bailed.  So I asked Allie if she would like to go.  I was completely oblivious to Valentines Day or the fact it was a Valentines themed big band concert, and she took this as me asking her out/wanting a rebound.  She has been a rebound girl before, so all the shits were flipped.  I was in no mood to date or anything, so my intentions were nothing of the sort.  We had a chat; I explained I was not trying to ask her out, just a dumb ass with no concept of calendar dates at the time.  I went on to say that yes, I found her attractive and fun, but obviously it wouldn’t be very fair to her or myself if anything like that were to happen.  I wanted a friend who wasn’t treating me like a fragile doll, and she was doing it, so I just wanted company at a concert, and wanted to keep our friendship where it was.  (We banter like House and Cuddy due to two very sarcastic attitudes towards life.)


So now we’ve hung out more.  I have really started to dig her.  But I am obviously in the hardcore friend zone place, and put there by my own actions.  What’s more annoying is her inherent distrust of men in general because all the ones she wants ignore her and anyone actively trying to flirt with her is instantly treated like shit.  I joke about flirting with her sometimes and get a stern glare.  Using the word “date” freaks her out, but twice she’s come over to my apartment alone and I have made her dinner.  No moves were made because I don’t feel like getting punched in the balls.


I don’t want to ruin a friendship, because honestly I believe going on one or two dates to “test out waters” (I don’t mean sex, I mean personality compatibility) shouldn’t mean we can’t be friends.  But I’m afraid that 1) the simple act of asking is going to kill the friendship and 2) she’s young enough to think that dating does mean if it isn’t going to work, we can’t be friends at the end regardless.  Do I have any hope, or did I ruin this chance a while back?

ryoiq,2,2012-04-07,I am giving up.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ryoiq/i_am_giving_up/,"I quit my job in the middle of march. I had just graduated college exactly one year ago and got a high paying job as a programmer. It was all planned out very well by myself. I had the internships, decent grades, independence from my parents and everything. I even had a girlfriend I was in love with. I moved into a beautiful apartment and was honestly making a bonafide name for myself... 


--Then I dumped my girlfriend because I was so paranoid and distrusting. I know it was my fault. She was going to move in etc... It broke her heart and mine too, because deep down I thought I really loved her and she thought she really loved me. That might very well be true but I'm not sure, it is too late anyway.







--Then, I quit my job because the stress it was causing me was literally out of my control. The day I quit, I couldn't control myself walking out the door, I just *knew* I had too. It was a confusing and depressing work environment. I don't think quitting was totally my fault, I think it is something I was forced to do.





--Then I moved back in with my parents and dissolved the entire life I had created for myself. I only vaguely know what is *actually* going on with my life right now.



--I have been a pretty steady substance abuser since I was in middle school. I've never been caught (beside some close scrapes with death, and a brief chat with my parents [they are abusers too]) and I have always been able to function pretty well in society with my problem. It got in the way of my grades but I've been able to complete tasks outside of my field of work well... And I was definitely at the top of my class when it came to programming abilities. Anyway... I'm totally clean now. But who knows for how long.



..


-- I threw it all out. I don't even know why. I am so confused and extremely Jaded as to what exactly happen. My confusion doesn't totally stem from the substance usage either, but that was definitely a part of it. I will admit that.




..


-- So I am a officially giving up. I *really* dont give a fuck anymore. I've always pushed myself to care about shit but it was all fabricated in my head so I wouldn't be a ""loser"" or let my parents down, but I can't do it anymore. And I don't care because I am not sure why I should care. Poverty and an uninsured lifestyle doesn't sound too bad to me. Living as a bum feels like its a option right now. I hate living with my parents. I hate my situation. Once upon a time I wanted to work for the government or serve in the military. I can't do that for some unknown reason. And I am classified as 'self-destructive'... Screw it. Fuck em'."

Due to this, u can see the given minimal amount of advice and reads (all appreciated). So I thought I would give Reddit a go:

I am a very well rounded IT guy, with a passion for programming in particular. I have been through a BS program less the internship as I refuse to go lower than minimum wage (i.e. free) and/or such opportunities find the institution lacking. Since then, the catalog for my degree has changed, so I am making peace without it. I go up for job interviews and get myself no farther than a submitted resume. I have even changed my strategy and made this website: [http://goo.gl/qqpN8](http://goo.gl/qqpN8) to showcase my highlights (but not at all exhaustive) for specific areas in the US and paid for classified ads. The 'internship' is notable as I am just trying to get my foot in the door.

Because IT is so vast, with programming and engineering in particular, I spend my time researching the requirements for the job I am applying for. This has made me that well rounded guy I spoke of earlier, but has made me a victim of being a jack-of-all-trades; unfortunately being a master of none.

I embrace my gung-ho attitude and find it to be a trait that has powered my career before. But I am starting to lose steam. I want it straight. What is not appealing about everything I am doing? What are the technologies that I need to focus on that are in great demand at the moment?

I have relevant experience in my field from two internships and my GPA is alright for my major (3.1 in major) but I am still struggling to get past the application process with most companies. 

I believe my cover letter is hurting me the most because that is obviously the first thing a company will look at. So far I have been structuring my letters in the following format:

-Introduction about my academic background, discussing relevant coursework and programs I am involved with.

-Next I talk about my relevant work experience and the results of my internships. 

-Finally I conclude with how I believe I will fit into the company I am applying for, and discuss any other relevant experience I have that I think would be a strength for the company. 

Does this seem like a logical format or am I taking too long to begin talking about what I would bring to the company? Should the entire letter be about how I can contribute to the company and tie in my information with that discussion, or does it make sense to keep it separate?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, with graduation approaching I am starting to get nervous about finding a position and I just want to make sure I am marketing myself in the best possible way. 

Thanks for any help or advice, I really appreciate it.

s1cw6,5,2012-04-09,"I feel like the last company took advantage of me, can I really not do anything about it?",reallyjustconfused,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/s1cw6/i_feel_like_the_last_company_took_advantage_of_me/,"Coming out of undergraduate, I was desperate for some sort of income as I had a lot of bills needing repayment.  I willingly took an internship with a company in SC, as the person who hired me really sold me on the process they follow at the company.  Unfortunately, two weeks into my internship, he was forced to resign (the company owner has some pride issues, and their original partnership plans fell through when the owner decided he didn't need the guy who hired me anymore)

Here's the beginning of the problems, after those two weeks, I started to put in more than 30 hours, occasionally surpassing 40 hours.  I was doing development work up to par with their senior developer and front-end developer - but I was still the ""intern"".  

Throughout my whole employment there, I was required to be at the office no later than 9am (the owner didn't bother to hide his disapproval if I were late to other employees); I was expected to show up during ""happy hours"" (even though I didn't drink beer, AND the owner pulled me aside telling me it's very important that I go to these, or else I wasn't being part of the ""team"") or any other activities they were holding; and I was required to file leave of absence forms for unpaid vacations or sick leave (those were probably the only times I worked less than 30 hours).  I was never paid overtime, and it was always on an hourly basis. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I was given a ""promotion"" (if you can call it that, they paid me 50% LESS for a person with my experience and degree) to ""junior developer.""  Even though I held a more ""permanent"" role, I was not treated the same way as the other hired employees. All this time, the company had not taken out taxes like all my older jobs and offered no benefits.  I began to worry.  During my internship was fine, I figured they handled it like the way my college did when I was a student assistant.  But if I was supposed to be ""salaried"" and supposed to be an employee, why wasn't I given benefits and etcetera?  I wasn't as worried about the benefits (all of my previous jobs had never offered me any benefits as I was always part time or PRN, so it didn't occur to me to ask about it) as much as the taxes not being taken out, so I confronted the owner about his.  His only response was that this would be better when I went back to graduate school during fall of the next year.  He said I was a student anyways, so it wouldn't be a big deal; they would give me a break. (Actually, I had already graduated at the time and I didn't find out until later that I couldn't really count my tuition fees from that spring semester as part of this tax season because I paid them off last fall).  There were other things too that let me know that I wasn't held with the same respect as other employees - I was given no key to the office (everyone had one), offered no personalized business cards like the rest, and so forth.

Near the end of my employment, I heard him asking others if I was worth keeping at the company, as he just hired a new director at a 6 figure salary, easily 3 times more than I was making, and he felt that I was not fitting in with the company, even though I got along well with the group I was working with.  I knew company profits were down and business was slow, but I was the only other developer who could help take the load off of their senior developer, who would have been overallocated had I not been hired as their intern.  So knowing I was next to be fired and knowing that the two managers/directors I trusted were trying to buy me extra time, I quickly found another job and high tailed out of there.

Anyways, I shouldn't have believed the owner at all, about anything. I definitely owned the government this year, and anyone I spoke to about it has told me that I was wronged.

I have already also filed an SS-8 (employee determination form) with the IRS and am still waiting to hear back...but I know it takes forever.

And after speaking with the guy who originally hired me for the company, he said that he knows I had/have an employee file with the company, because he didn't have me sign a contract like he did other contractors for the company.  

Is there no legal action I can take about what the company just did to me?  "

I'm a 24 year old college graduate. I have 7 years experience in Information Technology, 8 years experience running an at home business doing web development. I graduated in 2010 with an AAS. As part of my degree I had to do an internship in the field of my degree, I interviewed for my internship at the company I currently work and was accepted for 120 hours unpaid in September of 2010. After my internship ended in early 2011 I was hired as a temporary employee (first intern hired ever apparently) through an agency working as a sys/network administrator under the director of I.T. In feburary of 2012 I was hired full time for human resources and I.T. basically filling two job roles helping HR, and my current duties under I.T. 9 days after I was hired my boss called and told me he was putting in his two week notice and moving to Florida to be a I.T. director at a new company. 

Being the most familiar with the layout of our company, operational needs, and experience the upper management decided that I would assume the responsibilities of my boss and would review the performance after 30 days. 

He had a Bachelors in CIS and 20 years experience, was proficient in our MRP(manufacturing resource planning) software and written some custom applications for the business.I'm not to his proficiency level in the MRP software, nor have I written in the language he developed the applications in, I'm more or less in a maintenance role at the moment, making sure the business runs smoothly. 

**My 30 day eval is this week**

I need some pointers on salary negotiations - I've never negotiated my salary before, I'm informed on our area's salary range for network administrators I'm grossly underpaid (about ~27k with OT). Right now I'm hourly, but they are leaning towards putting me on salary. The starting salary for an entry level in our area is about 37K, 35 - 40 was what I was thinking of. I'm not greedy but I live with my parents right now and I have a car loan I would like to move out this year. (Additional information: Health insurance to start after 90 days, profit sharing, 401k, tuition reimbursement after 12 months - I want to go back and get my bachelors in CIS) 

Additionally I need help in my department, my boss was struggling trying to keep up with just him (3 locations in the US, two in state, one across the US with between 90 - 120 personnel total), which is why they hired me after my internship. I want to come off with saying I need help but not in a way that It sounds I can't handle the job. "

I've always been that fat girl ever since I was young.  When I hit high school all I ever did was eat and drink junk and that made me balloon up quickly. I never really cared what I really looked like, my excuse was I'd lose it later once I'm done with school. 

Well now I'm a junior in college and I have an office job in a corporation, things probably aren't going to get more stable for me aside from just finishing up school and focusing on work.  Lately I've just been feeling insanely depressed about my looks and I just really want to make a total lifestyle change.

I've been diagnosed with PCOS and because of that I actually have acanthosis nigricans.  The only ""treatment"" for these is to lose weight, and even then there is a small chance that it won't help since there are even slim women with PCOS. 

I was raised on the whole ""finish your plate"" mentality, so this basically made me over eat.  I over eat all the time because my eyes are way too big for my stomach, and I just don't want to deal with left overs.  I've just been stupidly lazy in taking care of myself and I've been yo-yo dieting in the past.  I even did stupid stuff such as the master cleanse that took me down to 245 lbs, but I eventually gave in and started eating out again. 

I'm not huge on cardio, because I have osgood slaughter in one of my knees that easily flares up since it's carrying so much damn weight, but unlike a lot of women, I love to lift and weight train.  I don't want to be one of those women that always needs a man to help lift stuff or open jars, but I don't want to be a shredded woman that looks like she's on roids.  But I recently started jumping on the elliptical and bike since it doesn't hurt my knee so much.

I've been looking online and there are people that state the the south beach diet helps a lot with women diagnosed with PCOS, I just signed up for it online today.

My main issue is having food readily available...  I'm studying to be a computer engineer and I currently work at a huge company as an intern, this alone doesn't give me a lot of time to spend shopping for and making meals for myself.  It would probably go better if I actually knew how to cook.  Right now I'm just steaming broccoli and eating canned tuna... It also doesn't help when my roommate cooks huge amounts of delicious and fatty asian foods...

I currently hate how i feel and how I look right now and I want to be healthy target weight for myself is probably 150 lbs.  I definitely am hoping to drive my self forward, but figured I would start in r/loseit to see if anyone else is in my shoes, if anyone knows of any easy recipes I can make fast and eat on the go, stories of your weight loss journey, any words of wisdom/encouragement.

TL;DR: I'm new, I have PCOS, I hate how i look/feel, I'm starting the South Beach diet, hoping to drop to 150 lbs. "

We were on the gymnastics team together almost ten years ago.  Although we were never particularly close, I was deeply saddened when I heard the news of her accident five years ago.  And I've always kind of felt guilty for not visiting her in the hospital, or even now at her parents' home...  I guess I felt like it would be awkward, just simply because of the fact that we weren't really close friends.  Or maybe just thought that she might not even recognize me after all these years...

She was a quiet and soft spoken girl, but always friendly and kind to anyone.  The one memory that stands out to me of her, is the time when she decided to try a butterfly leap at gymnastics practice.  She had apparently seen it on TV the night before.  So she just went for it!  And then ended up breaking her wrist.  We all laughed about it afterwards, but she really surprised me that day how spontaneous she was.  And from all of the stories I've heard about her time at the hospital, I know that she probably surprised many other people with her kindness, her empathy, her charm, or her spontaneity because I heard that her recovery room was always brimming with people.  She had many friends, of many backgrounds, from all over the world.  She was just a beautiful person, inside and out.  

I check her mother's blog about once a week to check on her progress.  She's now able to move around on her own (with assistance) and is communicating through the use of an iPad!  But I know that her family has been struggling financially for sometime from the medical bills and aftercare costs.  I try to make donations when I am able, but I've been living on a tight budget as well and can't give as much as I'd like.  I imagine that donations have also stopped coming in as frequently since it's now been some time since the accident.

So today I've decided to solicit the Reddit community for help.  I feel like one of those kids walking around the parking lot with boxes of chocolate caramel turtles asking to help me pay for my summer internship program...  But hey, it can't hurt, right?  If you have a dollar, or 5, or 10 to spare today, could you please make a donation [at her mom's page](http://dearada.blogspot.com/)?  

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can help get the word out about Ada and her family to more people out there."

I'm in the process of finishing up college and hope to launch a new company by then or soon after. 

The company will develop and launch the following:
E-commerce sites and platforms
Mobile apps (practical, not games)
tech patents and products
Business development consulting (included)

The major roadblock is coding. I have the entire image drawn up in my head but never learned how to code. I've spoken with many coders and while I don't mind sharing the company with them, 50% of it just for the initial coding is pretty ridiculous. I also don't want to outsource the coding either (even though it can be less costly).

How should I go about acquiring people to code for the new company? 
I've come up with the following ways
1. Hire a software development company to do it for me
2. Get a team of coders who want to help start the company
3. Get a single coder who is knowledgeable in all of the necessary languages to do it
4. Hire interns to code
5. Work in tandem with a software company and give them a portion of the company instead of cash (kind of how ebay owns 25% of craigslist).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and feel free to message me to discuss if you've started a company before.

I'm already quite experienced with business operations, marketing, etc. The main thing I'm looking for is advice on the best way to acquire coders. I know that. The 50% part was just for the coding and then not staying with the business and multiple people have said that to me. I don't mind splitting a company with a technical co-founder, but they'd need to stay with the company for that amount. "
s08uo,4,2012-04-08,Summer Housing Needed! Please help!,EndlessMike_,UMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMW/comments/s08uo/summer_housing_needed_please_help/,"Hey guys,

I am returning to an internship I had in Fredericksburg, last summer (@ end of May - @end of August), and I am looking for a room.While the neighborhood I lived in was nice, there simply were not a lot of young people(I am a 21 year old male in engineering). Downtown Fredericksburg seemed to be the 'hip' part of town, so I thought it would be cool to find a place there. I have been scouring craigslist for a room -- anywhere -- not having much luck.

Does anyone on here have any tips, suggestions, or is anyone looking for a roommate?

Thank you for your help!

- How difficult is the first year? Do they try to weed out students or do classes get harder as you go on? 

- On the same line, how difficult and rare is it to maintain a high GPA? (3.8-4.0)? 

- Are most students if not all, in the honors or scholars program? I assume so since engineering is more difficult to get into. Is there any significance to being in honors? 

- On average how many hours do you spend studying a week? 

- Since the classes for the first two years are large, how hard is for your professors to know you personally? Like if you needed a recommendation for transfers or interns. 

Thanks~."

Lets make this a discussion: have you picked a school yet? If so, what swayed you? If not, which schools are you still considering? What other information are you currently looking for? Make your posts as broad or specific as you'd like.

Have nothing objective to add? Just feel like blurting out your acceptance story and/or ranting about admissions? Go ahead!

I'll start:

I'm a Californian and I'm currently deciding between UC Davis and UC San Diego. I'm a chem major who's interested in research and lab work, and so both schools are quite strong in that regard. My sister goes to Davis, so I've visited there a good bit and appreciate the homely feel that it has (which may be a factor of me visiting often). I recently came back from Triton Day at UCSD and it felt distinctly less ""comfortable"" there, but I feel that it might have more to offer academically (San Diego is a hotspot for biotechnology, so internships would be easier to get). I'm considering going back to San Diego to get another look at the campus, but I'm torn in the middle at this point. I have no doubt that I would be happy at both schools, but Davis feels more like home (not to say UCSD feels **un**homely), while San Diego has a better academic reputation (both are top ranked research universities, however). I want to have new experiences (San Diego is farther away and culturally more different than Davis), but that sacrifices the ""home"" feel of the other school. "

I ended up landing an internship by the skin of my teeth, then I didn't do well enough in my grades to be admitted to grad school (my job offer is contingent on grad school). I fell deeper into depression when my husband lost his job and our insurance.

These ads would then rotate either at a set time or whenever the page refreshed. 

Most importantly the software would need to track and display analytics for the ads. Click through rates, location, things like that.

Everything I have found so far has been a .net application, like [XIGLA.](http://www.xigla.com/absolutebm/) I'm not sure if that means the ads will only work on .net sites or if the app was just made with .net. I want to be able to host ads on joomla, wordpress, ning, drupal, etc.

s2tf4,2,2012-04-10,Internship Overload,MissingNo_1,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s2tf4/internship_overload/,"In order to graduate my program requires a 200 hour internship during the last semester of school in which hours are logged over the course of 15 weeks. 

I got a part-time position at this company a year ago, and this past January my internship started at a management position. I received extremely poor training (The lack of training has made me doubt my competence at my position many times). I have worked 50-60+ hour weeks for the past month, and I have come down with an illness due to lack of sleep and the stress from the job. 

The organization is shoddy, and my work rate will continue until the end of this semester (early May). 

I am not by any means ""interning"". They threw me into this management position, and are expecting to do all of this work which I have neither training nor time for (my department is under staffed as well).

So far I have told my boss that I cannot work 60 hour weeks because it will more than likely cause myself to stay sick, but he just went on vacation and I am receiving no help because we don't have the bodies.

Is there any real chance that they would terminate me early if I let them know now that I won't be staying after I graduate? If so, I wouldn't be able to get my diploma. 

The other option is to wait until I have my diploma, then put in my 2 weeks. I have been mentally and physically drained for nearly a month, and I wish to not prolong my stay unless absolutely necessary.

From those of you that come from the corporate world, what do you suggest I do? "
s2rso,6,2012-04-10,"About to graduate, feeling helpless/lost/depressed....help me Reddit",IntotheRealWorld,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s2rso/about_to_graduate_feeling/,"I am about to graduate undergrad with a bachelors in Management Information Systems and I feel like I have lost all my passion in life. This time last year I was very motivated to graduate, start a career in IT and move out of my parents, but now as I feel I get closer to graduation I find it hard to motivate myself to do anything. The only way I can think to express my feelings is by explaining the factors which I believe lead to my feeling of this. The main things that distract me the most are job hunting/school, legal troubles and my awareness of issues.
 Job hunting, while I know I haven't been searching long (about 3 months) I am starting to realize things about my education that may actually set me back. I never had an internship nor worked in my field of study and now this is hurting my job search. I love what I went to school for, specifically the idea of creating a solution for a business based on technology. I become discouraged when I search for jobs because they are mostly more technical positions, which I also enjoy but my Major isn't as technical as say a Computer Science degree. A lot of my classmates express similar feelings and are seeking jobs in other fields. 
Another big thing is I was arrested last December for possession with intent to sell marijuana, it has been dropped to three possession charges since then and I am hoping it doesn't hurt my job search (if it hasn't already). It makes me feel like I am a bad person, even though when I really think about it I had no intentions(and don't believe I actually did) to harm anyone, I was only trying to make a quick couple bucks and smoke for free. Regardless it really took a hit on me and stressed me out. 
 I have also recently become politically interested and like to spend a lot of time educating myself on the problems in the world and thinking of solutions.  I find now that the only motivation I can get is with these problems. Many times I will write down solutions, some of which are completely doable and this is the only time I feel I can make myself think, stay focused and motivated. 
Overall, I feel very unproductive lately, and can not find motivation to use on school work or job searching. I feel distracted, like I can't stay focused on anything productive. Can anyone relate to this? Or have any advice for me? I know I need to get my ass in gear and to stop feeling sorry for myself, but I can stop feeling useless, helpless, lost and depressed.

s2py4,166,2012-04-10,How Do You Make Him Stop?,Pharazlyg,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s2py4/how_do_you_make_him_stop/,"I’m an idiot. A real fucking screw up. You dabble and you muse and when you dive in it comes to bite you in the ass.  I sit on the internet all day, watching horror movies, researching legends and myths, and when I found reddit and everything it had to offer on these subjects, you can just imagine to what level my obsessions went.

I’m writing this with shaking hands. I can’t tell if it’s fear or just the poisonous amounts of caffeine and nicotine in my body right now. I’m writing this to tell you guys to stop. If you’re obsessing and reading and can’t get enough, just stop. It’s not worth it when the computer screen finally goes dark and you’re left in your room all alone. In the dark. With him.  

I played the game about a week ago. It’s called the Midnight Man. I’m going to guess anyone reading this knows what it’s all about, but just in case you don’t, here’s the basic premise; At midnight, you write your name on a piece of paper, place several drops of your blood on it, and put it in front of your door. After that, you knock twenty two times, open the door for a moment, and then close it. At this point, it’s said that the Midnight Man has entered your home. You’re supposed to have a candle with you, moving around your pitch black house until 3:33 AM. If you stop moving, the Midnight Man finds you and forces you to hallucinate your greatest fears until 3:33. 

I played with my girlfriend. The house was dark and we both had our candles. After about an hour of moving around, we became a little bored. I snuck up behind her and gave her a good scare. The scare was enough to ensure a little friskiness and we ended up on the couch in my living room. In the middle of the festivities, I turned my head and swore I saw a black shape on the already solid darkness of the room. I jumped and ended up scaring my girlfriend yet again, unintentionally this time. I told her what I saw and she told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was full of shit. I got an earful about how I was too obsessed with this horror shit and needed to get my priorities in line. This wasn’t the first time I had tried to freak her out mid-hayroll. She stormed out. The time was 2:26 AM. 

I fell asleep on the couch after that, attempting to get her to text me back. 

I had the worst nightmare that I can ever remember having. There was blood. A lot of blood. But it wasn’t coherent, it was just screams and faces. And fear. Just pure fear. At any moment I could die, and DID die, but yet, remained in fear for my life. A life that was always in danger, yet never in danger. It was fear without end. It wasn’t even corpses, or creatures, or the normal, routine stuff of nightmares that any horror addict had grown accustomed to. It was just pure terror, as if injected straight into my veins. 

I woke up, sweating and sore. My throat felt raw. In the nightmare, I knew I was running and flailing and panicking and screaming. I must have done so in real life. I can still feel the burning in my throat now. I feel like I couldn’t scream again even if I wanted. 

I was convinced I did see the black shape at this point. I checked my phone; 3:35. I knew I had spent at least two minutes scanning the now, seemingly, darker room for any signs of life or otherwise. 

I told my girlfriend. She didn’t believe me. I’m not going to even go into the details. You’re all smart people. Most likely as addicted to this stuff as I am. You know how skeptics get. It wasn’t a big deal until the next night. 

I fell into bed after a ridiculously long day. The elevators had even broken just as I was on my way out (I’m an intern at an accounting firm downtown). I was just reaching that point of half-awake/half-asleep when my last bit of consciousness caught motion at the end of my bookshelf. Now, my room isn’t nearly as dark as the rest of my small house, as the windows for the second floor are right at streetlight level. However, this does mean that all sorts of crazy shadows are thrown into the room. If you had asked me a week ago if that creeped me out, I would have laughed. Not now. 

I saw it again. The shape of a man, or what something thought a man should look like. It had the appropriate limbs and structure, but it just looked unnatural. It was a shadow with texture, like a black, decomposing snakeskin sliding between the shadows of my room. It made no effort to hide itself. As it moved, I saw its mouth opening and closing sporadically, like it was trying to breathe or talk, but couldn’t quite figure out how. It became more agitated as it moved from behind the bookshelf, to in front of my desk, to the point where it peeled itself off the wall and started gliding towards me. 

I screamed like I never thought I could. I swear I tore my throat open. I screamed the way I thought no one did in real life. I scrambled to my night stand and hit the light. In one, eye-shielding instant, the room was awash in the soft glow of my lamp. The figure was gone. I sat shaking, unable to move. Sick fear was in my gut and it wasn’t going away. It still hasn’t. I sat up all night. 

I kept the light on for the next two nights. But now he’s gotten smarter. He just waits outside the circle of light, pacing and silently babbling. And he doesn’t stop there. He’s suddenly everywhere. 

Yesterday, I was told to go home from work. I don’t blame them. I look terrible. I haven’t slept more than a few hours per day. My boss found me passed out on my desk. He woke me up and told me to go home. I told him I was having some family troubles. He seemed to buy it. I stepped on the elevator and hit the ground floor button. As the elevator started moving, the lights flickered once. I almost lost it right then and there. In the instant they flickered, I knew he was there. I didn’t see him, but I saw him. I know, somehow, I did. I ran out of the elevator as soon as the doors opened wide enough. 

That night I slept at my girlfriend’s house. I thought sleeping somewhere else would help. It didn’t. The nightmares came back, except this time he was there the entire time. The screams, the pure fear, the faces, the blood, and him. He just stands there the entire time. Twice, my girlfriend woke me up. I got another lecture on this “horror shit.” She didn’t appreciate the thrashing and the screaming. I decided it was another sleepless night. 
From where I am right now, it’s about seven hours until sunset. I don’t want it to happen again. I looked everywhere for a solution. I burned sage, I bought a crucifix and a bible. I even poured a circle of salt around my bed. I don’t know if any of this works. This has never happened to anyone else who’s played. I wanted a thrill and now I got one. 

Don’t fuck up like I did. If you’re obsessed, take a break. It’s not about fear anymore. I’ve had enough.

[The individual guests put themselves there, to be sure, but the show chooses which guests and how to present them.  And it picks on minorities in particular, in a very nasty way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4aqhrn?context=5)|I'd say more of the people I dealt with were white, actually. 
[Nope never have and never will. It doesn't convey any real meaning and it just meant to hurt someone, furthermore it holds the connotation that being gay is something bad, which I dislike very much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4al9tl?context=5)|You won't make an exception to the rule? 
[How fake is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abujq?context=5)|40%. Haha, everything is embellished, but rooted in truth. People are hired to Make a couple into a love triangle, everyone has to fight, and you should see these people before they go in to hair and makeup. 
[So, these people have actual issues with the other guests but make it bigger than life somehow? Is it that the show's writers make a small family feud into some sort of incestual thing that it never was? Could you elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adk69?context=5)|It depends. Some people are really acting a lot, but the incest story that I was talking about was pretty legit. The girl who was fucking her stepdad was talking to me about it when I took her outside on a smoke break ( they had to be supervised at all times) and was telling me that her sister really did hate her for it. Her sister confirmed this many times. The couple was creepy as fuck, and the sister really did hate the fuck out of them... so their fight, story, etc. was pretty legit. 
 |On the other hand there are many instances of bullshit... 
 |One woman didn't know what accusations to make so she made up the following while I was in the room with her.. pretty hilarious : I Found a condom under the bed, we don't use condoms! 
 |I've also heard ""she's my homegirl I don't want to fight her.""
 |The best instance of this though was a scrawny little black man that seriously looked like Flava Flav, named Santiago. He had a tranny girlfriend that was approx. 400 lbs. This obviously wasn't enough of a scandal so they hired some dude to act as a third lover to make a more dramatic ""love triangle"".

The third person is just a hired ""actor"" who just goes along with whatever story the producers give. 
[Was there a particular guest, or couple, that stood out the most to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abu6r?context=5)|Oh yeah. The most disturbing was a family of two sisters and a stepfather/ father. 
 |Sister A's (lets call her Tina) father was deceased, and her mother remarried and had sister (Well call her Val). Val's father and mother had recently separated, and he and Tina, his stepdaughter, became engaged. This couple was the raspiest, dirtiest, most Beverly Hillbilly people I have ever seen. The sister, Val, was a 6 foot tall bohemeth. Absolutely disgusting. 
 |And when the time came for the on stage fight, and scrawny ass Tina kicked the shit out of her, I was the one locked in a bathroom taking off Val's shirt to reattach her mic to her newly broken bra. -_-
[Tall people are not disgusting :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahmhe?context=5)|She was 6 foot tall and probably 350 lbs... and I had to put my hands inside her sweaty shirt to fix her shit so she could go back on stage to do some more fighting. 
[Because of this story, I have an inter-quest to go on.....any idea of what season/episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ah7zq?context=5)|Ummmm... it was shot in december or january of 2009/2010.

s2ba6,18,2012-04-10,Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA?,_khronos_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s2ba6/roth_ira_vs_traditional_ira/,"I've been looking to acquire an IRA for the better part of a year, but I am on the fence about which one I should go for. I suppose I'm thinking about it relatively early - 20's, had a few internships with some money left over, still in college - but I believe that it's never too early to start putting money away for older me. I just want to put it away in the right place, with reasonable compounded interest and as tax-free as possible.

I'm leaning towards a Roth IRA at the moment, but I would really like to know what's out there before I commit. Both suggestions and additional resources are welcome.

EDIT: Thank you all who responded, I think I'll choose the Roth IRA based on the information you have given me. I'm still undecided about if I should rush to open up an account before the filing deadline on April 17th, or if I should wait, acquire more money, and open an account within the upcoming year. So additional advice on that would be helpful as well."
s29ja,0,2012-04-10,My story,ADHDthrowaway101,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s29ja/my_story/,"Hi /r/adhd, I just discovered this subreddit and after reading a lot of comments that I could relate to I decided to just sort of spill my story and heart out.  Please excuse me if the writing gets sloppy at some points.  It's late at night and I've been drinking a few beers...

So I'm 21 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 1st grade, which I believe was around the time when ADHD was starting to become more well known and understood.  I can't recall how much it affected my childhood and it's not really important to this conversation so I won't really go into it.  

You know what, let me get to my main points because I'm starting to feel less and less motivated to do this, so let me get this out quickly before I just abandon it altogether 0_o.  Fuck it I'm going James Joyce 'stream of consciousness'...

About two years ago (summer before junior year) I started to feel very depressed.  During that summer I started my first job as an intern and hated it.  I hated working for people, I hated being told what to do, I hated doing bullshit tasks etc.  Around that time I also started self-studying philosophy, which I've continued to do since then.  I feel I've become a lot more intelligent since I've started studying philosophy, but at the same time I've felt more depressed by doing it.  Ecclesiastes 1:17-18 really speaks to me there (I'm atheist btw).

Also I'm a virgin.  Not exactly an easy thing to say, even anonymously on the internet.  Never had a girlfriend, but I don't think I'm ugly and I can generally talk to girls pretty well.  I think I have an appearance issue though.  I always have to see how I look in a mirror and I'm generally uncomfortable with how I look, so I always feel that girls will just find me repulsive for whatever reason, despite deep down I know I'm rather attractive. I guess I always I always have these fear that I'm being judged around strangers or acquaintances as well.  I think I'd be a pretty baller boyfriend, I would just love nothing better to cuddle the shit out of whatever girl I'd be dating.  I really can't think of anything better than to get under the covers, spoon like a boss, and listen to that rainymood.com site for hours.  This all has been a large influence on my depression obviously.  

I have almost no motivation to do anything.  I have a bad habit of not doing my dishes and when my roommates asks me to do them I get really pissed off, despite the fact that I know I should really do my dishes.  I guess I have a really hard time being told what to do.  My major is marketing, but I fucking hate it.  I feel like college has been a general waste.  I really really hate being taught.  I have a test tomorrow and I'm looking at the book and the chapters that are supposed to be on the test and I just couldn't care less.  Despite this I still love to learn, as I mentioned before, I like to read a lot of philosophy books and I also like studying science, and economics, history, politics, psychology etc. but only if I choose to on my own.  I took a philosophy class last semester and dropped it after three days because I was starting to lose interest in it just because someone was teaching it to me.  what the fuck?  Does anyone else feel that way too?  I have this really strong desire to write a screenplay, write poetry, write song lyrics etc. but it's hard to bring myself to do any of it, and when I do I cross it out thinking it's just not good enough.

So I'm about to graduate college soon and I am trying to find a job.  And by trying I mean I've done very little about it.  Mostly it's my father who has been pushing me to send my resume out, make contacts etc. but I feel that if I get out of college and get a job in marketing, my brain will just collapse in on itself.  I wouldn't be able to handle it.  For the last few months I've been obsessing over just taking some menial job.  I was looking at some of the top thread in this subreddit, and I noticed some comments in which the redditors stated that they would like to just do menial tasks like gardening or painting.  I really wouldn't mind working at Barnes and Noble or even fucking McDonalds.  But what the hell am I supposed to do with the rest of my life?  I still what to live normally (whatever the hell that means).

I take medicine for my ADHD, and it helps me to think clearly, but I can't use it forever.  I can't really talk to anyone when I'm on it, so it wouldn't be practical to take at work or whatever.  So it's like a lose-lose situation.  If I take it at a job I'm asocial.  If I don't take it I can't think clearly.  

I was supposed to call my dad on sunday about emailing a friend of his regarding job contacts.  Still haven't done it yet.  I think I'm just going to call my parents tomorrow and tell them there's no way in hell I can get a ""real"" job right now.  I just can't do it.  What the hell should I do?  I'd really just rather sit on my ass all summer and read, sleep, relax etc maybe work at Barnes and noble.  But I really can't get by in life with this sort of overall mindset going on.  I want a normal life (again, not entirely sure what that means) but I don't see how it's possible for me to get one.

I feel like I could do a lot of great things with my life if all these issues were constraining me."

s27hg,1,2012-04-10,Time to be a grown up...but how?,walledin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/s27hg/time_to_be_a_grown_upbut_how/,"My mind feels like it's at the bursting point, and I really need to review the facts and marshal my thoughts. Something tells me this could take a while...

The paralysis in my stomach began when I was 18, but it took three years before my increasingly numerous doctors had any idea what was wrong, time I spent in a gradual but steady decline. Soon I was almost always ill. About five minutes after eating anything I'd feel like I'd swallowed live scorpions and would be incapacitated by pain. All of the money I'd saved for an apartment was quickly spent on diagnostic tests that all came back negative. Finally, my attendance at school suffered to the point there was no mathematical possibility to save my grades, so I left school. I thought I'd focus on figuring out what was wrong with me and getting better and try again.

After another year of scans, I still had no answers. I grew increasingly afraid that whatever I had was killing me by slow degrees, and no one would no why until the autopsy. I resolved to go back to school, and came up with a game plan. Skip breakfast and lunch and drink a great deal of Pepto during the school day, do my homework, then eat a meal with enough calories to keep from losing more weight and endure the pain until morning. I was maintaining good grades, but then I got extremely sick just before finals. I missed them, which meant an automatic F in every class. 

The silver lining was that I'd gotten bad enough to be diagnosed from one of the dozens of scans the doctors ordered. It took a long time, but I learned to mostly manage my condition. Still, every few months, I'll have a week and a half where the pain, nausea and exhaustion are incapacitating. 

When I went back to college yet again, I tried to get a case manager from the Center for the Disabled to review my case, but it was months before she could see me. When she did, she told me it was a shame I couldn't get in earlier, because she would have advised me to take online classes instead of coming to campus. Well, shit, why didn't that occur to me at the time? Same old story--I do well in all of my classes until my symptoms strike me down for two full weeks. The attendance policy being what it is, I'm once again forced to drop out.

Now here's the big problem--through all of this time, I've been paying for these classes from savings bonds given to me by a relative in my childhood and my parents have helped pay my outrageous medical expenses. I haven't been able to work for the same reason school hasn't panned out--I figure no employer would keep me if I might be out of commission for two weeks at a time, even if they ignored my years of unemployment.

Today I found out that my parents are having serious financial troubles of their own. I feel awful--they have their own medical bills and a mortgage to content with and here they've been giving me room, board, and paying for my medical expenses--there's no way I can keep gobbling up their resources knowing they're in trouble, and furthermore I'm 23 and want very much to be independent--I have to move out and get some sort of job, yesterday if possible. My case manager thinks I'd qualify for money from Social Security, but that process can take years and a lawyer's help to wade through. I have about $4,000 left from the bonds, so I'd have enough to pay for rent and other expenses for a little while, but how long? And won't prospective landlords care that I'm jobless? 

I'm (trying to be) a writing major, but I haven't gotten to any of the classes in freelance writing or preparing fiction for publication, and I feel lost when I think about embarking on my career at this stage. Thinking about how much I don't know makes me feel dizzy. How does one get into freelancing? Write a few dozen articles and send them out until someone bites? What format should I use for submitting them? What price do I charge per word? 

I can learn these things on my own and through trial and error, but how long will that take? With as little money as my parents have left, I don't want to stay any longer than I absolutely have to. And I don't dare assume writing can support me, certainly not at first. Unfortunately, it's my lone marketable skill. Should I take a job I can do from home, so I don't get fired the first time I get really sick? That would be ideal, but so many of them are scams... Data entry? The best my resume could possibly offer in that area is that Mavis Beacon seemed impressed with my typing speed in the high school computer lab. Actually, with how long I've been out of work, few places would think I'm a good prospect. And that's if they don't figure out I'm a touch sickly. I look healthy, just tired, so I might get away with omitting that fact for a little while. 

I can get back into volunteering to bolster my resume, which I've been itching to do for a while, but people rightfully want to know you a little before vouching for you to an employer, and enough years have passed that I might not be remembered by those I worked with in the past.

Maybe I can get work study, but that can't start until Summer semester (yes, I'm going back yet again, with online classes this time. I don't give half a damn if it takes fifty years and beggars me for life, I value education for its own sake, and I will never, ever stop trying) and work study positions are in huge demand. I want to have moved out by then to avoid any financial aid confusion and spare my parents' wallets, anyway.

I've heard some nasty stories about the local temp agency, but would that be an option? I don't need a good job right now, I just need any job. And if I get fired from whatever job I somehow land? Well, I'll get another one. I'll muddle along. It's more than time I learned to stand on my own two feet. 

An internship could work for as long as I can keep my attendance steady. They're in high demand, but it's worth a shot. Should I focus on getting a job first and go back to school in the fall? But I've wasted so much time being sick already, that doesn't seem like a viable solution either...

At this point I feel like I'm playing a game of pin the tail on the life altering decision. "
s26t3,2,2012-04-10,I don't want to go home after school is over. Anyone have any experience with my situation?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s26t3/i_dont_want_to_go_home_after_school_is_over/,"My parents don't treat me poorly, so it's not like I'm in a Harry Potter-like living situation, but I dislike how reliant I am on their welfare and we aren't currently speaking to each other due to recent events. 

I don't have any job experience, and I'm broke as all hell. I haven't had much money in my accounts for as long as I can remember and today after school has been paid for I've got less than $60 to my name and I'll have to reserve all that for food.

Do any of you have any suggestions for how I can land a job when I don't have any prior experience to put on a resume? Do I just mass apply everywhere and hope they overlook that fact? Does it even matter that I don't have job experience in anything? Every job application I've ever seen seems to require previous employment history.

I'm a 4th year computer science major but honestly I don't feel like I've learned much so I'm reluctant to try for an internship in my field. At any rate, I'd like to build up some capital so I can hopefully rent a cheap apartment while continuing to work and pay off loans.

Any suggestions at all would be pretty helpful. If you read through all that, thanks - in a way, I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head.

First off, thanks to everybody that reads this. It means a lot. Here's my situation: I'm a senior undergraduate, about to graduate with a degree in Biology. I'm taking a year off before starting grad school, so I've been trying to find some internships or short-term jobs. I've applied to a bunch of places relevant to my field, but haven't heard back from any of them yet...of course, if I do hear from any of them, it's almost certain that I'd have to consent to a drug test.

On the other hand, I do have a job interview tomorrow for a job that's not related to my field. It would be good to have a source of income, but it would look better to graduate admission panels if I get a job related to my field; thus, if another opportunity arises from one of the jobs related to my field, I'm going to apply for them.

This leaves me in a strange position - I'll almost certainly get the job that I have an interview for tomorrow (one that doesn't drug test), but if I happen to hear back from any of the jobs that do drug test, I'll go for them and definitely need to be clean for potential drug tests. It's a shitty situation, because I haven't been smoking for about a week now and really want to (I have minor depression issues and weed helps a bunch). Thus, I'm not smoking for an indefinite amount of time, and I'm really disliking it.

Could somebody give me some advice, or offer any insight? I'm trying to tell myself that it's for the best and that if I get an interview for a bio-related job then I'll be clean. On the other hand, I hate not smoking just because there's a chance that I may get one of those interviews.

**TL;DR: Can't smoke weed on the off-chance that I'll get a job interview that drug tests. Have minor depression issues and weed helps. Looking for a compromise.**"

Coming Home


I landed in PDX in my fancied suit smelling of day old sex, cigarettes, and a hangover. My mother was waiting for me in the arrivals terminal to hug and kiss my cheek. My father would’ve been there as well, but he passed nearly 3 years ago. I still think about him every now and again, sometimes when it feels it’s been too long since I have. Other times simply to ground and remind myself. It had been a long flight since I’d left Edinburgh. The French were on strike for some odd reason and I got stuck in Charles de Gaulle, more mad that I couldn’t have a smoke or continue drinking now that it was 8 or 9 am than being delayed really. It sounds like something they’d do anyways. They questioned why my growler smelt of alcohol. I wanted to say it’s because I forgot to wash it after polishing it off in the taxi around 4 am that morning in Edinburgh, but with my french I could only lie and say it was water. The ensuing pat down was firmer than the norm. 

I’d been drinking since 4 or 5 the day before, strategically filling up my growler from Brewdog earlier in the afternoon, I think it was the Trashy Blonde that day or maybe the Punk IPA, and saved it for the time between when the bars close and my taxi ride departs. I’d gone out with the remaining interns, only two or so at that point, and my Scottish coworkers. I skipped work that day, my last, wasn’t much going on in the Parliament on a Monday to be honest anyway and met up with Paul and Iain up the Royal Mile, a song or two away from my flat for the last night out. 

We sat and drank the first of many pints in a shadowy pub called the World’s End. As soon as I arrived Paul roared into a story of how Iain and another American intern, a breezy and aloof blonde from Utah, had hooked up last Friday night, Hannah’s last night here. Iain brought her back to his new flat to crash and they ended up making out and getting into it, as you do. It gets hot and he ends up inside her slowly penetrating her for a good thirty seconds until she gets flustered and admits that she’s a virgin and doesn’t know if she can continue. She heads into this minute or so monologue about whether she should or shouldn’t have sex, meanwhile Iain is plowing away at a soft and steady rate throughout the whole thing. She inevitably tells him she can’t, and he pulls out, and we all have a laugh at how many times she’s been in this situation still thinking she’s a virgin. The last of the interns Yassef arrives at the pub having missed the story and we number five now, Paul launches into the story once more for Yassef’s ears breaking for a smoke and a call from his girlfriend, a californian blonde who’d left two days before. I smoke one and we chat for a second about goodbyes and past lovers outside after the call. It’s wet, the cold december rain riding in on sharp breezes in stacatto-like fashion, but the pub is warm and inviting, the story continues. After pulling out, they make out and she starts to jerk him off. He’s about to finish and, in her grace, she apparently thinks it a brilliant one to shove a finger up his arse. He freaks out and comes all at once. The table cracks up and cheers to that non-mormon Utah girl long gone by now, Iain’s joyful smirk following the story was priceless. 

We move up the mile to the Tron tavern, smokes in hand, and we enjoy the first buzzes of our night, the nicotine hits like a missing drumbeat, the age old cobblestone beneath our feet encouraging us, the whole lot buzzing. Pints and food are ordered, WC’s visited, seats taken, and we proceed with jovial conversations and laughs. More friends join, the Seattle girl from my office and a cute Manchester girl, Tony the Scottish-Italian gay coworker who fancied me at first, Stuart a coworker and Yassef’s lover at some point, and I finally start to realize it’s my last night here. I text Camilla, a barmaid I’d asked out and gone out with for bottles of prosecco the night before, and drop a line.

To be continued...I'm too drunk and I have class in the morning, can't continue this chapter or what have you currently."
s21nv,3,2012-04-10,No reason for feeling like this,takeiteasyonme,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/s21nv/no_reason_for_feeling_like_this/,"Where the hell do I begin?  I might get off subject and rant a bit but I'd appreciate your attention throughout. I'm a student at my second choice college, in my 4th year(will be staying for a 5th) in my dream internship working for my colleges football team.  After next year, I'm going to try getting a graduate assistant job to help pay for grad school and everything on the outside for me looks all good and well.  I was raised in a bible belt home by two strong christian parents and my entire childhood up until I was 18 leaves me with no choice but to believe in a higher power.  Fast forward 4 years later, I've gotten away from the church and have come to the conclusion that there is no God and that us as humans are incredibly ignorant to believe that from our small world surrounded by so much we know so little about, that we know exactly how we all got here.  This change has affected my whole outlook on life.  I now concentrate solely on being as good of a person as I can to anyone and everyone I meet.  If there is a God, I hope he sees that I did my best to be the best person I could be.  I think it's hypocritical to think we must be perfect in an imperfect world for the ultimate result in heaven.  I'm already ranting and this is branching off into other conversations for other threads so sorry about this.  I've dated two girls my whole life, both of them while I've been in college.  I was mr. popular in high school but i was never interested in dating, partly because no girls every really came across me as being interested in dating me.  The first girl I dated, we lost both of our virginities to each other and she fell head over heels for me.  A year into our relationship, I felt since I was young and had two more years ahead of me that my best years were yet to come.  This was also before I started this job with the football team in which all my time became dedicated to football.  Regardless, I didn't have the feelings for her that she had for me and there didn't seem there was a way to change that, so I broke up with her, ultimately breaking her heart.  Something I later apologized for as I was a real dick about the whole process.  A year and a half later, I met another girl, who went to my high school.  We'll call her ""B"".  What began as summer love turned into strong feelings for me, which I never felt before, even in the year I was dating the first girl.  She was younger than me and went to community college back home, forcing us into a long distance relationship.  After 3 months of skypeing every night, I finally asked her out and we dated for another 3 months.  I'd always been the type of person to poke fun at people who were in love so fast after beginning dating.  I was in my first season of my internship and wasn't traveling with the team, therefore anytime I got a weekend off, I was making my way back home to be with her.  By the third month, I knew my feelings were unlike anything i'd ever felt before so I automatically assumed I was in love.  For the whole year I dated the first girl, ""I Love You"" only came out when we were drunk and usually I realized what I said and would take it back.  I thought it was such a big step in saying something like that because I wanted it to be for real.  During Christmas break with B, I was laying down with her telling her everything I loved about her and eventually I said it, that I loved her.  It felt so right saying it because I knew the feelings I had inside me.  She said she loved me too and for the first time, I was the happy with every single aspect of my life, minus the fact she was still 200 miles away and i couldn't see her everyday, but just talk.  Eventually, she began getting the feelings I had for the first girl and broke up with me one weekend I came home to spend the weekend with just her.  It was literally the weekend before my 21st birthday.  The weekend of my 21st while celebrating my birthday, at some point while I was blacked out called her crying begging her back.  I have no recollection of the phone call but it almost certainly put the nail in our relationships coffin so to speak. It absolutely broke my heart and I had no clue how to handle it.  I begged her to come back almost to the point now looking back, I was boarderline crazy.  The week after my birthday was valentines day so I automatically felt jaded at the day, only to find out that same day that she had evidently been hanging out with her ex boyfriend who in the beginning tried to get her away from me, bringing me down even more.  Months passed and some things were forgiven and forgotten, we had our ups and downs, and summer finally came around which gave me a chance to go back home and rebuild our relationship once more.  I went to the first session of summer school and 3 days before I came back home, i caught wind that she had been hanging out with my then best friend.  By reading ""then best friend"", i'm assuming you can put 2 and 2 together.  The whole time she was talking to me, she was also talking to my best friend.  I asked both of them about it which they both of course denied so I had no choice but to let it go.  3 weeks after I come home, I'm at a party with my friend where he's talking to a girl about how he's found a new girl, yada yada, and then her name pops up.  He was talking about how he was talking to her and liking her literally 3 feet away from me.  This is all after he'd been telling me the whole time i needed to get over her.  Fuck him.  I called him out and he went off into a tangent about how he made me and I wouldn't have been popular without him.  Mind you, I didn't even start hanging out with the guy until my last semester of high school.  I'll say it again.  Fuck him.  Two days later, I packed my bags and came back to college just to get away from the drama.  For a little while things were getting back to normal and both of those people left my life.  Like that, I lost the girl I loved and my best friend all for a stupid reason.  The hurt and anger I had built up was numbed by my friends back at school.  Here I am, a year and a half after the breakup and approaching a year after all the drama.  I'm on the verge of completing this semester finally after a shit ton of work and I couldn't be more excited.  Truth is, deep down, I'm still hurt.  I'm over both of them and haven't really spoken to them except to close out everything (a kind way of me telling them fuck you).  Since then, I haven't really tried talking to any girls.  Again, no girls have really come across as being interested in me.  I'm the type of person that would rather have a girl come after me than I go after them.  It's so much more of a turn on to me to be wanted and for it to be so apparent it slaps me in the face.  I've never been the ""player type"" and usually end up coming back home from bars with my friends and just them.  I don't pull numbers, I don't really pull girls, but I'm still incredibly social with them.  There's the gap between acquaintences and fuck buddies or even getting to the relationship aspect I still don't understand.  I hate putting myself out there only to be rejected so i avoid the confrontation all together.  This strategy hasn't helped me either, hence me writing this to you.  I have so much frustration and hurt and anger built up inside and I don't really let anyone, not even my friends here know about it.  I'm at peace on the football field, but it seems the second I'm anywhere else, these feelings come back.  I feel like I'm wasting my life here and that I'm miserable.  I have so much fear for growing up and getting a real job if I can't stay in school as a graduate assistant.  More than anything, I just want someone here to care for and to come home to.  I have a great respect for women as I had two sisters growing up to show me how to be a man.  None of the things they told me really made sense until recently.  Like I said, I'm no player and I just want to give a girl what any girl deserves, just someone who will care for them.  I have so many friends who are girls who traditionally bitch and moan and complain about other guys that did them wrong and I'm too afraid to make an attempt to resurrect their faith in the male population.  I feel so different from anyone else because of the fact that I don't ""spit game"".  That's such a childish and immature thought process to refer to women as game as if they're a fucking deer I have to shoot at.  Again regardless of the fact, it never fails that the prettiest and most deserving girls end up with the biggest douches and wonder why they keep getting hurt, meanwhile, i'm on the sidelines with my helmet just waiting patiently to get in the game.  I feel like because I don't feel this way, that it's set me behind in social skills as well.  I don't always have the cool thing to say, and sometimes, I feel no urge to say anything at all.  I hate small talk which doesn't help either so just meeting and getting to know girls at social events is a marathon itself for me.  I'm not much of the hey i got your number from a friend lets have a full blown converstion despite the fact ive been to about 5 parties with you.  I've googled how to talk to girls and all that crap and it's all the same cliche ""be yourself"" bullshit.  Sorry internet, that doesn't help at all.  Like I said, I have a dream life and I wouldn't trade anything for it, but I want to get rid of this frustration.  I want to scream as loud as I can to get it all out but I know it won't be enough.  I'm so mad at the world for being the way it is.  I'm mad at things I have no way of controlling.  I have thoughts I shouldn't have.  I think to myself I'm of no use to the world and that I'm not meant to live in this time.  My family and friends keep me alive.  If I knew they wouldn't be effected at all, I would have ended myself a long time ago.  I think about suicide from time to time, nothing too serious though.  Just thoughts like well I wouldn't have to worry about whatever it is i'm worried about anymore. I know my life is of much importance and the entire scenario of my suicide would crush many people that are dear to my life so that takes it completely out of the question.  I just want relief.  The world despite how small in retrospect to everything else is still big to me and I don't have the first clue on how to live in it.  I want to get over the hump of being a good friend to everyone.  I want girls to want to be with me.  I feel like i'm an average looking guy, but regardless shouldn't have that hard of a time finding a good girl.  I know I'm young and have absolutely no business feeling like this.  I know this whole thing comes off as a frustration towards girls but in all honesty, there's a lot more behind my frustration.  Like I said earlier, I hate the way the world is today.  I feel like people are incredibly hypocritical which pisses me off more than anything.  I blame this fact alone for most of the feelings I have.  A few months ago, in conversation with a friend, I said I'd lost hope in humanity, something i never thought I'd say.  I'd like to think there's still hope but at the same time, there will always be dumbasses put on this earth solely to fuck with other people.  I'm hoping you're still reading this and for some of you, I hope we share the same unfortunate feelings.  I want to tell you just as I'm sure I will be told to keep your head up and that things will get better.  I dunno, maybe this is just a terrible case of the monday's and i'm just feeling sorry for myself."

s5839,5,2012-04-11,Want to break up with boyfriend; Moving into a house next week.,MsThrowAway404,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s5839/want_to_break_up_with_boyfriend_moving_into_a/,"That must sound horrible at first glance.

So, currently I'm in college. I'm entering my second year. I've landed a cool internship related directly to my major (Computer Science), working in a network admin's office. They pay very well, I love the job, and they have offered me to stay and work over the summer, 40 hours a week. When the summer is over, I will likely be promoted and get a decent pay raise.

My boyfriend of three years and I are planning to get a house or apartment with another couple we know very well. The other couple is very stable and well-off. We'll likely only be staying in the place for the summer, then we will all probably move to the on-campus housing. My current boyfriend has a decent amount saved up from his last job, PLENTY enough to pay for his share of rent.  He has already agreed to it, and said he'll do whatever it takes to stay with me.

Problem is, things aren't working between me and him anymore. I can't stand him sometimes. He annoys me. He pushes me around and hits me sometimes. He yells. He disrespects me, and is extremely immature and childish. Being around him feels like babysitting, because I have to monitor his behavior in public. He doesn't know what he's doing for his major, and he's used to his mother paying for all of his bills. He throws a hissy fit when people make him do things he doesn't want to do. When I bring these things up, he also throws a fit.
Overall, he's not who I want to be with long term.

He has also told me he really hates the house we're moving into and doesn't want to spend his savings on it. He'd rather go back home and live there with his mom for free, but he's renting this place with me and the other couple to stay with me.

We are due to sign the lease in a week or two. If I break up with him, he'll be out of the lease and we likely won't be able to afford the place comfortably. The other couple who is entering into the lease with us will likely also be very angry with me/us.
         
           
           
      

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I supposed to be renting a house with other couple. Want to break up with boyfriend for several reasons. See above.

Reddit, I really need your advice right now. You've helped me through a lot before, and I really need some input on this. What should I do? :[


EDIT: I understand I need to leave him. I just don't know when//how will be most convenient and cause the least amount of shit for everyone else. I don't want to screw up everything for everyone else, if there's another option. If I could tough it out for the summer, etc. I'm looking for ways to go about this, I already know what needs to be done.

Also, thank you all for all your concern &lt;3 Reddit is full of such amazing people. "

s4fx3,6,2012-04-11,"Are we broken up? If so, why doesn't she just say it?",genuinelydontknow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s4fx3/are_we_broken_up_if_so_why_doesnt_she_just_say_it/,"I'm 24, she's a year older. She lives in another country but we met about 2 years ago when we both lived in the same country.  
  
Things have gone through a rocky rollercoaster ostensibly because her circumstances in her country are changing and she's trying to find work and not having much luck. Throughout this period she's gone from brief phases of affection calling me her rock as she deals with her troubles and other times she's considering me a nuisance she needs to deal with on top of her other problems.  
  
This situation wasn't the best, but honestly, we were still keeping the semblance of a relationship, even if just by the phone. Unsatisfying though that can be I was still glad to be with her. But then she got an internship which she hoped would lead to a job, it was very intense and stressful and during that time we spoke often, but less so and she was sad, stressed, angry and far too preoccupied to be particularly interested in me. The internship ended and it didn't lead to work, she went to spend some time with her parents and that's when she started not answering her phone.  
  
She'd wait a few hours after I tried to call to send me a message with an obviously spurious excuse why she couldn't talk every time. I confronted her about it and she said that when she went back home from visiting her parents things would be different, that she was just preoccupied and trying to enjoy being back with her family.  
  
She's back but she still doesn't talk ever. Thing is, I know I'm representing myself here as just letting things happen, and being passive in the situation and I guess I am, part of me just wants to be patient with her and give her what she needs if she genuinely needs not to talk to me but I guess another part just doesn't want to hear that she's lost interest. I have however actually gathered the courage to ask the simplest questions: what do you want? Am I still in a relationship with you? Why don't you want to talk to me anymore? But she just reassures me, says she still wants me as her boyfriend, that we're still together as far as she knows and that she's just been busy.  
  
But something is very obviously wrong and has very obviously changed, she recently lost an opportunity to visit me in my country this year and when I said I'd go to hers instead she said she'd be too busy trying to find work. 
  
She doesn't want to talk to me, she doesn't want to come see me, she doesn't want me to go and see her frankly I'm not really sure what the difference would be between us breaking up and us continuing in this 'relationship'. 
  
What I really don't understand and am asking advice about is this, I can see from the signs it's probably over, that she's for whatever reason ceased to be interested in me. I could end things myself, but frankly I'm still stubbornly holding on to hope for a resolution because I do still care for her despite it all.
  
Why then, if she doesn't want me, never sees me and doesn't like talking to me, would she say she still wants to be in a relationship with me? What's she getting out of this? Is she being sincere?

UPDATE: Oh god. It was once something so sweet, it kills me to see where we've ended up. I can't imagine how I'm going to tell her I can't keep doing this but I really can't. Fucking long distance, maybe this would have happened anyway, but maybe not. If only we'd never had to move. She used to love me so much and I've always loved her. Thank you for your help agony redditors even you Nuitaqui, that's some dedicated trolling of r/relationships. I guess I'm going to have to contact her somehow and tell her the score. I wish I could go back to 2 years ago things seemed a whole lot nicer then."

Her, 23

Dating/living together 8 months
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I come to you, fellow redditors, in my hour of need. As the title states, I am absolutely desperate to save my relationship. I know this sounds cliché, but this girl is the love of my life, and the thought of losing her is more than I can bear. I am going to start at the beginning, and this will surely be a long post, but your viewership/input will be more helpful than you can ever imagine. 

A year ago I graduated college. At the time I was still in a 3-year LTR with my now ex-girlfriend. About two months after college I took an internship over 1,000 miles away. It was there, in this new city, where I met my current girlfriend. 

Once again, you'll have to pardon my clichés, but it was love at first sight. She was everything I'd ever hoped to meet in a woman. Fiercely intelligent, gorgeous, funny- I could go on forever. I courted her and when it became apparent we were falling for each other, I broke up with my ex. After that, my new girlfriend and I were inseparable: we did everything together and never got bored of each other's company. I couldn't imagine ever being with anyone else, and each day seemed like a gift.

We'd stay up at night - after mind-blowing sex - and discuss our future together. She'd tell me I was the one she'd been waiting for her entire life, I'd tell her the same. She'd say she felt complete, never felt like this before, etc., etc. It was, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to me.

For five months we lived in this bliss. It was absolutely wonderful. In December we decided to move to a new city to start our life together with new jobs, new people, etc. Truthfully, I convinced her this is what would be for the best. At the time I honestly believed it, but now I'm not so certain it was the best decision.

Flash forward the last 3 months. Things have been lopsided. She has a job and is successful. She makes all the money and has been supporting us by herself, much to my shame. Fortune has not been so kind to me: the job I moved here for folded, I am unemployed, and spend my days writing cover letters and filling out applications.  I feel like I could go on an Occupy-themed/Millennial-unfairness rant here, but I won't. Simply put, I've been having difficulties financially.

This, as you can imagine, has impacted everything... although perhaps not as much as you would think. Until April things between her and I were still going well, if a little stressed because of my unemployment. She makes enough money to support us, and although I objected and floated the idea of going back to my home state to find work (I believe I have a job waiting there), she told me she'd rather have me stay here than be alone. Because this woman does not sugarcoat at all, I took her at her word. Perhaps this, too, was a mistake.

These last two weeks, however, have been particularly rough. A trifecta of issues has appeared, one after the other: her mother injured herself somewhat severely and had to undergo surgery to fix a broken bone, her job is *incredibly* intense right now (financial work, quarterly yearly report time) requiring long hours, and I - also much to my shame - did not get into my the type of law schools that I wanted (should have mentioned I was applying for law school earlier, sorry). In addition to this, parts of our relationship have become sadly routine: we wake up, she goes to work, I look for jobs, rinse, wash, repeat. 

All these issues culminated last weekend. We had an argument on Thursday of last week, during which she said she hadn't been happy for 3 months (which I really hope was not the truth). I stupidly lost my temper and yelled at her, something I have never done before and completely regret. She went home to be with her mother. I sat in our apartment, alone, looking for jobs/playing video games. When she came back I knew something was wrong. But I still wasn't ready for what was coming.

Monday, Monday, Monday. Is there a more despicable day of the week? Even unemployed I still despise it, and now I have more reason to than ever before. When she came home Monday night she told me the worst news I've ever heard: she wants to break up, she doesn't love me anymore, she wants me to move out (and by extension, move back home with my parents). I was (am) completely crushed. I knew things hadn't been perfect between us lately, but I still am in a state of despair and disbelief. The worst part of it was when she said she didn't view me as a partner anymore, and felt like my mother. Soul = demolished.

I told her I was the same person she fell in love with. I begged her not to give up on me yet. I know how important stability and ambition are to her, and these last 3 months have not been my best in that regard. But I have had a job interview this week and things are finally starting to look up; I was also able to sell my old car for a couple thousand dollars to help pay the rent for the immediate future. I used my gift of gab to talk her into giving me a stay of execution, if you will. I told her by the end of April I was going to be the man she wanted me to be, that the man she loved no longer wasn't me but an awful figment of my true potential. She said okay. But she still claims she doesn't know if she loves me anymore; that knowledge alone has caused me to be unable to eat or sleep for the last two days and is destroying me with every second that ticks by. Melodramatic, I know, but it's how I feel.

I guess the worst part is that I have always viewed love as bound by Newton's first law of motion. I don't believe she could just stop loving me; there had to be a force there to cause the love of my life - whom a month ago told me she wanted to get married someday, 6 months ago told me she couldn't live without me - to ask me to pack my things two days ago. I have nominated my unemployment/bum-like state these past 3 months as the obvious culprit, as I know it has been awful for both her and I... this makes the situation all the more agonizing, as I am finally starting to see the light in this regard. I feel I am on the very cusp of being financially independent and able to support her and give her the life she deserves, but she has given up on me. It is a terrible, terrible feeling.

Last night I tried to show her I was the same man she fell in love with. After my job interview (which went really well, fingers-crossed!) I took her to dinner. We stopped by the river where I recited a love poem that I know means a lot to her (cheesy, I know) and tried to convince her this moment was the darkest hour before the dawn, that if she just believed in me for a little longer we could go back to the way things used to be. She seemed to be feeling it, and I was overjoyed to think I was saving this relationship. We went home and slept together (literally, slept) in the same bed. I was happy.

Then came this morning.

Mornings are the hardest because I can tell she doesn't want to talk about her feelings as she's preparing for a grueling day at work. I've respected this, as much I can, but right before she walked out the door I slipped. She kissed me, which I thought was a good sign, so I asked her what she was feeling. 

**""Nothing. Perhaps I just need more time?""**

God, it hurts. 

So here I am, writing this to you fine people and hoping against hope that you can provide me some sort of viable strategy to save this relationship. I love this woman with all of my heart, and I feel like I am *this* close to being able to provide the financial stability she needs to feel happy. How can I rekindle our love and prove to her I am not a loser? I know landing this job would really help, but I need other solutions, too. I did cut her a check for my half of the rent today, something I'd been unable to do until now, so I am hoping that helps... but I know I can't ""buy"" my way back in, even if finances are at the crux of the matter. I have to make her see me as she used to, I think, and I really could use some help with that.

I can't imagine my future without her in my life. Moving back home and living in my mom's basement or having to find another living situation here, hundreds of miles away from anyone I know besides her, both seem unimaginable right now. And I would have lost the one person I love more than anything in the entire world. I can't face it. Please help me.

**TL;DR Love of my life is disappointed with my recent inability to be financially independent and doesn't know if she loves me anymore. Wants me to move out of our shared apartment. Please help me show her I can be the same person she fell in love with originally.**

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How did he feel about the new definition of Santorum?  Did he actively have people working on changing the google results in the earlier days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as983?context=5)|He would never stop talking about that. He hated it so much. He did have many people working on it. I actually made an effort to contact google (although I knew it would be fruitless) to remove it.
[Who do you plan to support as a republican candidate now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as9s9?context=5)|Ron Paul.
[If i was an American I too would support Ron, but in all honesty, do you think there is a chance that he could become the Republican presidential candidate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbj8?context=5)|As Joe Shmoe, I would say no. But after taking years of Pol Sci, I have learned that it is a possibility, I would give him a 1:4 chance 
[Now we all know Santorum was a bit *enthusiastic*, to put it nicely, as were some of his followers... But what people didn't focus on it seems... Were people who protested his ways were equally or even more *enthusiastic* sometimes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)|Good question. A popular thing was to wear ""spreading santorum"" shirt to his rallies, speeches, etc; that reeeally got on his nerves. Another was many gay couples would get as close to him as they could and kiss. Although I found these both humorous (as they arent violent or very insulting), he didn't like it, and spoke out about it a few times 
[**Question**: What was the craziest thing you say someone do to protest his campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)| 
[One thing Santorum said that made you lose respect for him?  One thing Santorum said that made you gain respect for him.  Best and worst memory of your time employed there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Best is when one tie Karen Santorum wasn't replying to his calls for ab out 30 minutes, and he got very nervous an worried that she was in an accident or something. It really showed a compassionate human side to him few see. Worst memory was the one listed above, it demoralized many staff members.
[Which one of the last two ""Won out""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Obviously the first one, which is a reason I left.
[Alright... Since you're unemployed you should spend some of your free time watching Doctor Who... It's really good, and reddit becomes much more interesting when you get **all** the references...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as3q6?context=5)|Hahaha, thank you. I will check it out.
[Did you actually support his opinions or were you in it for the money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arli5?context=5)|To be honest, I did this for the work experience, as a younger guy with a pol sci major, not many jobs are available, and within those, it's better if you don't pick and choose with your beliefs. My beliefs never interrupted him, as I never brought them up much. So, this is really just to get deeper into the political field  
[Hate to tell you this, but in the world of DC, it's pretty much impossible to switch sides. Once you've worked for a republican, it will be VERY hard for you to get a job with a democrat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asczm?context=5)|I understand that. But, as said, I am conservative. I just don't agree with all of Santorum's ideas.
[Did he ever have any advisers tell him that he was already seen as so far to the right, it would not hurt to make some comments that would make him more appealing to the middle? To a lot of people, he just came off as crazy, and even if he won the primary, would stand no chance to Obama. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asrkj?context=5)|Many did. One said that ""the trip going back to the center would be a tougher one than staying where you are""
[How did you get the gig? Are you from PA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxl9?context=5)|I spent my childhood there. My aunt knew him and knew I had a pol sci major, and she helped me out as an intern, but when the camp found out I had a major from a good school, they told me I could be an aide. Really straightforward. I did hesitate though.
[What were your responsibilities, and how much did you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqm5?context=5)|Another good one. It ranged from helping his wife on camp-related errands, to researching speech venues, to typing up posters, and writing letters to various organizers and event hosters, to even getting him things he needed (yes, I did get him a Peets coffee one time)
[Have you ever noticed the religiousness among his staff members? Are your colleagues as religious as Santorum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbu4?context=5)|Most were, I tried to keep my atheism downplayed. There were a few others like me, but not many.
[What are your personal political and religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqce?context=5)|Conservative-Libertarian. Atheist.
[*Atheist.*  Something tells me you never bothered mentioning this to Rick...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4artsz?context=5)|Yeah. It somehow slipped my mind when we talked...
[What was it like working for arguably one of the craziest Republican candidates in history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arm8p?context=5)|Tough at times, although he was a very nice guy around the office, he did have a bit of a temper. Again, I don't agree with much of his views, but he's a nicer guy than people make him out to be. He was one of the biggest gentleman I've seen when Karen (wife) was around 
[Oh I'm not saying he wasn't a nice guy, but when a nice guy says half the shit he did...kinda scares the shit out of me that a guy like that could be seriously considered a presidential nominee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqis?context=5)|He was a very outspoken candidate. And many are, and that works well for many of them. It didn't work out too well for him though 
[It seemed to me like he was always very defensive and would be hard to correct. Did anyone ever correct him ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as144?context=5)|Not many tried, he had a temper and he liked to stay in control of things.
[Blah people* What are your feelings about glitter bombs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arswi?context=5)|More annoying than effective. I've seen two I believe.
[Did he ever strike you as someone who really should be president ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as5bn?context=5)|It depends. At times, yes. At times, no. I would say he did have moments where I saw him as someone with really good ideas. And also, at time where he...didnt.
[Is this guy as big an asshole as he seems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arkfi?context=5)|I expected this from reddit :) Although I don't agree with his politics or religion too much, he didn't talk turkey with us too much around the office(s). He was actually a very nice, and respectful guy to me and my coworkers.
[Don't get me wrong.  I don't dislike him for his politics.  He just seems to have issues with anyone different than him.  As a woman, I have a REAL problem with many of the things he has said.  College? Not necessary.  Yet, he and his wife have degrees.  Problems with public eduation?  Why fix them, when he has the ability to home school his children?  Black?  Why help them, when they are obviously NOT part of his target market.  Those are the things that make him an asshole, in my opinion.  I don't care if he is too religious or too conservative.  That's his choice.  But does he really have to make off-handed comments that are so hurtful to so many? EDIT: to add words I omitted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arpit?context=5)|There isn't a real way to answer that, from my opinion. He could be harsh at times, but so can anyone. Also, the media jumping on him (whether he was right or wrong) just amplified things to hell.
[Have you ever looked back at the Santorum Campaign, with the 'JFK makes me sick' and other recent statements, and say ""I got out at a good time?""  Also, for proof, maybe by showing an official letterhead memo with names/numbers removed in sharpie or blurred.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aseit?context=5)|Of course, I got out before it really hit the fan. And yes, I'll look for a memo. I had to turn in most of the office stuff I kept, but I should have one.
[Did you ever meet his wife, and if so, were they crazy together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arocr?context=5)|His wife is a great woman, and they actually seemed to get along very well. She was supportive of him throughout my time there (til Jan.)
[After Herman Cain, none of the candidates seemed to appeal directly to the Tea Party. Balance the budget immediately, cut back on trade with China, limit immigration. ( my spin of what the Tea Party stands for. ) Why did none of the candidates take the tea party seriously? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asgp8?context=5)|Again, its hard to answer questions like that. My guess is that Santorum did want to distance himself form the far-right (as you know he didnt do well though)
[Yeah, gonna need some proof for this one before the karma train leaves the station.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arl4e?context=5)|Understandable request. What can I do for you? Scan a document from him? (probably with some things redacted)

s42ui,2,2012-04-11,Should i contact an ex after many years together and she does not know i received a transplant? ,Porthios,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s42ui/should_i_contact_an_ex_after_many_years_together/,"Long time lurker first time poster (i think first time poster anyways) So im sure many people are rolling their eyes thinking not another one of these. But hear me out.

When i was 18 i lost both my kidneys (unknown cause) None of my family members where a match so i had to take dialysis. It was a rough first year my test results would come back horrible. Seem like i was not taking care of myself but i though i did. I would ask the staff for advice and i was getting some but none that help me out. 
Then one saturday during treatment i meet this wonderful tech (lets call her... Jane) Jane looked young to be there and i though she was an intern but lo and behold not only was she not one, but she had been working as a tech for ages. I got to know her through her working every fortnight on saturdays. One day she saw how bad i felt and she began to just sit down and talk. Nothing in particular just sit and talk, and man that helped so much.
Fast forward a few months and she changed her schedule just to be able to see me more often. Shortly after we began to date. Now i know many people say this but she saved my life not once but twice.
Here is why i say that, first she took over my whole medical chart and looked it over, asked questions to doctors and even had me change my doctor for another one. Not only did the new doctor change my medication he also told me about things i did not know. Sure enough a few weeks pass and i began to feel better and my test results proved that. Thanks to her i dont think i would have changed doctors as i figured this was how i was supposed to feel. 
So number 2, there was a time when i began to feel pain in my side. Not horrible pain just uncomfortable pain. She always told me to go get it looked at, but being stuborn i said it would just go away. A few days later she knocks on my door, she doesnt get an answer so she opens it and goes it (yes she had a key) and there i was in bed in extreme agony. She doesnt say anything just picks my butt up, now you have to understand she is like 5'0 125lbs soaking wet she just hauled my butt to the hospital where i had my appendix taken out. Doctors say if she didnt bring me in i would have died because my appendix was ready to burst. 
So basically I hold her in the highest of regards. 

Time passed and i did ask her to marry me, and she accepted, but we ended up splitting up. I think it was due to myself getting too comfortable in the relationship that i just took advantage of her thinking she would always be there. Anyways i transfer clinics because i knew it would be hard to see her, but i always remembered what she said about how to take care of myself and never forgot. 
Two years later i received my transplant. I wished she was there because i know without her i may have never lived enough to receive one. 
Now i think back and i would love to tell her thank you, thank you for what you taught me for what you did for me but also thank you for loving me at a time i though i was done. I know she is married now and i am happy for her, all i wanted for her is to be happy and if that was not with me then oh well. But i sit here and think, i would love to tell her thanks.
So i know where her folks live and was thinking, should i go and just drop off a note? Maybe ask her mom for her number? 
Its been around 5 years since we last spoke and i just feel if more time passes the more likely it is something will happen where i will never get a chance to say thanks. By that i mean she moves i move whatever. 
So Reddit what do you guys think? Im i just being retarded and should just leave well enough alone, or should i try to thank her?

s3up5,13,2012-04-11,Am i destined for failure in this field?,RetroByte,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s3up5/am_i_destined_for_failure_in_this_field/,"i'm in my 4th year of a CS degree and i feel like i don't know anything.  I only know the very basics of only 3 programming languages.  Java, C, and Python.  Not enough to code anything fancy.  I have no projects outside of school because i don't like programming enough to do it outside of school.  I spend most of my free time working on recording and playing music.  I've been reading some posts here and have read that a lot of companies ask ""so what projects have you been working on, on your free time""  it makes me laugh to think that i would be replying with ""nothing"".

I feel like if i were to go in to a technical interview right now, i would not know how to go about doing anything, and would just stand there like an idiot.  Yet somehow, i've gotten A's on all coursework relevant to my major.  I still don't know how i managed to get any of that, surprises me.  I don't think it's a good representation of what i actually know at all.

so some might ask well then why are you a CS major?  Well the answer is because i'm doing it as a compromise.  I sit in front of a computer for a majority of the day so i felt it was natural to get a degree in something computer related.  I wasn't expecting this though.  The alternative career path i used to pursue (music) is not an option at this point, as it very difficult to make a decent living at it.

Oh and to make matters worse, the internship that i thought i had set up for the summer just fell through.  I need the internship for college credit, and without it, i won't be able to graduate when i planned to.  At this point it's really difficult to find a replacement,  basically causing me a crap load of stress, something i don't need right now.

At this point i'm just taking it day by day, and trying to ride the wave as long as i can.

One thing i realized that i do not want for a career is one where it seems like i am constantly working.  I know people who are programmers and they work 60 hour weeks and then bring work home almost every day.  Screw that crap, that's something i don't want.  My motto is that life is too short to have to endure a garbage life like that.  My goal is to find something where i can comfortably support myself while maximizing my free time to pursue things i actually like.  I understand a lot of people never achieve something like that, but it's what i am going to strive for.

At this point i'm just going through the motions of school,  and i have this overwhelming feeling that I won't be successful in this field.  I do not know what I am doing."

I apologize in advance for the lengthy post **(will include a TL;DR)**, but I want to include the full context and honestly also really need to get it all out.


**I am currently 20 years old and my boyfriend is 24.  We have been together for 2-3 years, since I was 17 and he was 21.**


 My teenage years were rocky to say the least.  When I met my boyfriend, I was in a bit of a hopeless position.  I had been kicked out as a teenager, and with no real friends left at this point I didn’t have many places to go.  I was a recovering drug addict and made the stupid decision to give up and relapse because it seemed easier at the time.  I had been renting a room in a drug-trafficking house full of meth addicts for about six months.  I had just lost my job and although there was a part of me that really wanted to get sober and escape, it seemed very difficult at the time with my parents unwilling to take me back and having absolutely nothing to my name, and also still being a minor.  I had been a very bright young woman before, but had spiraled to an all-time rock-bottom.  


He came to the house through a mutual friend, not knowing what type of place it was.  We met but didn’t talk much that night, but he came back and we were basically inseparable after that.  He knew I wanted to get sober and get out, and stayed by my side for a few weeks until he brought me to my parents to talk it through and find a solution.  He brought me to my residence to pack all of my belongings and drop them off at my parents.  I stayed with extended family a few hours away for about a week until he found us an apartment to move into, then picked me up and brought me to the apartment to have a fresh start.


Since then, I have gotten my high school diploma, completed an internship, started as a data analyst at a great company and have went back to college.  I have been sober from meth since we packed my bags and left that house over two years ago.  To say the least, he has helped me become a better version of who I was and to rebuild my life and self-esteem.


Other than that, we have worked through various other issues.  He was an opiate addict (oxycontin) and when we met he was occasionally using.  I also tried it for the first time and would occasionally use as well.  Throughout the first year or so of our relationship, he and I worked on the issues with opiates and went through a relatively long stint of sobriety.  When heroin started becoming popular with his old friends/the town, we both tried it.  I won’t go through extreme detail, but it soon escalated to regular use, and we were both so far into it that we would become deathly ill if we went without it.  It was a little easier for me mentally to quit, and a bit harder for him.


After about six months of this going on, he entered methadone maintenance treatment with counseling to kick the heroin habit and I got a prescription to suboxone (both methadone and suboxone are drugs to stop withdrawals from heroin).  He has had his rough patches, but we have both been clean now for a long time.  Some months after kicking the habit, his best friend (and a good friend of mine) died of a heroin overdose (in November).  It was really rough for both of us, but it strengthened our resolve to stay clean.


Last summer, we were going through a really rough time in our relationship.  There were some issues with staying clean, and it was putting a major strain on our relationship.  There were a few times where we would consider breaking up and our fights got really bad, and things just weren’t healthy between us.  Neither of us were treating each other with the respect or love that we should have.


I just found out in February that he cheated on me last summer.  It confirmed the worst of my insecurities and fears.  He cheated on me with the girl that at the time was my best friend.  I had known her in high school, but became friends with her after hanging out a few times when she was dating my boyfriend’s good friend.  Her and his friend only dated for a couple of months, but our friendship continued after they broke up.  She was my best and only friend for a long time, until she also started using heroin and it ruined our friendship.  When he cheated on me with her, we were still friends, but I was well aware of the damage drugs had done to our friendship.


What had happened was she would start texting him and flirting with him, and would always ask him for drugs (**pretty** much saying she would do *anything* for it).  He eventually responded and when she came over to pick up one day, they made out and they used together.  The texting continued and a couple days later she came over again and again they started getting heavy.  They hung out a third time and they started to have sex, and they quit, because apparently *it wouldn’t fit* (which just makes me feel terrible).  He gave her drugs afterward.  After this meeting, he responded to her texts for a few more days, afraid that she would tell me right away, but would not meet up with her.  After another couple days went by, he just stopped responding to her texts at all.  This was all over about the course of a week, a week where he wasn’t sure we would make it through the week (because things were not going well **at all** between us at that time, I also remember the time not thinking we would make it through either).


This came out after trying to reconcile the friendship with the before-mentioned friend, as I knew she had gotten clean a few months ago.  She told me and tried to apologize, and gave her side of the story.  I was completely blind-sided.  I immediately texted my boyfriend saying that he was a pig, I was disgusted, etc.  He was supposed to pick me up shortly from work.  He at first denied it, and said he was upset I would believe something like that and got angry with me and said that we were done. 


 He ended up picking me up in the end, and after a long drive and a lot of crying on my part, we got home.  Initially he said he was going to get some things and leave, but shortly after we got home said he was really sorry but he needed to talk it through with me and explain everything and put everything in the open regardless of what happened.  He proceeded to tell me everything about the situation, what happened, etc.  His story matched up with my friends, and although it still hurt very, very badly, he told all of the truth. 


When I asked why he hadn’t told me in the six months since it had happened, he said at first he wasn’t sure we would make it through, and then once things started to go well, he didn’t want to reverse everything by revealing his wrong-doings.  He said that he planned to discuss it with me when we were both in a little better position mentally and emotionally, and that he knew it was a mistake but wasn’t sure how to handle it and he was selfishly afraid.  He said that he thought it would maybe be better to end things, but after having a discussion I said that I wanted to at least see how things could go and if I could forgive him.  We had been doing very well, and I knew we had both made our mistakes in the relationship, so perhaps this was another major obstacle we could overcome.


Since this came out, it has been a bit hard for me to cope, but he has been willing to talk about it openly with me and has been very sensitive about how I feel and when I may be struggling with it but not admitting it openly.  Our relationship honestly has never been much better and we are both at a good place mentally/emotionally and in life.  I often find myself wondering though, if I will ever be able to let go of it completely and trust him again if he earns it.  I do understand the reasons behind why he did what he did, as I have went through some of the same emotions when our relationship was very rough.  The thing that has been the most difficult for me is the fact that it was with my best friend and that to me, he essentially paid her to have sex with him, even if they didn’t follow through and that’s not the way he sees it.




 **My question is this:** am I insane for wanting to stay in the relationship?  Does it seem like this can work and we will be able to have a future together?  Everywhere I see people asking for advice regarding cheating, people say that it’s something that can never be overcome and that somewhere down the line it will result in a breakup and wasted time.  I know we love each other very much, and we want it to work, but I don’t want to continue if it’s really not healthy or if we can never restore trust.  He did something horrible, and not just once, but at the same time I feel like he’s being genuine and he would have eventually come clean.  We have been through a lot together, and with open communication I am hoping we can work through it.



 I’ve came across some texts he sent to his friend since it came out saying that even though it wasn’t a good decision, the mistake he made proved to him that freedom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and that he doesn’t want to stray from me or be with other women.  He said something along the lines of it took being with another woman to really realize that it wasn’t at all what he wanted.  Part of me almost thinks that’s why our relationship turned around after it happened (or it very well could be that he quit talking to her because our relationship was turning around, since he saw her a few times until it was over).




**I AM LOST; PLEASE BE FRANK AND OFFER YOUR TWO CENTS.**



**TL;DR**: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2-3 years.  We have went through a lot together, and at the moment are doing very well and have grown a lot throughout the past few years.  I recently discovered that he cheated on me about six months ago – is this something that can be forgivable, and am I crazy for wanting to stay in the relationship?

In the beginning we meet a really psychotic, sociopathic Dexter. We also meet Dexter's brother. 

This past season, Brian comes back, Deb finds out. 

Dexter's world has been crashing down since we met him, and it (I predict) will come full circle with Brian (via the intern) in season 8. 

It is like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, starting as close to the end as you can. 

I must say, I've loved the ride of watching Dexter go from a true pyscho to a really disturbed individual who struggles with good and evil every day and hopefully one or the other will win.

There I was told basically this, ""you've done a great job around here and we want to thank you, but we're cutting you back to 20 hours a week since things are running so smoothly.” I told them this would be a financial disaster for me and their only response was ""well, have your parents help you"" which is definitely not an option.

If not interested, skim or don't read!]

OK, throwaway account because my primary is for joyful humor. But this is personal and painful. I'll try not to vent and write this factually instead of emotionally...

During my 2 years at this fucking hellhole, I learned that students were to show no evidence of any conflict with staff whatsoever. It was like they had an itchy-trigger finger when it came to calling security, and then charges and punishment were doled out without ever understanding WHAT crime had supposedly happened. I believe it was a clear case of mis-using (illegally?) security to retaliate against complaints. It was like they had used Kafka's The Trial as a how-to-manual.


I had never seen a campus, (or any community institution besides a jail) with such a mercilessly authoritarian attitude. Being a jewboy hippy who does not take bullshit from any petty tyrants, I stood up for myself when the epic incompetence of the college reared its head. There were 3 occasions over the last 2 years in which my solidarity with the underdogs of this earth called me to action. Each time, security was used (illegally, I'm assuming) to retaliate against my complaints. The main part of this story are the three confrontations by security, so skip to those below if you want.) Alternately, here's some back-story to put those events in perspective:

***


**BACK-STORY: (skip this part if you want)**
I have attended 4 colleges. Good grades, full-time class load. Unfortunately, each time I transferred (for marriage/divorce/relocation reasons) each new college summarily rejected about half my earned credits. Due to this, I am now in my EIGHTH year of college (finishing my very last class now!) but I will only have achieved a (standard 2-year) associates degree. Needless to say, 8 years of debt (near $50,000) for a 2-year degree is depressing. I could have been on my way to a phd by now! I was shocked to learn that my human services program requires 90-some credits, yet I had by now earned **233** credits, almost all in my field of study! Needless to say, by the time I enrolled in this college 2 years ago, I was fed up and determined to just finish school and get the damn piece of paper as soon as possible. Attending this college was one of the worst mistakes of my life.


Now, due to my previous 6 years of education, I expected to be advanced toward the end of their human services program and wrap things up with an internship and a few classes. Instead, I was actually denied information on WHICH classes I still needed for my degree! The best anyone would do is give me their ""best guesses"" on what courses to take-- many of which had taken 2 or 3 times before, and had to pay for. After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. There were also many, many mistakes by the degree evaluators such as losing my official transcripts, getting my name wrong, etc. that held up the process. To give you an idea of the incompetence, even last term, two years into their ""program"" my advisers told me to register for 4 ""best guess classes"" (well over $1,000) and later told me I didn't need any of them! (this was not an isolated incident, it was what I'd been dealing with and paying for for 2 years). After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. I had reached the limit of my patience and started demanding some answers. Thus begins the tale of my harassment by security...

**Bullshit Event #1-**
-Was given a grant from the school, an advance on my financial aid so I could buy books at the bookstore. Waited in line over 2 hours (they pack us in like sardines here), they told me I didn't have access to that grant. I showed proof, asked for manager. She personally ok'd my proof, sold me a computer and signed the form. Go back next day, wait in line 2 hours, cashier again refuses to accept my grant money for books. Told her I already went through this with the manager and showed her proof. She refuses and gets very ghetto and macho with me, while 200 students wait in line behind us. As I leave, defeated + book-less a security guard approaches and gives me a piece of paper. This tells me to appear at a ""judicial hearing"" in which I am sat down in a creepy back office with security guards and college officials who tell me I could be expelled. Outraged, I tell them that a disagreement in the bookstore has nothing to do with security-- I hadn't broken any rules or done anything wrong besides disagreeing with a cashier about my right to spend my own money.
They act like they are doing me a favor by banning me from the bookstore. When I take one step toward the bookstore window to simply ask if I was allowed to get my bus-pass they hand out there, they call security again. I never yelled at or threatened anyone ever.

***

**Bullshit Event #2**
As I say, this gulag is incompetent. Their system seem to generate alot of automated form letters cancelling our financial aid over + over, and then when you go to dispute them (since they make no sense), no one will take responsibility- they just say ""our computers sent the cancellation, whether we agree with it or not you need to do an appeal (40 day process). I've gotten 3 such letters, and each time after the appeal they put you on probation for a term. The 2nd one, well, I got this one week prior to an internship at a homeless shelter. I had spent the last month interviewing at places to find an internship as I was told to, and was hired at a great place. (they later offered me a job!)

Now, even though they admitted the financial aid robo-cancellation was bullshit, they insisted I go through the 40-day apeal process. I explained that I could not start my internship without financial aid, since I couldn't pay out of pocket, and that I needed someone in administration to waive the bullshit rob-cancellation so I could start work. I began seking a meeting with anyone who would listen in the administration building- BIG. MISTAKE. The attitude I found was that student DO. NOT. request meetings with administration. Even to walk in and speak to secretaries there was regarded as ""suspicious"". I was actually told it was ""illegal"" for students to speak to the vice president. When some nasty woman told me it was illegal, I took out a pen and asked for her full name and if for the record she was stonewalling me, that I was not allowed to even make an appointment with someone. Never yelled at or threatened anyone. She was not concerned about her safety- she was obviously angry and disgusted with me, and she grabbed the phone, called security. 

As I left the building, defeated, 3 security officers drove up to me on scooters, surrounded me, and told me ""the vice-president's office wants me ""trespassed""  (odd, since I was not allowed to make an appointment with her)..... They said they might have to track me by my cell phone (I did not have one) so they could tell if I was near campus. Luckily, one guard took a liking to me since I was from NY (City, USA, once upon a time), said people talk differently there than the ""flakey west coast"" (true) and told me to go home and have a beer. I did. However,  I also filed a formal student complaint (in hopes of getting approval to start my new internship). They never responded to the complaint, one woman said ""because I didn't remember to sign it"" (I did, had photocopy to prove it). They did informally respond to it by waiving my 2nd financial aid cancellation and letting me do my internship, yet they made me attend another creepy back-room disciplinary hearing with security guards and officials who now had ""proof"" I was a repeat-offender with some kind of supposed aggressive tendencies, and acted as if I was menacing or harassing staff. They made ALOT of references to school shootings (I found their use of that tactic *unbelievably* offensive.) and said if anything happened again I would be expelled.

***

**Bullshit Event #3**

After 2 years of endless meetings with my advisers, the dean, degree evaluators, and counselors, they still would not give me any information on when I would graduate or what classes I actually still needed to get my degree. Keep in mind I had been relentlessly seeking this information for 2 years and was at that time (as usual) being told to take over $1,000 of classes they then admitted I did not need. I had just dropped a grueling writing class near end-of-term which they casually mentioned I didn't need, and my bill for next term (based on bullshit ""best-guesses) was comming due soon. I had had enough. So I went to disability services. I have a disability (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) but in my 8 years of college I have NEVER mentioned that to any teacher or counselor before- I wanted no special treatment and I wanted to prove I could graduate without their ""accommodations"".  I filed an Americans with Disabilities Act Complaint (like my formal student complaint, no response to this either after months, other than an email saying ""this doesn't seem to apply to you"").

 I also went to the regular counseling department and said I felt like I was heading for a nervous breakdown. The counselor sent me to her superior, I told him the same thing and then asked for help. He was not there to help me. He chastised me for seeking guidance from too many people and smugly said I should get a lawyer."" I asked one last thing- I said ""So 8 years of full-time credits, $50,000 in debt, and no answer on even when I could HOPE to graduate?"" He told me again to get a lawyer and so I just picked up my things, shook my head in disgust, and walked out. I think it was my evident disgust that unleashed the most epic shitstorm yet: A woman came out and said the head of the counseling department wanted to see me. I thought ""OK, I'll give this one last try"" and sat flipping through a newspaper. In a minute SEVEN security guards filed into the room and I could see them talking with the smug tool I had just seen. I knew they were for me. The head of counseling came out and asked me if I was alright in a condescending voice, like she was talking to a small child. I said ""Sure. These seven security guards aren't here to see me by any chance are they?"" She said no, and I got up to leave. The security guards followed me and surrounded me. I asked if they were ticketing me with something. They said no, so I went to walk away. They followed me and surrounded me again (at this point I was confused- like ""either give me a damn ticket or let me go, don't fricken stalk me!"" They acted like they were in riot formation or something, like football players in a scrimmage line, trying to pen me in. They eventually let me go and told me they wern't going to charge me with anything. I went to class. 

As I was leaving psychology class two security guards swooped down on me and took up their formation/scrimmage line thing. They gave me a ticket and had me backed up against a wall in front of my peers. This is when I cracked. I said rather loudly ""IO HAVE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. MY FATHER BEAT ME AND MY MOM TO A BLOODY PULP ALL THE TIME. I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. YOU PEOPLE ARE STALKING ME AND IT IS WRECKING HAVOC ON MY MENTAL HEALTH!""   (true story. oh well, at least he's dead. rot in hell dad!)

Thus begins the final chapter of this long macabre tale. I attend my 3rd disciplinary hearing in that creepy back-room with security guards, some semi-judge dude, and a friend and a Disability Services counselor there as advocates. [20/20 hindsight- should have brought a damn lawyer!]. I was sure I was getting expelled. The meeting was 2 hours of hell. I was sweating bullets and just generally miserable in life. I wanted nothing more than to never step foot on that campus again, but I COULD. NOT. let them steal my degree after 8 years of college. They didn't expel me. They pulled my file and finally made a judgement on when I could graduate. They said I needed only ONE more class (obviously someone was pulling strings to get me out before I either went nuts or sued them). But the guy who made the decision to put me on probation told me not to speak to anyone besides one disability counselor. He has since been tracking me, and appearing out of nowhere, as if he has appointed himself my watchmen, and very aggressively threatening me for such things as sending an email to the financial aid department (to appeal my 3rd financial aid robo-cancellation) and for requesting a form from the registration window. I have alot of rage toward this guy, since he has the power to expel me and has basically said ""you cannot speak to a single person (except the one lady) or use any services at this school, nomatter how trivial. If his goal is to make me feel as alienated, isolated, and quarantined like an infected outcast, he has. The good news is my very last class is an independent study I can do from home and I don't need to go to that macabre place ever again, except to walk in graduation which I have mixed feelings about to say the least.... I'm almost free!!!


The End...?


***

**Now, if anyone is still reading this:**

1) Do I have grounds to sue?  (I have kept every complaint form, scrap of paper, email, and timeline of events in case I do). What would my accusation(s) be legally? What would I be asking for besides a letter of apology? I don't really crave money, but is that how it works?

2) Is this wise?  The corruption of this institution knows no bounds. Nothing would surprise me at this point, such as the school claiming I was harassing, menacing, or terrorizing staff, or just fucking lying in any way that could hurt me if I sue?

3) Should I play the disability card? It's true I have PTSD, but it's embarrassing to me and I hate the idea of having to admit that I am broken in some ways, and that the real damage the school caused me was exacerbating the symptoms of that (nightmares, panick attacks, etc).  I have wondered if some kind of Americans with Disabilities complaint to some college-oversight ethics committee might be more appropriate than a lawsuit.

4) I should mention, I HATE anything to do with lawyers and court. I had one minor trial that was hell, and I have seen court destroy a dear friend of mine. Reddit always say ""lawyer up"" but could I be getting myself into a HUGE mess here if I do? Does the college have the right to counter-sue me and could I get charged and convicted of their bullshit claims?

5) If I decide to just put this behind me, do you think I should walk in graduation? (Or is that like having a cute little tea party with your previous captors, if you know what I mean?) And most
important of all, how do you think I should get the feelings of rage and resentment out of my heart now?


**TL;DR: I had genuine complaints against an incompetent college. They used campus security and judicial hearings to retaliate and make my life misreable for 2 years. Wat do?**"

I am taking 40 days off just to be safe, I know this seems like a short-term goal to many but after smoking for ~3.5 years regularly it is very difficult for me.

I am still craving the green regularly and my headaches are still present thus far, but my appetite and sleeping habits are beginning to come back to normal (or so I think).

Obviously my motivation is getting a job in the end and also to avoid an embarrassing conversation with my family about how I fucked up the first job offer I have ever received. But I have also been considering others that deal with much more addicting substances (coke, cigs, meth, etc.) and how they battle day-in and day-out. I think to myself if they can do it then there is no reason I should fail, is this a rational way of thinking? Or is this comparing apples to oranges?

Also note that I am not completely sure about returning to the habit after my 40 days, I may consider quitting but only time will tell.

Edit: I will continue to check in to let others know about my progress every 2 or 3 days. I am glad to help anybody out that needs advice for a similar situation. 

Edit 2: I also keep myself going by realizing how completely pissed I would be at myself for fucking up this opportunity, and end up looking back on the last 40 days asking why did I smoke????
Sorry about the rant, but it seems to help me out with continuing this journey."

I have slipped into the sysadmin arena over the last month or so messing with AD on Windows Server 2008 as I would like to have a little background in this. Our domain is at a 2008 level if that needs to be said too. 

Let me start off by stating how they add users to the domain:

1. They copy a current, lets say customer service account, and create the new user.
2. They then plug-in the pc at the desk, etc, etc.
3. The domain admins log in to the pc with their domain accounts and add the CS users domain account to the local admins group, and then they are done.

To me this sounds TERRIBLE, local admin domain accounts? This is not the way it should be in my mind. How would you traditionally in a business structure add users to the domain? I don't think adding them locally to the admins group is correct, but I could be wrong since I am new to this.

EDIT: I just learned 5 minutes ago, this is how they do it on servers as well. WOW. I just looked at the file server, and there are atleast 50 accounts in the local admin group that are non-existent or the employee left."

I am writing this because I need to point out some things. I don't think you realize your actions and their effects. I really can't forgive you for all the shit you've done to me over the years. Your recent bullshit has sent me way over the edge and I'm not going to keep silent on it anymore.


When I was 11 you decided to get rid of Mark who was the only person that was a good influence in my life. I know he isn't and wasn't a bad guy. Who did you replace him with? That asshole Nick, the guy I got into 2 physical fights with as a kid. I had to put up with his shitty parenting up until your divorce, which by the way was shitty of you to cheat on him with Rob. That's dirty shit. But even before that happened you were a raging alcoholic who would argue at night and keep me up. Remember that time when I was 10 and you and Igor went to the bar and I wanted to go home but you wanted to stay and drink? I do. Fucking shitty parenting. Remember that time I got an internship and you and that fucking drunk Alex decided to get shit faced until 3am  and cause a ruckus? Remember how I had to sleep on the train before i went to my first day to that internship? I DO. Remember how you called the cops on me when I wanted to pull your ass out of the bars because you were getting shit faced? I DO. Remember that time you called the cops on me when I wouldn't clean my room? I DO. Remember how I left the house when I was 21 working a full time job and going to school because I couldn't live with you because you would talk shit when you got home drunk? I DO. You remember how you asked me to come home and help pay rent when you lost your job and to pick up sophia? I DO. I didn't give you shit about it I helped you without giving you shit about anything. I can give you so many more examples of how fucking shitty you've been during the years but I think even you can maybe get the point.


You know why I have asthma? It's because second hand smoke from when I was 12, you deffinetly needed to smoke in the kitchen and now I have asthma because of your selfish shit. You don't like calling the doctors for me? IT""S YOUR FUCKING FAULT I HAVE THIS SHIT TO LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF MY FUCKING LIFE. You are the direct cause of my disease, fuck you.

You upset you need to help me when I'm 27 so I can finish school? Guess whose fault that is? It's not mine, you created such a shitty environment for me and no stability whatsoever. Every time I do something good, you're there to fuck it up with your selfish bullshit and how you're suffering by having to deal with my mess. 

I grew up alone. I grew up with no father figure and a mother who put herself first. Literally from 18-27 I raised myself. And you wonder sometimes why I don't show my affection to you? Are you fucking kidding me? You're one of the shittiest people I've met. Any time I give you some trust you fucking shatter it, consistently.

This is how easy it is to prove you don't know shit about me:

What's my favorite music band?
What's my favorite video game?
What's my favorite movie?
What do I really want to do with my life?
Where is the first place I want to take a vacation to?

Can you even answer those questions for Sophia? You think you're so much better then Nick but you're the same, you think spending some money on someone is enough to pass the good parent test.

Now yet again you're fucking up my life with your most recent shenanigans, I now have a strained relationship with Qi the kid I knew since 5th grade. Real nice of you to put your problems with me on him, but then again that's what you do. Me and Diana didn't work out because of you, because you ruined my ability to trust in women.

You have a drinking problem and you can try to convince yourself otherwise but anyone whose spent a night with you and has any kind of brain whatsoever can tell you act like a complete senseless idiot.

In conclusion, I don't give a shit anymore. Cancel the phone, I am going to get a new one this weekend, you want to take me off your insurance, go for it I'll survive. I never deserved the shit you put me through , NEVER. 

You've done good in my life but it's doesn't outweigh the shit. To be frank I lost all respect for you since I was 18. I haven't had love for you since the day you kicked me out when I was 21. The only reason why I decided to do the things I did for you was because I am better than you. I don't shit on people when they're in need. 

I'm an amazing person. I have my faults and I've made shitty mistakes with Sophia. But I know more about her then you ever did about me. My greatest faults is that I'm messy, poor and take things for granted sometimes. All in all that's not bad and everyday I try a little harder to be better. But instead of recognizing this you decide to pick at the little shit all the time, you're a negative influence on my life. You couldn't keep your shit together for the 2 months I needed to graduate? 

When I yelled at you , you deserved every word and I hope that shit burns into your memory forever. The only thing that I feel bad about is that I let someone get to me like that.

s5qc9,1,2012-04-12,Can sending conversations to a person's spouse that show they were disloyal bite you in the ass legally? Even if they are true? ,help12me34,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s5qc9/can_sending_conversations_to_a_persons_spouse/,"Okay reddit I really need help with this.

To avoid a long backstory (although details can be provided with requests), my ex-girlfriend made horrible false accusations against me to get marijuana charges that were not yet filed against me filed. She was successful, and while I got nailed with a felony selling three grams of weed, her felonies were all reduced to a summary offense and a one year no-contact order. Meanwhile, I had to transfer schools, lost a special degree I was going to get, lost my internships that would have given me a future career, and suffered from depression and anxiety from the reality that a girl I loved could do such a horrible thing to me. 

Well today, that no-contact order is long over, and now she's engaged. The thing is, she cheated on her fiance at least two times, and multiple people saw and know about it. I don't know this guy, but he needs to know what he's about to get into....quite literally. 

I have written conversations I had with one of her roommates who goes into detail about how many guys she cheated on her current boyfriend with (both she and her BF are named in the texts). They were on facebook, so you can clearly see who she is. I, however, am not visible.

If I were to print those out and send them to her BF (who is the fiance) - the guy I've never met and have no legal quarrel with - can I get in any kind of trouble? Especially legally - could it come back to bite me in the ass?

I also have pages and pages of private investigators reports on how she is a manipulative liar who fucks anything that moves from all of her friends and ex-boyfriends....so her credibility fails to exist with far more people than just me - it's more or less everyone she knows. 

What do you think? 

EDIT: whoops - poor choice of words in the title. SOON TO BE SPOUSE - they are engaged, not married yet. the point is to save this mans life from having to marry a sociopath. "
s5kgl,6,2012-04-11,"31, and we haven't made sexytime for almost a year.  Maybe other problems, too.",dunno_wha_do,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/s5kgl/31_and_we_havent_made_sexytime_for_almost_a_year/,"Ok folks, I don't even know where to begin, I hope someone can help.  My wife and I have been married for almost 8 years now, and we were dating/living together for 4 years before that (college).  I love her very much, but we haven't had sex for almost a year now.  This is a long one, I apologize in advance!  Also, as I write this, I cannot express how uncomfortable I feel discussing sexytime in a serious way on the internet.  Please don't judge too harshly!

I would like to think that it's not all my fault, but I don't know how true this is.  Here are the issues as I see them:

*  Weight/physical attractiveness.  I don't expect my wife to look like she did when I first met her, time passes and all of that.  She has, however, put on quite a lot of weight since then, and this has affected my attraction to her sexually. However, I feel like there's no way to bring this up without grievously hurting her.  Once, earlier in our relationship, she asked if her weight was a problem, and I answered truthfully ""yes"".  Before I could clarify or expound, she locked herself in the bedroom, and didn't speak to me for two days (last words were ""Don't talk to me!"").  To add to the fun, in high school, she was borderline anorexic, due to stress from her parents divorce and subsequent remarriage.  So, I feel like I have no way to express one of the things that's holding me back.  Recently, I would like to add, she has initiated a workout plan, gym 3x a week, personal trainer, cutting some of the crap out of her diet.  I am so proud and happy for her to be doing this!

*  Touching again on her parent's divorce:  I feel like this is a constant cloud over her view of our marriage, that it's doomed to failure every time we have a fight.  I guess my philosophy is that there are going to be occasional fights, but you try to do better and you keep working at it.

* She's also very insecure about her general appearance.  I am constantly having to defend my opinion when I get the question ""do I look nice/pretty."", she complains of hair going grey, wrinkles,  etc., honestly I tire of it (because it's unwarranted!).  For the record, although I think she needs to loose weight, I think she's **very** pretty, and I tell her all the time!  It's like she doesn't even hear it.

*  The other side of this insecurity is she's very worried that another woman will sweep in and try to steal me.  I'm at my flabbiest now, 6' and 195 lbs.  She says girls think I'm hot, but that certainly wasn't my experience growing up (will discuss this further down).  She doesn't have anything to worry about, infidelity is NOT my way.

*  Time.  We both work, she's getting her master's degree.  The bigger issue, however, is that she's an ""A"" person (morning), and I'm a ""B"" person (nite owl).  I have no desire to go to bed at 9pm, and she seems unwilling to consider sexytimes at any other time of day but bedtime.  Some of this is her body insecurity, I think.  For some reason, I'm at my randiest in the morning (when she doesn't want to go to pound town), and right after getting home from work.

*  Depression.  We've both got it in the clinical sense.  Lately, it seems one of us gets over a bout right in time for the next one to sink in.  While this at least lets us keep the house going, and one of us is able to cheer up the other, it's difficult to work up the desire to wrestle when your neurotransmitters are actively trying to eff you in the a.

*  Sexytime ""style"".  I'm not against foreplay, but sometimes I just want to casually go at it!  She doesn't seem to be in this camp anymore, is it so wrong to just want to bang my wife on the couch every once in a while?  In other ways we are generally compatible, I really like doggy style, she doesn't care for it much, but humors me (and I always emphasize my appreciation).  I think it would be very hot to blow my load on her face or boobs, she's definitely not into that, and I can understand how that could be, and I'm ok with it!

*  In addition, it seems like we're at an impasse when it comes to initiating an encounter.  I think we're equally to blame here, because we both want the other to initiate.  I need to do better about this, but goddammit, so does she.  One quick kiss in the kitchen isn't enough of a signal for me sometimes, is it asking to much to just take me by the hand and tell me ""we're doing this now""?

*  Kissing.  I'm not a big kisser, I guess.  She is.  I try to kiss her often, lately it seems that when I do, all I get is complaints that ""I don't kiss long enough"".  Actually, now that I think of it, that complaint has been going on since the beginning, despite my efforts to improve.  How do I make her understand that when I kiss her and she complains, it makes me *less* likely to want to kiss her, not *more*?

*  My own inexperience.  I was a social recluse in elementary/middle/high school.  It was a **very** clique-y place, and I didn't fit into the athlete/pop culture mold.  Consequently, I never had a date in high school.  My wife was my first girlfriend, first sexual experience, you name it!  I don't regret this (well, a tiny bit, but honestly not a big deal), but it does make me wonder how I would deal with these problems if I had more experience dealing with the opposite sex.  I see this as a big problem, because I just don't have that much experience dealing with the female mindset, I have to learn it all with her.  I see the ""crazy"" in some of our friends' relationships, but I don't know what it looks like from the inside, other than what I'm seeing now, if that even counts.  This is very frustrating.

*  Babies.  She want's one.  I finally feel like I'm adult enough to have one, and once we get her a little more stable in her career (read: out of grad school, and a full time job as opposed to internship), we will be ready to make it happen.  I think she sees that this is the *logical* way to plan, but I also think she's a little ""baby crazy"", especially as our friends are all having kids right now.  I'm just not willing to have a kid and figure out the details later, and that's one of the few things in our marriage I'm not willing to budge on.  

*  She also had to have a cyst removed from one of her ovaries, and she still gets pain from time to time.  These times have managed to ""cockblock"" me on several occasions (especially the 6 months before surgery, when the diagnosis had yet to be made), I don't blame her at all for that, just sayin' it don't make it any easier.  

I hate hurting my wife's feelings.  I want to be a good husband.  I want her to be happy.  But I don't want to get steamrolled in the process.  I still need to be me, I need to be happy too.  What can I do?  What should she do?"

I guess I was smart, but now seeing people go about their lives getting internships and having hundreds of friends and making lifelong memories drives me to panic. I have wanted to do so much, but I feel that with my leave, all these plans will be postponed. 

Loneliness is at the core of my daily life. I'm an anxious person and can't help feeling inadequate when talking to mostly anyone. Going to school at an Ivy League, where people are rich and amazing, is a brutal reality check and reinforces my insignificance.

Despite my efforts at optimism, I really do feel excluded from everything interesting going on in the world. The depression is swamping me, and it's hard to hold back tears as I type this. There is this monster that has ripped me from my tentative spot on a trampoline to success, dragging me down into a canyon of despair.

I feel like I suck at everything. I even feel bad when I browse Reddit, because the experiences of people on here seem to outdo my own. 

I have contemplated a number of ways to end it, and I'm feeling that a train would be the most efficient course of action, as I don't own a firearm. I don't think anyone would care about a collision as much as they would cleaning up my guts if I shot myself. 

My only regret would be not having been born a different person, one with a rich social life, successful academic career, and life prospects. I will never have a wife, nor children. I would be ashamed for such people to exist when I am in this state.

s8g27,93,2012-04-13,"If your question is ""Should I get into graphic design?"" then the answer is probably ""No."" If you are meant to be a designer, you will know.",sealiontamer,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/s8g27/if_your_question_is_should_i_get_into_graphic/,"I've seen/heard this question too many damn times and wanted to offer my take on it. 

If you don't have a passion for design in your heart you should NOT become a designer. ""I like to doodle"" and ""I have used photoshop"" are NOT good reasons to become a designer. I graduated with a bunch of people like this, people who chose design because they thought it was going to be an easy major and they fancied themselves ""artistic, creative free spirits"". The majority of those people are now servers, retail employees, and realtors.

Design is NOT easy, and it is by and large NOT an artistic pursuit. (Unless you consider a page from a picture-less novel ""art"") 

You will be getting paid to deliver brand messages and hawk product. You will be producing banner ads that no one will ever see/click. You are not painting Guernica or even drawing Garfield. 

You will be busting your ass to sell your ideas to dimwit clients who typically don't know shit about design and don't place ANY value on you or your skillset. 

You will be working with and taking direction people who get to positions of power by brown-nosing, being tall, and having a nice haircut.

You will be focusing primarily on typography and content organization, and typically only dabbling in what you might call art — color, image, illustration, icons, etc. (about 90%/10%)

Unless you truly enjoy all the anal, tedious minutiae that comes along with ""designing"" - (and by that i mean typography, kerning, leading, grids and guides, stock image/footage searching, color correcting, clipping paths, endless revisions — NOT crosshatching a portrait of your cat wearing a beret), you are guaranteed going to hate your existence and be one of many simply adding noise to a landscape already overflowing with bad-to-mediocre design.

Yes I realize I am an asshole and that this post is rife with potentially-unfair generalizations... if you disagree, please share why!

**Update:** I was always a lefty, artsy kid who enjoyed all creative pursuits — drawing, crafts, acting, music, etc. They were all hobbies and I never took any of them seriously and was never the best artist in class. I sucked at sports and had a passing interest in most other studies — enough to get decent grades but I never really considered a career in math, science, or ""business"". I always knew I wanted to be an ""artist"" of some kind, but didn't even have a concept of ""graphic design"" until I was in high school. I image most designers or people who consider getting into design fit this bill.

But I also clearly remember being impressed with certain logos as a kid and considering how the creators managed to create such recognizable images with such few shapes. being blown away by album artwork and t-shirt designs and silkscreen rock posters and wishing so badly that one day I could make something as awesome as the stuff I found cool.

I went to college for photography at 18 (but took the general art curriculum, including intro to GD) and dropped out after a semester. Then to a trade school for audio engineering — did that ""professionally"" for a few years. Went back to school for Graphic Design at 23. I became a paid design intern at 25 and am now an ACD at 31.

Lots of creative people are drawn to the idea of design because it's one of the few ways to actually make a living doing something ""creative"" — where less than 3% of painters, sculptors, actors, musicians, etc will ever make enough money to support themselves, there's a lot of money being thrown around in design and advertising — enough to feed many a family. That said, I know a lot of folks (some who are ex-designers) who make a respectable salary via other less traditional creative pursuits — baking, crafts, jewelry, custom murals. The world needs these creative people too!

The title of this rant is perhaps a bit much. As a few of you have said, people (creative or otherwise) should dabble in lots of different things before committing themselves to one specific career path (especially with the cost of quality education/software/hardware/etc). Exploring on your own (via the internet, self-initiated projects, libraries) over time is the only way to see if something really interests you enough to make a career of it. "

We dated for almost the whole 3 weeks I was there (most amazing three weeks for both of us) and then decided to leave it at that, when I went back to my home country as it seemed crazy and not realistic to build a long distance relationship on such a spontaneous, short summer relationship. After I went back, we still talked a couple of times a week, and I couldn´t forget about him. And although we never talked about ""us"", I always hoped that he was still thinking about me too. So after 6 months of almost daily talking via Facebook and sometimes Skype, I decided to fly back to visit him and see what would happen. The moment I rang his door bell...most exciting moment of my life. When he opened the door, he kissed me almost immediately and we continued our relationship from the summer as if the 6 months hadn´t been between it. By this time I had already applied for a 6-months-internship in his hometown (I had to do an internship abroad for my university degree anyway), hoping that - if I could live there for a longer period of time - we could give this great relationship a real shot. Shortly after I left his hometown for the second time, I got accepted for an internship there. The minute I told him, he decided to come visit me in my home country for the first time and that´s the moment we decided to officially and exclusively be a couple. That was April 20th, 2011. Only two months after he visited me, my internship started and following were one of the best 7-months of my life. We are now back at a long distance relationship, but he´ll be moving to my home country in a couple of months and I couldn´t be happier. Had I not decided to fly back to visit him half a year after I had met him, I would have missed out on this amazing relationship. People told me I was crazy and that I didn´t even know this guy, when I decided to visit him again. Even he himself didn´t believe that all of this could ever work. Now he is thanking me for not giving up and following my heart :) Today is April 20th, 2012 - our one year anniversay!"
s85m2,6,2012-04-13,In Chile for June and July...,OnLakeOntario,chile,https://www.reddit.com/r/chile/comments/s85m2/in_chile_for_june_and_july/,"Well, I'm actually arriving the 26th of May, but small technicality.

I'm staying in a hostel in Bellavista. As I understand, this is a good area for clubbing and what not, but I'm also in Chile for an (unpaid) internship and to learn some Spanish.

So, questions...

1. I'm a fashion management major at my college in Toronto... As such, though my internship is based around journalism, I want to discover the Chilean fashion scene (street fashion, high end Vitacura fashion, everything). What would be the best place to start?

2. Phones... I read in another thread that it's apparently near impossible to get prepaid voice and internet... Not a problem. However, which company is going to rape me the least on prepaid data? 

3. Learning Spanish... I don't want to pay for a school. They're expensive and not worth it from what I've heard. What's the best way to go about getting a Spanish tutor and how much should I expect to spend? I'm also a pretty awesome cook, so bartering would be awesome as well.

4. Football/soccer... La U is doing rather well in the Copa Libertadores, and I must see Colo-Colo play. How do you buy tickets to these events?

5. Another soccer related question... Speciality stores. I want the jersey Colo-Colo wore for the last Copa Libertadores with their anthem in the background. As it's not current, I imagine I'll have to go to a speciality store or the Museo de Colo-Colo. Any that you would recommend?

6. Safety... Is a money belt necessary? I'm already picking up a small netbook so I don't have to lug my giant 17 inch laptop around (and it's a Mac... Even more encouraging for snatch and grabbers), but are pick pockets that bad? I'm avoiding this topic on expat forums as they blow everything out of proportion.

Hopefully I can meet up with some Redditors on my 1st &amp; 2nd days there, and get acclimated a bit. The main point of this trip is to gauge if Chile is the kind of place I could live once I get my degree (and to go to a wedding...), so anything else you can recommend I'd love to hear."

Hey LoseIt,

First of all, I just wanted to thank all of the wonderful people in this community who have helped me make this possible. The advice, support, and motivation I find here is indescribably amazing.

Here's a bit of background on me and how I changed my life for the better:

I graduated from college back in May of 2011. Right after graduation, I continued working as a finance intern for a technology company -- long, sedentary hours which left me mentally exhausted at the end of the day. The fatigue was usually so bad that I would just end up eating something frozen or delivered for dinner because I was too burnt out to actually cook something decent for myself. 

That summer is when I discovered r/LoseIt. Seeing all of the wonderful advice being exchanged inspired me to make my first post. At the advice of some amazing Redditors, I began to keep a simple daily log of my weight and everything I was eating. I also started to cook a week's worth of food on the weekend and portion them out into individual meals for the week so that I would have no excuses to eat poorly at the end of the workday. My go-to meal was oven-roasted chicken breast with a heaping helping of mixed vegetables and a small side of quinoa. Lunches usually consisted of salads or homemade chicken/tuna wraps. Also, I ditched my morning bowl of cereal for eggs and vegetables -- kept me so much happier and more satisfied during the day. The difference I saw in my weight, mood, and energy levels even after just one month of eating better was phenomenal. But there was still the pesky matter of exercise -- I was still very out of shape.

Now, exercise and I have a long and tumultuous history (middle school and high school PE, anyone?) I was wracking my brain over the options I had -- gym membership? Yoga? Spin? I didn't know what the hell I was going to do. I then received an e-mail that made it perfectly clear. Groupon -- $39 for 6-weeks of fitness boot camp:

The offer promised highly rigorous 30-minute workouts at 7:00am three to four times per week. I signed myself up and eagerly awaited orientation. When orientation day came (on a Saturday, with class to start on the following Monday), I found myself sitting in a fitness studio with a few dozen fellow Groupon'ers, absolutely befuddled and wondering about this huge mistake I was about to make. I thought to myself, ""In my 4 years at college, I can count the number of times I went to the campus gym on one hand, and I'm about to start something called 'boot camp'?! What the hell am I thinking?"" I spent the rest of that weekend ruminating and trying to think of excuses not to go.

Fast forward to Monday, August 1st. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30am -- thankfully, I'm very much a morning person. I fix myself two eggs and a 1/2 cup of rice, and pack a gym bag for the first time. The ""before"" picture above was taken in the morning right before my first boot camp session.

Now, this particular gym facility is over 5 driving miles from my apartment -- any San Franciscan will tell you that 5 city miles is a voyage. I get to the facility early as instructed, only to see the pained faces of the brave souls from the 6:15am class as they finished their last set of lord-knows-what. I was literally shaking in my gym shorts.

After they finished their warm-down stretches, it was my turn to hit the floor. After a bit of group stretching, it was finally time to begin circuit #1. I'd be damned if I even remember what we did in our very first circuit, because 30 minutes later, I found myself in the bathroom, on the verge of throwing up. It was then that I realized just how out of shape I was.

I managed to get myself over to work and into the showers in our building. I got dressed and headed up to my desk, and fought to stay awake for the rest of the morning. I returned home from work that day absolutely exhausted and wondering if I was gonna make it to another session. I spent all of the next day intermittently popping ibuprofen and trying not to move too much. As much as I was hurting, I was determined to make it on Wednesday morning.

And make it I did. And on Friday. And all three days the next week. And every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks afterwards. Each time, the workouts became easier, and I found myself getting less and less winded after each one. Soon, I was feeling more energetic during the day -- no more 2:30 crash at work. But the good changes didn't stop there. My clothes began to feel more like blankets. I went through each item in my closet individually, and had to say goodbye to so many clothes that had served me well in the past.

Although I loved the boot camp immensely, it was too expensive to continue at a non-discount price. Since then, I made the resolution to be more active in general, and to capitalize on my alumni membership discount for my old campus gym.

While I had slimmed down considerably during 2011, I neglected the importance of strength training, and ended up in the awkward ""skinny-fat"" category. That's when I decided that it was time. for me to hit the weight room. At the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a personal trainer), I picked up the book [The New Rules of Lifting](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com/), and I'm glad that I did. Armed with the knowledge and confidence to hit the weight room for the first time, I started right after the new year. The energy, confidence, and muscle I've built from a few short months of lifting weights has been nothing short of incredible, and I can't stress the importance of strength training enough.

Now that I have lost all the weight I wanted to lose for medical and health reasons, I am now focused on improving my general fitness and physical appearance (as vain as that may be :P). I have shifted my diet to a high-protein, low-fat, adequate-carb approach, maintaining a sufficient caloric deficit in order to further reduce my body fat percentage. My eventual (but lofty) goal is to have visible abs at some point, and I'm determined to get there one way or another.

I am also ridiculously excited to be participating in my first mini-triathlon in two weeks! Something I never thought possible months ago is now the main focus of my efforts.

Lastly, for anyone who is looking to lose weight or get healthy, just remember this: **there is no magic pill, shake, or gizmo that will take the place of clean eating and personal diligence**. It is remarkable to me how quickly the weight came off once I took control over what I was eating. At no point in this journey did I feel starving or deprived -- when you're full on tasty, nutritious, wholesome foods, your body no longer craves the processed junk anymore. Losing the weight and getting fit has simultaneously been the easiest and most difficult thing I've ever done; the diet and exercise is easy, but casting aside all of the self-doubt and excuses was definitely the challenging part. 

Sorry this ended up being such a long post -- I just felt that there was so much to share! I am so honored to be a part of this wonderful community, and I look forward to reading about all of your trials, tribulations, and SUCCESSES!

Cheers,
Dave 

[TL;DR -- Started cooking for myself, eating more nutritious wholesome foods, and became active for the first time of my life. More protein, less starches. Weight came off so easily it's almost ridiculous.]"

He hit on our 26 yr old engaged intern (who got a job after a few months and left). Made comments in our office about her being his girlfriend. Made comments about a female in the student activities office being his girlfriend. Flirted with a female in our organization. She told him to stop and he laughed at her. He's the president of another club. Would bring random people into our office to have business meetings. Didn't do the things he was supposed to in his position on the exec board. I caught him lying. He always blamed other people for everything.

I go to the advisor and talk to the student conduct officer on a thursday. The next day at our meeting five people quit. He steps down from his position but continues going to meetings.

In the other club, he decides to have an event for speed dating. Puts an ad in the newspaper saying that wings is sponsoring it. They aren't and threaten to sue the school. The event never got approved and thus the ad was never supposed to go in the paper. He's friends with the editor in chief of the newspaper.

He decides to run to student trustee. Another candidate discovers guys passing out flyers smearing her name. She asks if the guy send them and one starts to say yes before the other shushes him.

I quit the organization I was in. He's still in it and is still president of the other thing. The results of the winning candidate are not in yet.

Can anything be done? Nobody else went to the advisor out of fear he turn everyone against them and make them look bad."

My partner recently got accepted for an internship at MIT. This is a dream come true for her (and for me, because I'm very proud of her), but now that the excitement is 'wearing off', reality is kicking in.

She's going to stay in Massachusetts for about 3 months. She's never been to the States for this long (we're both European) and the thought of going somewhere new, where she doesn't know anybody, is pretty scary.

Do you guys have any tips for great places where she can socialise and hopefully not feel alone? Bars, cinema's, parks, etc...

Also, since she will be an intern, she can not get a room at the MIT campus (sup with that? ;p). What would be a great way to find a place to stay? We know of craigslist and /r/bostonhousing, but maybe you guys have some interesting tips. As you can imagine, going to a different continent and moving in with someone you haven't met before is kind of scary.

Thanks in advance!"

s7qkf,1,2012-04-13,My girlfriend got sexually harrassed by an ex-coworker yesterday and she's talking to the offender today on MSN like nothing ever happened. What do I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s7qkf/my_girlfriend_got_sexually_harrassed_by_an/,"Here's the full story:

Yesterday, my girlfriend had to go back to his old work place to get some internship certificates she needed to graduate. In the middle of that, she runs into one of her old co-workers who had a -major- crush on her (and still has, it seems.). They were good friends, and she told me all about it and how he kept gifting her roses and chocolate when she was doing her internship over there. I was like ""Well, you're being pretty straightforward and honest to me and I appreciate that, you can be friends with whoever you want anyway.""

Well, seems like he got pretty confident about himself yesterday, because he pulled her to a secluded place and ran her against a wall and tried to kiss her. My girlfriend got out of that position, in the meanwhile one of his bosses is walking down their way so she started talking to him normally so he wouldn't get in trouble I guess, I don't know why.

Fast forward today, she tells me everything that happened yesterday (the story above). We started chatting like the lovebirds we usually are until around 3am, since I had to go work early I give her my good night, sleep well etc. But she tells me she'll stay online for a couple more minutes since she's chatting on msn with someone else. I ask her who, out of curiosity?

The ex-coworker.

Naturally, I flip my shit at her asking her how the hell can she still talk to that son of a bitch after what she did to her. Then she literally tells me ""Well he tried to kiss me but he didn't make it, that's what counts right?""

I turned off my pc right away.

Am I overreacting here? She looked pretty surprised that I was mad, but come on, I was already lenient enough about her having him on his contact list even after the repeated attempts to take her away from me. But this is the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's strange because, we spent the whole night talking about our future and all that, I want to believe we're both in love and I don't want to do or say anything that might hurt our relationship without necessity, so that's why i'm asking here.

What do I do?

**Edit:** I might have been a bit extremist with the ""sexually harrassed"" on the post title, I don't know.

I'm in my early 30's, which makes me feel too old at this point.  But better to start doing what I like now, right?  Anyways, I'm taking a C++ course while deciding if I want to go for a BS or MS.  I'm a molecular bio major, which has completely nothing to do with CS.  Anyways, I have a few questions that needs answers in order for me to decide which route I want to take.
1. Does school matter?  I've read somewhere that the drop off is so significant between a school like MIT and Madison that unless this is what I have to choose between, it doesn't matter.  I would love to hear your opinions as it would help a lot with my decision.
2.  MS or BS?  I still need to take a handful of basic computer courses that are required for entry into a Master's program.  I probably have a lot of the gen-eds completed from my previous degree that would also fulfill CS BS requirements .  These required classes would also fulfill a BS requirement as well.  However, for a BS,  I would probably have to take Calc based physics and math beyond Calc 2.  I'm approximating about 2 years for either degree.  I guess my biggest concern is skipping undergrad and all its foundation courses to plunge into a graduate program.
3.  Is there anything else I can do to get a head start?  Time is definitely not on my side so any suggestions, even ""internship, ASAP"" would be wonderful.  I really have no idea where to start except enrolling community college courses.  I had a conversation with someone from work and he suggested looking for collaborative ""open source projects"".  And I found out about project-Eula on reddit, which I will check out after this.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Currently I am in my second year, and will be graduating next year. I am 19 years old

Right now I am very worried because my problem is that I do not have any experience and am not very confident.I have no networks whatsoever. The Big 4 does internships during the summer for students on their second last year of university such as myself. However I did not apply for it this year.

On the side, I am also studying to receive a Japanese diploma. 

My main question is, when I graduate I am thinking of not jumping straight into the accounting field, but instead take a year to teach in Japan as part of a program. 

When this is over, I feel like I will feel more confident and ready to enter into the business world.

Is this a good idea? And will such an experience help me get a job in accounting in the future when I, or will it be too late, as I hear that companies such as the Big 4 like to recruit graduates straight out of university? 
Though i am not saying I Big 4 is my only option, but would working for other firms, e.g. a bank or other companies as an accountant be as good? 

Thank you, I am very inexperienced but very ambitious, so would appreciate any responses!"

I am in the middle of taking introductory (Java) programming series at community college (no prior programming experience). I also have applied to my state university's CS program, but it is very competitive and I won't know if I'm accepted until July at earliest. I think these are good first steps, but I really want to be doing more to learn and get experience. I am not really being challenged at all in my programming class. I could (and likely will) learn the rest of the course material within the next week or so. But other than that, what can I do? Learn another language? Try making Android apps? Read more advanced level textbooks? I tend to struggle/lose motivation with learning things on my own because I don't know what to learn next, but I can learn/work extremely quickly if I have some sort of structure to follow or a project to work on.

Another thing I have been thinking about is summer internships. Does already having a bachelor's degree disqualify me from internships? Is it even possible that anyone would hire someone with as little experience as I have? I live in the Seattle area if that's relevant. I know it's unlikely but the sooner I can get experience the better, and being unemployed I have ample time to learn."

s758i,0,2012-04-12,Help me choose a school clinic this summer,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/s758i/help_me_choose_a_school_clinic_this_summer/,"All of the 2L summer internships I got this summer were unpaid, can't get school credit for them, and don't have a reputation for hiring interns after graduation, so I'm leaning towards doing a school clinic for credit this summer. It's close to my home and I get credit towards graduation for doing so. I'll also be able to research for a professor on the side for pocket money. 

The only thing is, I can't decide between two of the clinics. The first is a general practice clinic for indigent clients. Some characteristics of this clinic:
| It is a 45 minute drive away, but my school compensates me for gas AND something like $0.75 per mile for wear on the car.
| General practice, but most covers family issues (divorce, custody, protection from abuse, dependency, etc.)

The other option is an environmental law clinic. 
| Close distance, on campus, about 1 hour walking or 20 minutes by bus.
| Covers land use issues, clean water act cases, etc.

Here's the thing, though. I'm already enrolled in the Environmental clinic for the fall and spring semesters anyways (It's a year long commitment during the academic year). 

So the concerns running through my mind are these: will doing the general clinic (with the Enviro clinic during the year) make me stand out more to employers than committing to three semesters of the Environmental clinic? Would an extra semester of the Enviro not really do much for me in terms of attractiveness or can a case be made that it shows my dedication to that cause?

If the answer to my first question is yes, would the benefit of the general clinic alongside my environmental clinic be worth driving 45 minutes each way and sitting in traffic and all that? 

Should I consider the possibility that I will hate the Enviro clinic, and after a summer in it, will want to drop out for the year, saving me a year of trouble? 

What do you all think? Is there anything else I should be asking myself for making this decision? For what it's worth, if I had my choice, I would love to work in environmental law, but would be happy working in any public interest/non-profit area, and would take anything I can get in any of those fields after graduation. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"

I am an avid gamer (mainly Call of Duty recently) and I am quite competetive, in a healthy way of course. NES and SNES bring me back to my favorite classics though. I own the following: Xbox 360, PS3, 3DS, Sega Dreamcast. I play anything and everything. I really love to go bowling or go out and play basketball or something but I don't do much of that because I don't have many friends in the area. I don't smoke or drink at all and I don't want to be around it.

I am Agnostic (Christian for about 16 years and now I lean more towards Atheism but I can't rule anything out) and I am very knowledgeable in both views so I can fit in and respect your views. I don't talk about it a lot. I do have fairly high morals that I have kept from the religious background but I have always listened to heavier music and cursed and everything. I am a very calm and laid back type of guy.

I have been living in the area for almost a year now. I only have 3 friends that I really talk to anymore and none of them are able to get an apartment right now. I had 2 apartment situations that I got out of and I am now living with my cousins. I don't like living here because they are raising a family and I often feel like I'm intruding.

First off I'll explain to you what was up with my apartment situations. I was attending school at DeVry and I got the apartments through them. In the first apartment I had roommates that were pretty douchebaggish. I was able to stand it for a while but then they started smoking weed and getting drunk everyday and the were worse while they were in these conditions. I don't approve of either of those and I couldn't handle living with them so I asked to be moved to a different apartment.

In the second apartment everything was fine for a while until I started noticing things coming up missing. It started with small things like a 16 GB SD card that I might not notice. That turned into $50 Christmas week (I had to have a friend give me gas so I could drive home for Christmas...), my class ring, and a laptop. Needless to say I got out of there the week after Christmas when I came back missing those things as well.

.

I was pointed to a set of apartments by another redditor. The price is $395 for a 1 BR and $495 for a 2 BR. The person who linked me there said they pay around $120 a month for utilities. They are about average sized and seem to be pretty nice. I personally have a lot of things that you need in an apartment, all the kitchenware, a bed, a kitchen table/chairs. I have a mini-fridge for the living room and several TVs. I think I can supply a Futon or couch from a family member as well.

If you are interested shoot me a message. I am actually available to move in any time pretty much."

So far, I have done a lot of internships (through a co-operative study program), but none of them have involved any programming beyond VBA and some database queries.
Since it is pretty much the norm over here, I'm going on to study for a master's degree in IS (CS master's are hard/impossible to get into with my bachelor's, especially because it is low on math) and want to use the two years this will take to move over to the programming side of things.
What are some steps you would recommend? I am working on the SCJP certification and am planning to get at least three programming internships in before the end of my next degree as well as to take as many technical classes as possible (and IS degrees are often significantly more technical here than in the US, with the sad exception of my bachelor's degree). I also know a programming language specific to a certain large German ERP software product.
Is my best bet to get as much personal and open source programming experience as possible? Are there even any ""enterprise"" open source projects (as that is the area my IS degree may help a bit in)? Are Java EE, multiple other Java frameworks, .NET and ABAP (SAP) good choices for areas to build skills in?"

1. He came to me upset asking for advice.
2. My sister said something to me at her wedding. ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

Lemme list some things about him that may be it..

- He's quiet.
- According to some of the female nurses, some think he looks good.
- He can be sarcastic and cynical at times, but its rather funny. (I happen to be the same way.)
- He smiles a lot.
- He may not have any self esteem or be socially awkward. (Im not sure because he is never down on himself nor acts like he is confident.)
- He seems tired all of the time and sometimes comes across lazy.
- He seems like he doesnt like to talk to people because its a waste of time. Either that or hes not comfortable with it.
- Hes really nice.. always willing to scrub in on mundane slice and dices.

Really.. the list goes on and on.. but I think he may be super average. Doesnt stand out.

Below is the beginning of a short story I'm working on. I've recently become interested in writing as a creative outlet since I get no such satisfaction from my work. I'm looking for any feedback. Since I'm just getting into this I would like to avoid getting in to any bad habits. The story is about a man who can dig into and influence peoples minds. He sells this talent/service to individuals looking to influence politics. 

---------------------------------------------

The guy in front of me stepped away and the security guard suspiciously looked me over.  I got a little nervous.  It happens every time.  Are they going to see through my phony invite and identification?  Then the real questions would start.  The who’s, what’s, when’s, where’s and why’s.  None of which I felt inclined to answer.

I took a cautious step forward and presented my invite.  The guard grabbed it and looked it over.  It was painfully obvious he was looking close, but more so concerned with the appearance of it.  I smiled and took it back when he handed it to me.  What a clown.

The guard told me to raise my arms and spread my feet and proceeded to pat me down.  My palms were sweating a little.  I never carry anything on me, but getting through security is always the toughest part of the job.  When you’re up to no good you think everybody around you has some kind of sixth sense about it.  All this time and I still succumb to a little paranoia here and there.  When he finished I shook his hand and thanked him for good measure.  Contact made, his mind was open and I peaked inside. It was cluttered and unfocused, the connections were a mess, but I found what I was looking for.  No issue, all he cared about was when he got off shift.  He probably forgot my face as soon as the next guy stepped forward and handed him their credentials.

The guard waved me on and I left my anxiety behind at the checkpoint.  I stepped through the open double doors into the foyer and the party was in full swing.  I smiled again.  It seemed so cliché, waiters in tuxedos carrying glasses of expensive wine on a silver platter.  Those people do love their opulence, don’t they?  I grabbed a glass as a waiter floated by.  No sense in being the only person in the room without a drink, right?

I surveyed the crowd.  The sooner I spotted my target the sooner I could make an exit.  The mansion was big, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be too hard to locate my target.  Off the foyer to my left was a large sitting area filled with couches, chairs and other butt-holding instruments.  Directly in front of me was a staircase with an ornate banister, gold trimmed and spared no detail.  To my right was the busiest room in the house.  The bar was packed from wall to wall and the bartenders moved with speed and grace to fill orders as fast as they could.

I decided to head left into the sitting area.  I imagined that my target would be just as enthusiastic as I was about the prospect of pushing my way into the crowd at the bar.  Besides, he probably had some lacky intern at his beck and call to fetch his drinks for him.  The guests adorning the furniture were contributing to a dull roar.  It was hard to make out any specifics, only words plucked from the air here and there.  As I moved deeper into enemy territory I could hear the soft call of piano music.  It was slow, but melodic, carrying a deep sense of emotion.  My curiosity peaked and I sought to discover the source.

I turned the corner and spotted my target.  The Senator sat, dressed in a black business suit, behind the piano.  Surrounded by an awestruck crowd the room was still, his practiced movements the only source of motion.  I took a spot in the back of the room. I would have to wait until this performance was finished before I could get in close and make contact.  

As the song began to display the tell-tale signs of winding to a close I began to plan contact.  Some targets in the past have been easier than others.  Sometimes, though rare, they have taken steps to limit physical contact.  This presents a unique challenge, one that often involves one of those ""Oh, I tripped. Thanks for catching me.""-type moments.  If I was lucky the Senator would be in full politician-mode, schmoozing, meeting and greeting to the fullest extent.  The music had stopped; I would soon find out.

The Senator rose from the bench to raucous applause and gave a small bow.  His mouth was forming ""thank you's"", but I couldn't hear them.  He moved into the crowd and began shaking hands, this was my chance.  I repositioned myself into his path and acted the part of an admiring constituent.  

""Senator,"" I said. ""That was beautiful""

The Senator shuffled near with his hand out and I grabbed it.  He felt my grip and turned to lock eyes with me, his mouth smiling, but his eyes calm and unaffected.  There it was!  My mind flooded with foreign images, memories and thoughts of a man well exceeding me in age.  It was overwhelming at first, as it sometimes is.  His mind was so much more structured and disciplined than the security guard, the difference was as stark as day and night.

sbhjn,26,2012-04-15,Any advice for asking for a raise when the company is in a down time?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/sbhjn/any_advice_for_asking_for_a_raise_when_the/,"Here is my history with my company, followed by the **TL;DR;**

I can’t think of a better subreddit to post this in, if there is one please let me know.

I went to school for web design and got a job at a marketing/design firm while I was still in school. The position has evolved into more of a web developer position, and I love it.

I started as a paid intern at $10 an hour doing design as I taught myself how to build websites, they had been using a company from out of state to build all of their websites and I made myself the goal of replacing that company. Within six months I had reached that goal and they hired me on as a salaried employee at 25k a year.

During this time the company was doing extremely well. It's a relatively new startup, and they were going into their fourth year. At our Christmas party they said that because we were doing so well that they started a profit sharing program, and we all receive bonus checks. My boss took me aside and said that they had hired a consultant to help with the company’s growth, and that part of that was going to be a salary review in order to insure that we were making fair market wages. 

He said that they knew that I was being underpaid but wasn’t sure by how much, but that it would be a few months before they finished the review process. They gave me a raise to 30k that night, and said that I could expect another one when the review process was finished. A few months later I received another raise that put me at 45k.

This was about 14 months ago, and my 2 year review is coming up in June.

I actually never really planned on at staying in this city, and had planned on moving when I graduated college. But in the time I’ve been here I’ve really fallen in love with my job. 

I want to ask for a raise, and a fairly substantial one. My goal is to make 55k, which would be about 20% more than I make now. The problem is we’re not raking in the money like we were before. We’re going through some growing pains and the owner mentioned about a month ago that we had been living payroll to payroll. 

But even knowing that I’m honestly not that worried. We landed a few biggish contracts and are hiring for 2 more positions (going from 9 to 11 employees). I think we’re all really excited about making the next year a good one. 

(On a side note, I have been saving up an emergency fund just in case, but honestly the unknown is part of why I love this job)

We are in a small town, and we are the only company of its kind here. If I ever need to find a new job it will involve moving away, which would be fine with me. The closest town and most likely destination would be Ft Collins CO, and according to indeed.com the [average salary for web developers is 68k](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Web-Developer-l-Fort-Collins,-CO.html).

The other piece of  information that I have which I probably shouldn't share with them is that I talked to the only other web developer we've ever hired, and he was making 62k. He was fired for poor performance, but he had a lot more experience than I do. I am a much better developer/designer than he was.

I feel like I’m in a good position to ask for a raise, except for the slow business. 

So here is my idea. I thinking about in the review telling them that I want a raise, and backing it up with the 68k theoretically available in the next town over. The honest truth is that if they say no I’ll still want to continue working here. The raise would make life a shit-ton easier, but I’d rather work somewhere that I love and make less than make more and be stuck in a cubicle somewhere. 

I’m going to collect my thoughts and arguments and write them down, and in my review tell them the salary I want. I’m going to ask them what I would need to do in order to earn the 55k, and give myself 6 months or a year to reach those goals.

Is there any advice you guys can offer me? This will be the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise. I think the fact that I wouldn’t quit if they said no might be apprenant, which probably isn’t ideal. And there is the concern about the tight budget we’ve been working on the past few months. But that’s why I’m going to propose either the 6 month or 1 year timeline. 

**tl;dr;**

I want a big raise, not willing to leave my job if I don't get it, I believe I've earned it, and I'm willing to prove that I can earn it. I'm planning on asking in June, so I have time to prepare. But I want to know what I should bring to the table in order to make my case."

sbb80,2,2012-04-15,Guilty Using Google?,Sarkar9,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sbb80/guilty_using_google/,"Hi Reddit. I wanted to inquire about your use of Google / stackoverflow / etc for any of your programming projects, whether they were professional or personal. 

I'm currently a junior working towards a CSE degree &amp; work as a software engineering intern at a company, and I can't help but notice that as the classes have gotten harder and I've been writing professional code that I've been googling a TON more. Not necessarily for full-fledged solutions, however. Let me explain with an example. 

One of our projects for a web infrastructure class was building a tool that let us retrieve an HTML page. I knew how to do the TCP part but had no idea how to do the HTTP component on top of TCP, so I googled questions on how to write an HTTP component; I ended up finding a fully working solution. I didn't copy / paste the code, but I understood exactly what the solution was doing and re-fitted the function calls and steps to my own program. I feel sorta guilty that I googled a solution to a problem and ended up using it, but this class doesn't have a book nor a reference guide, so we're kinda on our own. Not only that, I made sure I understood WTH was going on, e.g. building a HTTP query as a string and sending away. So, I did feel like I learned, and I did not copy/paste because I altered the GET statement to my own needs. 

However, how often is this done? Is this something many other programmers do? Can you guys share your stories and perhaps let me know what it's like in a professional setting? I completely understand having things like php.net always open and googling for random errors, but what about situations like mine where you don't exactly know 100% what's going on, but use search engines to figure out what it is?"

Talk to her on Thursday and everything seemed to be alright, Friday the 13th, I text the usual ""I love you, good morning.""

This is the beginning of the end, she replies cheerfully, but doesn't reciprocate an ""I love you."" Eventually, after some more texts, I realize that she isn't saying it at all, so I call her. 

It's over, apparently she had been putting a lot thought into it over a couple of days, and it was too far and too long for us to be together. And ultimately, ""it shouldn't be this hard to date someone.""

One thing I noticed, she would always browse this subreddit and I'd ask her if she was reading it because she was troubled, she just liked to read the stories. I don't know if that was true, but this is just a tangent.

I asked her if we could ever be together again, she said she didn't know, but maybe when she got back. Was this her just saying that to let me down easy, she did say she had already hurt me enough.

I logged out of her facebook, erased the saved password. I still live in our room, but am moving out when I graduate college (2 months left). I'm shattered. 

It seems though, from her sisters and family friends that I've spoken to, she's alright. She didn't cry nearly as much as me through out this. She even seemed a lot stronger about leaving then I did, before she left.

Do I have any hope? "

It started with my first full time job. It was my first software engineering internship. During this time I learned a lot about myself and the world. I am 23 years old and still living with my mom. After this internship, I learned so much about my profession and general knowledge that I would never attain through college(I am a computer science major). I am going to graduate this spring and I am so surprised how much I have grown through college.

I am interested to hear when was your first realization that it was time to grow up and not associate yourself with childish emotions or feelings? Or if you truly never wanted to grow up and call yourself an adult?

I am sorry if this post seems all over the place. This is my first post on Reddit and I couldn't sleep so I decided to ask this question. "

I'm a 25 year old hard worker who moved down to this area about 6 months ago. I'm getting married in June, living with my in-laws, and looking for a career path slightly different to the one I'm on now.

Currently I'm working as a Certified Technician at Staples. While I'm very good at my job, sadly it's about 90% focused on selling. I was told I would be selling every now and then, but it's become a big part of this job. I like it, because it's a job, and it helps pay my bills and helps me treat my fiance (who is working as an unpaid intern) to a weekly date night, but I don't like it in the sense that the pay is embarrassingly low for a Computer Technician.

Previous to this job I worked at an independent gaming store in Columbia, SC and developed my own process to repair gaming consoles. It was very hardware related, and I really took pride in it. I worked there for a year until I realized I needed to get out of that city (seriously, it's crazy up there). Previous to that job, I operated my own business repairing game consoles out of my home. I did this job for a year also.

I don't have any formal training other than being a Staples Certified Technician, but I *have* gone to The University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina - Lancaster, and Midlands Technical College. I basically just do not have the money to finish the last 1.5-2 years of schooling for a degree, but I DO plan on finishing it out, whether it's taking online classes when I find a decent paying job, or joining the Air Force.

I can also provide a resume and cover letter to any employers who may be reading this.

Even though this may get lost in the depths of Reddit, it's worth a shot. If anybody knows anybody who is hiring, please let me know, any help would be appreciated.

I can answer any further questions also. Thanks [/r/Charleston](/r/Charleston) !"

It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

I am socially awkward. I have a hard time connecting with other people, but am doing well academically. I am in shape and workout at the CRC more than a couple of times a week. 

I have recently overhauled my wardrobe a little by following some advice from [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice)  and searching former asksubreddit posts, I have started being myself? (not sure whether I am doing this wrong). I am a pro at small talk and then ejecting (Hey how's it going...nice..take care/have a good one) but I am so fucking alone that it kills me. On Fridays, my limited friends are playing some videogames, but mostly I've spent the past couple of weekends alone in my room or walking out and about because I am clueless about clubs/bars that I can get to without a car. Even if I did, I don't know people to go with. It seems like being in a frat, would have been a great option to have something to do on weekends, but I am 2 semesters away from graduation, and it's a rather fucking lonely place to be. 

Most of my attempts at talking to girls are epic fail too. I have been on a grand total of 2 dates this semester, but most girls I like, I am too chicken to talk to, or they are taken or the others I don't want to mess up the social friendship/acquaintance thing that I have going. In my classes, seems like everyone has their own groups, so I feel alienated in the class. And the only other place that I see girls that I'd be interested in talking to are at the CRC which I made a pact with myself not to do. Mostly because I'd much rather do my workout and let the girls do theirs besides I couldn't engage in such behaviour because if I were a girl, I'd probably think of the guy as creepy? Unless they know each other which seems like the norm for all frat/sorority people at the crc or in classes/etc. 

Anyway my life seems to be in a funk and I am not even sure why I am studying to be an engineer anymore. I am unsure about life post graduation as the limited (two) summer internships that I've had have lead me to believe that I fucking hate my guts working on some stupid analysis and optimization stuff. 

TL:DR -&gt; I am fucking down and out and on the verge of what might be depression? plus I am clueless about life now. looking for your thoughts and suggestions and wisdom. Thanks. "

The first year while I was undecided and messing around with courses in the college of arts and sciences, I ended with a 3.86 GPA. 

Now that I'm in the engineering college pursuing a major in CS, I've been doing terribly. Last semester I dropped one of my two math courses, then got a D in the other. I also got a C in another class, dragging my GPA down to a 3.33. 

This semester it looks like I'm going to get a D in the CS weed-out class for my major (I need a C- to pass), and I'll probably have another C.

This is all so stressful and I don't know what to do. Currently I'm looking at having to take 5 classes per semester, and since I will most likely fail a class this semester, I'll have to take that one again (it will be with another professor who is really easy). 

I don't really want to switch majors. I *like* my major, and it's really the only thing I can say interest me, but it's just so damn hard. It's given me so many opportunities to travel, plus the program has 100% job placement rate. I'm just worried about graduating withing my 4 years. I can take this class I'm failing over the summer, but it costs money I really don't have. I'm already going to be spending thousands on going to Europe for an internship and taking the math course I got a D in once I get back. I was thinking, ""Well, my parents are going to kill me, but *maybe* I can convince them to let me dish out another $2440 to take another class this summer. Even with that I got screwed over. The class meets 4x a week, and one of the meeting times would interfere with the math class. 

I really don't know what to do. I can't take 6 classes one semester. It'd kill me. I can barely handle 5. I become so sleep deprived and lately have felt physically ill very often. I get frequent headaches, and this is just making it so much worse. I get so upset over my courses that I begin to feel nauseous. I've briefly considered staying one extra semester to lighten the load, but I really don't have that kind of cash. 

I was the perfect A+ student in high school and I feel like since being in college, and switching colleges (within my university), I'm slipping.

Note: I talk to my professors. In the class I think I'm going to fail, the professor told me today I need to get an 80% on the final to be on the border of a D+ and C-. I could study extremely hard, but realistically I doubt I'll near an 80% (I'd have to practically double my performance based on the past 2 exams) , especially since I'll have two other exams to study for before this one.

I don't really know what you can do. I don't know if anyone can really give me any guidance, or just a cheerful thought. I got back my exam grade today, so the reality is sinking in that I'll have to take this class again and I really don't have the time for it. I'll have to plan the rest of my college life (again, as far as my schedule goes), even though I did this already and said, ""Ok, but this will only work if I never fail a class.""

Tl;dr: I'm not doing great in college and it's becoming both physically and mentally exhausting."

Today I really didn't want to go to school because everything seemed so meaningless. The thought of cutting my veins kept occurring to me. I learned from an online post long ago that cutting your veins and soaking in a bathtub with warm water is the least painful way to die. I wish I do not need to live with the guilt and unbearable pain of loss. I wish death is the easy escape. However, I still managed to go to school with 15 min late, because I needed to turn in a take home exam; because I needed to get good grades from my class; because I needed good grades to get a good job; because I needed the money from the job to repay the tens of thousands of dollars my parents paid for my college, and make them happy the rest of their life. I still cannot let down the people that still love me.

 

But with the unbearable pain that I was afraid I was not the girl they thought I was. Yesterday I told my mom that my boyfriend proposed to me, my mom and I were both so excited and thrilled. From my mom's loving and happy expression, I suddenly felt I grew up and I was no longer a little girl, and I was a whole new fully matured woman capable to take responsibility in life. Yesterday at this moment I felt like the happiest woman in the world with my boyfriend getting me the perfect ring I wanted. It was like I finally found the meaning of life.

 

My boyfriend is the nicest guy in the world, even though at the beginning he was flaky; but later on, he fully devoted himself, and I never felt so good with a man. It was like my dream from my childhood came true. I was his princess and he was my prince. I never felt so secure and right with a man, and we could see our future together.

 

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

 

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

 

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own feeling that I would lose him. 

I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful and sinful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

 

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

 

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

 

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

 

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation--just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer--we are challenged to change ourselves."" - Victor Frankl



This is from the book my wonderful boyfriend let me read not long ago, because he noticed the saddes and depression and anger that happened to me sometime, which I tried really hard to manage. I never found a book so enlightening, and I believed it cured my depression where the psychologists did no help. This is just one of the numerous things I so deeply appreciate my boyfriend. I cannot find a reason not to love boyfriend now. Yes, even after what happened, even if I was damned."

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch at that time. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own fear that I would lose him. 
I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation--just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer--we are challenged to change ourselves."" - Victor Frankl

This is from the book my wonderful boyfriend let me read not long ago, because he noticed the saddes and depression and anger that happened to me sometime, which I tried really hard to manage. I never found a book so enlightening, and I believed it cured my depression where the psychologists did no help. This is just one of the numerous things I so deeply appreciate my boyfriend. I cannot find a reason not to love boyfriend now. Yes, even after what happened, even if I was damned, I always love him."
scpeg,0,2012-04-16,I work in a small business and my colleague does absolutely no work. What can I do to have her evaluated and possibly fired?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scpeg/i_work_in_a_small_business_and_my_colleague_does/,"Like I stated above, I work in a small business. Its a federal contracting firm, and there are probably ~15 people in the office. I have been working here around 6 months as my first job out of college, and I work hard every day (until i get on reddit). I have a colleague that is female, and black. I have nothing against women. I grew up in a heavily populated area with very diverse nationalities, so no, I am not racist.  I along with many other colleagues before I entered the company have had multiple conflicts with this woman--multiple times. She causes problems. Every time you disagree with her opinions, she gets extremely defensive and begins to undermine your position, stating that you are not qualified to make such an accusation. (I'm an engineer, she claims to be an architect but she does no architectural work....but she is a ""project manager"") I asked her how to read a drawing in a particular architectural scale (1:50m) and told me to ask someone else. I'm not an architect but I can definitely read that scale.

The most recent event happened on last Wednesday. She stayed on the office phone for FOUR HOURS trying to figure out a cell phone bill issue. Then the following day she was on the phone for an additional TWO HOURS just to re-order a coffee table that wasn't the color that she wanted. This entire time, I am at my desk working my ass off. She sits there speaking under her breath on the phone for four hours. Then better yet, I see her time sheet for the last two weeks and she BILLS the hours saying that she worked. She is the last to come in, and first to leave.

I constantly interact with my colleagues. I get work from multiple people in my office, and I always turn it in on time and in great quality. I work easily 9 hours a day, and stay after work just to get some more experience. This work habit is consistent to everyone in this office, except her. I am already involved in more work in the company than her, and she has been here for a year and a half. I applied to jobs for 6 months straight after graduation and FINALLY got employed, so I am trying to make the best of it.

This is the part that REALLY aggravates me.  I am working at my full potential, because I have what a lot of my college graduate friends STILL do not have. But I work next to someone that myself and a few colleagues consider an overpaid paper-pusher. Someone my age could easily fill her overpaid salary position in this company, that is not only more qualified to do the work, but can generate work at a higher quality. We don't even need one person to fill her position, we could hire 2 people each with half of her salary. More work would be done, and a friendlier work environment would be made. We work as a team here, and she is the only person in the whole office that works solo. It has come to the point where colleagues cannot ask her for help on something. Her work quality is terrible, so anything she works on has to be redone. We recently got two part time interns, and now all she does is push her work to the interns. Her work is simple enough to have these interns do it. All of the others in this office are skeptic to dish out our work because it is too technical for someone to understand without prior engineering experience. I have written emails to my boss twice on how myself and a colleague have been personally offended (in an extremely unprofessional vocal manner) by her, and nothing seems to be done. My boss is completely content with his situation, and wants absolutely nothing to do with these events that seem to keep reoccurring. It has gotten to the point where no one talks to her unless they HAVE to. I feel like my boss is too scared to make a move towards questioning her, it would just release a disaster of arguments and self defense. 

What to do reddit? 

What can I do?

I can't stand it anymore and would like to move out, but she is still going to hold me responsible for rent unless I find a subleaser.  Am I really just going to have to suck it up?  Details inside.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sco9r/my_roommatelandlords_cats_are_destructive_and/,"These cats were not part of the deal when I moved in.  She adopted them and asked me prior-to if I would mind the cats moving in, and I said I wouldn't mind because I was under the impression that they would be well-mannered, well-behaved cats and I am a cat-lover myself.  There was no written agreement or anything involving the cats living here. 

Now, the cats are very cute and sweet for the most part, but they are also the most destructive, annoying cats I have ever known.  Of my belongings, three pairs of shoes have been damaged, one of which I can no longer wear, a clutch purse, and two brand new reusable ziploc bags (the washable, $10 a piece kind).  That may not sound like a lot, but I'm an undergrad college student that worked an unpaid internship this semester.  One of the bags was even stuffed into the very bottom of my double-zipped book bag and on a low lying table...I came down one morning to find it pulled off the table onto the floor with both zippers open and the ziploc bag demolished.  This cat eats plastic, yes.  All kinds.  I can't leave my bedroom door open for even a minute because they'll get under my bed and start eating things that I am trying to keep protected.  I can't leave my belongings downstairs besides books and things because they will get chewed up.  I can't even eat in peace because of the incessant meowing, prancing around the tables and counters, and one of the cats will literally steal the food off of your plate if you get up from the table to go 10 feet into the kitchen for a moment.

I am at my wits end, despite the fact that my landlord/roommate has done her best to try to train the cats.  My main issue is that I start all distance education courses in the end of May as I finish up my undergrad degree this summer and I will need a peaceful place to study.  Here I can't even peacefully study anywhere besides my room because one of the cats repeatedly bangs the cabinet door that hold their food as he tries to open it.  It has a kiddy lock on it but that doesn't stop him.  He also noisily vomits up the plastic he eats pretty regularly.  My dilemma is that my lease isn't up until over a month after I start classes, and given the intensity of summer courses it would be extremely stressful to try and move in the middle of them.  And I seriously don't think I can last until the end of my lease with these cats...I really am miserable and am not feeling safe or comfortable in my own home.  I apologize for the long rant, but I want you to understand that I am not just a crazy cat-hater.  I love cats and these cats are just insane with their behavioral problems.  

I've told her how I feel and that I would like to terminate my lease early, but she said she is still going to hold me responsible for payment of rent unless I find a subleaser.  I looked through my lease agreement and it does say under a section, ""Quiet enjoyment.  Tenant, upon payment of all of the sums referred to herein as being payable by Tenant and Tenant's performance of all Tenant's performance of all Tenant's agreements contained herein and Tenant's observance of all rules and regulations, shall and may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof.""  Does that mean anything?  Has she violated her agreement as landlord by putting animals in the home after the beginning of my lease that disrupt my ability to leave peacefully and quietly?

Can I do anything at all here or am I just going to have to suck it up?  Any insight or help would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** My landlord acquired two cats since the beginning of my lease and they have become incredibly destructive and disruptive, including doing monetary damage to my belongings that I have not been reimbursed for.  Do I have any options as far as terminating the lease early and moving out because as they are interfering with my right as a Tenant to ""peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof""?"

At the beginning of the semester, we get a list of ""Sponsored Projects"", which are essentially semester long assignments for a customer.

I later find out that these customers are companies that pay the university $8,000 to have their project put in the list for a semester. Then the students pay thousands of dollars to enroll in the class, and work as programmers for the companies for the semester.

My question is this: Is it really legal for the university to accept payment from both sides of this transaction? It almost seems like they are selling our work without us getting any cut. Is this an opportunity I'm taking for granted? Is this common in CS programs across the country?

I've already had an internship for a couple years so the idea of doing the same work but paying out of my pocket to do it makes me feel like I'm being cheated."
scbib,7,2012-04-16,Australian biomedical science student wanting to do an internship (or some such thing) overseas. Does anybody know how I could go about applying?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/scbib/australian_biomedical_science_student_wanting_to/,"Hi guys, I thought this was the best subreddit for my question. As I said, I'm an Australian biomedical science student in the fourth year of my degree. At the end of this year, I'll have had one year of experience working in a laboratory. I'd love to apply to do an internship overseas, as I know that some universities have those kinds of programs for students, but have no idea how to go about applying. I've asked around at my university, but they haven't been very helpful, so I thought I might have more luck asking some overseas students such as yourselves if you knew of such a program. 


I've been working my ass off this year, however (unfortunately) I only realized I *really* wanted to stick with science and do research until it was too late. Meaning that I had plans to go off and get another degree after I was finished with this one and never look back. I developed my passion too late. As such, my GPA stands at about 2.6, or something equally as depressing. I'm really annoyed with myself as I know that this will impact my chances of universities accepting me for any sort of project they have. I feel like I'm at a disadvantage and need to make up for the time I wasted not doing research or making connections in my early university years. 

I guess my questions are

* Do any of your know of a university who runs these types of programs?

* How would I go about applying? I've looked on the internet for a bit and all I've learned is that I should apply to the lab I'm interested in directly, instead of going through the administrative channels.

* Would my year of research experience make up for my incredibly average GPA?

* If I can't get past the GPA issue, is there anything I could put on my resume to help me stand out?

Just as a side note, my main interests are in neurogenetics/neurogenomics, intelligence, consciousness, stem cell research and genetics. I enjoy...building things. "

sc4y2,60,2012-04-16,What is the number one problem with the U.S. education system?,PirateLogic,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sc4y2/what_is_the_number_one_problem_with_the_us/,"This may have been asked before, but I couldn't find it, and I'm curious to know what reddit thinks. To get things started, I'll say this:

The state of the U.S. education system has always infuriated me. There are so many issues and it seems that there is no consensus on where we should start. Because nobody else could figure it out, one genius came forward and threw out this gem: Children are failing at school, so we obviously need to make it easier.

My biggest problem with the U.S. education system is that students aren't being held responsible for their laziness and lack of effort. Officials are dumbing the system down and making everything easier to get students to pass. Students are catching on to this – whether they realize it or not – and it's making them become incredibly lazy. The parents, in turn, go to the principle and blame the school who blames the teacher for being too hard on the student. This vicious circle repeats it self and the entire system cracks a little bit more during each cycle. 

The fact of the matter is that students aren't being held responsible for what is, more than likely, their own fault. Of course there are situations where it is legitimately not the student's fault, but it seems to be the popular reaction for parents to blame others for their child's failures before having all of the facts.

Another problem is that everyone is scared of their child's feelings being hurt. Name calling seems to be such a big deal these days; one student calls another student a slut and the next day both parents are in the principles office having a shouting match. A much more efficient solution would be for both students to grow up. Children in our country are being babied to the point that they can't take care of themselves while we all just sit by and let it happen. Why don't we do something about it?

I'm a computer science student and I feel very strongly about the state of our country's education system. It saddens me to realize that there is no hope of fixing the numerous other problems we have if we can't even educate the country's adolescents. I feel that everyone should have something they feel strongly about and my goal for next summer is to get an internship at a company like [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). For those of you who don't know about Khan Academy, it is an alternative, open learning platform for students who aren't satisfied with their current education. Maybe my impact on the overall problem will be minimal, but at least I'll be doing something, as opposed to talking about it.

What say you, reddit?

**TL;DR** The U.S. education system sucks. Why?"
sc4da,4,2012-04-16,Should I stay an extra year? ,anonymousperson12345,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/sc4da/should_i_stay_an_extra_year/,"Okay so I am approaching the time when I have to decide what to do for the rest of my undergraduate time. I have the requirements to enroll in the health science program, which is necessary to complete my major. However, the conditions of getting into the program is that I have to graduate right after I complete the program. I cannot stay an extra semester (for this undergraduate degree) to take any more classes - that means no additional minors, majors, anything. (This is what the academic adviser told me. Correct me if I am wrong.) So now I have to think about whether I should delay my graduation for an entire year since the program begins in fall only. I just do not know if it is worth staying an entire year to finish recommended requirements for graduate school which I do not know if I even want to attend in the first place. However, I also feel like I am not emotionally prepared for graduation. On a professional level, I lack internships and job experience. On a personal level, I felt like I never got to truly enjoy college. I am a transfer student so my experience had been mostly stressful, from disliking my old school, the process of transferring schools, and the adjustment period to Stony Brook. Perhaps an additional year could give me some time to actually enjoy college. So in summary, the pros/cons list I came up with for staying an extra year is: 

pros 
- more time for internships/jobs 
- more time to enjoy college
- take the classes I possibly need for graduate school and maybe some other classes I want to take for myself 
- will be much more ready for graduation and the future in general
- can complete a minor

cons 
- $ (The financial aid adviser said I would qualify for a pell grant in my 5th year. However, I am not in EOP so I will not get TAP for my fifth year. I do have plans however to maybe find a place to live off-campus and of course, to get a job.) 
- time 

I am in a pretty tight spot now so any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time. "

seu1v,0,2012-04-17,Been Charged with possession as a minor for the second time. Whats going to happen to me? ,mackncheeseyx,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/seu1v/been_charged_with_possession_as_a_minor_for_the/,"
I tried posting this to /r/legaladvice but with no prevail. 

Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

 Sincerely, A Very Scared Redditor

sepxq,14,2012-04-17,The Benefits of Personal Networking:  How I Got to Play with a Professional Laser-Effects System While Drunk,Chalcedon,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/sepxq/the_benefits_of_personal_networking_how_i_got_to/,"*I actually emailed this story to my brother a day ago, and I've rewritten it for here (names obscured, mostly, some details added for background).  It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.  It's also a solid example of:  ""It's all in who you know.""*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

senxx,0,2012-04-17,"going abroad this summer, looking for an ultraportable around 400€",allasui,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/senxx/going_abroad_this_summer_looking_for_an/," Hello,

I'll do an internship abroad this summer and I am looking for a laptop that I could bring with me

 General Questions

1) What is your budget?


around **400€**


2) What size notebook would you prefer?


 **Ultraportable**; 11"" - 12” screen


3) Where will you buying this notebook? 


France


4) Are there any brands that you prefer or any you really don't like?

essentially** multimedia** (movies, musics...), **internet** and why not some **light/retro gaming**


7) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places, leaving it on your desk or both?


As I said before I would bring it with me when I will be travelling but once I'm set up there I don't think I would be moving with it very often


8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so, please state which games or types of games?


I would play with whatever my computer can do, but at least TF2 or N64 will at least be not a problem for actual ultraportable?
 

9) How many hours of battery life do you need?

a good performance/battery life price, but it is **not a crucial point** for me

10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?

both will not be a problem

11) What OS do you prefer? Windows 7

Notebook Components

17) How much hard drive space do you need; 80GB to 640GB? Do you want a SSD drive?

SSD drive is not required and I have an external drive of 1Tb so I guess that I would **not** need** a big hard drive**

18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a CDRW/DVD-ROM, DVD Burner or Blu-Ray drive?

not really

seipw,1,2012-04-17,"Charged second time for Possession as a minor. What should I do, and what is going to happen to me?",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/seipw/charged_second_time_for_possession_as_a_minor/,"Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

 Sincerely, A Very Scared Redditor

sebis,3,2012-04-17,I'd like to hear r/compsci about Model-Driven Architecture/Development,huhuh11,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/sebis/id_like_to_hear_rcompsci_about_modeldriven/,"Hi,

My question is not really technical/in-depth but more about the general philosophy of things. I am currently working as a research intern on a big project that aims at providing industrial actors with an environment for developing critical embedded systems. 

Typically, the company can input its own domain-specific modeling languages and generate a whole lot of tools like code editor, graphical editor, simulator, code generator, etc... from their metamodels.

For those of you who are not familiar with MDA/MDD, i'll use the definitions from [modeling-languages.com](http://modeling-languages.com)
&gt;MBE (model-based engineering) process is a process in which software models play an important role although they are not necessarily the key artifacts of the development (i.e. they do NOT “drive” the process as in MDD)

&gt;MDD is a development paradigm that uses models as the primary artifact of the development process.

&gt;MDA is the OMG’s particular vision of MDD and thus relies on the use of OMG standards. Therefore, MDA can be regarded as a subset of MDD

I would like to know from anyone involved in the computer science field / software engineering what are your thoughts on MDA/MDD ? Do you think it will become more popular as tools develop, or will it only stick to critical embedded software ? What are your experiences with it?

Also, it is hard to talk about MDA/MDD without mentioning UML or a subset of UML which may often be one of the concerned domain-specific modeling languages. Specifically, what do you think of UML's idea of trying to do everything ? I'm talking about the possibility of execution of UML activity diagrams and/or of UML state machine diagrams.

Thanks for your input !"

(AKA am I screwed?),jamaljermaine,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/sdygo/q_did_any_of_you_graduate_without_any_internship/,"As the title says, I'm wondering if any of you graduated without any sort of internship experience and I'm curious about how that turned out for you. I'm a Junior at a University very well known for its CS program, and each day as summer draws closer and I still have yet to hear back from any prospective internship employers (wasn't excellent at applying, did poorly in some interviews due to nerves).  I have a 3.4 technical GPA (freshman year was bad for me, but this isn't absolutely awful considering the school average) and I'm wondering how difficult it is to find work after graduating given that you have no work experience whatsoever.  

Even if I do secure an internship this late (school ends in a month) I would be sacrificing a family vacation to various parts of Asia like Taiwan/Japan, which is an experience that I would love to have.

Essentially I'm asking for stories and advice: Assuming I do get an offer, would you say the internship experience is more valuable than a trip with my family to the other side of the world? Assuming I don't get an internship, would you recommend summer courses to remove a humanities requirement so I can focus more on my academia, trying to get Research with a professor (unlikely grad school, but always a possibility), or trying to find some sort of open source project which I hear is also good to do (though I wouldn't even have any idea where to begin or what to do)?

I used to work for Universal Studios in Orlando.  I lost my job for doing something stupid that was entirely my fault, and I hate myself for it.  I wish I could remove the happy memories from my mind, because all they do is mock me now.  My childhood was terrible, abuse at home and abuse at school.  My Dad used to beat the shit out of my mom, and my mom would passively take it out on me.  At school, I don't know why the other kids hated me.  I still don't know. Those that didn't didn't bully or ridicule me ignored me, which is just as cruel.  Teachers and Principals didn't do shit to help either.  If I told my parents, my mom would come to the school and raise hell, but that only saved me for a few days.  The teachers would lecture or punish my abusers for a few days, but in the end they always went back to their apathy to my problems.  My classmates' cruelty knew no bounds and when my father died of cancer, they smelled blood and tore into the fresh emotional wound like piranhas.  

  All I've ever wanted is to be accepted, to feel loved.  It hurts bad, real bad.  

All my life I've been obsessed with theme parks.  My childhood dream was to design attractions for Disney or Universal.  As soon as I got out of high school, I signed up for an internship program at Walt Disney World in Orlando.  It included housing.  I thought I was beginning a new life and leaving the pain of my childhood behind.  The pain only continued.  I was terrible at my job, because it relied on social skills, which I severely lack.  Being bullied and abused for 20 years will do that to you.

  I was a driver at Kilimanjaro Safaris at Animal Kingdom. I loved that job dearly, and found that ""theming"", a form of acting that theme park workers use to immerse guests in the story of the attraction was something I was good at.  It gave me confidence, but it had a side effect.  I loved that job, but I took it too seriously for my co-workers tastes.  I was obsessed with it and felt like my co-workers were half-assing it.  It was the only thing that mattered to me, and that combined with my lack of social skills drove a wedge between my them and I.  I excelled at driving the truck and acting, but as far as actual customer service went, I was pathetic.  I couldn't deal with conflict at all and stressed out easily.  I made it most of the six months, but I was fired with a week to go over a verbal altercation with another employee.  It wasn't my first.  I have re-applied several times, but I'm pretty sure my managers have made sure that I'll never work for Disney again.  My first adult taste of rejection and the heartbreak that comes with it.  I went back to live with my family in Tampa a broken man.

Fast forward three years to the summer of 2009.  I landed another ""dream"" gig in Orlando at Universal Studios.  I started as a Halloween Horror Nights actor, something I had dreamed of doing since childhood.  Again, a wedge formed between my co-workers and I as I took my job too seriously for their tastes.  I gave it 100% every minute I was doing my job, and felt again that my co-workers didn't put in half the effort I was.  A few even tried explaining it to me, saying that to them it was just a job and that they didn't feel like trying so hard.  To me, that was akin to blasphemy.  My superiors were always glowing in their reviews of my performance, but ""Actor of the Year"" went to one of the social butterflies that had tried to convince me to ""tone it down"".  I was livid, but held my tongue.  

   I then applied for transfer to Jaws, as it was an acting role that I felt was well suited to my talents.  I had already found kindred spirits at the attraction, people that had the same level of enthusiasm for the job as I.  Unfortunately, I wound up as far as I could get from my beloved Jaws filling an HR quota at Jurassic Park River Adventure. 

  I once again gave it my all, as I'd been a fan of the movies and books.  There though, I again was met by co-workers that didn't care about their jobs.  They just stood there and barely put any enthusiasm into it.  I gave it my heart and soul, just like I'd done so many times before.  It took a few months, but they eventually started to like me there.  I was regarded as quirky and while I had a few detractors, I found a niche and was regarded as a member of the team.  They accepted me, and I accepted them.  I learned to do my job at my level, and made great strides in the social skills department as well.  My customer service was regarded as some of the best even.  I figured I had finally put the demons of my past behind me.  

   One of my co-workers shared my passion for ""the industry"", as we called it.  We eventually became roommates.  As he was popular with the staff of our ride, that made me popular too.  I was invited to parties.  I had dates.  I was socializing normally for the first time in my life.  Life was good, but it caught up to me.  

   One day, after a night of partying I took my roommie's morning shift on my day off as he had a hangover.  I was generally hangover proof, but I hadn't gotten hardly any sleep.  I was assigned an observation post.  Basically, I was to sit there and watch the ride.  I fell asleep.

   A manager caught me, and that was that.  My beloved job was gone.  I fell into back into a suicidal depression that had been plaguing me since before I can remember, at least childhood.  The only times that depression has gone away was while I was at Disney and while I was at Universal, as my job was equal parts demanding and satisfying.  Once I had a social life I forgot all about it, and thought that I had beat it. I fell into abusing drugs as a coping mechanism.  Nothing hard, just weed, but it didn't help matters. I lived off my savings for three months.  My roommates were understanding as long as I had money for the bills.  They must have seen the handwriting on the wall, but said nothing.  The party invites stopped coming.  I isolated myself as my roommates went on with their lives.  Instead of job hunting, I'd get high solo and play video games.  Eventually, the money ran out.  My roommates gave me a month to get things going, but by then I was so depressed and suicidal that I was going days without leaving my room.  They did what they had to do, and I moved back to Tampa with some old friends.  I got a job and got back on my feet.  I was doing fine until the 7-11 I was working at laid me off when a franchisee bought the store.  It also didn't help that a longtime friend who was also struggling with depression committed suicide.  My depression doubled on itself, as the job hunt, which I threw myself at failed.  After three weeks, I was back to getting stoned in my room and the video games.  One night I came clean to my mother that I was suicidal.  She took me to the hospital straight away.

Psych Units aren't anything like what they show on TV.  It was a rather therapeutic experience, and a revealing one.  I was unable to forgive myself for losing my job.  I still can't.  Even with nifty new anti-depressants, I still can't get over it, which is why I'm posting here.  My few friends have been distant, since they found out where I spent a week and a half.  I now live in a house my mom owns with a pair of alcoholics for roommates.  I am again isolating myself, as I can't stand their behavior.  I'm still unemployed.  I'm not suicidal anymore, but the depression is still pretty nasty.  I sleep a lot and I don't get out much.  Now and then I go back to my happy memories of my experiences and the friends I met along the way, but tonight they've been mocking me like demons.

If you read all this, thanks you.  It does feel good to get things off my chest, but my life still hurts.

sdpev,0,2012-04-17,Cover letter help,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sdpev/cover_letter_help/,"So, I am redoing my cover letter. It use to be a template with about 4 paragraphs, a big read. It has given me a few interviews, but for internships, so now that I am graduating from Software Engineering, I am not sure if this will suffice. I heard that sending a generic template usually doesn't work, so I am going to try something non-generic.

I have been reading some example tips, some of them have been slumbering for many years on reddit. A few quotes that I like and probably use are
&gt; I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I'm the best candidate for your ... position

I wouldn't mind using something like this, however, I wouldn't want to say ""best"" as I know I am not the best, I am probably average, no CS coder. And saying I'm a average candidate, well, no. Perhaps excellent, it doesn't have that over confident and naive sound especially coming from a recent grad.

&gt;with an outstanding work ethic

I would love to say this, it can be true at times, I work for 10+ hours, but either because what I am doing is very interesting to me, or that it's due very soon and I have nothing done yet. Just now I went on Reddit for resume tips and the first few hours it was just checking the top stories and then start working on my cover letter, so I can get off track if I am bored.
Mainly I don't like to overstate my abilities (like saying I am the best at something), although I wouldn't want to understate them as well. Or lying about my abilities, as I know they will come back at me if I do get a job.

Do I also need to make a new cover letter for each job? Or at least have the main stuff similar, but just change around words such as Company X to Company Y, and I want a job as a X to Y.

I took an example from Fuzebox13 in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/admbw/for_the_unemployed_redditors_are_you_tired_of/) post.

Ill submit what I have now, any comments or wording changes?

&gt;I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I am an excellent candidate for your Software Developer position. I am a keen worker and I am interested in challenging problems. I know Java, C, C++, plus several other languages and I can learn new concepts quickly. My experience may be lacking a little, but not my ambition.
&gt;
&gt;My final design project was to integrate an RFID module on wireless sensor nodes to authenticate and communicate with a handheld. I lead the software development with another group member as well as managing the groups schedule. I had to research TinyOS and nesC in order to implement the software as well as my group mate. I realized that my group mate wasn't doing much work, so I had to pick up the slack, and I finished it, all.

&gt;We can further discuss why I am an excellent candidate for your software developer position at the interview. I can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Thank you, and I look forward to the opportunity.

Ever since I can remember I've had trouble with my weight. Even when I look back at photos of when I was 6-8 years old, i've always been round. I live in Florida, so body image is something i really was conscious about, and was really embarrassed. In HS I always got by b/c of my good grades and I never showed in public that the jokes actually effected me, but they did. Anyways, when I got to college, I decided to get fit and go the gym. Everything was going great my first year, but then i had hand surgery and ballooned to my worst shape ever as in the picture below. The combo of pain meds, terrible diet, depression from losing results i had worked so hard to achieve, on top of the stress of class and funding my education became overwhelming. 

What really changed it all was when I got a summer internship in Charlotte, NC, last summer. I was fed up! I hated the way I looked, the way I felt, and thought THIS would be the perfect opportunity to start fresh: new friends, new coworkers, new opportunities! I worked downtown and found a gym literally 50 feet form work where all the people at my company went to. I buckled down, created a diet for myself, and went to the gym almost religiously. After a great summer I went from 195 to 175 and felt AMAZING!!! I had so much confidence, bought new clothes and was on a whole different level. 

I cam back to school for my senior year of college and unfortunately fell into some bad habits including going out for dinner and drinks with friends, and wasn't as motivated to go the gym. Fall semester I put back on about 5 lbs. Once I saw results fading again, I was infuriated with myself. NO WAY I WAS GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN! During winter break I signed up at a local gym and since December have lost another 15 lbs, down to 165. 

Just wanted to say that reading /r/loseit and /r/fitness has been all the inspiration in the world and I wanted to say thank you!

In December 2010 I got really into Android development and released 2 apps so far, one paid and one free. To my surprise, both achieved a reasonable success, and right now, after the initial boom, they bring enough money to make a decent living.

The dilemma I'm facing right now is whether to, as everyone else, find a normal programming job, or maybe pursue the freelance path from the very beginning.

I'm very close to the latter option, because I can always - in case of failure - start looking for a normal job. 
But imagine this scenario - I graduate, start making more Android apps and games, and after a year or two I run out of ideas/money, so I start looking for a job. It is worth noting at this point, that I have no real world programming experience (my bad, I know, but I was stupid and didn't look for any internships). So my situation is quite bad in this case - only freelancing experience, year or two after graduation...

Is it worth the risk?"

So I get a call from one of the partners at the PR firm I used to work at. She was an older woman, good at her job but TERRIBLE with computers. That said, she had become reliant on her Blackberry calendar to keep things in order. And she had A TON of calendar entries - stuff she wasn't even going to but wanted to keep track of.

She had an assistant who would plug in all of her hand written calendar appointments into her outlook calender.

Well, her assistant was going on her honeymoon and god forbid this lady learn how to make a calendar entry, so we assigned an intern to manage her schedule for the duration.

So back to the call I got.... she was frantic that her phone alarm had gone off several times during the night and she could not figure out why.

I go to her desk, look at her phone, and I noticed that there were upwards of 10 events scheduled between the hours of 9pm and 6am. It turns out that intern didn't know that you could schedule two things concurrently on a calendar. So, in his infinite wisdom, he assumed tha if something needed to be added at 3pm, and there was already something listed for that time, he would just schedule it for 3am, with a note saying ""*Actually 3:00 PM"".

So I'm a graduating college senior with a half-decent GPA and a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a pretty prestigious (and unfortunately expensive) engineering school. I am also 6 credits shy of completing my masters, and have over 2.5 years of relevant engineering internship experience.

My non-academic accomplishments include founding, and acting as chairman for 4 years of my school's chapter of College Republicans as well as serving on the state board for CRs in an executive position.

I am also a member, and part of the executive boards, of the Archery and Riflery teams.

I do not hide these facts, nor am I ashamed of it. They showcase me as a well rounded individual, and show leadership, as well as a good deal of philanthropy (because of all the charity work I've done with several organizations - especially the CRs)


I have been advised by the office of career development not to remove any of this information - for the aforementioned reasons. I know the economy sucks, and the job market is awful, but I can't help but think that, in today's politically charged climate, it may actually be hurting me.

I know that not hiring me because of my political affiliation or sporting activities is discrimination, but I'm not one to make waves, nor would I really be able to prove that methinks.



Can any HR folks, managers, career development personnel, people who see similar things, etc... comment on this?



tl;dr - hold leadership positions in political and other ""non-pleasant"" affiliated clubs at school, and thinking of removing that info from my resume.




**Note - I am not here to debate anyone regarding politics, guns, or anything else. I put the affiliation there in good faith that the good folks of r/askreddit can look past it for a moment and discuss my situation.**

**Edit-** Thanks for the responses guys. It seems pretty split, but the leadership part does seem to be winning over the ""keep politics out of the office"". I appreciate the insight, and look forward to reading more as more comments come in."

We need to talk about shill intern spam. We have had a few discussions about the ""adventures in poor taste"" network and divvvy/fappytaffy, both of which get spammed by shill marketing interns. Personally, I find people ""gaming"" reddit to be disgusting and infuriating, so I am writing this post.

Recently we had a x-post from r/hotties. If you check out r/hotties you will see that it is a small new subreddit with 6 moderators. If you follow the histories of them, the majority of the links you will find posted lead to the AIPT network or divvvy/fappytaffy or some other cable-outlet web site like MTV. They link to the ""other subreddits we enjoy"", a single link going to r/popcult, a subreddit with almost the same moderator crew and less than 300 readers. It is my unsubstantiated theory that the accounts associated with these reddits are being run by a single user. 

You may recognize some of the mods in question:

terrayze (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

kellenwelker (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

winback099 (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

**In other words, the entire r/hotties subreddit is a shill link farm.**

I will not allow x-posts to them. Furthermore, I am posting this to inform the subscribers of this subreddit (some of whom visit or moderate similar subs) that this is happening. I have x-linked this post to r/reportthespammers. I really love what reddit can be, and the communities it allows us to build. Spamming links for off-site ad ridden content breaks reddit. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

TL;DR: I think r/hotties and r/popcult are shill link farm subreddits, being run by a moderator ""crew"" that links primarily to (stolen content on) their own sites. Your feedback is appreciated. "

So, a few months ago I asked here about how to do a ponytail for my shoulder length, curly hair. Keep in mind that I am a guy, so I had no idea what I was doing...

Anyway, fast forward a few months and I'm wearing it almost ever day, not just when I have to wear it for my internship, and now, I've noticed something. My scalp is looking pretty red in the mornings after I've put up my hair into a ponytail. I haven't changed shampoos or anything, nor have I gotten a lot of sun recently for a sunburn. 

Also, when I do have my ponytail up, it feels very, very heavy. So when I tilt my head forward, lets say too look at a test on my desk, I can feel the ponytail dragging me down, almost as if its pulling my hair out, and it is a very uncomfortable sensation.

So, what I really want to know is, how can i prevent my ponytail from hurting me? I enjoy the style and people have complimented me on how I look with it, but I don't want to keep doing this if it hurts this bad.

**TL;DR** - Ponytail hurts after I put it up in the morning and my scalp is becoming increasingly red in color.

Brief Background about Myself: I was initially pursuing art/design, but couldn't leave my interest in Computer Science alone. I want to pursue an education in Computer Science while I'm younger and spend the rest of my years applying my CS degree to a more artistic direction e.g. Front End Development, Game Design/Programming, UX/UI, or Human Computer Interaction. I might even do grad school in such fields.

I'm currently a community college student, and I've been accepted into two state schools.

School A known for its Computer Science program than School B. With that in mind, School A requires more Math and Physics classes, which will take me a longer time to finish my degree. I'm certain about this extended amount of time because I struggle in math and science which tends to lead me to retake classes. I wouldn't say my struggle isn't a stress free experience--I work hard to pass my classes, but it does affect my social life and my free time, which I could be using to have a part time job/internship. (Although I must admit, that I do use my free time to learn web development, SEO strategies, and web design.)

I'm at a point right now where I want to graduate and apply CS in an artistic way. I see School A the benefits School A will give me in terms of internships, connections, ""name branding"", but I see how School B gives me the benefit of time. I would finish my degree quickly in comparison of School A, test the waters in the job world, and then pursue further schooling if I still want it--oh, can't forget less debt as well.

What do you guys think? Is it worth spending maybe 5-6 more years at School A or to finish my degree at School B within 3 years?

I already have a job as a software engineer that pays enough for me to be comfortable where I am now so I'm curious if I can expect the same in NYC. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, getting a full time position with a Department of Defense contractor where I worked as an intern for two years while I worked on my degree, so I already have experience in a professional environment which I hope can give me an edge applying for an entry level software engineer job.

Doing the math, it appears I would need a salary of $80,000 (pre-tax) to live comfortably in NYC, this is assuming that rent is only 30% of my expenses (assuming about $1700 a month) but I realize the reality may be that I spend nearly half of my income on rent if I make less than that and/or I am underestimating the cost of studio within the city. Am I right in shooting for this salary if I want to live comfortably here? When I say comfortably, I mean that I have a roof over my head within the city and money to go out every once in a while and I'm not counting pennies at the end of the month. The more important question is if this is what I can expect companies to be offering for entry level software engineer jobs, and if not, what should I be expecting?"

It says full time, however, it is open to rising seniors or graduate students (who I would assume would be in school).  I will be only in school for 12 hours in the Fall and for only 2 days of the week, so I will be available much of the time needed, but I didn't know if maybe they were expecting something else.

Also, I will be gone for a month and a half soon to go on a study abroad.  This wasn't an issue with my last job as it is obviously an enriching experience, but now that the date is approaching soon... I would essentially be hired and leave.  I know I need to bring this up, and I would entirely understand the effect it would have on me getting this internship... but, I want this internship very badly.

Finally, I don't have the specific degree they are looking for but it is unfortunately not offered at my school, and I am definitely intending on going to graduate school for it. I know this would be something to come up in the interview, but if I am to contact them beforehand, I didn't know if it would be worthwhile bringing up.

Should I contact the employer ahead of time, or wait to see if I get an interview and bring it up then?  I simply do not want to seem deceiving, yet at the same time I do not want to lay a lot of issues on the employer before they even get a chance to call me in for an interview.

Thank you for any advice!"

I've got an internship here with Chevron for this summer (Louisiana st. office), and was curious if anyone had any recommendations for places to live or avoid. I had communication issues with the coordinators and virtually everywhere they recommended is full. Any craigslist listings I've tried haven't led anywhere either. I've got about four or five days to find somewhere, since I'll be doing field work for the following two weeks.

I have some prospects in East Downtown, and one in Katy which would require a commute (don't have a car) but I've heard horror stories of the public transportation. Thanks for the help everyone. Looking forward to getting down here!"

sfcaa,3,2012-04-17,Extend my time in school or transfer from community college and quickly finish up my degree at a lesser known school?,yearningpotential,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sfcaa/extend_my_time_in_school_or_transfer_from/,"Brief Background about Myself: I was initially pursuing art/design, but couldn't leave my interest in Computer Science alone.  I want to pursue an education in Computer Science while I'm younger and spend the rest of my years applying my CS degree to a more artistic direction e.g. Front End Development, Game Design/Programming, UX/UI, or Human Computer Interaction.  I might even do grad school in such fields.

---

I'm currently a community college student, and I've been accepted into two state schools.  

School A known for its Computer Science program than School B. With that in mind, School A requires more Math and Physics classes, which will take me a longer time to finish my degree. I'm certain about this extended amount of time because I struggle in math and science which tends to lead me to retake classes.  I wouldn't say my struggle isn't a stress free experience--I work hard to pass my classes, but it does affect my social life and my free time, which I could be using to have a part time job/internship.  (Although I must admit, that I do use my free time to learn web development, SEO strategies, and web design.)

I'm at a point right now where I want to graduate and apply CS in an artistic way.  I see School A the benefits School A will give me in terms of internships, connections, ""name branding"", but I see how School B gives me the benefit of time.  I would finish my degree quickly in comparison of School A, test the waters in the job world, and then pursue further schooling if I still want it--oh, can't forget less debt as well.

What do you guys think?  Is it worth spending maybe 5-6 more years at School A or to finish my degree at School B within 3 years?

sfags,5,2012-04-17,Will things ever get better? (Long post. I'm sorry.),[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/sfags/will_things_ever_get_better_long_post_im_sorry/,"My life has been nothing but painful coincidences since 7th Grade. Here's a summary:

7th grade- change schools from very small, conservative, family-run Christian school where I know everyone to far larger and more liberal school where I literally only knew 5 people, parents get divorced, nervous breakdown, essentially wipe my personality and start over.

8th grade-terrible story gets out about me for no good reason, people I thought were my friends turned against me, mocking and bullying carried on until around junior year, I still carry the emotional scars, another nervous breakdown and diagnosed with OCD.

9th grade- I've pretty much intentionally blacked this year out of my memory due to intense bullying.

10th grade- bullying starts going away, start making more friends, get involved in theater, I was given charge of the school's comedy team, things start lightening up.

11th grade- to date, best year of my life. I had a quasi-girlfriend (we never really made it official and to date my only ""real relationship""), I was the lead in the musical with my best friends. The comedy team was made fun of a lot, though, which hurt.

12th grade- apply to and get accepted at my dream college, which at times I feel like I only attended to give the finger to my family, I get an offer to apply for an internship at College Humor (as a senior!), and then my grandfather, who was the single largest influence of my life, gets diagnosed with cancer, given 6 months to a year. He sees me graduate, and dies two weeks before I move out. I'm left with almost no friends from high school and a bleak future for college.

Freshman year of college: Still reeling from my grandfather's death, I stay in my room almost all year. I try out for and fail at every audition I come across for various comedy teams and singing groups, even though I assumed that my comedy and theatrical experience is what got me into the school in the first place. My radio show flops horribly, so I jump onto another and save it from sinking. Grades are alright, but I have absolutely no friends. Also, on the home front, ugliness stirs up in my church about forcing our pastor, whom my family is very close to, out of his job.

Sophomore year (present): Again, fail at every comedy/singing audition I come across, and now my current radio show is getting stuck in a rut as my character is being dramatically reduced. Still know no one I would consider a friend. My pastor resigns under duress (he did nothing wrong, just very petty people wanted him gone), throwing my church community into a mess. I get into one show, which goes alright, but now my grades are plummeting and currently in freefall as I don't know how to save them.

I'm applying for College Humor again, but that's still very up in the air. The internship process is very long and confusing even if I do get in. And if I do, I'll probably be forced to pass up a once-in-a-lifetime family trip.

I have no friends, my grades are failing, I'm possibly going to lose two great opportunities (one for the third time), and my family has enough of their own problems to deal with without me adding to the pile. I'm just tired of every good thing in my life being met with equal or greater negativity. Will I ever have a moment in my life where things will go well? Will I ever find friends? Lovers? Will I ever get a job? Will the things that go badly for me finally stop being more frequent than the good things?

As I'm typing this, I realize a lot of this may seem quite petty and childish, but it does weigh very heavily on me. I still carry a great deal of shame, sadness, and fears from being bullied so much as a kid that my self-confidence has never really come back. I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time. I'm sure you have more important things to attend to."
sf79v,0,2012-04-17,[Short Story] She Once Had Me,Glussell,LitWorkshop,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitWorkshop/comments/sf79v/short_story_she_once_had_me/,"I hate this song, really I do.  It sends me to a dark, naive place. I really should have known better.

“*...my belle.  Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble.  Très bien ensemble.*”  sings the unmistakable voice of Paul McCartney as I sink lower and lower into my chair.

It didn't always used to be like this.  It used to be my favourite song.  Now I just pretend. 

“*That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way*”  the radio continues to torture me.

Let's see, where do I start?

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

My apologies.  This must be too much for you.  I forget how little you know of this.  Allow me to back up just a little bit.

She first appeared in my life one September.  She was introduced to the whole staff at my office as our new intern.  She was wearing a skirt that came part way up her thigh.  She had her blonde hair clipped back in a professional yet innocent way.  She awkwardly stood up as the boss went on about her role in our company.  She let her eyes meet mine.  She seemed to calm ever so slightly.  She went on about how much she loved and respected what we were doing.  She was so eager to make a difference.  She had all the energy that we imagine ourselves possessing in the forgotten years of our youth.

I knew that I had to meet her.  I pushed passed my colleagues to get to her first.  I extended my right hand and told her my name and she told me hers.  I laughed when she said that all of her friends called her Claire Bear.  I think that my voice cracked a bit when I told her that she could ask me if she ever needed help.  I know that my mind raced when she said that she would take me up on that offer.  I felt so excited.  I felt so awkward.  I felt like I remembered feeling when I was her age.

There were countless moments that took place over the next few weeks between Claire and I.  The lingering smiles, the coincidental lunch breaks, the accidental contacts, the perplexing flirtations.  I could go on about each one forever.  But I doubt that you have time for that.

One day while I was sitting down with a friend from work.  Somehow, we got to talking about Claire.  I am sure that I brought her up.  

“You two seem to be spending a lot of time together.”  He commented.  He was probably right.  “She's cute.  But what about...”

“But nothing.  Her and I are just friends.  Besides she's too young.”  I interrupted.

“She's not much younger than you are.  She's 21.  That's only eight years younger than you are.”

I wish he had never said that.

After I  passed into my late-twenties I seem to forget how young I actually am.  I have somehow become both ignorant of my age and self-conscious of it.  Somehow though Claire seemed young to me.  Was she full of exuberance or was I lacking in it?  Am I old enough to have been crushed by the weight of the world?

Or maybe it is just that the past four years of my life have been very eventful.  But I guess you know all about that.

Sorry, I digress.  To the point.

Our office was having a party some Friday night.  I can't remember what it was for.  Was it someone's birthday?  Or retirement?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

Naturally I got talking to Claire.  I don't remember about what really.  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

At an infrequent pause in our conversation the music caught our attention.  A song by The Beatles came on.  Was it “Twist and Shout”?  Or was it “Day Tripper”?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

“I love The Beatles” she said.

“Oh yeah, what's your favourite song?” I asked.  Had it been anyone else I probably would have said “Who doesn't?”.

“Norwegian Wood” she answered without an ounce of hesitation.

“Very good.”  I responded “I love Rubber Soul, I think it's their best work.  I think that my favourite song is 'Michelle'”

I didn't tell her why.  Oh how I should have.

The rest of the night we were glued together, talking about everything we could think of, but especially music.  As the night began to end, she cracked up some excuse to invite me to her place.  I think it was so she could show me her CD collection.  I didn't think to just ask to look at her iPod.

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

When we arrived at her place, naturally we put on Rubber Soul.  I fiddled with my left hand while we talked through “Drive My Car”.  Then during “Norwegian Wood” she leaned in and kissed me.  I let her.  I let her all through “You Won't See Me”.  She continued as “Nowhere Man” played.  It got heavier during “Think for Yourself”.  I don't even remember “The Word” it was so intense.  

Then, it came to “Michelle” my darling of a song.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” I ached

Each note made me want to leave.  Each note made me want to stay.

“*My Michelle*”   sang the last line as the guitar played it's beautifully sweet outro.

I felt a sigh of relief come over me.  I eagerly anticipated “What Goes On”.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” my shocked ears hear. 

The song played a few more times before we finished our passionate moment.

“Good thing it's your favourite song” she said and proceeded to fall asleep in my arms.

“*I love you, I love you, I love you.  That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way, I will say the only words I know that you'll understand*” I heard time and time again.

I lost count of how many times it played.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I slunk out from underneath Claire's arm.  I gathered my things and opened the door.  I paused for a moment to see her perfect figure bask in the moonlight.  I hurried into the night.  I made my way back to my apartment.  I was exhausted from the walk and the thought.  I opened my door.  I walked into my bedroom.  I crawled underneath my blankets.  I was still shivering.  

“Hey, you're home late” she said to me as I pressed my cold body against her warmth.

“Sorry, it was a wild night” I responded to her.

She nuzzled up into me.

“I love you Michelle” I said as she drifted off to sleep.

I've never stayed in Houston for the summer and I'd like to do that for once. Plus my girlfriend lives here and I'd like to be able to spend the summer at least in the same city as her. My previous plans for the summer fell through so I'm scrambling to find something to do. 

I'm a math major with a good deal of programming experience. I've done two REUs in the past (in mathematics). Ideally I'd like to find some companies (software firms?) still looking for summer interns, but I realize that is unlikely at this point. I checked out Google Summer of Code and it looks like I've missed the deadlines.

Failing all else, I could just take a summer class and pick up a random job--I have no issues doing that--but I want to see what all my options are first. I'd greatly appreciate any and all ideas! Even if they are not internship-related! THANKS!"

sinbn,2,2012-04-19,"Failed once, too scared to try again now",Cantbreakaheart,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/sinbn/failed_once_too_scared_to_try_again_now/,"So I met this girl about 3 months ago during an internship I'm currently in, and never once thought we would get as close as we have today. At the time I was still with my ex, and she had a boyfriend that she had been with for a month or two. About a week later I broke up with my girlfriend for pre-existing reasons. We quickly became friends and soon became really close. We would hold hands, cuddle and watch movies, and she would sit on my lap or lay between my legs on the floor. Well turns out her boyfriend was cheating on her and was a complete asshole, so after a few weeks of them fighting, she broke up with him. A couple weeks later we were watching a movie together with her sitting on my lap and she started to hug me and pull me close. i hugged her back and then turned my head and decided to kiss her. She just turned away a little and i ended up kissing her chin, it was a little awkward, but a few minutes later she made a joke about the movie we were watching and we acted like it never happened.

A couple of days later we got into an argument, started by me about what was going on between us, and if she had feelings for me or was just leading me on the whole time for some reason, and she admitted to liking me but she was afraid to get too involved because in a few months we would be leaving to go back home in different parts of the country and she didnt want to deal with that kind of relationship. So I told her regardless of what happens its going to hurt to leave her after how close we've gotten and how much I care about her, so we decide to just be friends for a while. 

Recently over the past couple of weeks, there have been some changes in my plans for the future that involve me transferring schools and getting a job near this girls hometown. At first I didnt want to tell her because i felt like it would seem as if I was either lying or doing it it just for her. So I continued normally, but things started to pick up between us again, the holding hands, the cuddling, leaning against me on a counter in a very personal way one night... We were drinking one night with a bunch of friends and then started to walk home, while walking I told her I had something to say and she asked what? I let her know that I had fallen in love with her and regardless of what happens between us that I've already been planning to move to her home state, and she just smiled and hugged me. (non-relevant, but a few feet later we both saw a shooting star and it was amazing) 

So since then we've been getting closer and closer and i have kissed her on the cheek or forehead a few times after taking her home just because. Now Yesterday we spent an entire day together, something we hadnt done in a while do to work and she had a week off of vacation to spend with family, and we had a great day. she was especially affectionate, holding my hand, pulling for it whenever i got too far, wrapping her arms around my waist, and pulling my arm around her neck all the time, in the car she'd rest her head on my arm and kept looking up at me smiling. We were walking around again and her feet hurt so she asked for a piggy back ride and of course i agreed, shes very light and I carried her for a while, she said she expected me to walk 5 feet and then put her down but when i said I could carry her all night she leaned forward while still on my back and gave me a kiss on the cheek. On the ride home we stopped at a redlight and she put her head on my shoulder and looked up at me, i lay my head on hers and looked down, she got closer to me, i feel as if at that exact time she wanted me to kiss her, but my head filled with so much doubt and fear that i was making a mistake again or just imagining this that I just smiled and looked back up waiting for the light to turn green. the rest of the ride home she just kept smiling at me or making a face like =/. I feel like she either thinks I dont like her like that anymore, or something, but i just really dont know if I should try and get together with her again and go in for a kiss again. 

TL;DR I tried to kiss a girl too early and failed, now we're a lot closer and I think she really likes/loves me and I had the opportunity to kiss her again last night but was afraid I was imagining it or that she wasn't looking for a kiss even though I really feel like she was. I'm so confused and scared, help, I really love and care about this girl.

sik5l,233,2012-04-19,Proper interview attire: from a hiring manager,SweatyButcher,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/,"There's been quite a few posts about how people should look for an interview, with a lot more unnecessary or inaccurate advice. The reason I decided to write this is because I worry that some of you are putting too much time into how you look. **If you can only dedicate *X* amount of hours into preparing for your interview, 99% of your time should be preparing for your answers. Looking better than other candidates isn't going to really play a factor, truthfully.**

Let me preface by saying my perspective comes as a hiring manager that isn't based on fashion or appearances. So if you're applying for a job in the fashion industry, marketing, presentations, or anything like this, then this post doesn't apply to you. This post is meant for people who are applying for most standard behind-the-desk jobs. 

*EDIT: As others have pointed out, this isn't an all-encompassing post that will cover every interview. Every industry is different, and every company within shared industries are different. How you should look for a government job will be drastically different than a small startup, which is different from a law firm. To top things off, the position level also changes how important your look is. I'm simply catering this post to the numerous posts I've seen: entry to mid level jobs in areas that typically don't have stricter attire standards.*

For what it's worth, I work in the software industry. Most of the candidates I interview &amp; hire are fresh out of college, or have graduated 1 or 2 years prior to their interview. As a result, I interview for internships and entry-level positions.

**WHAT TO WEAR**

***To put it simply, all you need to do is to try to look professional. That's it.*** Everything else is pretty much unnecessary. Dressing very nice won't help you that much. Dressing poorly, on the other hand, CAN hurt you. To put it in gaming-numerics, dressing nice, at best, will give you a +2; dressing poorly can hurt you by -15. The only time we notice what you wear is if it's too distracting 

From the company's perspective, they're just looking for someone who can do the job, and if they can work in team to do said job. What you wear and how you look provides almost no indication of your ability to do these things.

**So what does dressing professional mean?**

[Shujin states it best](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/c4en9up):

&gt;For actual attire: Feel free to call the secretary and ask what most people wear around the office. If no one wears a suit ever, then it might be overkill. For most professional positions (human resources, finance, management, high-clerical, education, sales) you'll want a suit. Some positions will require a simple button-up and dress trousers or chinos (medium-to-low level clerical work, some construction or other labor, some manufacturing, some transportation services, some food services or retail).

&gt;For a suit, you want a 2-button charcoal or navy suit, with either dark brown or black shoes (preferably balmorals). A maroon, navy, or gold tie is fine. Feel free to get a simple stripe tie. Don't get any ties with more than 3 colors. A white, point-collar shirt is the standard. No french cuffs or other adornments, keep jewelry to a minimum. Socks should match the trousers. That's basically it.

&gt;For positions that don't expect suits, most of the time you are fine with a white or light blue button-up (perhaps even an OCBD) tucked into dress trousers (charcoal, medium grey) or chinos (khaki). You can get away with black or brown loafers, but oxfords are a better choice (bluchers are fine with chinos). Feel free to throw on a blazer (grey or navy) if you want to sharpen up a touch. Again, socks match trousers.
Below that, feel free to just go polo and chinos with loafers. For anything below that, use your discretion. Keep in mind that minimal is better. Wear what makes you comfortable in your interview.

**COMMON QUESTIONS**

*Doesn't dressing nicely show an attention to detail?*

Of course. But when it comes to interviews, there are far better indicators. The thing with dressing nice is that you can prepare ""easily"" by getting advice from others. Any decent interviewer will have questions prepared to show how much attention to detail you really have, especially the type that's relevant to the job you're applying for.

*Doesn't dressing nicely give a strong first impression?*

Yes and no. It gives a negative impression, if you dress VERY poorly. Not so much if you dress nicely. There's a process to selecting interview candidates. We don't just interview anyone who applies - that would be a waste of a lot of time. To filter candidates, we have to look at resumes &amp; transcripts, plus ask pre-interview questionnaires. Those are our first impressions. We're far more interested in what you have to say than how you look.

*Can I wear black?*

Most candidates wear black. Like I said, most candidates I hire are really young, and didn't pay attention to their suits. Those that don't know any better (myself included) often go with black.

*What if my suit doesn't fit as nicely?*

Again, just as long as it's close enough. We don't expect perfectly tailored suits. We know for some candidates having a great suit isn't your top priority. For the job at hand, it isn't relevant. Just make sure you're trying. Like we said, fit is only relevant if the what you're wearing is noticeably large or noticeably small. It's at that point we start to wonder ""Why didn't they get a better fitting suit? They can at least put a little more effort into it.""

**FINAL ADVICE**

Again, if it looks professional, then you've done everything you've needed to do. Dedicating more time than necessary on how you look is a waste of time. The biggest general advice I can give on landing the job you're applying for is to check out a book called ""Knock 'em Dead"" by Martin Yates. I literally credit that book for getting the job I have now. Putting a couple of hours into that book will reap SIGNIFICANTLY more rewards than putting those hours into how you look.

NOTE: *I'd also like to mention that suit recommendations for an interview is very different from getting a suit for all occasions and using it for an interview.* ***This post applies to the former.*** If you're doing the latter, then mentioning it's going to be used for an interview is most likely irrelevant. If it looks good for most occasions, then it'll definitely be good for an interview.

***TL;DR: Try to dress professionally, and err on the side of cautious and conservative. All you have to do is look ""good enough"". Dressing nice won't really help you to much, but dressing poorly can hurt you. Interviewers care far more about what you say than how you look.***

EDIT: The advice I provide is based on the idea that you're expected to wear some sort of business attire to the interview. There are lots of interviews that don't have an attire requirement, and that you're free to wear what you please. I think we can all agree that the best play is to simply ask them what you're expected to wear. "

sidam,0,2012-04-19,I'm considering a CS or CIS degree - what are your opinions?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sidam/im_considering_a_cs_or_cis_degree_what_are_your/,"**TL;DR** I'm considering going back to school to obtain a CS or potentially a CIS degree.  Math is not a forte for me, but people skills are, so I was leaning slightly more towards CIS.  I'm coming to reddit to ask for opinions because A) after some research there seems to be some sentiment out there that these degrees aren't necessary / what they used to be, B) I'm unsure as to which one would be most beneficial / useful, and C) considering I'm not brand new to the college scene and getting a little older, would I be better off trying to teach myself and get work experience rather than get a degree.

Any thoughts or opinions are quite welcome.

**Brief background**: I have approximately 100 credit hours under my belt from hopping around in various degrees when I first went to college (like many, I had no idea what I wanted to do).  I took a couple years off to work and get rid of some of that debt.  I'm 26 - and while I'm still relatively young (obviously I'm not headed for the nursing home just yet) - I feel as though I'm a bit late in the game for a CS/CIS degree.

A lot of people say that ""any degree is better than no degree"", and similarly, that ""you can be 30 without a degree or 30 with a degree"".  I agree with both of those views, and one way or the other I am going to finish my degree, but I'm looking for some practical advice.

After doing some preliminary research, it seems there are a lot of negative views about the IT world out there concerning computer science and information science. H1Bs are taking all the jobs, a CS/CIS degree is worthless without actual work experience, etc.

Would I be making a mistake going for either of those degrees at this point?  Is it *really* that bad out there for these graduates, let alone a guy like me who will be around 30 (give or take) when I complete it?  I have to admit it has me a little worried.

**My thoughts**:  My primary interest is coding and programming, and not so much the theory and math end of things.  Initially this lead me to believe that I should just self teach myself for a while, try to get some internships and an apprenticeship, and get work experience organically.  However after doing some research, it seems that if you go this route you stand a good chance of getting stuck as a ""code monkey"" (saw that term thrown around quite a bit), and have little job stability due to outsourcing and not having deeper technical skills necessary for better, higher paying work.  Hence my thoughts on going back to obtain a degree.

As far as a CIS degree goes, I figured it might be a better fit than a computer science degree as I do have a business background (some of my undergrad classes were in business), and work well with people.  In that sense it might be a better fit than doing the technical work 80% of the time.  However there also seems to be the sentiment that a CIS degree is worthless compared to a proper CS degree, and is for people who can't hack the CS degree.

I suppose it's also worth mentioning that during my earlier studies I only completed math as high as college algebra, so I would need to refresh as well as take Calc 1 and 2 etc.  I'm neutral towards math in general, meaning, I'm okay with it, but it doesn't come naturally or easily so that could be a potential struggle point with a CS degree.

Any thoughts or opinions you have on the matter would be greatly appreciated!

sid5g,10,2012-04-19,Summer Internship...how do I get ready?,MattDavidBennett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sid5g/summer_internshiphow_do_i_get_ready/,"I have landed a very nice software engineering internship at prominent company this summer. They work on very large and important contracts for large clients (some of them governmental projects). My interview went very well and they seem VERY excited to have me.

They also didn't seem phased that I have much more experience in Java than I do in C++, which is the language we will be coding in at work (using Visual Studio, mostly). I have been studying C++ extensively since my acceptance and really trying to hammer down the major concepts, most of which are quite familiar from my experience in Java.

Here's my question: I start the job in just a few weeks. What can I do between now and then to help myself be a better member of their software engineering team? I can learn C++ concepts, yes, but what can I do to prepare myself to USE those concepts in a fast-paced setting and on a team with people who have been writing in C++ since the language existed?

TL;DR - Starting C++ internship, what can I do to prepare myself to transfer my theoretical knowledge to being a valuable team member?"

I am currently on a Sprint family plan that ends in June (I have an HTC EVO 4G). Which, incidentally, is when I am leaving for a summer internship in Germany (I'm currently in the US). I would like to continue to have a smart phone, but I have a few questions...

*  What do I need to make sure I can use the phone in both places? I'm looking right now at buying an unlocked international edition of the Galaxy Nexus, if that helps

* I was hoping to get a pay as you go sim card for while I'm in Germany, who would be a good service provider?

* When I get back to the US (after ten weeks) who should I go with? I'm currently looking at T-Mobile or Straight Talk, but I don't really know

* If I'm just thinking about this all wrong, please let me know! Is there a better thing I could do for international service?

si9xv,3,2012-04-19,US to UK (Amersham/London area) - Natural Resource &amp; Energy Policy background,taniapdx,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/si9xv/us_to_uk_amershamlondon_area_natural_resource/,"Well here goes, the decision has been made! After a lifetime of wishing I could move to the UK, it seems to be the right time to start setting plans in motion. 

About me:

* 36 yo, female, US citizen, born in Oregon
* I will receive my Masters of Public Administration this fall/winter from Portland State University, my focus is natural resource policy, with an emphasis on energy policy and conflict resolution. I also have a B.S. from Oregon State University in American Studies (focus on environmental science &amp; history, cultural anthropology, and ethnic studies) and a minor in resource economics. 
* Understanding that course work is not necessarily the same thing as experience, my academic background is in PR, tribal law, HR management, conflict resolution, administrative law &amp; policy, analytic methods/statistics, shrinking cities, grantwriting, finance &amp; budget in the public sector, and comparative cultures/ethnic &amp; indigenous studies.
* My interests, so far as future careers go, are mainly in the public sector, either at the local or national level. Energy, forestry, water, and resource advising, liaising, PR/Community outreach, and conflict resolution/mediation are my overall focuses, and I feel I'm well suited for work in most any agency dealing with some combination of these issues.
* I spent about six years working at OSU as a grant &amp; manuscript editor, secretary/assistant to department heads, a lot of my job was event and travel preparation, document creation (excel, word, mathtype, powerpoint, publisher, etc.) Since moving back to Portland I have worked as a legislative intern with Oregon's Citizen's Utility Board (a ratepayer advocacy group) and I have worked as a field representative with the U.S. Census for a little more than two years.
* No criminal convictions
* I have a bit of high school French and minimally conversational Spanish. By no means fluent in either, but I can usually get by in short conversations.
* I am looking for a semi-permanent to permanent expatriation, depending on how life goes.
* On the personal side, I have two daughters going off to university next year. Having a lot of 'mom guilt', but they seem to have come down on the side of ""we're going away for four years and don't really care where you are because hey, there's this thing called the internet."" My younger one has been asking to move in with her uncle and his wife for years, and seems to be genuinely excited about having a dad figure, so I'm leaving a lot of the 'when' to her. May be next summer when my oldest goes to uni, may be the summer after if my youngest decides she can't live without me...I'm thinking it will be somewhere in between 14-26 months from now.
* My boyfriend lives in Amersham, so I'm definitely leaning towards finding a job in that general area. I'd like to be close enough to see him within an hour...not so close as to smother him after being long (so long) distance for two years. I'm staying with him for about a month this summer and will have a good chance to see the area and surrounding cities better, as I've really only spent time in London and Wales (where my family is from). Hoping to go back in the winter/spring after I'm done with classes to put out feelers for jobs as the actual move date gets closer.
* I'm definitely looking at dual-citizenship, and wondering how much easier (if at all) it will be to go through the Welsh bureaucracy? My family is from Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire (and my distant cousins still live there). I don't know if one can claim repatriation 150 years after your ancestors fled the country, but while I am also Scotch and Irish by way of my mother's father's family, I would consider my heritage to be 'mainly Welsh' and think that may be the way to go.

I feel like there are about 400 things that have to happen in order, and I'm on number 3, but just deciding that this is happening and having the support of family, friends, colleagues, boyfriend, etc. is making it a lot easier to seriously think about making the leap. Any and all advice/connection/help will be most welcome!"

shopi,8,2012-04-19,Day 4 - just putting it all out there,angleshank,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/shopi/day_4_just_putting_it_all_out_there/,"So i've been following this subreddit for a while now, maybe about 7-8 months, not because I wanted to quit 7-8 months ago, but because I've been entertaining (read: wrestling with) the idea of quitting for some time now. 

Well, on Sunday I smoked the last of my stash, and I hope not to buy again and also not smoke again, so that I can try to work out whether some of the issues that I have struggled with over the years really are related to Pot (let's be honest, from reading this subreddit, spoiler alert, they most likely are).

I live in South Africa, just to clarify any strange terms/ideas...
My story is pretty tame really, I first smoked when I was 16, I'm turning 26 in September. Started out very occasionally, at house parties/when I was with my friends with slightly more lenient parents we would go and buy a ""matchbox"" of proper ditch-weed and smoke it through pretty atrociously rolled roaches. 

Anyway, after school I slowly started getting into bong smoking, and also my best friends who I lived with through uni started smoking as well. So gradually we all just started smoking more and more, and from 2006 when I started uni in Cape Town, till about 2009 me and my friends/housemates' usage grew from weekends to daily. 

This didn't really affect my work, I did really well in uni, graduating top of my class with a 1st class (&gt;80% average) degree in Film Theory and Production. 

Anyway, I then went to England for a while, wanting to have both a ""gap-year"" and maybe do a little film work there. While there I became quite depressed, being stuck in various hotel/restaurant jobs, and feeling generally unfulfilled and unmotivated. As a result, and because of suddenly having access to pretty good weed, I started smoking alot. like all the time. mornings before work, after work, at certain points I was sneaking away during a shift to have a sneaky smoke (I was a shift manager at a hotel, so I could disappear for 5 mins without being interrogated). In uni, there was a ""safety net"" of sorts, I had to be clear headed to do my work, and do well, because I wanted to do well. At the hotel, or later the restaurant, I could do the work with my fucking eyes closed, so, often, I did the next best thing, I did it stoned. 

Eventually (about april last year) I realised that London was not doing me any favours work or life-wise (this isn't hate for teh place itself, I actually do love it, it was just my headspace at teh time) and I returned to Cape Town. I moved back in with my friends, and basically resumed my life here. I got a good internship at a good production company through some friends, and have, in the last 7 months already been promoted to junior researcher from intern. But, I was still smoking daily. not before work, hellz no, but afterwards, and on weekends, all day on weekends. 

At a certain point I decided to stop during teh week and only do weekends. Which worked for a while, although I tended to overindulge then on weekends. Eventually I realised that I was, in actuall fact, addicted to pot. I was no longer doing it because it was fun, I was doing it because I craved it, I couldn't be at home, not doing anything and not have it. Add to that me starting to realise (through reading testimonies on this subreddit) that alot of the ""issues"" i had struggled with in recent years (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, procrastiantion and lack of motivation) were rather common side effects of the love affairs with the sweet leaf (some of them had actually gotten worse in the last year or two, when I started really smoking alot). 

So here I am, 26 years old, in a secure junior position, with a head full of ambition, and not wanting to compromise that ambition in any way that I have control over. 
I know I am capable of doing this, of kicking this habit and improving my life, but I also know it'll be difficult, especially considering I live with 3 daily smokers, and alot of my friends are regular smokers too. But I have resolve, more to improve my life than to quit, and I think the challenge (but also the key) is for me to keep making teh connection between quitting and improving my life.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Not really asking for help (although any advice and/or support will be appreciated) just wanted to write it all out, so I can see it all in front of me. Incidentally, me writing this has already given me more perspective on my dependence on MaryJ.

So keep it real r/leaves, thanks for the great discussions and support you give out, and also for just being there :-)

shh34,17,2012-04-19,Migrating from Windows to Unix,Atlos,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/shh34/migrating_from_windows_to_unix/,"I'm a Uni student that has been programming for a while and have become proficient in a few languages.  Right now I typically use Eclipse for everything, which I know can cause more headaches than it's worth on some occasions.  I used RedHat at one of my internships quite extensively, but still did my development on a Windows machine and instead based my project on a network drive that was available to my RedHat machine.  So I haven't truly experienced developing on a Unix system yet.  

My question is how to get started with developing in Unix.  It seems like there is such a steep learning curve and no one ""right"" way to jump in.  I've been looking into Fedora16 because it's similar to RedHat.  Is this a good version to start with?  Can I develop successfully with running it through VirtualBox?  I'd rather not dual-boot because my SSD is only 64GB big, and I'm sure my i5 and 8gigs of RAM can handle the load. 

How do most people code on Unix?  I wasn't a huge fan of vi when I used it at work, but I know some people are crazy for it.  I've been using Sublime Text2 which is pretty nice.  What should I install on my system after I get it up and running?  If somebody could help me get going I would appreciate it!"

“I don’t care how good you are at Q-bert, you will never beat my high-score in Frogger”!  Schlotsky yelled as he grabbed another Oreo cookie.  “I saw that”!  Eduardo said as he pointed to the bag of Oreos that had “EDUARDO’S DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT” written across the package with a black marker.  “Guys, guys lets all calm down” Sizzler said trying to break up the argument.  “We will settle this once and for all with a game of Pitfall!”


“This was the scenario that took place moments before the scene of one of the bloodiest murders in our nation’s history.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this case has been open since 1987 but today, I want to close it once and for all.  I am going to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the defendant, Mr. Elmer Butterbur was responsible for the vicious actions that took place at 10:15 pm in that apartment complex on sunnyville drive.”


“We all know that Eric Schlotsky was a master at the game of Frogger and few people could beat Edward Eduardo at Q-bert…these two young men were in a league all their own- a league that Steven Sizzler desperately wanted to be in.  Let me recreate the details of the night in question and paint a picture for you all to see……”


“The year was 1987 and 15 year old Steven Sizzler had just gotten his penis circumcised by a clumsy barber.  Steven was curious about things such as radioactivity, lamp shades, and soup strainers.  He was always volunteering to go on game shows that involved fabulous prizes until one day he got his shot.  The game show was entitled, “Don’t you Dare” and the rules were simple…there were five contestants who were each given an hour to obtain whatever was on their card.  Steven’s card was written, “Three Blind Mice”- he ran out to the closest pet store, bought three mice and gouged their eyes out with his pocketknife and returned in just under one hour.  That was when he first met Eric Scholtsky….who was already waiting at the finish line with a handful of 4 deaf turtles.  Sizzler, being a good sport, shook hands with Schlotsky and congratulated him on winning the game.  The two became friends and Sizzler was eventually invited over to Schlotsky’s house to play Atari.  “This is my friend Eduardo”  Schlotsky said, very proud to introduce the two.  “Hi friend, I am playing Q-bert, wanna play?”  Eduardo said as he munched on some Oreos.  “Do you have the game pitfall?”  Sizzler said when all of a sudden Elmer Butterbur kicked down the door and began blasting everyone in sight!  It was a sad day in the town of gopher that night I can tell you.”


The jury sat upright- they were horrified as they looked at Elmer Butterbur in disgust.  Elmer just put his head down in shame- a sure sign of guilt.  “Objection your honor” Johhny Applebee said as he stood up in protest.  “Sustained” the judge replied…”Mr. Burger King, do you have any evidence other than this ridiculous story, that what you say actually took place?”  Mr. Burger King slyly shook his head yes as if the trap he had set had just caught a big fat gopher and now he was about to have his way with that gopher in any imaginable way he could think of.  He nodded up and down at the judge as he imagined the gopher tied up to a chair with a ball in his mouth and the muffled screams were not going to be heard by anyone….he continued to nod and think of the gopher he just caught and…”Mr. Burger King”!  Are you going to nod at me all day with that ridiculous grin or are you going to show this courtroom some proof?”  Mr. Burger King shook the gopher fantasy from his head and presented the court with a necklace made out of three 6-inch penises marked “Exhibit A”.  “Allow me to call my witness- Edith Fuddruckers!”  Mr. Burger King yelled to a gasping jury.  Edith Fuddruckers made her way up to the witness stand but refused to put her hand on the bible.  She was a notorious cloud worshipper who would never have given the Christians the satisfaction of breaking her like that.  


Ms. Fuddruckers, what were you doing on the night in question at the time in question during the event in question?”  Edith Fuddruckers was no Christian but a devout cloud worshipper with exceptionally high morals and ethics.  She could not tell a lie….”I was masturbating” she said to another gasp from the jury.  “That is all!”  Mr. Burger King said as he looked at a speechless Johnny Applebee….”your witness” he said with a look that said “bring it”.  
Johnny Applebee regained his composure and said, “Mrs. Fuddruckers”….”It’s Ms. Fuddruckers”,  Edith interuppted as she hungrily looked the handsome lawyer up and down.  “Ms. Fuddruckers, has it ever occurred to you that you do not need to masturbate?”  “Surely a woman with your sex appeal could have any man she wants.”  The jury leaned forward….Ms. Fuddruckers was indeed a sexy woman- why would she masturbate?  “OBJECTION!” Mr. Burger King screamed at the top of his lungs with his voice cracking a bit.  “Your honor, the sexual orientation of my witness is not on trial here, it is the fact that three young men are dead and missing their penises!”  


The judge said “sustained” and called for a recess.  The judge really enjoyed recess and had ever since he was a young boy at Stone Hall Pre-Prep.  The teachers would call recess and little Stevie Olive Garden would run outside as fast as he could.  He always envied the teachers and their power to call recess whenever they felt like it.  He made a commitment to himself that he would become a teacher and studied his ass off to get there.  The real world is cruel however, and little Steven Olive Garden did not have the brains to be a teacher.  He was forced to find work as a judge and hated every minute of it until he learned that they too could call “recess” whenever they felt like it.  


Judge Olive Garden ran past everyone to the outside and was the first to get on the swing set.  He laughed and played while the court waited for him to return.  After about 15 minutes he came back in, sweating and smelling of body odor.  He sat back down and said, “Please continue with the closing arguments”.


Johnny Appleby was first.  “Judge, Jury, countrymen….I am not a vegetarian but I do eat vegetables.  Mr. Butterbur is not a criminal but he has committed crimes.  I think that we as a nation at war should be more concerned about what is going on in the world rather than what is going on in this courtroom.  I ask you, no I beg you not to convict this man….do it for me- please.”  Johnny Applebee said with a sincere expression as he sat down.  The jury had just been given a masterful performance by a master.  They were literally eating from Johnny’s hand and would have done anything for him at that moment…but it was a fleeting moment and soon Harold Burger King, the young hotshot lawyer fresh out of his internship approached them.

  
“Steel Magnolias” was a great movie.  “Cagney and Lacey” was a great TV. show.  “Highway to the Danger Zone” was a great song, and Johnny Applebee is a great actor.”  We all want to believe that the world is a great place and guys like Elmer Butterbur do not shoot teenage boys and make a penis necklace out of their private parts.  Hell, I don’t want to live in a world like that either…but guess what folks- we DO live in a world like that.  We live in a world where 6 out of every 10 8th grade boys lose their penis so some sick fuck can make a necklace out of it.  


Now I was on the drama team in high school and I got my degree in dance therapy but are you going to let me sing and dance my way into telling you how you should think on this one?  Or will you stand up and say “I am a free thinker and I know that Mr. Butterbur killed those boys!”?  C’mon, be a free thinker and say that for me, will ya?  Huh?


Judge Olive Garden sat back in his chair and looked out the window at the seesaw…he thought about calling for recess but instead asked the bailiff to escort an escort to his private chambers.  “The jury is dismissed to come to a conclusion on this case” the judge said as he walked past them.  

4 hours later

“Has the jury come to a conclusion” Judge Olive Garden asked.
“Yes your honor we have” a jury member said, on the count of embezzlement we find the defendant not guilty.  On the count of racketeering we find the defendant not guilty”…with every utterance of the word “not guilty” the fist of Mr. Burger King got tighter and the smile of Mr. Butterbur got bigger…until the big one- “On the count of obscene bodily ornamentation we find the defendant……NOT GUILTY!
Suddenly there was pandemonium in the courtroom!  Elmer Butterbur jumped up and down and gave his lawyer a hug.  He then grabbed his penis necklace from the exhibit table and smuggly put it on right in front of Mr. Burger King before walking out the door, a free man.  Johnny Applebee extended his hand and said “you can’t win them all” but no handshake was returned.  Mr. Burger King just stood up and glared at the audience before storming out.  He walked outside past judge Olive Garden who was swinging from the monkey bars….he got in his car and he drove home to his apartment, fired up his Atari 64 and scratched at his missing penis….yes Mr. Burger King was one of those unlucky 6 out of 10  8th grade boys he so passionately defended.


Just then Garrett Goulett woke up from his sleep….”what’s the matter honey?”  His wife said, “Did you have a bad dream?” “I don’t remember sweetie, but I sure feel like eating out!”  The play on words had been made.

The End

Steven’s card was written, “Three Blind Mice”- he ran out to the closest pet store, bought three mice and gouged their eyes out with his pocketknife and returned in just under one hour.  That was when he first met Eric Scholtsky….who was already waiting at the finish line with a handful of 4 deaf turtles.  Sizzler, being a good sport, shook hands with Schlotsky and congratulated him on winning the game.  The two became friends and Sizzler was eventually invited over to Schlotsky’s house to play Atari.  “This is my friend Eduardo”  Schlotsky said, very proud to introduce the two.  “Hi friend, I am playing Q-bert, wanna play?”  Eduardo said as he munched on some Oreos.  “Do you have the game pitfall?”  Sizzler said when all of a sudden Elmer Butterbur kicked down the door and began blasting everyone in sight!  It was a sad day in the town of gopher that night I can tell you.”

The jury sat upright- they were horrified as they looked at Elmer Butterbur in disgust.  Elmer just put his head down in shame- a sure sign of guilt.  “Objection your honor” Johhny Applebee said as he stood up in protest.  “Sustained” the judge replied…”Mr. Burger King, do you have any evidence other than this ridiculous story, that what you say actually took place?”  Mr. Burger King slyly shook his head yes as if the trap he had set had just caught a big fat gopher and now he was about to have his way with that gopher in any imaginable way he could think of.  He nodded up and down at the judge as he imagined the gopher tied up to a chair with a ball in his mouth and the muffled screams were not going to be heard by anyone….he continued to nod and think of the gopher he just caught and…”Mr. Burger King”!  Are you going to nod at me all day with that ridiculous grin or are you going to show this courtroom some proof?”  Mr. Burger King shook the gopher fantasy from his head and presented the court with a necklace made out of three 6-inch penises marked “Exhibit A”.  “Allow me to call my witness- Edith Fuddruckers!”  Mr. Burger King yelled to a gasping jury.  Edith Fuddruckers made her way up to the witness stand but refused to put her hand on the bible.  She was a notorious cloud worshipper who would never have given the Christians the satisfaction of breaking her like that.  
Ms. Fuddruckers, what were you doing on the night in question at the time in question during the event in question?”  Edith Fuddruckers was no Christian but a devout cloud worshipper with exceptionally high morals and ethics.  She could not tell a lie….”I was masturbating” she said to another gasp from the jury.  “That is all!”  Mr. Burger King said as he looked at a speechless Johnny Applebee….”your witness” he said with a look that said “bring it”.  
Johnny Applebee regained his composure and said, “Mrs. Fuddruckers”….”It’s Ms. Fuddruckers”,  Edith interuppted as she hungrily looked the handsome lawyer up and down.  “Ms. Fuddruckers, has it ever occurred to you that you do not need to masturbate?”  “Surely a woman with your sex appeal could have any man she wants.”  The jury leaned forward….Ms. Fuddruckers was indeed a sexy woman- why would she masturbate?  “OBJECTION!” Mr. Burger King screamed at the top of his lungs with his voice cracking a bit.  “Your honor, the sexual orientation of my witness is not on trial here, it is the fact that three young men are dead and missing their penises!”  
The judge said “sustained” and called for a recess.  The judge really enjoyed recess and had ever since he was a young boy at Stone Hall Pre-Prep.  The teachers would call recess and little Stevie Olive Garden would run outside as fast as he could.  He always envied the teachers and their power to call recess whenever they felt like it.  He made a commitment to himself that he would become a teacher and studied his ass off to get there.  The real world is cruel however, and little Steven Olive Garden did not have the brains to be a teacher.  He was forced to find work as a judge and hated every minute of it until he learned that they too could call “recess” whenever they felt like it.  
Judge Olive Garden ran past everyone to the outside and was the first to get on the swing set.  He laughed and played while the court waited for him to return.  After about 15 minutes he came back in, sweating and smelling of body odor.  He sat back down and said, “Please continue with the closing arguments”.
Johnny Appleby was first.  “Judge, Jury, countrymen….I am not a vegetarian but I do eat vegetables.  Mr. Butterbur is not a criminal but he has committed crimes.  I think that we as a nation at war should be more concerned about what is going on in the world rather than what is going on in this courtroom.  I ask you, no I beg you not to convict this man….do it for me- please.”  Johnny Applebee said with a sincere expression as he sat down.  The jury had just been given a masterful performance by a master.  They were literally eating from Johnny’s hand and would have done anything for him at that moment…but it was a fleeting moment and soon Harold Burger King, the young hotshot lawyer fresh out of his internship approached them.  
“Steel Magnolias” was a great movie.  “Cagney and Lacey” was a great TV. show.  “Highway to the Danger Zone” was a great song, and Johnny Applebee is a great actor.”  We all want to believe that the world is a great place and guys like Elmer Butterbur do not shoot teenage boys and make a penis necklace out of their private parts.  Hell, I don’t want to live in a world like that either…but guess what folks- we DO live in a world like that.  We live in a world where 6 out of every 10 8th grade boys lose their penis so some sick fuck can make a necklace out of it.  
Now I was on the drama team in high school and I got my degree in dance therapy but are you going to let me sing and dance my way into telling you how you should think on this one?  Or will you stand up and say “I am a free thinker and I know that Mr. Butterbur killed those boys!”?  C’mon, be a free thinker and say that for me, will ya?  Huh?
Judge Olive Garden sat back in his chair and looked out the window at the seesaw…he thought about calling for recess but instead asked the bailiff to escort an escort to his private chambers.  “The jury is dismissed to come to a conclusion on this case” the judge said as he walked past them.  

4 hours later

“Has the jury come to a conclusion” Judge Olive Garden asked.
“Yes your honor we have” a jury member said, on the count of embezzlement we find the defendant not guilty.  On the count of racketeering we find the defendant not guilty”…with every utterance of the word “not guilty” the fist of Mr. Burger King got tighter and the smile of Mr. Butterbur got bigger…until the big one- “On the count of obscene bodily ornamentation we find the defendant……NOT GUILTY!
Suddenly there was pandemonium in the courtroom!  Elmer Butterbur jumped up and down and gave his lawyer a hug.  He then grabbed his penis necklace from the exhibit table and smuggly put it on right in front of Mr. Burger King before walking out the door, a free man.  Johnny Applebee extended his hand and said “you can’t win them all” but no handshake was returned.  Mr. Burger King just stood up and glared at the audience before storming out.  He walked outside past judge Olive Garden who was swinging from the monkey bars….he got in his car and he drove home to his apartment, fired up his Atari 64 and scratched at his missing penis….yes Mr. Burger King was one of those unlucky 6 out of 10  8th grade boys he so passionately defended.

Just then Garrett Goulett woke up from his sleep….”what’s the matter honey?”  His wife said, “Did you have a bad dream?” “I don’t remember sweetie, but I sure feel like eating out!”  The play on words had been made.

The End

I'm more interested in the theoretical aspect and the mathematical logic aspect of computer science; the problem solving, the puzzles, and the computational thinking.

1. Andy and Erin should run off and elope.  When they return Erin should be much more focused and less mopey and she should be pregnant.

2. Andy as a expectant father should focus on little else.  He resigns as manager and returns to sales.

3. James Spader and that actress go away

4. Kathy Bates returns and decides to put a woman in charge: Pam

5. Pam steps up to the plate and introduces an entire new level of wackiness to the office. including:  
6. Turning the lounge\day care into a nursing station for her, Angela and 
Erin.
7. Realizing that Dwight is the top sales man and replacing Jim by making Dwight her new #2
8. Introducing morning exercises to get everyone in better shape
9. Moving on:  Angela and Dwight should have an affair.  It turns out Dwight is the father of Angela's baby.
10. The senator scandal leaks (he's gay and sleeping with a male intern).  Angela devastated but rejects Dwight's marriage proposal which causes him to quit and return to Shrute farms to run the inn.
11. Dwight's replacement is a young gay man and a relationship (slow burn) starts with Oscars

sj705,1,2012-04-20,"For the last 10 years, I've hid my desire to become a graphic novelist, and I’m afraid it’s taken a severe toll on my mental health. The question is, how do I start??",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sj705/for_the_last_10_years_ive_hid_my_desire_to_become/,"Hello Reddit!
I am in need of some serious help. I'm not the best at forming questions, so I guess I'll just lay it all there. I am very sorry for the ridiculous length of this post.
When I was about 10 years old, I was wandering around in the library, when suddenly I came across a badly beaten up copy of Jeff Smith's [Bone](http://tinyurl.com/6uct346). I was instantly engrossed in his method of visual storytelling. That was my first encounter with graphic noveling.

Years later, I learned about anime and manga and was completely blown away by the amount of detail in the drawing and the wide range of genres that were available (as opposed to just being for kids like most cartoons/comics at the time were geared towards). It was around that time that I somehow got the notion that I wanted to be an animator/manga artist. However, I remember feeling deathly embarrassed about my love of comics/manga. There were a few moments during class, where I would be doodling some sort of character and one of my friends would catch a glance and flash me a ""oh no, you're not one of *them*, are you?"" look. I can still vividly remember the extreme feeling of shame I had.

Towards the end of High School, when it came time to take SATs and apply to colleges, I blocked out any options of going to art school. I applied to local state college as a potential business major. I was running full speed away from any silly ideas of being a comic book artist. Fast forward past graduation and a few internships at various companies (some sales, some marketing) and I started to notice that I was starting to burn out. I quit my job, and moved back home to take a bit of a hiatus.

Then, one day while living at home with my parent's, I had an overwhelming feeling to kill myself. I had bad days before where I all I wanted to do was disappear, but this time was *much* different. I lost all will to get out of bed, to eat, and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I contemplated which means of killing myself would be the best (easiest seemed jumping of the nearby bridge), but luckily my parents had caught on that not was all well with me and ended up taking me to the ER, where I was then admitted to the Psych Ward. Despite the stigma that Psychiatric Wards have, I found it to be wonderfully helpful and a great place for me to get help. I started taking medication, got into counseling, and started working towards rebuilding my self-esteem.

This happened about two years ago. Up until recently, I was doing well, working at a new and interesting doing sales with a small boutique store. However, I was finding that I was still unsatisfied with my direction in life. Every now and then I thought back to my earlier dreams of being a comic book artist, and I would feel a deep yearning to try my hand at it. I started gathering ideas and sketching and drawing more. I even started writing out a story, and then life kind of got in the way (busy at work, dating, family drama, etc). Weeks and weeks went by, and I hadn’t been able to get anything out on paper, and I started to feel hopeless that I would never be able to do what I really wanted to do. I imagined myself, 40 years in the future, still having not written anything of substance and feeling weighed down with the regret of lost opportunities. I started having trouble focusing at work again, and I was starting to have panic attacks. I started having the overwhelming urge to end my life or hurt myself. My sister called me while this was happening and when she realized that I was relapsing she drove over and forced me to go back to the hospital. 

This was two weeks ago. I got the treatment I needed, but now I’m worried about what the consequences of putting off my dream are. I used to write it off with thoughts like, “I’ll get around to it tomorrow”, but that image of me as an old woman having not accomplished what I wanted now haunts me constantly. 

Having given a very long-winded explanation, my question is: How do I start? Do I need to join a graphic novelist’s group? Do I work under someone as an apprentice or find myself a mentor?

I’m so confused about how one becomes a graphic novelist, that if anyone is able to read this long post and offer ANY suggestions, I would be very grateful.

For an idea of what my style looks like [here’s my deviant art page](http://nicigrigg.deviantart.com/).

EDIT: Perhaps I'm also very curious if anyone knows someone who has written/drawn a graphic novel, regardless whether it was successful or not?"
siu1r,1,2012-04-19,Moving minimalist,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/siu1r/moving_minimalist/,"I'm planning a cross-country move (Portland to Boston) in July, and I would love to get some advice on making the whole process as simple as possible. Here's the story: I'm a 21 y.o. student in Portland. This summer, I'll be starting a six month internship in Waltham, MA. I don't have a car, and I don't have a lot of money or stuff right now. I'll be coming back to Portland in January to finish school, so there's the possibility of storing a bunch of my stuff here until I come back. I also hope to sell a lot of the things I don't need or want anymore.

So the question is, what's the best way to figure out what I need, what I want, and what I don't? And then what's the best way to get this stuff to Massachusetts from here? Like I said, I don't have a huge amount of stuff, but I'm not a ""minimalist"" at this point by any means. I'm learning a lot from checking out posts on this subreddit. Now, I think it would help to hear some words of wisdom from someone with experience in minimalist moving. Anybody care to chip in? I'd really appreciate it!

Here's a close-to-exhaustive list of my shit, with a few notes on my plans for it:

- 2 guitars (1 possibly to sell)
- 1 guitar amp (sell)
- stereo/speaker system (probably sell)
- keyboard
- laptop, phone, tablet, monitor (too many glowing rectangles... but it is my line of work, so...)
- 5 pairs of pants, about 20-30 shirts, 3 pairs of shoes, bunch of socks, 2 sets of bedding, 2 towels
- toiletries
- 2 pairs of glasses
- a few dishes (give away)
- a few pieces of furniture in my room (to be given away/sold)
- bike (give away/sell)
- helmet, bike lights, tubes, other bike stuff
- about 40-50 books (store most of 'em)
- about 15 personal notebooks (store)

So what do you guys think? My current plan is to ship all the stuff I need to as cheap as possible, and fly myself and my guitars out there. Pretty sweet plan? Or is there a better way? How can I make this experience a little easier by getting more minimal?"
slxfp,4,2012-04-21,"""I want you to want to___."" --- Is this a common thought, is it the distance making me crazy, or what?",mdmazinglife,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/slxfp/i_want_you_to_want_to_is_this_a_common_thought_is/,"Disclaimer: A bit of a story/rant that leads up to the final question:

Ok, quick run-down: SO (M24) and I (23F) have been friends for 2 years (met on vacation visiting mutual friends), started dating this past November (LDR from the start), week-long visits in Dec/Feb/Mar with me moving to intern in his city in May-Aug, final end date for the long-distance is Dec 2012 when I graduate. He's graduated college and works full-time now, while I am finishing up my last couple semesters.

Now, this past week was a doozey for me with school and work. Group projects going wrong, next to no sleep...that sort of thing. I couldn't get over this feeling that I hadn't talked to my SO much, actually barely, all week. We usually gchat most of the work day, but I'd barely heard a peep from him. Like, not a ""hey just checking in to see how you're doing"" or anything. Which got me thinking: I'm usually the one to initiate contact. Not just this week, but usually all the time, and I feel bad about it, like I may be interrupting some part of his day when I do. I mean, if I'm not in class (total of maybe 3 hours a day), I'm just working on things. But he has friends over all the time, or places to go, or things to do (situations where he's not going to idling sit and chit chat with me).

So with me calling/txting as the initiator, or being the one that's ""hey, what's up, talk to me"" or ""call me"" or ""poke poke poke"" ... I don't know...I feel like I'm pestering him...or that I'm thinking about him more than he's thinking about me. 

I communicated to him on Friday this is how I'm feeling. I'd gotten a bit irked at the fact that when I initially told him ""hey, let's just talk when you get home, I'm feeling kind of disconnected"" he began telling me about his weekend coming up and all the plans he had. I don't think he meant for it to reinforce my feeling of disconnectedness, as when I said ""Ok, yeah you're gonna be busy. I'll just talk to you later"" he was frustrated with a ""Stop, I'm trying to tell you about my weekend and talk to you now."" Idk...just a poor subject choice.

He said that he usually just waits for me to call him/chat, because he knows that I will eventually whenever it is that I have time. To be more convenient for me? But I'm not the one with so much social time that I'm not readily available. :: shrug :: So we talk for a bit, I start feeling better, all is good until he asks me:

""Oh, hey I just got a text. I'm supposed to play tennis with so-and-so soon, we made plans like 4 hours ago. Is that okay, or should I just tell them no? I mean, we see each other all the time, so if you want me to cancel, I will.""

I respond with a ""Well, it's fine. Do what you want."" And he responds to his friend and the plans are still a go. -___-

I never want to be *that* girlfriend that is like ""cancel your plans, always hang out with me, no you can't do this, yes do that, ect"" I try to be thoughtful and respectful of these relationships that existed way before I did. If he wanted to cancel to talk to me and make me feel better, he would have. The fact that he asked meant that he thought he should, but didn't in fact want to, right? I don't want to be restrictive like that, you know?

I just want him to *want* to cancel his plans to talk to me. I want him to want to call me even if he thinks I might be busy, just because he wants to talk to me.

**So is this idea of ""I want you to want to ______."" a common type of thought? Or is the stress of school, work, and long-distance finally making me crack and be all needy? Either way, is it stupid?**

tl;dr: I want you to want to _____. Stupid feeling?

Although we have only been together 14 months, she has been my best friend for a few years. I spend all my time with her, then and now, and we never get into any arguments.

I thought things were going fine until last Monday when she told me about this guy she works with( once a week, 4 hours a week, for 16 weeks). She told me that she likes him. She told me this is because she would never lie to me. Then said she does not plan on leaving me for him and she just needs time to get over things.

Fast foreword to Friday, she tells me that she needs a break. She said she doesn't want to hurt me, but she in confused and needs to be alone. She is my best friend, and I love her to death. I can not lose her, but I want her to be happy. So it sounds like we are taking a break until she feels better.

Has anyone ever taken a break in a relationship that has not ended poorly?

Edit 1: Thanks for all the advice, and I did hear pretty much any stance that I thought I could take, so I am going to talk to her about 'terms and conditions' of the break. I will tell her that we are not to see anyone else, and if that happens then everything is immediately over between us. After a while I will want to talk to her about how she feels. A big thing that I guess I did not mention is she is done working there is a week -The dorm where she works is closed for the summer- So she may never see him again. I am also leaving her in a week because I have an internship while she is taking classes, but I am pretty sure after a week without me she will want me back. Last summer she wanted to talk everyday because she missed me. If she doesn't choose me then I can find someone else. Thanks all.

~[This picture was taken last week for the body fat friday thread.](http://i.imgur.com/NTZLS.jpg?1) I'm probably closer to 170 lbs in this picture than I am to 160.~ I believe I took it a little far getting all the way down to 160. [Here's another facebook photo for a facial comparison, taken a few weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/efG5f.jpg?1) Edit: [Here's a shirtless photo I took 2 minutes ago with the face included. Sorry for the confusion caused by the first picture!](http://i.imgur.com/n31tq.jpg?1)


I got serious about losing some weight in May of 2011 and probably hit my lowest weight in November so this took about 7 months overall. This is a lifelong process though, and I've got a long way to go!


Thanks for reading!

***Updates***

**Diet &amp; Exercise** 
I cut back on calories pretty quick in the beginning by simply cutting out any snacking and switching to water as my only drink. I did, however, still eat whatever my dad decided to make me for dinner. I never counted calories during the summer and generally had little idea of what I was doing. If I had to estimate now I'd say that I was probably consuming around 2000-2500 calories a day, but exercising quite frequently. **I know this is totally against what fittit is all about, but I did not know of fittit at this point and did not lift heavy weights during any period of my weight loss. I would not recommend this to others, but it is certainly possible to lose weight with diet and cardio alone. What's important is that this will ONLY be good for weight loss, and not so good for aesthetics and what not.** My starting exercise was biking as I probably couldn't even run a mile straight at this point. I would get on my bike with some music and ride for around an hour sometimes. I found a pretty long, flattish road and simply rode back and forth on it. I figured from google maps that I was averaging 10 miles a day biking on this thing.


I eventually got an internship that summer which was essentially a full time job (9-5, 5 days a week). This made not snacking much easier and I was essentially forced into a 3 meal day. For these 2 months or so I'd say my calories dropped a bit to 1700-2000. By the end of summer people had taken notice that I was getting pretty small. Lots of concern and what I saw as bitterness came from friends at this point. It bothered me then, but at this point I can guess they were just worried about me. Exercise at this point tapered off a bit, volume wise, but I believe I started running more at this point. I was comfortable enough with my cardio level to run around my neighborhood which was about a mile loop. I would do this at night when I got home from work. I also played basketball pretty frequently, after work when I could and on the weekends other wise. 


I got back to school for fall semester and was suddenly ""the skinny health obsessed freak"" according to all of my friends. This was a pretty harmful to my eating as I felt that if I did anything but eat extremely clean I'd be seen as regressing. I took a strong liking to the salad bar (I still love salad and eat it for at least one of my meals per day) and generally ate less. Snacking was still a no-no and after I had a pretty set diet of dining hall food going I spent a week counting my calories. I rarely came in at over 1300 calories per day. I also upped my exercise quite a bit. I found a nice loop from my dorm through a small off campus community which totaled a little more than 5k distance wise. I ran this once a day for the few months that it was warm at my upstate new york school. I also had my bike at school and would bike to a field about a mile and a half away where I would do a core workout for half an hour or so. It consisted of cherry pickers, leg raises, planks, sit ups, push ups, and whatever else I felt like doing. This was also when I first found /r/fitness and I remember I made some pretty silly posts that really illustrated how little I knew about what I was doing. One time I asked how I was supposed to be at a deficit when I was eating 1000 calories but only burning about 600 from my 5k + bike ride (I didn't even take BMR into account). 


Eventually it got too cold out to run or bike anymore and my only exercise came from core workouts that I would do every day before I showered. Because I knew I wouldn't be burning as many calories anymore, I made sure to keep my calories pretty low. Thanks to reddit I knew about BMR by this point and so I didn't cut back on intake any more than I already had. It was at about this point that I first saw my abs and it felt amazing. **This whole semester was actually probably the best I have ever felt, energy/attitude wise, even though I was cutting back on calories so much.**


Winter break came next and this is probably where I got the least healthy. I was already consuming a small amount of food but I decided to give lean gains a go just for fun. I didn't follow the macro cycling and generally just avoided carbs while keeping protein and veggies coming in. For me it was basically just a 16/8 (at least) fast which helped with calorie restriction. I didn't have a job (the summer internship was well paid) at this point and could basically do whatever I wanted so I had a system going where I would wake up around 12 pm eat some breakfast/lunch, eat dinner at around 6 pm and then stay up without eating until 3-4 am. This was easy for me and although I was hungry at night sometimes, I had grown to enjoy the feeling and knew I would be able to eat as soon I woke up. I also experimented with 24 hour fasts to off-set big calorie intakes like christmas dinner and eating out with friends and such. 


During winter break I also began to lift some weights. All I had was a bench and a very small amount of weights for it, plus some 8 pound dumb bells. I had a system going where on one day I would work on my upper body with high rep (20) sets of bench, incline bench, shrugs and rows. The next day I would do lower body with some squats, lunges, step-ups, and calf-raises with the same rep range. I was doing all of these with only around 70 lbs of resistance so I'm fairly confident I wasn't doing much, but it was something to do and I spent basically all day doing random sets of this stuff. I also continued with my now well rehearsed ab workout every day and did some stupidly high volume bicep/wrist curls with the 8 lb dumbbells on upper body days. I was also experimenting with tougher body weight stuff like planches, hand stand pushups, and dragon flags. I was down around 160 lbs during winter break. 


I went back to school for spring semester (this semester) and they had opened a newly renovated gym on campus. I quickly grabbed a membership and started with a split of upper-body days and lower body days similar to what I was doing at home. I was into fitocracy at this point and would get a little too concerned with the point totals I was getting compared to actually making a good routine. On upper body days I would do db bench, db incline bench, lat pulldowns, tri extensions, db rows, cambered rows, chest flies, OHP, shrugs, basically any back/arm/chest workout I could figure out that didn't involve barbells (I was an idiot). On leg days I did leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises, and lunges. I also did core stuff like HLRs, weighted decline sit ups, and weighted hyperextensions on both of these days. I would go for 6 days a week generally. I also still ate about the same I had been eating but perhaps a little more. I'd guess I was at about 1600 calories a day at this point. I also began taking protein powder but very inconsistently and with water. I neglected cardio pretty much completely. I took a week off before the triathlon to prepare a little bit.


**My Current Routine/Diet**

A: (Legs/Shoulders)

* Squats

* Barbell OHP

* Shrugs

* Calf Raises

* Random ab stuff (HLRs, weighted declines)


B: (Chest/Tris)

* Barbell Bench Press

* Incline Barbell Bench Press

* Cable Flys 

* Tricep extensions

* Skull crushers

* Pushups 

* Random ab stuff

C: (Back/Bi)

* Deadlift

* Barbell Rows

* DB Rows

* Curls

* Chins

* Random Ab Stuff


I try to keep reps per set as close to 10 as I can but have to lower that sometimes as my weights go higher on the compounds. I basically start with a small amount of weight and slowly work my way up to my near maxes while keeping my reps as high as possible. I've never actually tested my maxes. **I realize this is not what fittit proscribes but I've found this workout schedule to work for me and it keeps me happy.**

I still struggle with my diet but have been eating about maintenance lately and am eating a good amount of protein. I've never really counted macros hardcore, and will need to get into this soon. 

**Lift Numbers**

* Bench - I work up to 135 for 3x5

* Squat - I work up to 185 for 3x8

* Deadlifts - I work up to 225 for 3x10 (Will be adding more weight next workout)


**Goals** 
I've been saying for a while that I want to bulk and put on some muscle but at this point I think I'd rather just stay on the skinny side for the summer and start to bulk during the fall semester of next year. I will be eating enough for maintenance though, at least, and keeping my protein levels high. I'll also continue lifting and trying to increase my working weights. 

***TLDR***

**What Worked**

* Cut carbs. This was the easiest way to cut calories for me. I honestly had no problem eating very little amounts of calories when I cut back on carbs. I basically had a bowl of cereal each day and got the rest of my carbs from fruits and vegetables. Whether or not this is healthy I do not know, but if your goal is weight loss, this works. Remember though, as long as you are consuming less calories than you burn, you will lose weight. If you want to do this without cutting carbs, go for it.

* Find something you enjoy and do it. I love /r/fitness and spend loads of time on here but if you ask what exercise you should be doing you're basically going to be spammed with SS. The most important thing is to find a routine that you enjoy and that you'll keep doing. Progress will come with persistence. 

* Leangains is cool. This made it pretty trivial to run a calorie deficit. I'm not sure whether all of the science behind it is legit or not but the fact is if you're only giving yourself an 8 hour window for eating, it's easier to consume less. I don't understand why people would ever use this for bulking, though.

**Suggestions (Learn from my mistakes)** 

* Keep your calories respectable and your protein intake high. It hurts me now to think of all the muscle I must have been shedding by running a high deficit for so long without knowing much about macros. Try to keep your protein at 1g/lb of body weight while running your deficit. 

* Lift weights while losing weight. Cardio is fun and if you enjoy it then you should absolutely do it but lifting while you're cutting will help you look that much better when you shed that fat away. I may be skinny but I'm fairly scrawny these days. I'm happy with how I look but there was certainly a better way to do this than simply run at a huge deficit. 



This was a lot to write and remember. I'm sure I've forgotten some stuff but hopefully I'll touch on everything while I'm answering your questions. I'll be answering anything you guys want to know but it may take me some time, as I have a busy school schedule currently.


Thanks again for reading!

skqdk,3,2012-04-20,Can someone help me use this ADC chip?,Braanium,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/skqdk/can_someone_help_me_use_this_adc_chip/,"**TL;DR:** So, the chip we're using is the ADC0834CCN which comes with the BalloonSAT circuit board. Datasheet -&gt; http://elcodis.com/parts/5709201/ADC0834CCN_p10.html. The circuit is set up correctly, I'm simulating the clock on the STAMP BS2p microcontroller. My code isn't working and I only have a week left to get results or we have to cancel the launch. Thanks!
  
  
Hey there, my university started this new program where they bring in the smartest high school students in the state and set us up with projects and internships starting our Freshman year. The problem with that is we don't know what we're doing, and it's becoming a very big obstacle to overcome as we get closer to the end of the project.

Our first project is to design and successfully launch a balloon 100,000 ft into space with a payload carrying sensors and a microcontroller to retrieve and store the data. It doesn't seem so hard, but I'm the only computer engineer in the group and I've never worked with the BASIC Stamp language (We're using the STAMP BS2p microcontroller) and I've definitely never worked with integrated circuits on this scale before.

So after completing the circuit board (we're using the BalloonSAT board) and doing the initial tests we were all stoked because it seemed like the project was going to be a breeze. Jump forward a week and a half and I'm still stuck with no results despite looking up and reading everything thing I could find on this darn chip (the ADC0834CCN). I've never seen and much less worked with a chip that takes a code to start so I was lost in the water until I found the waveform diagram. At that point I was pretty sure I could figure it out, but after testing my code and getting a serial output of only HIGH values no matter what we did with our solar power sensor I brought the board down to the electronics lab and used a logic analyzer. Unfortunately for me my code seemed to produce the exact waveform diagram as the example showed, but I didn't not get any values back from the chip.

Any tips or tricks, or even a step-by-step howto would be lovely. I can provide my code if it would help, but it's quite lengthy so I won't post it unless it is necessary."

sn9lg,23,2012-04-22,Where should I go for undergrad CS: Berkeley or Caltech?,surelyfunke,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/,"Right now, I'm deciding between Caltech and Berkeley EECS for undergraduate CS. In terms of finding internships and jobs at companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc., is a degree from one of the institutions more prestigious/valuable?


**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the feedback. I have a couple more concerns/questions.

**Waitlists:** Everyone always complains that it's impossible to get the classes you need at Berkeley. Is this true for EECS majors? How commonly are you put on the waitlist for a class/how easy is it to get off the waitlist?

**Stress:** Everyone knows both schools are stressful, but how much stress do EECS majors face at Berkeley? How prevalent are dropouts/suicides? How many hours of work do students typically put in a week?

**Extracurriculars:** What are some common extracurricular activities for EECS majors?

**Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Everyone knows Stanford has this entrepreneurial spirit, and it's something I found lacking at Caltech. What about at Berkeley (at Cal Day, professors mentioned some EECS students drop out to form startups. How true is this/how frequently does this occur?)










**Original:**
Here are a couple of key comparisons between the two schools that I have noticed:

**Class size:** Class size at Caltech is obviously smaller than Berkeley (35 CS majors vs. 300 EECS majors). Some lower div CS classes at Berkeley get as big as 200 students.

**Classes offered:** Caltech only has about 14 CS professors, whereas Berkeley has about 85 professors in EECS. At Caltech, they said that they didn't offer as great a variety of classes as schools like Berkeley because of the small department size. Caltech's CS is also very theoretical, according to both students and professors.

**AP credits:** Caltech does not accept AP credits, but Berkeley does (allows me to get out of more lower division classes)

**Core requirements:** Caltech's core is notorious for its rigor and difficulty (proof-based calculus anyone?) but makes me a better problem-solver and thinker (something interviewers like to see).

**Semester vs. quarter system:** Berkeley is on a 15 week semester system, whereas Caltech is on a 10 week quarter system. At Berkeley, I would have to take on average 4 classes a semester, but at Caltech, I would have to take 5 classes a quarter.

**Cost:** Berkeley is a lot cheaper than Caltech because I would pay in-state tuition (~$30,000 vs ~$55,000)

**Scholarships:** Berkeley is offering me the Regents' Scholarship of $2500 per year. This guarantees me housing for four years, gives me priority registration for classes (a big deal at Berkeley), a personal Faculty sponsor, and the ability to join the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (which hosts faculty dinners, alumni dinners, etc.) I don't know if this would give me a significant leg up over other EECS students in terms of getting letters of recommendation, finding research, etc.

**Housing:** Housing is not a problem at Caltech. At Berkeley, I have the Regents' Scholarship, so I am guaranteed housing for four years.

**Research:** About 70% of Caltech undergrads do research, but only about 1/3 of EECS undergrads do research. Caltech pretty much throws research at you; at Berkeley, professors want you to have more upper div classes under your belt so that you are more useful. Also, I feel like at Berkeley, I would be competing with other EECS students for research opportunities. Caltech is conveniently situated near JPL, and Berkeley is situated near LBNL.

**Internships/Jobs:** Everyone at Caltech says that a Caltech degree opens a lot of doors for you, regardless of your major (one professor offered the example of a Caltech Mech. E student who is now working for Google). At Berkeley, I feel like I would be competing with my fellow peers for the same jobs/internships/positions. However, these Berkeley grads seem to be doing fine (https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm), and Berkeley is conveniently located in the Bay Area (I'm from the Bay). Berkeley has a larger alumni network because of its larger size and because Caltech students are more academically inclined (more pursue academic careers versus professional careers).

**Environment:** Berkeley is known for being cut-throat. Caltech seems very friendly and welcoming (more cooperative than competitive).

**GPA:** The average GPA for Berkeley EECS is about 2.7 to 2.9. At Caltech, 130 of the 230 or so kids graduate with honors (3.5+ GPA)

**Double major:** At Berkeley, I have the ability to pursue a joint major (EECS and Materials Science or EECS and Nuclear Engineering). At Caltech, a common double major for CS students is CS and Business, Economics, and Management (BEM).

**Master's:** Berkeley has a 5 year's master's program for highly qualified EECS students (roughly 10 to 15 EECS students).

**Rankings:** US News &amp; World Report ranks Berkeley higher than Caltech for both computer engineering and EE (#4 and #3 vs. #8 and #7). Among people I've talked to in the Bay, they say that I should go to Caltech (more prestigious)."
sn4iv,1,2012-04-22,Summer Project,[deleted],LowtechLiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowtechLiving/comments/sn4iv/summer_project/,"I'm a programmer.  I spend all of my time on the computer.  I work on the computer, I play on the computer, my hobbies are on the computer.  Ugh.

I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people.  This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming.  It's a start up and those could be long days.  My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.

For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.

Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.

So this is my summer project.  Does anyone have any similar plans?  I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates.  I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand.  Maybe we can make some collective goals?  I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.

I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"

[What was it that made you decide to drop out and do this instead? Was there an epiphany moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypgh?context=5)|I went for my first interview at an investment bank for a summer internship. never wanted to step back into one of those again. 
[*•The local gang is on the payroll.*  I would like to ask about this... what do you get out of the arrangement? and how did that happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ez8yi?context=5)|Basically ease of mind. they look after me and any guests they see around. point them in the right direction if they are lost. make sure none of them run into any issues with the locals. The neighborhood is still primarily black, and myself and most guests are white, so you stand out. it came about after the 'head' of them kept seeing me leave each morning with female guests or walking with them to local stores. he thought this was countless 'walks of shame' by all these girls and asked my 'secret' haha. that lead into the conversation of what i do and what he does (i already knew what he did from local business owners telling me). its a friendly arrangement (if that seems possible) and its not too much. they have come though on a few occasions and helped avoid what could have been bad situations.
[Would you mind expounding on a situation in which he intervened? This sounds like it could be a good story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1ygb?context=5)|One example- there use to be this guy who was always hanging around the block drunk. one day a female guest was buying beer at the deli and he was aggressive towards her and threatening. One of the boys from the gang was in the deli at the time and grabbed the guy on the shoulder and lead him outside. they talked, not even loud enough for me to hear, and I have NEVER seen the drunk guy around since. Previously I would see him everyday.
[How was it attending the ivy league school?  By higher education, do you mean ivy league or university? If the former, how is it a scam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|I think that the current university system needs a complete overhaul. Especially graduate schools. It is inefficient, cost prohibitive, and in general just held up because ‘thats how it is always done’. More than half the schools need to be shuttered, as well as half the programs at each school.
[What did you think of the people while you were attending school? Now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|My classmates were amazing. Very talented people who were motivational to be around. That was the best thing about the program. I think many of them will waste the talent by chasing the highest paying career as opposed to creating things of value or innovating.
[Do you hook up often with guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eynmb?context=5)|Hahaha. My PR response would be “it is bad to mix business and personal affairs”.
 |The honest answer- it happens.
[Go on....  Best story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0z0r?context=5)|I don’t know about a best. i used to write some of the stories on a blog- [Link to hosteltales.com](http://hosteltales.com) a few are pretty funny. most will probably fall into the tl;dr category however.
[Are you financially successful?  Credit cards are a very risky way to finance a business, so I'm worried you'll get yourself into financial trouble.  After expenses, do you generate a profit, and if so how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyry0?context=5)|The most risky. however, some times you have to just jump in and make it happen. i paid off all initial expenses last month and now generate enough to live comfortably.
[By atmosphere what do you provide? drinks? music? movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyw6a?context=5)|Rampart on repeat.

[No moderator has responded... Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f9cmq?context=5)|I sent it in to the mods yesterday. not sure why they didnt comment but i'll show you the reply from them [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/3OqTF)
[Perhaps the most obvious question but could you tell me your daily routine managing the hostel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2qn2?context=5)|Sure!
 |Most of the time I wake up and check my email. I usually have around 15 emails from people inquiring about staying here.
 |After that I kinda survey the place walk through all the rooms, clean up debris.
 |I look at what check-ins we have that day and get the beds ready. Then I tell my friend who looks after the place who is coming and going.
 |Then I usually bounce into Manhattan to do something. Or go with one of the guests somewhere. Or work on some of the other projects I'm involved with.
 |After that I usually head back to the hostel and sit in the common area (like I am now) and interact with guests/give advice and make plans for that night.
 |Then I usually go out somewhere with some of the guests and mix in some of my other friends.
 |My main 'job' is to make sure all the guests are having a good time.
[Have you got raided by cops for drugs or underage drinking or whatever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|No.
[What was the most expensive thing that someone broke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|A framed piece of artwork from a friend.

[Most disgusting thing you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Period blood on a mattress after a girl got hers early. then she threw up next to it.
[Most weird question asked by a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|To call them a prostitute and arrange cocaine purchase. when I explained I had no numbers for such things he got really upset and took my phone from my hand and threw it against the wall.
[Do you find yourself learning foreign language from your guests? For example, are you learning much french from having so much guests from France?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Yes. i knew Spanish before, but I am trying to pick up more french due to the large amount of guests. It is hard to learn! I also know intros in many languages 
[New York. So Columbia I'm assuming ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eylkb?context=5)|Correct.
[Great idea, NYC is sorely lacking in budget lodging. Where's the hostel? Are you glad you did it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyhj9?context=5)|It has been the best experience of my life thus far. everyone has their own unique interests/passions and talking with people about them everynight I have learned quite a bit. Also, I now have close friends all over the place, which the value was shown recently when I took a Euro trip to 6 cities and stayed with former 'guests' in each city.
[So you are like the manager/owner of this hostel? What does that entail? Is it mostly logistical maintenance like getting enough food, bedding, and other things for the travelers that come through? So far, would you say you've made a good life decision? I really want to travel the world and utilize any hostels and half-way houses I can, my brother and I are planning on it, So my last question is; do the backpackers that come through seem to be enjoying their experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0n0w?context=5)|Correct. I wear mostly all the hats owner, manager, janitor, etc.
 |I also hired one of my long term friends from where I grew up to help me with the day to day.
 |Most of my 'work' is in the reservations and handling them all. We always have more demand than we have beds, so it comes down to choose guests who I think would best mesh with the atmosphere here.
 |I have a local laundromat do all the laundry (big expense).
 |So far it is the best thing I have done. I love it. Hostels are really a great place and I have made not just acquaintances, but really close friends too.
 |All of our guests absolutely love it. It is why we get such a large amount of referral traffic now. We really nailed what we want to be and so far everyone seems to be enjoying it.
[Thanks, that's the answer I was hoping for. Just one more question I forgot to ask. Which country do most of your guests come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0rwh?context=5)|France.
 |Followed closely by Australia and UK.

[Are you making a lot of money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eygx7?context=5)|Not as much as my friends who got 'traditional' jobs, however, I have total control of my free time to pursue other interests, which to me is far more valuable.
[Do you make enough to do/buy things you enjoy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2kbc?context=5)|Yes. i can go out on nights I want to go out and go to the occasional Yankees game, which I enjoy :)
[Do you think that it was worth doing? its been 7 months but what do you want to have done in 7 years? I know that in Asia a lot of people make chains out of their hostels but is that possible to the same extent in NYC/USA? If so please do it. I always need a cheap place to stay!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyoql?context=5)|I would love to create the chain if i could get the right people for each one. the people and their personalities really make the situation.
[Do you (or did you, at one point in time\) ever regret dropping out?  What's the most amazing experience you've had doing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypjm?context=5)|I don't regret dropping out. I wish I had earlier. Higher ed is very good at teaching facts, dates, information, well. However, they fail at teaching skills, and skills are what translate into success. It is impossible to broadcasts skills to an audience in a lecture hall.  
[Cornell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f20as?context=5)|No, an actual ivy league ;)

 |Hostelworld.com is pretty much the standard for finding hostels in cities all over the world.
[1-10.  Difficulty of straying off the traditional path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyzuj?context=5)|4-- Parental approval isn’t there for this venture, which always affects a decision even if we don’t admit it. However, I always wanted to do this, and am 'good' at it so I’m happy, which I don’t think a lot of my former classmates can say with their jobs. 
[What inspired you to want to open a hostel? Did you have a great experience backpacking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|Definitely my past backpacking experiences. i met some of my closest friends in hostels, and just loved the entire experience.
[Do you want to do this for the rest of your life, or do you have other plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|I am working on a few other projects at the moment, not exactly sure what I want to do. If I keep doing the hostel(s) longer, I would hire more people so I could have less hands on time so I could again travel more.
[Silly question, are you usually able to get a good night's sleep? (what with guests getting locked out, noise, etc.\) As someone considering travelling and working in hostels for a few months, that's a small concern of mine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|Haha, the sleep question is great! I NEVER get a good night sleep. Between people coming and going, drinking all night, our excellent sound system, the lazer lights we bought--its a party every night. I have heavy earplugs that help slightly. My best sleep is in the middle of the day when all the guests are out exploring.
[I'll be visiting NY later this year, any discount for redditors? haha. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1792?context=5)|We do have a 'bro rate' that we could probably extend to reddit :)
[Are you in Bushwick? I know of a hostel in Bushwick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ezkbl?context=5)|We aren't there, but I love my neighborhood. I grew up in the typical suburbs in CA and never want to go back to that. You are 100% correct. I think Mos Def summed it up best in that song ""Brooklyn""---
[Was there a moment while you were still at school that made you decide ""that's it, I'm dropping out.""? What was that decision like, and what were the first step(s\) you had to take after that in order to successfully start your hostel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f3kny?context=5)|Stepping into an investment bank for an interview. Seeing my entire life become utterly predictable. It was like a nightmare--I would complete school, have to get a job to pay off my student debt, have to get a certain type of high paying job in order to pay it off. After I get said job, and work for xyz company for such and such years, inevitably I will fall into the classic routine of meet some girl, move to the suburbs, have the single family house, the BMW, and the family dog. Before I knew it I would be 45, an executive of xyz company, finally debt free, but a slave to my conditions. I would eventually retire around 60, at which time I would be too old to really do anything.
[What would say you decided first: That you wanted to start a hostel or that you wanted to drop out of school?  Appreciate the answers, I'm currently a student in a similar position as you were as far as what school I'm at/shared aspirations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f3kny?context=5)|The first was getting out of there. I moved out to Brooklyn and lived with a very creative friend. We always threw around ideas and one day I brought up the hostel. He really pushed me to to it. Surrounding yourself with people supportive of you and someone to hold you accountable to your dreams is important.
[Are you planning to expand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyq0s?context=5)|We need to. each night we are at or above capacity. but the draw to the place is that it isn't huge, and I can get to know the a lot of the guests. and all hostels are really based on the atmosphere within them, and the people.I've been looking at new places, however still struggling on how to maintain the atmosphere while getting bigger.
[What advice would you have for someone who's looking into trying to start a business rather than going to an expensive college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Read. It's free. No matter what you are going to try and do, someone has done it before. Read up.
[On a similar note, about how much money do you make per week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Its cliche but do something you love. Nothing about this feels like 'work'. One of your passions you can make into a living some way.  I make enough to live, go out to eat if I'd like, and not stress when I spend too much at the bar :) Never a ton left over at the end of the month, but no real money scares either 
[What were you studying ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ez3ip?context=5)|Finance.
[Looks like someone is downvoting all your comments LOL ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0e3j?context=5)|Haha, yeah, someone isn't a fan.
[Would you recommend others to start their own business?

When you think of 'absolute worst case scenario' it really isn't that bad. you probably won't starve. it also gives a nice feeling of pride, and makes you want to work harder.
[What made you want to start a hostel specifically ? Passion? Past experiences that made you think, "" I could do it better""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2afi?context=5)|Past travel experiences. I traveled a lot and stayed in hundreds of hostels. I made some of my best friends in hostels. I researched it a bit here in NYC, and thought I could do it a bit different than what was offered. (smaller more host interaction, better partying)
[Sooo I don't think anyone has asked this yet... but, how long have you been at this hostel and how long does the average person stay? I know it says 7 months in the title, but I'm not sure if that's how long you have been there.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1700?context=5)|7 months total! First day we had guests here, even helping set up the beds haha. Average stay is around 4-5 days. I don't like to do 1 day stays because you can't get to know the person much, which I like to do. Longest stay was about 5 weeks.
[Do you notice any common traits in people from the same country or are people mostly the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1e5o?context=5)|I do. It is one of the more interesting things to watch. After interacting with so many people you see traits not just from where they came from, but their interests or even age. Let me think about the exact examples and I will post another response.
 |Overall too the experience has reinforced that 'people are generally good' which is cool.
[Any particular group of people you dread coming? Though it sounds like you can kinda pick and choose who stays... Around here whenever we get bookings from Spanish or Italian groups everyone is like 'ah fuuuuck that' :S.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1u7t?context=5)|Hahaha, I guess older guests. i really try hard to screen, but occasionally you have the guest that makes everyone feel like their weird uncle is in the corner.
[How did you market yourself and let travelers know that you exist when you first started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f347c?context=5)|I let all my friends know. Especially all my traveling friends. I traveled a lot in the past and keep up with many of them on facebook. It is surprising how many people have a friend going to NYC at any moment in time.
 |Also, post the hostel on the typical online booking places.
[Have you thought about going to Europe and work in one of the hostels there? My suggestion, go to Budapest or Prague! I know that hooking up is popular in backpacking culture, any experiences on catching the guests on act?

[For me, it was Wild Rover or Loki in La Paz, Bolivia. I ended up staying at both after Wild Rover got in trouble with the taxman and had to close for a few days (lol\).

[I've been looking into college myself recently and have been hearing more and more of it being a giant scam. I applaud you on having the courage/insight to drop out of such a ""golden opportunity"" to pursue what you want to do. I've also heard, that in relation to ivies being an overhyped phenomenon in particular, that the students they bring in are so talented and driven that even if they were locked in a closet for four years they would still come out and be successful. As for the question, what advice would you give someone who completely foregoes college and wants to succeed in the real world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f4ldg?context=5)|Experience. trial by fire.
 |Whatever you want to do, dive in and get some experience. If you want to have your own business-start one. Be a writer-start writing. Or start working within the industry (whatever it may be). Everything is theoretical until you actually do it yourself. You might fall flat the first time, but you will pick back up and learn from it.
 |Skills are the commodity, education lines on resumes are not. Soon resumes will start emphasizing skill sets. No more lists of achievements and brownie points, they will be portfolios of performance.
 |Find someone to hold you accountable. a friend, etc that you tell your dreams or hopes to and they follow up and remind you that they are watching. 
[Aside from accomodations, have you learned any tricks about travelling cheaply from your guests? Specifically as it relates to air fare? That's always the most prohibitive thing for me when it comes to travelling. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4flnhl?context=5)|I haven't learned much from guests about this, but from personal experience kayak.com/explore is a cool resource to see how far you can go with what amount of money.
 |Other than that, regional carriers can often offer much better deals than deals you find on travel search engines. Especially in Asia.

smsac,3,2012-04-22,"Although anecdotal, here's my own success story (actually, a collection of mini-successes wrapped up in a series) to get you going.  I'm not a particularly talented individual, either.  (Long)",BranchedOut,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/smsac/although_anecdotal_heres_my_own_success_story/,"I've gotten motivated over the past year, and I've had wondrous results.  I'll begin my story in November.

I was going to a friend's party.  I went to go put on one of my favorite shirts.  *It didn't fit*.  My weight rose to 250 lbs.  At that point, I said, ""Time to do something about this.  Now.""  

Instead of planning a weight loss routine, planning this, making schedules for that, I just started eating better at my next meal.  I didn't change what I ate, I just ate less.  I even went OUT to eat at a Mexican restaurant.  How did I eat healthier?  I just ate half of my meal.  That then made the most delicious, wonderful smelling lunch the next day.  I pretty much calorie counted.  Still ate terrible, but just a little less.  Surprisingly, the weight just melted off.  Over the course of 3 months, I had dropped 20 pounds.  Just from counting calories.

New Years came around.  I made the resolution to lose weight like normal, right?  

Wrong.  I decided the best to way derail my weight loss was to make it a goal.  People ask me, ""How many pounds are you trying to lose?""  I respond, ""Iunno.  I'm just trying to get fit.""  This nonspecific thing I was going toward (it may be a goal, but I'm not calling it one) was the key.  

I bought some new clothes from a thrift store.  Best purchase?  A suit.  For $5.  I then bought a host of nice button-up shirts, and slacks.  They do wonderful things for your appearance.  I'd imagine you could go five thousand miles in any direction from where any of you are, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a girl that doesn't appreciate a man that dresses nice.  

I took a ""Social Dance"" class at beginning winter quarter.  I wanted to be active.  Well, the class wasn't as physically intensive as I wanted it to be, but I did learn a few good dances.  *And* it wasn't that bad that there were lots of attractive gals in there.  I took this opportunity to shamelessly flirt for the sake of flirting.  Got some numbers.  But, I'd say take the class if you ever find one.  I haven't met a girl yet that didn't appreciate a fella who knows more than the ""bump and grind.""  

Spring quarter, I signed up for a swimming class.  It'd be more active than dance!  AND I WAS RIGHT.  Every day we swim until we're out of breath.  And if anyone ever tells you that you can't get muscles from swimming, **punch them in the throat.**  I'm toning up like a sonofagun, and I keep finding new muscles that are getting big enough to notice.  I'm now 210 lbs, 40 pounds lost, and a lotta muscle gained.  

Now, all the while this was happening, I had an internship opportunity going.  A company was at my school's career fair, and was looking for interns.  I'll make the story short, and let you know the company took a month and a half to get me to an interview, but never messaged me back or anything if I got the internship or not.  After realizing they didn't want me, I went to my school's career center website.  I applied to everything with the word, ""IT"" in it.  I just middle clicked everything, went to the tab, scrolled down, and hit ""apply.""  Days later, I get an email from a company that wanted to speak to me that day.  Long story short, I went from not getting an internship in a small town in Louisiana (where I'm from) with nothing to do, to a **Full time job, with really awesome benefits, and a higher pay, in *Washington, DC* **.  Higher pay, I get full insurance coverage, and it's in a city where I'll have a million things to do!

But it doesn't stop there.  From November, my confidence also rose because I decided I wanted to be confident.  Confidence is a really attractive trait, physically and mentally.  I thought I was awesome, acted like I was awesome, and you know what?  People thought I was awesome.  It's a self-feeding cycle.  I just got more and more confident, and looked and felt more and more awesome.  I was talking to very attractive women in a way that seemed I could get them easily.  Although I'm still quite flabby (I'm in an awkard stage between fat and fit.  There's big muscles showing, but most of it is covered by a layer of fat, so I just gotta burn it off and I'll be goooood), I talked like I was the most attractive man on the face of the earth.  And it works.  Next weekend, I visit my hometown.  There, I have a date with this Philipino gal, who's just ferociously good-looking.  And she's really sweet, too.  She can really get any man she wants, and she's a good person, so she deserves a really good guy.  Unfortunately, I'm moving, so I'm not doing anything to get tied to anywhere.  But dates are fun.

**Do you want to know how I did it all?**
As cliche as it is, I followed Nike's slogan of ""*Just Do It*""  Really.  I didn't worry about small details, or anything else that would slow me down.  I wanted to lose weight, so I did.  I wanted a date with a gal far prettier than most guys my appearence would date, so I did.  I wanted a job, so I got one (but luck was a major contributor to this one.)  I wanted to be confident, so I did.  Just do it.

**TL;DR**:  Lost weight, got a job in DC (I'm a country-bumpkin from Louisiana), became confident, got a date with a girl far prettier (and a good person, too) than guys my appearance would date.  If I want to do something, I do it.  "
sms94,4,2012-04-22,"Reddit, what are your ""I didn't think I'd be doing this a year ago."" stories?",HammerFace,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sms94/reddit_what_are_your_i_didnt_think_id_be_doing/,"I’ll start.

This time last year, I was living in a suburb of Chicago.  My job consisted of working as a sub-delivery knave for Jimmy John’s.  Below minimum wage plus tips, hated my manager, the store owner didn’t know how to treat his employees, it was garbage.  23 years old, college grad, living at home, my mom chewed me out at 3am one morning because I wasn’t do anything with my life.

Within weeks I was visiting some friends in LA, and decided that it was time to make my move out to Los Angeles.  I am a huge fan of the pop culture industry.  If it’s big, I’m fascinated.  After saving enough money, I moved out in October 2011 towards my internship at an online blog.  Within my first six months of living here, I turned the internship into a job, and I’ve interviewed the likes of Jason Lee, Brandy, and I’m soon to head to an event where I’ll be talking to Robert Downey Jr, Tobey Maguire, and Ben Affleck.

Working at JJ’s in 2011, I never thought I’d be this far only six months into my stay in Los Angeles, and I think I’ve done fairly well for myself.  Reddit, what are your “I never thought I’d be doing this a year ago…” stories?

smhvz,4,2012-04-22,"Gf is depressed, doesn't know it.  Do I stick it out or cut my losses?",NightWalker75,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/smhvz/gf_is_depressed_doesnt_know_it_do_i_stick_it_out/,"TL;DR Gf probably needs to see a psychiatrist, but won't because she insists that she don't need it and that its for crazy people.  Her depression is ruining our relationship and draining the life out of me.   Idk what to do.  

GF Amber 25f and I 27m have been going out for almost 2 years. I used to love this girl alot, enough to tell her that I would be honored to marry her in the future and start a family as well.  She was everything I was looking for and appeared to be ""the one"".  But recently that girl serves only a figment of my imagination and has been replaced with what seems to be like a truer version of the ""real Amber"".    

We were connected in every which way.  Our sense of humors were almost identical and till this date she is still the coolest, most laid back, funniest chick I know.  Sexually we couldn't keep our hands off of each other.  Compliments were both common and easy to come by.  Expressing ourselves, feelings, and deepest thoughts couldn't have come any easier.  We were open about everything.

But now... now shes confused.  Idk what she expected to happen to her life after college, but all she really wanted to do was travel and see the world.  She got a chance to do that when she got to do a 4 month internship in Switzerland last summer.  Let me also mention that this was 4 months after I had moved back to Hawaii after living in California for the last 4 years, just so we could finally be together after doing long distance for 6 months.  So understanding this was something she had to do for herself, i agreed she should go and that I would stay with her parents for the time being.  I bit my tongue and endured the 4 months that she practically forgot about me and let the relationship fizzle away.  She would later admit to me that if I hadn't worked so hard at our LDR that it probably would have ended while she was in Switzerland.  

Well ever since shes gotten back from Switzerland, Nothing else ever seems to make her happy anymore.  She came back home weighing 20 lbs heavier and she lets that take a big toll on her self confidence.  Before you go off and determine the problem right there, I personally find her more attractive now, or at least don't find any less attractive.  I tell her I like it, I compliment her on her body at least a few times a week and would tell her more but I know when to draw the line of overdoing it.  We actively work out together.  I signed her up under my 24hour membership program, we go to sissy turbo kickboxing/yoga classes together.  I go hiking with her, we do crossfit training, we go on runs around her neighberhood, we go to the beach, and were even planning to go snowboarding in Canada in May.  So I do my part in trying to help her feel more confident about herself physically, even though I love her body as is. 

Shes worked 3 different jobs since being back home and quit one with a major career advancement within a month, allowing a well paying management position to slip right through her hands and opting to work for $12/hr insead of a 55k/year salary.  Her other job (I should also mention is her favorite) is buying back gold at a kiosk at a grocery store.  Its a dead end job, she knows it, but wants to put in full time hours here because she can just relax and not really do anything all day. This is all understandable to me though, finding the right job is no easy task and takes time.  Im also allowing her time to find her base and open her wings.  

But through all this she has lost sight of the girl she once was.  Or pretended to be for me, at this point im not really sure what to think.  

The only thing that is ever on her mind is how shitty life is.  How her schooling screwed her over with grant money going towards her masters degree (which she still cant make a decision if she would with or without the money).  Or how how bad her job is and how it makes her sick, to the point where shes gone to the ER only to have the doctors say shes perfectly fine.  Even after multiple visits to her regular doctor, they couldn't find anything. She was anxious and freaking about if she was termially ill and the doctors can't find out whats wrong with her.  Her father and I would eventually get around to her that she needed to calm her mind down, relax, and learn breathing exercises that would eventually eliminate all her heart problems.  

But weeks after quitting the job that made her sick in the first place, shes still feeling the after effects of the chemicals she had to work with.  She gets dizzy and nauzea spells daily.  Never to the point where she is throwing up or really ill, just on and off slight dizzyness.  But enough for her to tell me how irritating is... not at the time, but days later when I try to make passes at her and tells me how shes too sick to do anything.  When minutes before we could be playfighting and laughing it up like nothing was ever wrong. 

She is no longer physically attracted to me, nor has any desire or need to be please either of us sexually.  Her libido is now non existant.  I have talked to her about this numerous times and she says she will try to do better, but in the end she can't even fake it anymore.  Through this grueling process I have completely given up on trying to get physical with her.  I have come to terms and accepted that I will probably get laid once a month now if im lucky.  I have a strong libido and this was not something I wanted to do for any other reason but trying to make this relationship work.

After a recent fight she has even admitted that she does not put in her fair share of effort into making this relationship work.  

But heres the problem, This type of thing happens everytime we fight.  She will fix the problem for a few days or so, but will fall right back into her old ways shortly therafter.  Until we're back at square one.   IM tired of all the work im putting in and getting the run arounds.  She won't listen to me or take my advice on mostly anything.  She now makes me feel small and even worse about myself because she has become so condiscending.  Can I work with this girl or am I headed down a path going no where?"

smexf,1,2012-04-22,"broke up a few months ago, still feels like i lost a best friend, need some help",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/smexf/broke_up_a_few_months_ago_still_feels_like_i_lost/,"first time actually posting on reddit.  my parents and some family know most of what i went through, but i haven't really talked much with anyone else yet.  it might be a long read and i don't know if a lot of people can relate to it, but any advice/comments are appreciated.

so i (an american) met a girl while studying abroad last year in asia.  she's now 26 and i'm 23.  i found out she was dating an american guy who was an english teacher over there, and i was happy for her.  but after a while she starting asking me things like ""is it true in the US boyfriends don't have to buy anything for their girlfriend's birthday?"" and telling me he wouldn't let her hang out with certain people without his permission.  just an overall dick, and the thing is she's the type of incredibly kind person who didn't understand that she was being used.

so after talking with her some more, and hearing that it was kind of getting to physical abuse, she was convinced to break up with him.  i was so happy for her letting go of that situation, and even though at this point i started alluding to her being someone i would like to date and sensing that she possibly felt the same way, since i was going back to the US in two months pretty soon i didn't want to tell her anything.

in late august after getting back i finally asked her if she'd like to have a long-distance relationship with me, and it made her so happy.  normally i wouldn't recommend having a relationship like that, but for our personalities and future plans being so similar i think things can work.  and i hear stories about people cheating and stupid things like that but we were in love and i don't think either of us would ever be the type of people to even think about that.  i also wanted her to know i was serious about this since her last guy wasted her time, so i promised her that if things worked out that she would definitely be the type of person i would consider marrying.

so things were great for a few months.  i'd wake up every morning, talk with her online, chat on skype sometimes, sent letters/gifts back and forth occasionally.  we got to know each other pretty well this way, and i've never been so interested in hearing what a girl had to say every time we talked like i did with her.

but she also also went to school/work a total of 80 hours a week.  i was also pretty busy with school, upcoming graduation and an internship too.  and i didn't realize how difficult it would be not getting to be physically close to her, even when i studied abroad i gave her a hug maybe once since we were only good friend then.  i'm also a virgin, so i brought up the topic of sex sometimes which made her uncomfortable to talk about.  and looking back on things i could've easily waited to talk about some of that but i acted immaturely.

in late january, with all of those little stressful factors involved and a small misunderstanding of her thinking i talked with a mutual friend about some private stuff, which i didn't, but it's somewhat understandable she thought that.  she tells me it's better if we end the relationship.  i ask if we could work things out, saying id come visit her or vice versa in march, but she wasn't interested.  i'm pretty sad/upset at that point and i politely tell her that i can't stay friends and never want to talk with her again even though i respect her as a person.

and i thought that would be it, like i would just forget about her in a few weeks and move on.  but it's not that easy.  she was a pretty important person in my life for almost a year, and even the slightlest little things bring back memories of her that i can't really avoid.  i tried emailing occasionally without making myself look too desperate, but she didn't want to give me another chance.

in march i was back in asia for a week and while there i decided to go to her house and drop off a package.  hopefully i could at least talk with her in person again.  but because of an unknown law about not visiting a person's house after 9pm without prior approval, i was taken into a cop car right after i got to her house.  the cop goes into her house and talks with my ex's mom, who doesn't like me at this point, which only makes things worse.

at the police station i'm interrogated by two police officers, they couldn't speak english to add to that.  at this point i'm thinking i may go to jail so i'm trying to explain my side of things.  they ask to see the gift i brought her, a few small items and a letter i wrote.  at this point after my explanation he's more understanding but as soon as he reads the letter he starts crying, and i'm crying at this point too.  so he understands things a little better now and we work something out where he'll let me go without any questions asked if i just sign a piece of paper saying i won't contact her by email, in person, etc again.  he rips off a piece of notepad paper and i write that i won't contact her, sign my name, and put a fingerprint on it.  we say some sorrys, thank yous, and i go back to the US a few days later.

that's a condensed version, and i know it's a little long just for some context.  basically i'd still really love to see her, but i guess legally i'm not allowed to contact her, maybe indirectly through a friend but even then in her mind the way she thinks of me now she probably wouldn't be willing to meet.  i'm not even concerned about dating her or anything like that, just getting a chance to talk with her in person for a little bit would mean everything to me and it may help her too.  i'm not sure how else to deal with it other than talking with her.  i have plenty of money, let's say $10,000 i could somehow devote to this, free time, and my life in general is pretty good.  it's just this one thing that i'm having a really difficult time dealing with."
smanp,3,2012-04-22,Help! Completely broke and feeling overwhelmed. Advice?,hittingmylowestpoint,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/smanp/help_completely_broke_and_feeling_overwhelmed/,"**tldr; college senior completely broke after shitty circumstances, needs money advice**

Never thought I'd be one to make a post like this, but I'm getting desperate. Hope I don't make this too long...

I'm a senior in college, about to graduate in a few weeks. This is the third year I've lived off campus in my own apartment. Before living at school, I lived with my mother, sister, and grandmother. During that time, my grandmother fraudulently used my social security number to open a credit card and failed to pay it back. 

Let's backtrack. My grandmother was not a very good person to us when she was alive. She was very manipulative, verbally abusive to my sister and I, and had almost every decision that any of us made was based around whether or not it would make her upset. It was a tough living situation, but we couldn't afford to live elsewhere - my grandmother owned the house we shared. Likewise, my mother insisted upon giving her ""second chances"" because this woman was her mother. I understood why she'd often turn a blind eye during less important fights we'd have or whatever, but it was obviously incredibly frustrating when something actually serious would happen and my mother wouldn't do anything about it. I, embarrassed and often really confused about what to do, never told anyone about my living situation outside of close friends, who also never really knew what to do about it. But can you blame me? I was a kid, I didn't want to call out my family on things that I weren't even sure were serious or not. 

That changed after leaving high school. A short time after going to college, I started getting letters from a credit card company that I didn't have an account with asking me to pay a substantial amount of money that I definitely didn't have: over $2,500. I looked into the statements that were sent alongside the bill and found out that the card was opened in 2004 - I would've been only 14 years old, way too young to legally open a card. I assumed the bills were well crafted scams, and didn't pay attention to them (possibly stupidly, but like I said, I was just a college freshman at the time). A short time later, I received a summons - the credit card company was suing me for a card I had never used or even knew about. I went to court, explained the situation as I knew it best, and showed them my driver's license and passport to prove my current age. My case was declared ""dismissed without prejudice."" This means that the court says that I don't have to pay the credit card company right now, but they can still ask me to pay the amount if they so choose. If they were to sue me again and the court ruled in my favor, it would most likely be declared ""dismissed with prejudice,"" meaning the company would no longer be able to ask me to pay. However, because it's without prejudice, the glaring mark on my credit reports that claim I had a card ""charged off"" will still remain until the card company decides that I don't have to pay it.

Because of that mark, I am unable to open my own credit card for myself, so over the last year I have only had bank accounts in my name, which up to this point has been perfectly fine. My mother added me onto her credit card account for a short while for emergencies, which I used responsibly. I had this card from 2009 up until the end of 2011, never missing a payment and only using it when I absolutely needed to. It was sort of a backup plan, as I do not have a proper savings account or emergency fund (I can thank grandma for that too. Apparently, the savings account that she had ""graciously"" opened for me (""But you can't access it, or you'll just spend the money, so i'll watch over it for you."") on one of my birthdays had been withdrawn from enough from her to deem it basically useless.). At the end of last semester, my mother had to take that card back because she fell into debt and had to close the account.

To compensate for not having that card, I picked up more hours at my job. I make $11 an hour there and work basically whenever I'm not in one of my classes or at my required unpaid internship (my major requires an internship for at least one semester before allowing students to graduate and most internships around where I live are unpaid). I also cut back on extra expenses - I stopped drinking completely, started buying groceries on a need base and tried to budget my money as best as I could, choosing to spend every weekend and work night working or doing homework instead of going to bars or other fun outings with friends. I was doing okay. Not great, but okay. I had a little extra at the end of the first couple of months, and started trying to build a bit of a savings account for myself.

I worked my ass off and it didn't help. Life has a way of creating obstacles at the worst moments and decided that this was the semester to send me a lot of them. Last month, my purse was stolen. My purse contained my wallet, my car keys, a camera, my passport (normally this was kept in my safe with other important documents and items but I had gone to Montreal the weekend before and had forgotten to take it out), and a few personal items. Almost everything was replaceable, but at a cost. Whoever had my purse now had my license and my car keys. I needed to get my door locks changed or risk my car getting stolen. I brought my car to the shop and got my locks changed - for a whopping $800. That's more than what I pay for groceries, rent, and utilities every month. At this point, I barely had that in my accounts, but I had to pay it somehow... Without my car, I can't drive to work, and if I can't drive to work then i don't have a job and if i don't have a job... the cycle goes on and on. 

My first thought was to ask my mother for help, but she was struggling with finances as well. I went to my father next, but he is in the same boat. So, I cut into my homework time and picked up any extra hours that I could. Because of this, I am currently struggling to not only finish my school work on time to even graduate without a failing grade, but I still can't cover everything with the money i've earned. My accounts have all been overdrawn and my utilities companies have sent me warning notices about late payments. The worst part about it is that once I graduate, I can no longer work at the job I currently hold because it's an on-campus position, held only by current students. I've been applying for multiple jobs in the area and secured one for after I graduate - finally some good news! 

Well, not so much. See, graduation is still a good three weeks or so away. Because my funds have disappeared and am now in debt, I'm terrified that I'm going to be kicked out of my apartment. I can't put in any more hours at work, I have no other means to pay for anything, my accounts are very overdrawn, and I have no idea what to do or how to get myself out of this situation.

Currently, my total debt for rent, utilities, and car payments is a little over $1,500. That's not even including food or toiletries or dog food or anything else that at this point has kind of become less of a priority over actually having a place to live. Going back to living at home is not an option - I already renewed my apartment lease, having secured a job for myself post graduation. Likewise, up until this semester, I've been mostly fine living on my own for the past few years. However, I am now completely broke and I have no idea what to do.

My question for you, if you've actually read this far down, is what do I do now? I have until the end of the month to come up with over $1k. I've never been in this situation before and don't know where to turn. I know that once I start working post graduation I can get back into the system I was on and be able to pay for everything normally again, but I don't know what I can do about the next few weeks. I know many people suffer worse debt than I do and many other college students suffer with money situations, but I've always tried to be really responsible about money so as to not fall victim to debt. Yet, here I am anyway.

EDIT. Totally forgot to give a little more detail about my current living situation. I live in an apartment with two roommates and my boyfriend. I also take care of my dog from back home that I've had since high school. My boyfriend lately has been paying for almost all of my dog and my food for the past month as I've used that money to try to cover bills. I don't feel comfortable asking my roommates or other friends for that kind of money because I know most of them have their own financial woes. I also don't want to ask my boyfriend for more than what he's already helped me out with."

* Are there any brands that are particularly linux friendly while performing well?
* Conversely, are there any brands I should steer clear of?
* How difficult is it to set up my linux so that I have all the boot/os stuff on an SSD, while all the data is on an HDD?

I've seen posts in this sub before about how to properly list languages that you know as opposed to languages that you are familiar with/learning. With that and my current education status, I have a half page long resume and will almost certainly be skipped over.


Is it inappropriate for me to list past work experience if it is unrelated to the field (ie Waiter, Security Guard, Sales) just to prove that I have held jobs before? Or perhaps I could mention projects that I've worked on in school (Build Manager, Project Lead) as somewhat professional experience?

After living through the grotesque transformation of the girl I loved into the controlling imitation of her mother, I decided to chase my dreams.  Family vacations to Utah and Colorado got me obsessed over the area, you could say.  Everything I love doing is out there- in addition people who shared my interests and were “like me”.  With a hollow heart I began striving for that destination.

Getting a degree in chemical engineering was the easy part.  I packed on internship after internship and sacrificed personal time for resume building projects.  I became the envy of my peers as I was not as intelligent but had a chip on my shoulder from having work experience.  I first decided that graduate school in Boulder would be a great option- but when a supervisor at one of my jobs failed to write a recommendation letter I dismissed the option of going for chemical engineering graduate school.  I wanted to work.  

I somehow became one of many people being considered for a job in Denver doing natural gas.  I put up with a two day interview process to finally be offered a job in Midland, TX while two of my classmates got jobs in Denver.  My jobs.  I tried going to Midland, and the socialite in me could not take the isolation.  It was good money, though, but the isolation got to me so I decided to not take the job.

Two more job options later, and I’m in a city only two and a half hours from my home town.  Things went well in my new field of Environmental Engineering- I grew to like the field.  However, the last four months of living in this area have gotten me bummed as I became less and less used at my job, more and more worthless.  Still no girlfriend, I had burned bridges with some friends and had failed to find enough more friends in this city, and most importantly, no Colorado.  I tend to think of the girl that started it all.  I tend to think about taking her back- as she is still single.  I would be miserable, but not as miserable as now.  I become angry at myself very quickly because I look at how my life is now and how I enabled it to become.  What if I had gotten the job in Denver?  Fuck that, out of my control.  My self-esteem has plummeted but yesterday I started applying for new jobs, out west.  The graduate school application for Denver is due in October- funding in July.  

It’s all a fucking game, hopefully I get lucky this next round.

About a year ago I was working a general wage slave job at a grocery store.  There, one of our special needs employees, a bagger came up to me and asked if I could be her friend.  I don't know what mental disability she has, but I know for sure she has a lower IQ.  I agreed because I'm not a bad person, and would text her from time to time when she wanted to chat.  That was fine and all, but eventually she started pressuring me to hang out with her.

I did, because I know that she doesn't really have anyone to hang out with as she wasn't in high school anymore where there are programs and such.  We'd go to the mall, go see fireworks, I'd make her dinner, stuff like that.  But she started getting increasingly more demanding of my time, like she wanted to hang out for more than 4 hours or wanted to spend the weekend with me, things I just didn't have the time for.

I'm a full time student and for awhile there, I was working 2, 3, jobs while having an internship, while taking 18 credits.  I told her I could only see her every once in a while and she got pretty upset.  

Due to her disability she cannot drive, and therefor could only work shifts that were when the public bus ran.  One day she called and asked if I could give her a ride home from a shift so she could pick up an extra one.  I agreed as I live within walking distance of the store, but she lives almost a half hour away.  I did it because I felt bad that I didn't have time to hang out with her.

After this, I ended my employment there but I'm still working 2 jobs (one is freelance, so I have more time to myself now) but school is very busy and finals are ramping up.  After I gave her a ride once, she's constantly texting and calling me, asking if I can give her rides to and from work.  Even on days that the bus is running!  It's expensive and time consuming and quite frankly, I'm feeling upset and used.  I have my own freelance business to worry about but I feel like a complete and total jerk for telling her no.

What's the best way for me to approach this?  I know she lives with her mom and I think the problem is that the mom thinks ""great!  a friend who will do anything!"" and has even asked me for rides which I have said no as well.  I want to sever this connection as I feel like it's invading my time when I'm constantly getting texts asking where I am, what I'm doing, and if I can stop what I'm doing right now and drive her somewhere.  

As of now I've been ignoring the messages as I don't see her because I don't work there anymore, but it's making me feel like an awful human being."

I am a student doing a university course exchange. I have a long term boyfriend from back home and our 1.5 year anniversary was in February. I love him very much and we had planned to move to the city together when I got back from my exchange.

However, I have extended my stay abroad as I was recently offered a six month internship with a company I really can't refuse. I will be the country for an additional 7 months in addition to the last 5 months. My boyfriend is supportive and says we will work things out, even though we will no longer be graduating at the same time. 

This is where things get complicated. I recently met this really great local guy and made friends with him easily. He has taken me around to several of the local gay bars and been my private kind of tour guide. One night we got pretty drunk and I went home with him. Of course we slept together and since then have become rather romantically involved. This has been going on for about a month now. He is aware of my attachement and is always calling me out on it. 

I realize what I'm doing isn't fair to either party. I can't commit myself to my local man and I can't keep my boy at home waiting while I am having an affair. I really just want to make a fair decision that I can live with and be happy with. 

I want to take a break from my long term boyfriend and spend time with my local man but I am worried this is a wrong decision as my local man just got a job offer in which he could potentially be leaving the country anywhere from 2 months to 6 months.


**Possible Decisions:**

Break up with boyfriend, Date Local for up to 6 months
*cons included breaking local boys heart, local lives earlier than expected, ruined relationship with boyf.*

Date both men
*cons include feeling incredibly guilty about being a player, take all lose all scenario*

Stop seeing local man
*cons include being in a long distance relationship for a year, uncertain future with boyf upon return, lose best friend abroad (local man)*

**I am just  looking for ""what would you do sort of advice."" I don't need anyone judging me for my life choices. I have to live with them not you. Thanks for your opinion.**

I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people. This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming. It's a start up and those could be long days. My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.
For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.


Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.


So this is my summer project. Does anyone have any similar plans? I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates. I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand. Maybe we can make some collective goals? I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.


I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"

I'm a first year Computer Science Major and need some advice on my resume.  

With my current resume I feel that it highlights the things that aren't necessarily directly relevant to any internships that I will be applying for.  It starts by pointing out food service jobs mostly, then goes on to talk about my actual technical abilities and projects.  Would it be better for me to almost completely reverse the ordering of my resume so that it highlights my skills and academics first?

Also, do you feel that it is appropriate to have a link to my github profile on my resume given that all of my projects are stored there?"
snm1p,14,2012-04-22,"Need some advice
",CO_Coleslaw,eldertrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/snm1p/need_some_advice/,"Hey Elderents,

I'm in need of a little bit of advice from those older and wiser than myself. I am about to finish my sophomore year in college and due to being unable to find an internship or afford summer school, I will be moving back home for the summer to work. I am from and also go to college in Colorado and I decided to get a medical card before going home for the summer and have been trying to figure out what I should do when I get home. My mom and I have talked in the past about marijuana (not about usage particularly, more just general talk) and I have never admitted to smoking but I have made it clear that I am not against it and my mom seems fully supportive of that. My current plan is to find time to talk to her as soon as appropriate when I get home and tell her I got a medical card (which I believe she will fully support due to my chronic back pain). The reason I want to do this is because 1) I think she will be fully supportive of it, 2) because I don't want to hide my smoking from her, and 3) so that we can talk about guidelines for my use (such as smoking in the house, etc). 

Seems pretty simple, but here's where it gets a little more complicated. My only hesitations for proceeding with this plan is that my mom also happens to be my boss, and I don't know how she would feel if I were smoking regularly while my little sister (about to finish junior year in high school) is around. 

As far as the work situation, my work does have a drug testing policy but it is only implemented if someone suspects you are high/drunk on the job (which I would never do). What I'm worried about is that there may be some conflict between my mom, who I feel would support it, and my boss, who could technically fire me for using marijuana. My mom is generally very good about separating the ""Boss"" mom from the ""Normal"" mom but I just don't know how she would feel about it from a boss' point of view.

As far as my sister goes, she is a pretty good kid as far as I know. I don't think she smokes or drinks or has ever considered it. I plan on hiding my marijuana usage as well as possible from her over the summer but I don't want to be scared to leave my room while high for fear that she will notice.

So what do you think I should do? Tell my mom and see how it goes or just keep it a secret?

TL;DR: Going home for summer, getting medical card. Should I tell my mom or not?

sqtof,2,2012-04-24,1 month. negative mental changes vs positive physical changes (maybe NSFW),[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/sqtof/1_month_negative_mental_changes_vs_positive/,"so I checked my badge today and saw that I made it to 31 days. can't say I feel like celebrating too much.


I'll start with the good changes: 

* rock-hard boners, and my penis seems bigger now than 1 month ago

* an overall healthier feeling (more stamina, better muscle health - feels as if i can feel and use my muscles better)

* and yes, more confidence.. since I started I managed to talk to 2 really cute baristas and got their numbers, and apparently I'm having an effect on one of our interns (3 female interns.. it's heaven for a chem lab)

bad changes: 

**mental fatigue and stress**; I can't sleep well, I have very stressful dreams, sometimes I wake up crying. when I wake up I feel completely exhausted, and I need about 2 hours to gather the required energy. I've been warned that this might be (the start of) a mild depression, however I have no depressive thoughts or behavior. 

**always horny** as if this is news for nofappers.. but it's bothering me at work.

**uncommon sexual urges** the 2nd week was very weird for me.. I had slight homosexual tendencies (and I'm the straightest man I know), as in thinking how it would feel to have things up my ass; showers started to be uncomfortable.. I considered this as a mechanism of my brain to satisfy sexual needs. this phase lasted about 3 days.

I am happy to see such physical changes, but I must say that the mental issues have a stronger impact: I'm tired a lot, have difficulty focusing, bad sleep, my memory got a bit worse..  it feels as if things are worse than before, or maybe they are the same and I feel them stronger..

however, I do have a thyroid issue, which I suppose nofapping made worse (hormones disorder and whatnot I think).. it's my only explanation so far..

oh well, here's to hoping things get better \o/"

I swear to God, it took me 3 months of trying to download Chris Jericho to finally succeed in doing so. My next attempt is to get that sweet Lord Tensai, but by the time I get him downloaded the gimmick will probably be dead. Fix this, or stop advertising all these awesome CAWs scrolling by my screen on the main menu.

#2 - You fix this fucking pin system and you fix it now. This piece of shit is the dumbest system ever implemented. How could anyone approve this? Do you test your games? Apparently, nobody in your almost out-of-business company has nephews, because playing this game with a couple 10 year olds will  prove to you how fucking dumb this pin system is. Guess what they do when they are getting pinned? They press all the buttons like a wild man. I show them how to use the kick out system and they don't even understand. One of them got the hang of it and only managed to kick out ONCE. FUCKING ONCE. Don't tell me I don't know how to use it, because I fucking diddly do. I can use it to kick out, it still sucks. The pin system should appear right when the guy's skin touches yours (AW YEA!), not when the ref counts 1. STUPID STUPID STUPID.

Do you know how annoying it is, having to wait until the referee starts to count 1 before the graphics even appear on the screen? Kicking out is a frantic thing to do, nobody wants to slow down and play some goofy ass mini game. Fix this shit.

#3 (but not really that important) - Your models this year looked like Herpa-Derp the Third. Do interns make your character models? I can forgive the graphics, because you DID manage to make the game's replay value FUN again... and I feel like the AI was well done this year.

That's all I'm going into. I feel like WWE '12 was the best WWE game in the SmackDown Series and the revamps they made were great but#1 and #2 need to be fucking fixed. Still doesn't top WWE All Stars as the best engine THQ/Yukes has put out though. You put realistic physics and graphics on that game and you would have something magical.

Please feel free to continue posting suggestions for WWE '13. Swearing encouraged."

Yesterday I was off due to the snow in NY, I could not leave my driveway. They brought in the machines yesterday and those in the dpt that did make it helped set them up. Everything was all sunshine and rainbows.

I come in this morning, email is stuffed between panicd emails of users saying they have a virus and our automated emails going insane. I ask what in the hell is going on, as I thought we were not supposed to face the apocalypse until December. One of the other techs tells me this:

""Those machines we put in upstairs yesterday had a handful of infections on them, the main one being keyloggers. They have infected almost all of our servers and we are risking having to shut everything done in order to protect data."" (HIPPA Issue)

So I thought I would ask a similar question - maybe even a series of these would be beneficial to the community?


****
**BACKGROUND** I am about to graduate from the University of Maryland in less than a month, with a degree in Government and Politics (* UMD's Political Science major). Before I get chastised for picking a liberal arts major, I justified my decision for two significant reasons:

* Politics and government are my true passion, and the one subject that I never seem to get bored with.
* I had a number of significant high school (student school board member, state legislative page) and college internships with federal(USDOT), state (MD House of Delegates, [CAPC](capc.umd.edu)) and local government (Rent Control Board Member, City Council Liaison). 

My GPA is a bit embarrassing, at a solid 2.86. Throughout college I have consistently worked a part-time job, struggled with severe depression, worked as an RA, and was elected to student government. Additionally I see a therapist weekly for depression/anxiety issues, and I am currently taking 10mg Adderall three times daily.
****
**CURRENT PROBLEMS**

* No employment prospects
* Overbearing parents
* Can't maintain enough savings from part-time income.
* insatiable desire to run for public office, or be involved in public service.
****
**PERSONAL SKILLS**

* I am quick to read and understand people, and am quick to empathize/relate to other people's problems.
* Good debater/public speaker (can improvise speeches off the top of my head).
* I can learn really quick, and I research everything - wasting many hour scouring wikipedia for no reason.
* I'm relatively proficient with PCs and widely-used office software.
* I love meeting people and being on the move. I would be miserable at a desk job/cubicle job. 
* I have a strong work ethic when I enjoy what I do, but I am terribly lazy when I am bored or uninterested in the work. 
* I can explain complicated and inter-related concepts in layman's terms. I've been told I would be a good teacher.
* I like to think I write well, and I weirdly obsess over orderliness despite the fact that my home life is messy (laundry, dishes, etc.) 
****
MY PROBLEM: I am interested in pursuing more education - particularly law school or a MPA/MBA. Though I am almost positive that my GPA and college performance makes this unrealistic. I don't really care if I make a massive salary - I'm more interested in finding a career that I am passionate about, that won't be hindered by my ADHD.
****
TL;DR I am an anxiety-ridden ADHD graduating college senior who has a mediocre GPA but aspires to be a successful and happy. Please ask questions!

spogo,1,2012-04-24,random thoughts,throwaway2345645,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/spogo/random_thoughts/,"I'm 21, on my last year of uni, doing the last projects I'm going to do and waiting for an internship opportunity to come up.

Last year I got into a massive depression that almost ended the already fragile friendship I had with a couple of classmates, who are the only people I have ever met who I could remotely consider friends.

I went to a doctor who sent me to another doctor who sent me to a psychiatrist who send me to a pshycologist and I have been taking first sertraline and then anafranil for the best part of a year.

My mood has been somewhat better, but I still felt like shit in the inside. A couple weeks ago my pshycologist told me she would be leaving the center where I see her and she would be replaced by someone I don't know. This came after visit upon visit of talking more about my OCD problems than my emotional problems. To her it is as if after being diagnosed with OCD everything had to do with that.

I'm emotionally unstable, I'm jealous of other people's habilities to make friends and communicate with other people and I can't stop thinking about the fact that I can't achieve that, that the couple people I had a friendship in class meant much more to me than I to them, I'm just another person in their collection of contacts and friends and people they can be with.

I've got no personality, no treats that make me special. I've been told I'm a good student pretty much all my life and I focused on being a good student because it is the only thing I knew I could do, but I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of feeling nothing, of working for the sake of working, of feeling alone, of not achievieng anything...

My days consist of waking up, eating and then spending the rest of the day in bed because I have nothing else to do, I don't feel like doing anything, I have no one to talk to, no one to share anything with and the only thing that has any meaning in my life is the two projects that I have to do for uni and that I hate and that I'm not able to do properly for god knows what reason.

I'm sick of feeling nothing but a void inside me. I feel useless, I can't do anything that I thought I was remotely good at before, I have no motivations, I'm growing older every day and every day I feel worse, more alone and further away from the life that I would like to have lived.

I stopped taking the anafranil, I stopped going to my therapist, I stopped caring for the work I have to do and for everyone I have to do it with. I have had suicidal thoughts for months, before, during and after the depression I had last year and the visits I had with doctors and more doctors.

The only thing that scares me is pain. I think about overdosing but I have nothing but diazepan that could do anything to me, and the ammount I need is not available. I think about cutting my veins, but fear it for it being to painful. I think about taking cyanide, rat poison or whatever the fuck I know would work, but I fear not taking enough or taking too much would fuck me up instead of killing me. I think of jumping off the highest building I have access to, but couldn't make myself jump after the two times I have tried. I think of cutting whatever other veins or artheries there are in my body that could make me bleed to death as fast as possible. I think of shooting myself in the head, but I have no weapons available, so I think of stealing one from wherever maybe a hunter in the forest. I think about drowning, about jumping in front of a car, a train, the metro.

Every day of my life I think about the lack of meaning or significance it has. Fuck a family that I don't like, fuck the people who say that care but do not care. I'm alone and I can't share anything. I'm feeling less and less able each day. My life is a failure and I can't see myself achieving any of the things I thought were possible when I was younger. I have no motivations to live and I live every day waiting for it to end because there is no joy in any moment of it for me."

So a little back story first. To start off, I'm 18 years old. Since my freshman year in high school, I concurrently went to a community college, taking 11 units every semester eventually getting an AA. I haven’t had a break since the transitioning summer of freshman to sophomore. I did an internship my sophomore and junior summer and took summer classes after I graduated to get a little ahead. Now that I graduated, I'm attending college but I'm seriously burnt out. Last semester I got mediocre grades and this semester it’s pretty much the same. I really want to get at least B's in my classes but I'm finding it to be very difficult to do so. I took classes in Biotechnology in high school, I took enough to receive a certificate in it from the community college, and since I found that really fun and interesting I decided to major in it. However, in order to get my bachelors and eventually masters, I need to take Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. As most of you may know these classes are demanding and require a lot of time devoted to them. These classes just aren't as interesting to me as Biology, which is another reason why I'm not doing so well with grades at the moment. 
	
During the summer I was hoping to get a lot of stuff out of my system and just take it easy. I was planning to return to school in the fall but not as a full time student and get a part time job. That way I can still go to school, have some extra money and not over work myself. Come spring and I will be a full time student, mind rested and hopefully be in the game and seriously study and what have you. Having said that, my mother doesn’t think I should do that. She wants me to stay a full time student and hurry up and graduate. I live close to my college so I still live with her. Since I’m a full time student right now, we made a deal that I don’t have to pay rent and other expenses. I also still get her benefits from her job. This however is only if I stay as a full time student. I told her of my plan and she gave me a lecture about how as soon as I get a job I will quite school and end up nowhere. Her benefits won’t benefit me anymore and I will have to pay rent, my own food, cell phone, and other stuff. *Note*, she is an immigrant who only went up to the sixth grade in Guatemala. She has worked hard and I understand what she getting at but she doesn’t know how stressful college can be. I don’t plan on fully quitting college, just taking it slow for now. 
	
I was also thinking of joining the reserves mostly for the benefits they offer. I went to talk to a recruiter but I felt like he was just telling me stuff I wanted to hear so I can join as soon as possible. Maybe someone can help me out with this as well. 
	
Thanks for reading. Can you give some advice on whether I should stay as a full time student and just soldier on or if I should follow my plan to take it easy for a semester or two?

**TL; DR**: I’m stressed from school and want to take it easy for a semester or two, mom thinks taking it easy will be a bad idea resulting in me never graduating and making me a failure. What should I do?

I may continue to quit if I feel that the sober life has more to offer than being high 24/7. I have been a daily smoker for ~3.5 years.


So this past weekend I was with MANY friends that were smoking while I was around. I tried not to make it a big deal that I was quitting for however long it may be, but just said no thanks when offered. It actually felt kind of good being the only one around that wasn't high because I could really look around and see that most of these people just sat around and watched the world go by, I on the other hand wanted to experience it! On the flip side of things I was pretty envious that they were toking it up, and I actually still enjoyed being in the atmosphere of smoking even if I wasn't hitting it myself. In the end, I refrained from smoking and I feel like this is my greatest challenge that I have faced yet.


Here is how I have been feeling lately:
1. The not-smoking headaches are completely GONE! Thank god, they were getting very annoying!
2. My head continues to get less blurry. I still notice random instances where I just totally zone out or feel a little ""after high"" kick in.
3. My cravings aren't as strong, but not a day goes by where I don't think about smoking.
4. Sleep schedule is back to normal, but appetite still doesn't feel completely normal. I still have to force myself to eat on certain occasions.


I hope my experience motivates others to continue on their journey!
I will continue to check in every 2-3 days.
Stay sober!

We are staying at our parents houses until we have 60k in total saved so we can have a big down payment on a house.

What would be the best way to go?

I just started my third and last internship at the company im currently working at (Paying 36k a year for the next 4 months and then i get another raise of minimum 4k).

I am planning on staying at my parents house for another year, but my gf and I really want to buy our house and live together. How much money do we need to save before we are good to go?

Any tips?

Thanks everyone.

**Edit :** Ok, after reading all the comment, I realised that you have some good points. I was really thinking that buying a house instead of renting was a good solution but you have proven me wrong.

So, my next question would be : What is the best way to go from living with parents to living with your wife/girlfriend?

**My short to middle plan looks like this :** Right now, I still have 6 classes and 1 internship to finish before my college ends. I got my boss' word that I will get hired at the company where I am doing my internship. 

I am currently saving about 80-85% of my money. My girlfriend and I are trying to save up to 60k before we move in together.

Once we have 60k, we are going to try to find a small appartment in repentigny at a low cost (300-500ish a month). We will keep on trying to put money aside until we have 100k, and then we will buy a house.

Is that a better plan?

This will let us : 1) see how it is going living together 2) buy most of the stuff we will need in a house

Does that make sense?

Thanks again everyone."

So I'm in the middle of a tricky situation where I may face a semester suspension at my university due to a breach of the student honor code.

I still require one more year to graduate and would like some suggestions as to what the best plan of action is for me to do during this time frame.

If I am suspended, it would be for the upcoming Fall semester and not affect my current student status. I have already obtained an internship for this summer, and if I perform well, may receive a job offer for when I graduate.

Now if I do get suspended, I will not be able to go back to school after my summer internship. If my internship goes well, would it be an option to ask if I could extend my internship throughout Fall as well? Would it be a bad idea to tell my supervisor I could work longer because of my suspension? 

I wanted to get an idea if this is an option, or if it would be better for me to just finish my summer internship and apply elsewhere for opportunities until I finish my degree, and potentially go back for full time.

Best."

My boss has only hinted at me being hired full time at some point in the future, and has explicitly said that I won't be doing my energy work anymore.  I have no commitments from them beyond that despite me asking about a job offer several times over the past four months.  Once I was even told to keep it on the ""down-low"" as if it was some kind of secret.  The only explanation given was that ""the division head is working on it.""  What does that mean??

I don't know if my ego is just too large, but it feels like opportunity is being pulled away from me.  With the energy work, I am in contact with the highest managers on-site and trying to bridge the gap between PM, capital shortages, and energy savings plant-wide.  With manufacturing, I'm working on a very small footprint of a small building, in contact with middle management, and will be spending a considerable amount of time as process support; doing the same job that non-engineers do, and not using any of my math or engineering skills.  I'm also afraid they'll use that as an excuse to low-ball any offer they give me.

Does manufacturing engineering have good prospects for advancement?  Will I be wasting my ME skill set and putting myself at risk of stagnation?  I don't understand non-desk jobs and it has me freaked out, clearly.

Thank you to anyone who reads all of this and replies.  I really appreciate your advice because this has kept me stressed out much more than I need in my final semester.  I have spent a lot of time talking about energy efficiency in this forum, so I'm not just a lurker hoping to take advantage of your kindness.  I do appreciate it.

I was told by my employer to start looking for housing in the Tempe, Scottsdale, or North Chandler area and really have no idea where to begin. I am looking for a one bedroom apartment/studio and my absolute max would be about $800/month, but obviously the cheaper the better. My main concern is finding a place that offers 3 month leasing options. Having never been to Phoenix or the southwest in general I'm not sure what the possibilities and limitations are. Besides the leasing issue, I will be bringing a dirt bike and street bike with me so extra storage is an absolute necessity. Complexes with fitness centers and other such amenities would also be a big plus. I have done some searching on padmapper.com, rent.com, apartments.com, and apartmentguide.com and I am overwhelmed with the number of potential options. In short I am looking for a safe, clean, and friendly community with storage for a couple bikes. Any advice on the the area, management companies, and where I would have the best luck finding a place on such short notice would be greatly appreciated! "

**Some background on me:**

I'll be graduating next December from GW with a degree in Political Communication. I'm thinking about pursuing a master's in Political Management or Public Relations, but considering it's a big decision, I thought I'd take a shot at finding a job first. I've even heard about some firms offering to pay for a master's education, so I thought I'd look into this.

I have tried to have a relevant internship every semester of my schooling. I interned in the Hart Senate building my freshman year (even got to go to the President's first SOTU), interned for a K-Street PAC my sophomore year, went abroad earlier this year, and just finished interning for a DC Council candidate.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do, but I am obsessed with politics. I'd love to some day be a campaign manager, and this summer I am leaving DC to work for a Senatorial campaign. However, my candidate is not likely to win, I am unsure how to enter this field and find a job in Washington once I graduate. I suppose I should be looking for an entry-level job for a political consulting or public relations firm?

**My questions:**

What should I be doing between now and the time I graduate?

Where should I be looking for a job, and what can I do to make sure I'm not only employed after graduation, but on track for a lucrative career as a Washington professional?

Any tips or guidance would be appreciated, and I will answer any questions you may have.

Thank you in advance."

After some digging you find the son is downloading a torrent of that high-octane, twist-ending, blow-‘em-up, psycho car chase action movie.

We met at the beach while I was a sophomore in college and he was working as server in a restaurant. I had everything going for me. I had a great internship the previous summer and I have a job lined up for this summer after I graduate. He had planned to go back to school to finish a computer science degree.

For the past couple of months, he has been depressed. Diagnosed by a doctor. He's lethargic, always woe is me, and doesn't put any initiative into doing something with his life. He's never made any effort to go back to school. I have to practically force him to take his meds. He lounges around and complains and makes excuses for why he can't go back to school and how everybody and everything is against him. I love going out, but he rarely wants to come. When I do go out without him, he tries to make me feel guilty for doing it.

I believe some of the problem is that for his entire life, his parents have always taken care of him. If he wanted money or a car, they'd always give it to him. I've had to work since I was 14. Now, his parents have been transferred out of state and he wants me to pay for his things when he's not working, but I don't want to be a mother to a grown man.

I've talked to him about all of this before, but when I tell him how I feel, he starts crying and begging me not to leave him. he tells me that I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him and leaving him would destroy him.

I know he's depressed, but I feel that if I stay with him, my career and social life will suffer. I want to be able to go to company functions and be able to work all day on projects without feeling I have to check up on him. I love him, but ultimately, a relationship with him isn't worth more to me than I am to myself and my needs. I also want to just have fun.

Is it wrong to dump him when he's depressed and what's the best way to go about it?

TL;DR boyfriend is depressed and I want to live life and have fun. Is it wrong to dump him and how?"

I just got offered my dream job.  I'm not going to specify, but it is a major defense contractor.  The problem is, they aren't really cool with drug use.  For now, it is just an internship so I only need to do a urine test, but if I get offered the job full time, I will have to go through the process of obtaining security clearance (extensive background check, as well as a polygraph).

Anyways, I have a few questions for you guys.

(1) Have any of you ever obtained a clearance?  I know that I need to quit for good if I am going to get it, but I used to be somewhat of a regular smoker for a few months, so I am terrified of being rejected.

(2) I will have to take a drug test before starting.  I'm pretty sure I have about a month before this happens, but I NEED to be able to pass the urine test.  This is my dream job, and losing it would crush me.  I am about 140 lbs, female, and probably like 5'6"".  Is a month enough time to pee clean?  Is there anything I can do other than extensive exercising to ensure that I am clean?

Thanks guys.  I had to create a throwaway in case during the investigation they check my reddit account (yes, they're that thorough)."
srqp8,20,2012-04-25,Guideline to stay debt-free after college?,matlem,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/srqp8/guideline_to_stay_debtfree_after_college/,"I am about to finish my college without any debts (Thanks to my 24h/week job since high school and my parents who paid for most of my education fees).

I have asked in /r/frugal if buying a house with my gf was a good idea and I have realised that we should rent first. 

Now, my question is : What are the best way to stay debt free once we leave the parent's house and live in the ""real world""?

1. My car is paid
2. For now, my only expenses are food, phone bill (53$/month which is actually low in canada for my data plan) and my car insurance (75$ a month for full coverage)
3. I just started my 3rd internship at the same company where I now make 36k.
4. My boss told me he will give me another raise after my internship (in 4 months), which will bring me up to minimum 40k.
5. I do not see my gf and I breaking up (we have been dating for 6 and a half year). (I know things will change when we live together but I really hope it will work out good.)
6. I still have 5 classes to finish at college but I will work at the same time (they are evening classes and aren't really important)
7. We have about 20k saved up and are putting 85-90% of our money aside until we have at least 60k before making a move (Either buying a house or renting an apartment)
8. We were thinking about buying an apartment because the renting price are almost as high as a house payment (600-800$/month compared to 900-1100$ a month)

I think that sums it up... I will not take it personal if you guys tell me I am naive and/or ignorant. I just turned 23 years old and would like to know what you guys would do differently if you had the chance to go back to being 23 and starting in the ""real life"".

Thanks."

**Description**

JOSH DENNY is here, with former intern Shooby and fan Max. We’re drinking spirits and celebrating Friday the 13th. Watch out for spooks and killers out there, kids. We talk about Shooby being late, and how his teeth look like they’re escaping from his mouth. We talk about food trucks and Mexicans, as well as shitty bands. More stupid stuff with Flapper’s Comedy Club. We start a new ongoing new Natasha Leggero reference for anything that sucks. Is milk steak a real thing? Max and Shooby aren’t original and repeat each other’s jokes. How would society start over if almost everyone died? A weird British fan calls in. Our mandatory talk about shit continues. Patrick reads an IM conversation from a fat girl with no sense of humor to one of our fans about Patrick and the show. We talk about why Hitler got a bad reputation for killing too many Jews. We get in to Shooby’s phone and read texts from Tony, a girl who manages High Roller Tattoo in New York, where Shooby recently got a tattoo and Patrick will soon be getting his. Shooby texts likes a man-girl. Domino’s Pizza Hero game for iPad is so addictive and it actually makes their pizza look good.

Before I started nursing school I came in with a 3.8 GPA and that quickly went down the drain-it took me a while to get used to nursing school-not to mention year #1 I had TERRIBLE TERRIBLE professors...in two 8 credit classes I wound up with a C and it sucks because right now my GPA does not reflect the type of student I am or the type of nurse I will be.  Right now i'm in my last semester (with amazing professors) I am running all A's. I think my improvement will look great for me-but at the same time I am looking to work in a well respected hospital in NYC. I'm worried that my grades are going to hold me back from that happening. My sister works at CHONY (NYP Presbyterian Children's Hospital) and I'm praying for some connections through her but all in all I don't know how much connections will really help. I hear that a lot of people don't get a job for 4-6 months-this scares me. My sister got her RN job right when she graduated before she even passed her boards (and this was only 3 or 4 years ago). 
I'm also really nervous for interviews-I'm one of those quiet and sweet kinda girls-not loud and confident-Interviews make me really nervous and I need to learn how to suck it up and be proud of what I've done and exude confidence-if anyone has any tips for me that would be really amazing. 
I also hear that a lot of people get jobs where they interned in btwn the 2 years of nursing school. I did in internship at Bellevue in the Peds ER--&gt;Will that look good for me? My dream is to work at NYP I am just worried about how difficult it may be for that dream to come true-am I way in over my head?

Any advice is welcomed!

Now I need some help making a decision on where to work and what offers are my best choices. 

Currently, I have an internship opportunity for a company I would love to work for over the summer. Only problem is I'd need to enroll in school to be eligible for the internship which is something I would consider but the costs are concerning.

The next opportunity is a job in another city that is expensive to live in. The salary would be enough to get by but no real room for substantial savings. The job is for a start-up company and I am reluctant because I've worked for one before and it is draining. I emailed a current employee of the company I know through mutual friends to see what they say about the company culture.

And last option is keep looking for work where I am: in a small city living with family. The ability to save money would be highest here although it is also a lot slower to find work and I don't have many connections here.

It was raining so most people had umbrellas, and I was standing in line with my roommate behind these 2 girls. Let's call them girl 1 and girl 2.

She turned around, said something with a smile and we started talking, and I moved my hand towards the middle so that it was pretty much over all 3 of our heads (girl 1, girl 2, me. My roommate had his own umbrella). I found out that it was her first time there (it was my first time  at the one in this city too) and that she moved into the area a year ago working in social media, say it sounds fun, but it's really not. I joke that at least they have a job, I'm still an intern, but that topic quickly died. As I was talking to girl 1, I saw three friends who I was supposed to meet up with walk up behind the girls and I waved at them, and then continued talking to girl 1 about other stuff I don't remember.

At some point she mentions that girl 2 was a coworker and also a bartender. I instantly tell her that my roommate was DJ and they hit it off pretty well. While they were talking, I realize that my friends had disappeared, and I start looking around for them while she talks every once in a while. Eventually, I find out that she used to live in the city where I work, so I start talking to her about where to find places to live around there. 

Eventually, we get to the front of the line and I ask my roommate what he's getting, if he wants to get 2 things and share it. The girls turn around to look at the menu. My roommate mentions some coke grilled food on the menu, and girl 1 turns around again to talk about it, saying how it should be good and stuff. But then after they ordered they just walk away and leave without saying anything.

After the 2 girls left, while we were waiting for our food, another couple came up to us and the girl asked us to explain to the guy what dim sum was. We got to talking about a lot of different foods and it felt like a much better interaction than the one I had with the 2 girls because everyone was talking and there was laughing and stuff. Eventually I realize that I have to go look for my friends and told them it was nice meeting them, shook their hands and asked them for their names then left.

In hindsight, I think I could have got her to talk more about her job and what kind of things they do, maybe throw in a couple of negs. 
I also think that looking for my friends was a bad idea, because I was no longer paying attention to the girls. I could have just looked for them after we ordered and got our food.
Should I have also moved in closer after I offered the umbrella? I moved my hand towards the middle and took maybe half a step forward, but maybe I could have stood shoulder to shoulder with girl 1? 
Also, when girl 2 was talking to my roommate, should I have gone back to talking to girl 1 instead of listening to their conversation? It felt like it was 1 to 1 conversations going on during our entire meeting, rather than the entire group talking.
Finally, should I have asked them their names sometime in the conversation?
I also didn't get any # closes because at no point during the interaction did it feel nature to ask them for it. I also wasn't too interested in either of them and didn't feel like we had too much in common. I feel like after reading seddit a lot, I need to get rid of this mindset, should I?

TL;DR: Offered girl in front of me my umbrella and hit it off, but then interaction died when we got to the front of the line and they just walked off. Not too sure why, but I have some ideas."
st71b,7,2012-04-26,Girlfriend of two years not interested sexually at all: Am I justified in being upset by this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/st71b/girlfriend_of_two_years_not_interested_sexually/,"I (M20) have been in a relationship with my gf (19yo) for a little over 2 years now. We both have known each other since high school and ended up attending the same college--her a freshman while I'm a sophomore. Let me preface this by saying that our emotional relationship has been very healthy throughout our time.

Things were going great throughout the first few months. We were extremely attracted to each other and messed around about 3 times a week -- no intercourse though. We talked about sex on every so often and she would repeatedly put it off. This didn't upset me because we were virgins and I know she wanted her first time to be with someone special to her. I felt the same way so I agreed with her. We kept up this routine for the entire summer before I went off to college. This is where I felt like our healthy sex life ended.

I moved in to school in that Fall. It was really hard on us, many tears were shed the night before I left. This is where I felt we really had something special going on. I made it a point to try to better myself by losing weight so when she was able to come to school with me the next year I would be even more attractive than I was when I left. 

I would visit often maybe once a month and whenever I visited she never wanted to mess around and sex was way out of question. I would almost always be turned down whenever I visited...even though she would say different. I never got too upset because I didn't want to seem like that was all I cared about and that it was reasonable that she would just want quality non sexy times. This continued throughout the entire school year. I even lost 50 lbs over this year to no avail.

I spent that summer at home where I had my first engineering  internship. I was hoping that the summer would be a return to the same type of summer as the year prior. This was not the case. Whenever we did mess around I would have to almost beg her and she didn't even seem to enjoy it and still no sex -- this time she said she wanted to be on bc and planned on starting it in the fall. I chalked up her disinterest this time to her anxiety of moving away from home. She is super super close with her mother. This continued until the fall when she joined me at our university. 

First semester I had built up new hope that our sex life would increase; but again barely anything. I blamed the disinterst this time on bc side effects and separation anxiety from her mother in addition to moving away from home--definitely understandable. I tried as hard as I could to be a rock for her.

Now we have just passed our two year anniversary.  She quit taking the pill and has been feeling a whole bunch better about being away from home. We have both being super successful academically and she has made tons of friends. We still haven't had sex and I practically have to beg for any type of sexual stimulation. Any time I bring up how sex she gets super upset and angry and makes me feel like I am being unreasonable. She has straight up told me that we will not be having intercourse any time in the near future. 

I don't know what I am doing wrong if anything. The constant rejection is whittling away at my confidence. I feel inadequate around all of my guy friends from high school who are not virgins. I am also having a hard time making new guy friends because of this. It also makes me angry because she wants us to act like we have a sex life around all our friends. Is this my fault?

**TLDR:** Been with girl for two years and she has constantly turned down sex even though we have a very healthy emotional relationship. The constant rejection coupled with feelings of inadequacy around my guy friends is fucking up my confidence.

Writing all of this has been an awesome catharsis for me. Thanks for listening. But tell me people of Reddit, what advice do you have for me? "
st5t4,1,2012-04-26,22/f...I feel like I'm in a soap-opera,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/st5t4/22fi_feel_like_im_in_a_soapopera/,"Ok, I'll try to make it to the point, I really don't want to tl:dr...

A couple of years ago I met this guy at a social gathering (we're in the same student organization at my school) and we've been friends ever since - though nothing more than friendly acquaintances; I've always been attracted to him but didn't have enough interest to pursue anything more.

Flash forward to a couple of months ago, and we randomly start hanging out on a semi-regular basis. Like, 4-5 times a week at various social gatherings. I get to know him much better and turns out he's a super cool guy. He starts pursing the crap out of me for a couple of weeks - texting, hangouts, what have you - and I was certain it was going to go somewhere. Turns out he's just super friendly and led me on ""by accident."" We talked it out and our friendship has been great since then (that was the beginning of March); we hang out nearly every day and have gotten considerably closer as friends since everything happened.

The problem is that ever since then, I've been in total anguish about the situation. The more I've gotten to know him the stronger the feelings I have for him have become. It totally blows. He's still friendly (if not friendlier) than ever and evidently wasn't scared off by what happened. Friendly enough to make me doubt sometimes that he doesn't have feelings for me - which makes getting over him much more difficult than it should be, but that's another story.

OK, SO...Here's my dilemma: he's going to move to another city for the summer to do an internship, so I pretty much won't see him/talk to him at all for 10 weeks. I've been harboring these feelings/heartbreak for a while, though I'm pretty sure he's oblivious to both. Would it be worth my time to make him aware of either of those before he goes? Part of me really wants him to know so I can fucking stop holding it in, but the other part is afraid of more rejection (obviously). Plus I don't want things to be weird between us...but if he's going to be gone for months, it might be a good idea to clear the air? At least for the sake of my emotional well-being? Is that stupid? I kind of want to know once and for all if I have any hope with him...I just don't want to come across as too needy or dramatic or something. You know? Gah!

Halp!"

Is the Free Network Foundation(FNF) a good place to start?

And I may as well go ahead and throw Python in. I've heard a lot of good things about it and I think it'd be nice to add to my resume.

It's been about a year since I passed my preliminary exams and began research (but still I don't expect to graduate until 2015 plus or minus a year); in January I switched advisers due to complete disenchantment with my previous topic (no bridges burnt), but for a few reasons I'm just unhappy with things right now and want to try to apply around and see if I can't get a nice offer. In case it's relevant, I'm in an applied math program at the computational end of the spectrum and will be looking in the technology sector - data analysis and the like. There are a few details about my resume that I've got questions about given the situation:

1. Presently I've included names of my various research advisers/mentors throughout my academic career; should I not? At the very least my current adviser is a (relatively) well-publicized name, but some sources do seem to suggest excluding all names of any sort apart from my own.
2. A consequence of 1.: I *certainly* don't want my current adviser (or former, or anyone at my school) to be contacted by a recruiter; to that end I included a line at the end stating ""References available upon request."" Again, sources suggested such a line is superfluous and assumed, but I felt that it may deter any calls/contact to the names I have listed before we've actually discussed references. Thoughts?
3. I keep hearing different things about this: should I include GPA? I don't have any experience outside of academic research (and a research-oriented summer internship). All my GPAs since undergrad are quite nice, and because of my format including them isn't wasting vertical space.

Any feedback is appreciated."

I planned things and always came up with creative gifts. Not to mention get him the gaming stuff he wanted... He bought me dinner that was it. I would ask him to come over and he never did. He was so stubborn. He liked to just be home and play games all the time. I finally had enough. I know i deserve better. I am angry but then i get sad because he is not even trying to contact me. All i wanted was for him to visit me and be more affectionate... So anyway I am trying to get by. I got two internships this summer so i will be busy but he is on my mind everyday. I get sad when my roommates bf is around or just in general. At night is the worst. I cannot sleep and I cry sometimes. 

I know i shouldnt contact him but it hurts all i think about is why is he not contacting me... He unfriended me on facebook he said if i broke up with him I never loved him... I do though. I am lost. I dont know how to deal with things. Why isn't he contacting me... why does it seem like he is not even sad. I feel like he has just moved on...

svmic,62,2012-04-27,"Is it a scam? It's probably a scam. List of experiences dealing with scams, scum, and deceit.  ",ckallas2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/svmic/is_it_a_scam_its_probably_a_scam_list_of/,"### First some background about me:

I graduated the University of Illinois in 2010 with a bachelors in political science and an associates in philosophy. I have taken grad school level statistics courses, had paid positions in political campaigns, am currently interning in the marketing department of a theatre (we've had Lewis Black, Jack Hanna, and we are going to have Brian Regan), and I have another summer marketing internship lined up at the local chamber of commerce.

I tell you all of this to let you know that anyone can fall for a scam job proposal. I have fallen, or nearly fallen for, several such offers over the years. Starting in high school I have probably averaged 1 scam job offer per year, these last three months not withstanding. Over these last three months I have received 12 job offers that were all too good to be true. The first several interviews I received (way back in high school) I treated with the utmost respect; trying to garner the favor of the conman/woman. I ignored my proper senses which all told me these places were basically being run by carnies telling me anything I wanted to hear. I have become intimately familiar with their schemes, pitches, long cons, and everything in between because I started going to these interviews for fun. Messing with the recruiter, informing others in my group interview how their schemes work, and generally causing a ruckus. Honestly doing this is more relaxing for me than getting a massage. Moving on. 

## Why does this matter to you? Well I can help you, the desperate job seeker, from being taken advantage of by scalawags and malcontents. Here is a short list of things for which to be on the look out. 

***

**1) They call you out of nowhere but insist you sent them your resume.** 

Everybody knows that the economy is terrible which translates into high unemployment. These companies know that job seekers must send out resumes *en mass* trying and snag a position, any position, with a legitimate company. When you update your online resume via careerbuilder, monster, or linkedin you are adding chum to the water and these sharks can smell it. 

How to combat this trick: Keep a list of companies that you send your resume to; make sure to include parent company. Now when their recruiter calls and says ""I'm calling about the resume you sent in to company X"" you can say ""I never sent a resume into company X"". This is one small step in getting the upper hand.

Similar Tactic: Sometimes companies will just tell you that they trawled your resume from monster/careerbuilder/linkedin. This gives you the upper hand immediately because you know how to proceed. Most companies do not grab low level resumes off of a resume website; they make potential candidates vie for position by listing the opening. This is the first red flag people should get.

**2) When they set up the interview they tell you how to dress. (Make sure to dress up!)**

This is a sign that the interview is not going to be legitimate. Most companies will give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dressing yourself, the ones that don't are generally trying to set a mood for the interview. They are going to have a group interview and they want each of you to look professional so that the illusion of legitimacy is maintained even when other candidates are present. 

**3) If they ever use the term 'multilevel marketing'.**

Most of you are familiar with this type of sales structure but I am going to give a quick rundown for those that are not. A multilevel marketing strategy (scheme) is basically a legalized pyramid scheme. The recruiter is trying to build a team. Each member of that team will be giving a percentage of each sale to the recruiter. They encourage you to recruit a team so that you can start making that sweet recruiter income. You, in turn, will encourage your team to recruit more members. In several iterations the population of the planet will be working for you! Imagine what kind of check you will receive then!

**4) They offer 'unlimited income'.**

If you just work hard enough you can make as much as you want. We have people making six figures a month. 

This phrase, and explanation, is just used to put the burden on your shoulders. If you don't succeed then it is *your* fault, not the fault of the company or the recruiter. They will impress you with figures like 'just three sales a day and you will be making $2000 per week and that doesn't include the residuals!' and 'average starting salary is $5000/month!'. Maybe some sales people are earning $2000/week (or $5000/month) but they don't work for this company. 

How to combat this trick: These types of companies are basically made of hubris. They will never expect that you will try to validate their numbers. That's why they generally have a 'top earners' newsletter. That newsletter will be prominently displayed in the waiting room. Read it and see what types of salaries their 'top earners' make. If they have a top ten list, as they often do, then notice the bottom four or five salaries. You will notice something frightening: they aren't making as much as the touted 'average salary' of a starting employee. If the 'top earners' aren't making $5000/month then how the hell can they claim that as the 'average' salary. 

**5) We offer a flexible schedule where you work the days you want and you are your own boss.**

Bullshit. The recruiter is going to be on your back everyday to get out there and sell. Even if they aren't you are looking at 12-14 hour days just driving around from potential sale to potential sale not actually selling anything. Your recruiter is your boss and your hours of operation are always. 

**6) During the interview they ask what salary you want to earn and then they say ""don't low-ball yourself; I see someone like you making 8-10 thousand dollars a month at least.""**

This is just poor baiting. They are making you feel inadequate about only wanting what you need to survive and they are, again, putting your failure (when it inevitable comes) directly on your shoulders. 'They knew you could do it, but you didn't work hard enough'. It's also an appeal to the kid in all of us who once thought that we could be making $100K/year.

How to combat this trick: Ask them how much they make a month. They will be taken aback but they will also be in 'sell mode' so they are not going to say ""I can't tell you that."" They are also not going to tell you what they make (because it is roughly equivalent to 1/20th of a pittance). They will make an allusion to a six figure income but don't believe it for one second. They barely scrape by but by getting you in on the gig they will barely scrape by more comfortably. Ask who makes their suits (because you want to buy one when you start making the big girl/boy dollars). If they say George then they are dressed in Wal-mart chic (which there is nothing wrong with but very unlikely when making $100K a year). If they say Armani, Gucci, etc ask to see the label. Call them out on everything. 

**7) They insist you pay for training/product to sell.** 

They will say things like 'well we have to insure that you have a drive to sell this product' or 'it's company policy that each employee own our brand of knives/shoes/insurance'. With a simple wave of the wand they have made you into a customer instead of an employee. If you need a certificate for a job, that makes sense. Some jobs require additional training. If they require you to buy the product you are trying to sell, run!

**8) It's going to be a three part interview. Group interview, panel interview, one on one interview.** 

Just say no to group interviews. These are just presentations designed to sell you the product. Your peers are there to create an atmosphere in which you are afraid to ask questions. It also makes their small office seem populated and hospitable instead of cold and dead (like the inside of the recruiter's heart)


**Epilogue)** That's my advice. It is not comprehensive but it is, I hope, helpful. Each of these things are red flags which means that some legitimate companies may employ some of these tactics. That doesn't legitimize the tactic but it means that you have to be extra vigilant. Remember: companies need to prove themselves to you just as much as you need to earn a place within them. If a company feels scammy, it is a scam!

Good luck job hunters; I hope I have helped.

This will be my first post on reddit, so lets see if I do this right.

So I got my new case in the mail yesterday and I was really excited about it. I started by taking out all the komponets that where in the old case and putting them into the new one. Old one was a mid tower, new one is a big tower. Then when I was done putting it all back together I put the power plug and one of my monitors in to see if everything was ok. It was not The light on the motherboard was lit but when i pressed the power button nothing happend. I then was going to take it all down to see if ther was anything I had done wrong. When i was about to unplug the monitor it suddenly started up but as soon at I moved my hand in any way it stoped again. i thyed aplying diffrent preasure to the graphics card and from ther on I could only get it to power up by doing that, it didn't even work sometimes. 

Things i have tryed to get it to work again are:
Removing the graphics card and only use the inbuilt graphics card in the motherboard. Didn't work.

The power supply is powerful enought to handle the power requirements. I even tryed without any case fans, only CPU cooler and SSD. Didn't work.

I have tryed mulible other tings that mostly would have worked on other computers I have worked with before. Non worked so far. 

I am currently working as a computer intern, got one year left to get my degree. A few of my friends has master degrees and simular grades in computer engenering, programing etc etc, no one of them knew after hours of trying all sorts of things what to do. 

This leavs me to seek help from my fellow redditors to see if anyone has anyide of what could be wrong and what i could do to fix it. 

This is a computer that has a price tag at about 3400$ that is just sitting there not working. 

Any sugestions?

Thanks in advance! :)

 Does anyone have links for resources for someone interested in learning shell? It's worth noting that I already program (C, ML, some Java)"

So here goes:

-I currently have a 3.57 LSAC GPA (plan on at least a 3.6 before graduation). Assuming I get a reasonable LSAT score (165-170), what are my chances of getting in to a top 20 school?

-Assuming that I do not get in to a top 20, would it even be worth it at this point, as far as my getting out of student loan debt is concerned, to pursue a career in patent law?

-I have two internships under my belt as well as several leadership positions in on campus organizations. Also, if all goes well I should be graduating with honors (honors program as well as academic honors). Will this have any basis on my being admitted? 

-I come from a white middle class family, and did not have any spectacular hardships growing up. What would be the best way to make my personal statement stand out if at all possible?

-Is a career in patent law, particularly in software and/or computer engineering if it matters, a satisfying career choice in the first place?

supo6,2,2012-04-26,How to deal with jealousy in early relationships,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/supo6/how_to_deal_with_jealousy_in_early_relationships/,"I'm 22M, and my girlfriend is 22F. We've been together for 5 months and it's going amazing.

However, I find myself having some jealousy issues. I'm not sure if this is normal for all guys in new relationships (this is my first relationship that lasted for more than a couple weeks/one night)

I am also her first boyfriend (she had a bunch of guys friendzoned and had a thing with another last summer, but that's it)

 
I have no reason not to trust her, but she is very VERY social and has a lot of guy friends.

We have seen each other every weekend except once in the past 4 months (she is on an internship away from our university).

Otherwise it makes me quite uncomfortable when she goes out drinking with some of her clients / co-workers. She works in a gym during her internship so obviously she is surrounded by a lot of guys. This hasn't been so bad, she usually texts me quite a lot during the evening and the next morning, but sometimes it's hard for me.

For example, last week we were going out for one of her girlfriend's birthday, and she invited the two guys from the gym she had met in her internship. This made me feel a bit uncomfortable when she told me she invited them them.. but I got over it. 

Obviously I talked to her about it once or twice. I told her I want to let her do what she wants, I don't mind her going out with guys at all, but it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes, and I hope she knows. Those discussions always go very well and she makes me feel a lot better right after. This being said, there is no way I well ever be THAT boyfriend who gets all pissy when his girl goes out, or who prevents her from going out (I know some guys who do this, sickens me)

This week it's been the worse ever though. She is in some all-exclusive resort in Mexico with 3 of her girlfriends for a week. I've been over-thinking about all kinds of stupid shit. The fact that she told me her friends were boring and she wants to make some new ones to go out and have fun makes me more paranoid. I obviously haven't heard from her since she left last Sunday. I know I should have nothing to worry about, but just thinking about how crushed I'd be if she came back and told me she hooked up with some guy makes me sick. (She couldn't tell a lie if her life depended on it, she would tell me right away).

So, is this normal? I've been told it's all about my confidence and stuff... But honestly I consider myself fairly self-confident, good-looking, on my way to a good job when I graduate, we share interests, I can satisfy her in bed etc... Basically I have REALLY nothing to worry about but I still do. 

So, how do you guys cope with jealousy, and does this happen to everyone in the early stages of a relationship?

TL;DR: Been in a relationship for 5 months and I'm a jealous fucker. Is this normal? How do I fix this."

Background: My mom's a pretty mean alcoholic and I've found pot in her room a bunch. I'm REALLY against drug and alcohol use.    

My boyfriend knows that. We used to argue about it a lot, and he would watch me cry (I never cry about anything other than this and family problems) and beg him not to drink when he visited his friends at other universities, but still do it. Eventually (a year and three months into the relationship), I gave him the ultimatum of drinking or being with me (because this really is a huge problem in my life, and I don't want to worry about it all the time and be unhappy with it), and he said that I was more important to him than doing those things with his friends.  

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out from a coworker that he had met my boyfriend at a party. I asked him about it and he said that he went, but I didn't have to worry about it. I asked if he drank and he said he did (even though he promised he wouldn't). After hours of unanswered texts, questions, and phone calls, he finally admitted to me that he's been smoking pot at least once a week for over a year.    

I broke up with him, but then we got back together a few days later.    

I don't know if I made the right choice. He's been nearly perfect with everything else; this is the only serious problem we've ever had.      

Back at the time of the ultimatum, he said that I was more important to him than doing that stuff. Well, now he's doing what I thought PLUS smoking, so what does that mean about my importance?    
He knows I struggle with feeling unimportant, and that I hate that my mom puts alcohol before me. But he's doing the same thing.    

Please help, I can't get this off my mind.     
Note: He told me that he's smoking tonight.  
For those of you saying that I'm too controlling, I'm really not. He's going off to an internship for the summer, and I'm okay with it. We're going to different colleges and I'm okay with it. We really only hang out like once or twice a week, and I'm okay with it. I'm not one of those people who's like, ""You have to call me/text me all the time."" If he's busy, he's busy. I don't care. I've never asked him of anything other than this.  

**TL;DR**- My boyfriend has been lying to me for over a year about smoking pot at least once a week, despite me being super against it. Should I stay with him? "

E30 M3, E46 M3, Z3 M coupe (E39 M5, but v8 fuel mileage scares me). Porsche 911, Hyundai Genesis Coupe, Mazda Rx8.

I will probably try and pick a car up from the SF Bay area this summer. I also spend a lot of time in Portland in Seattle if that matters.

TL;DR: Help find me a RWD sports coupe for ~$20,000. 

Edit: I've driven the E30 M3 and my family owns an E30 318is.

I'm currently studying Computer Science. I may possibly hold off from buying until I graduate. But I figure it would be convenient to grab a car in the SF Bay area while I am down there for an internship and then drive it up north when I am done (it seems to have the best used car market). "

_____  
When any of the people in my life ask me why i stopped being a christian i always say ""it's a real long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised christian and when i got into high school is when i really cranked up the jesus juice. I became a part of first priority (a christian group at my school) i even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. i was in, 100 percent in. You see the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""the love of christ"". so when i got done with high school i did not really know what i wanted, i was always interested in psychology and sociology so i though maybe a therapist. so i left my hometown to discover what it was that i wanted out of my life. Then everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, i loved that family as if it was my own) in the town i moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. well i had a sit down with the pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me) and asked me if i would become the ""youth leader"" for the high school group. i of course accepted thinking this is what god had planned for me. if it was, god is a cruel bastard. do not get me wrong, i loved the kids i was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast, i got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. all these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them and i did my best to help. then the fateful day came, you see i had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that, i held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. my pastor came to me and asked how devoted i was to this group and these kids, i of course, said that i was completely devoted so he told me that god had a plan. i should have asked ""why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not, i asked what i could do. he told me that i had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"" he said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all i had to do was do this internship and after i would be a pastor. well i had not gone to or taken any college classes and i was really excited about it. a pastor, now there is a job i can be proud of. so i was swept up and within a month i was enrolled. then they paid my first months rent and i was set to go. i had my ""interview"" which was a joke. they gave me a tour of a church i had already been too and talked up the program and then told me i was in. well on my first day i felt like a fish out of water i did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than i ever was to mine, they basically lived there. not to mention the man that was in charge of it all pastor dan. he was a real life, grown up bully. he made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man  (who was a 50 something year old man) i was there with my church. i should take a minute to explain my church siuation, you see there are these things called ""chain churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state and they all answer to the same head pastor guy in a bigger city. well the church i was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where i attended the internship. in the internship it was myself and another guy and we drove the 50 miles four days out of the week to be at the church by six. and immediately for some reason pastor dan began making my life more difficult and making petty jokes about my fingers (i have two missing fingers on my left hand). it was an awful experience but i kept going cause at the end of the day all i wanted was to help these kids. well as you may have guessed the church stopped paying my rent and food and with the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm) i could not find a job. the pastor from the church i was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man i was at the internship with. and that is when it got really bad. you see the family that i was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave, you see i was 20 by then and i had a circle of friends that i was very close with and not all of them went to my church and some no church at all. i want to pause here again, i can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane, they

syqq4,3,2012-04-29,So here is my story about religion,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/syqq4/so_here_is_my_story_about_religion/,"When any of the people in my life ask me why i stopped being a christian i always say ""it's a real long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised christian and when i got into high school is when i really cranked up the jesus juice. I became a part of first priority (a christian group at my school) i even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. i was in, 100 percent in. You see the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""the love of christ"". so when i got done with high school i did not really know what i wanted, i was always interested in psychology and sociology so i though maybe a therapist. so i left my hometown to discover what it was that i wanted out of my life. Then everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, i loved that family as if it was my own) in the town i moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. well i had a sit down with the pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me) and asked me if i would become the ""youth leader"" for the high school group. i of course accepted thinking this is what god had planned for me. if it was, god is a cruel bastard. do not get me wrong, i loved the kids i was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast, i got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. all these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them and i did my best to help. then the fateful day came, you see i had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that, i held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. my pastor came to me and asked how devoted i was to this group and these kids, i of course, said that i was completely devoted so he told me that god had a plan. i should have asked ""why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not, i asked what i could do. he told me that i had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"" he said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all i had to do was do this internship and after i would be a pastor. well i had not gone to or taken any college classes and i was really excited about it. a pastor, now there is a job i can be proud of. so i was swept up and within a month i was enrolled. then they paid my first months rent and i was set to go. i had my ""interview"" which was a joke. they gave me a tour of a church i had already been too and talked up the program and then told me i was in. well on my first day i felt like a fish out of water i did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than i ever was to mine, they basically lived there. not to mention the man that was in charge of it all pastor dan. he was a real life, grown up bully. he made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man  (who was a 50 something year old man) i was there with my church. i should take a minute to explain my church siuation, you see there are these things called ""chain churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state and they all answer to the same head pastor guy in a bigger city. well the church i was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where i attended the internship. in the internship it was myself and another guy and we drove the 50 miles four days out of the week to be at the church by six. and immediately for some reason pastor dan began making my life more difficult and making petty jokes about my fingers (i have two missing fingers on my left hand). it was an awful experience but i kept going cause at the end of the day all i wanted was to help these kids. well as you may have guessed the church stopped paying my rent and food and with the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm) i could not find a job. the pastor from the church i was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man i was at the internship with. and that is when it got really bad. you see the family that i was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave, you see i was 20 by then and i had a circle of friends that i was very close with and not all of them went to my church and some no church at all. i want to pause here again, i can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane, they would be the ones who i would complain to about the emotional torment i endured because of dan and the others at the internship. they were amazing and i could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. but back to the story, if i were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family i was staying with would lock me out. sometimes i would stay with friends, sometimes i would stay in a

sykc5,0,2012-04-29,Job Offer: be my Secretary / Coach,garoththorp,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/sykc5/job_offer_be_my_secretary_coach/,"**TL;DR** I'll pay you (negotiable: 50$/week) to manage my schedule and nag me to get things done on time.

I think the greatest challenge I've had during my stay at school has been time management. I'm just awful at it. The related problem is that it's taken me a few years and several failed courses to realize that this is something I'm terrible at. What I need is someone to pretty much make me accountable for my time, and force me, contractually to do the things that I should be doing -- while resisting the urge to point out how much of a lazy arse I am.

**So here's my proposition:**

I pass off some fairly simple tasks to you, such as handing you my assignment papers and having you make sure my calendar is correctly kept. Then once the datapoints are there for when I need to have things in by, you'd figure out about how long it'd take, and schedule time for me to do it -- and check back later to make sure that I'm actually on track. Basically, the goal is to ""mentor"" me to get my stuff done on time, and create accountability.

I don't generally require tutoring or anything of that sort; I'm just lazy. This position would basically be a cross between an executive assistant style job, and a coaching style job where you yell at me do extra pushups.

My only prerequisite for this position would be that you're also not a lazy sort of person, so some proof of you actually getting stuff done in your own time would be nice (decent grades or something). I guess some psychology courses would be helpful, though not mandatory.

I figure a fair salary would be about 50$ a week -- since really, it shouldn't take much time at all to manage a calendar and phone / text me occasionally. Should go a long way to covering weekly living costs if you're trying to save money. We can negotiate the price when we meet.

Anyway, so just send me a private message on Reddit here for extra information / to schedule a time to meet up on campus. Thanks for reading.

**My Background:**

I'm a 22 year old male computer scientist. I've finished all of my internships and am on my last few semesters of school. In general, I'm a fairly sociable guy and interested in philosophy and startups. In my spare time, I like to play board games and video games -- the usual."

sye9z,11,2012-04-29,RPG: innovation concerning quests?,zegazefazfa,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/sye9z/rpg_innovation_concerning_quests/,"Hi,

I've been playing RPGs for a long time (lands of lore, might and magic 4/5, BG1/2, fallouts, morrowind, witchers, skyrim...) and been enjoying them at different level (I have to admit that I've been kinda disapointed in the more recent ones, and more and more seeing thru the ""tricks"" of gameplay/mechanics now more than before). Lands of Lore still feels like the game where I was the most immersed, I was younger, and did not ""see through"" the gameplay but just enjoyed the story and atmosphere.

Now what is my problem? Quests (and stories).

I don't know if it's me getting older (29) or just having worked for the industry for a brief time (game design internship @ ubisoft) but I can't help but call off the bullshit of the way games are rolling out in front of my eyes: get this, pick this, kill x, go there, hide and kill y, wait in the dark ... 

Now that I'm older **it seems that the story is just a way to interconnect gameplay/mechanics one after another** and not the other way around (gameplay supporting the story). Everything feels cheap.


*The Basics*  
- My question is, is it possible to get rid of the fetch/kill quests that make up 99% of the actions were supposed to do?

*The false innovation*  
- And even the so called innovative gameplay is most of the time gimmicks. Meaning, that you ""feel"" that you are just here to roll out the specific gameplay, the ""scene"" was just waiting for you to do as told and that's it. (the way they inject random ""new"" gameplay mechanics at some point of the game (sneak, snipe...))

----------------------
**Quick idea:**  
Most of times it seems that the quests (3 basic types fetch/kill/find) are the way the story advance. So you're not living the story but you're just makeing it advance acting as you are told to within the framework of these mechanics.

(a)--&gt;(b1/b2/b3)--&gt;(c1/c2/c3)

If you are in city A and the story must roll out towards city B, you're not going there on you're own, for you own reasons (except maybe in Morrowind, very unique game), you go there because you have to go thru a specific task.

See, stories in RPGs are often a series of tasks. If you realize that, you feel cheated. When I was 12 I could pretend I didnt see that, now I can't anymore (I am struggling to finish skyrim because of that).

An idea I had, would be that the story plays out, with you going along the world, geographically or timely or with dialogues, and ACTIONS/EVENTS happen along the way.

Take Skyrim such a big WASTED, i repeat, wasted, by making you go from point a to b to c to d, in a crazy manner, zig zaging across the map! It's insane.

Proof? I often try to FORCE myself to roleplay (miss things, walk more, take actions that are more in character rather than mix maxing, try to travel in a logical way - ie not jumping from quests to quests like a mad man across the map)  to kinda enjoy the game! WHAT a gamedesign if the player has to PRETEND and BEND the gameplay in order to enjoy it!

I would like, once, a game where the kill/fetch quests are the exception. Let say you are the hero warrior, so you start somewhere, and then take on a journey with friends, to a certain direction and things HAPPEN along the way! not the other way around (things happening force you to travel &lt; you lose control, you're  puppet just pushing button to make the story advance!)

In some ways, older FPS (doom) are way more logical! You move forward the world, and things happen : magic and amazements!

Can we discuss this? Thank you."

[Hint: hit enter twice to create a break/paragraph.  Wall of text is difficult to read.  With that out of the way, thanks for the AMA, it sounds interesting.  What are the salaries like for your work?  Or is it more like contractor work, paid by the job?  I would think public speaking skills are important, to appear credible/likeable if you need to testify in court. I'm assuming court testimony is part of the deal, but have no clue - is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7zk?context=5)|Salaries are competitive with those of Civil Engineers in conventional areas. Yes, testimony can be part of the deal. But most of the time a case will never see the court room.
[Could you go into more detail about photogrammetry, e.g. what it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hrqoy?context=5)|This gives a good rundown of a program called PCRect we use for rectifying oblique photographs into plan view.

[What's your total station setup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpyqp?context=5)|I have a sokkia SET 513 with an HP data collector.
[Can you post some sort of proof?  Like a copy of your certificate from the accident reconstruction course? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hotno?context=5)|I'm working on this, give me a sec. I'm answering more questions.
[What is the most bizarre accident you've ever had to reconstruct? One that really made you wonder how the hell they managed it?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hogw5?context=5)|My boss told me about the case, which happened long before I started doing this type of work. Based on the story he told me, I requested the set of depositions. My intention was to write a story based on them; they are Cohen Brothers script quality stories. I need to put it in motion.
[Is it harder to reconstruct an accident when ABS brakes are involved (due to fewer skid marks\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoj8r?context=5)|Slightly harder, but nowadays vehicles are equipped to record a long period of pre-crash data through the Airbag system. This, along with damage to the vehicle tells the rest of the story.
[How much historical data do those units record, i.e. is it recorded if the airbag doesn't deploy, and how far back does the information go?  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpeeb?context=5)|There are two types of events that are recorded in the Airbag module. Most auto manufacturers since about the year 2000 are equipped with such devices. This varies from make to make. The event can be a deployment event, in which the bumper sensor tells the computer to deploy the airbag; usually at higher speeds. Also, non deployments get recorded at times, these are low speed impacts which tell the computer not to deploy the airbag. The amount of time and data recorded vary. Typically you'll see information such as driver seat buckle on or of, speed 5 seconds before deployment, brake on or of, accelerator throttle, etc.
[Do you need some sort of authorization from the owner to get this information from the airbag module?  EDIT: 'Black boxes' (event data recorders\) mandatory for new cars in 2015. Source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uy?context=5)|This varies from state to state. In my state, It is necessary for us to fill out a form signed by whoever has taken ownership of the vehicle post accident.
[So bumper sensors actually exist? I didn't think cars actually had airbag deployment sensors housed in the bumper, it sounds like an easy way to have an accidental deployment. I thought they deployed based on the input from a few accelerometers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hstus?context=5)|It's a combination of both: [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag#How_airbags_work)
[If I wanted to remove the computer after an accident, where would I look for it?  Different on every car I'm sure, but you must know some general ltips (under the hood, inside the dash, you tell me.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hrp8k?context=5)|[Link to www.cdr-system.com](http://www.cdr-system.com/pdf/CDR_v5.0_Vehicle_Coverage_List.pdf)
 |It's usually under the driver's seat in the center tunnel.
[Cool! What kind of a background do you have in terms of education? I can imagine many subjects which would be beneficial, but none that would encompass all of the skills I presume need to be possessed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hom9n?context=5)|I have a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering as well as several accident reconstruction and software courses.
[Whow. you were a civil engineer and switched into this ? If you dont mind me asking, what is the more lucrative career ? (I'm on my way to becoming a civil engineer. I don't ask because I plan to switch, just because I'm curious\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htdt0?context=5)|They're pretty well aligned monetarily, though in this line of work I travel a whole lot.
[The National Society of Professional Surveyors (NSPS\) had a student competition on forensic surveying a couple years back. Here's a write-up I found.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hshlt?context=5)|There is an 8 hr test which makes an applicant ACTAR certified. It's not as hard as the PE.
[What state do you work in? Is there some kind of licensure procedure, like PE, but for reconstructionists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hshlt?context=5)|[Link to www.actar.org](http://www.actar.org)
[Ah thanks, and is it fight-club-like travel i.e. short, in/out trips or do you ever get time off to sight-see etc ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htgns?context=5)|Travel varies from  2 days to 4 or so. I get to meet a lot of interesting people and eat at a lot of great hidden treasure like places. From time to time I'll end up in a city where I know people and we'll have dinner, etc.
[Has the job changed the way you drive? Are you more wary of the dangers of driving, or put off certain brands of car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp0i7?context=5)|My job has changed the way drive indeed. I try to be very observant while driving through intersections. 
[If I'm driving behind someone and they purposefully slam their brakes to get me to rear end them, and there are no witnesses, can you prove that the accident was their fault?  And how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4homro?context=5)|It'd be difficult to prove that. The gold standard seems to be that the rear ender is usually at fault. If you can prove that his brake lights were not functioning before the collision, then you may have a case.
[Is it remotely possible to prove that the brake lights weren't working? Without the use of a dash-cam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4houpa?context=5)|There's a method in which you analyze the filament of a light bulb of a car involved in a collision. If it's streched it means the lights were hot (on) when it got struck, if it's a brittle fracture it's likely the lights were off. This makes a decent argument.
[Is it possible, at least in some scenarios, to examine tire marks to determine what happened? you'd think that the front driver suddenly slamming on the breaks would leave a trail on the asphalt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp2bm?context=5)|Yes. The deceleration rate (usually in units of g's or gravity-32.2 ft/s) is dependent upon condition of tires (new or old), surface details (new asphalt, grass, etc) and weather surfaces (rain, snow). A typical deceleration rate is 0.7 g's for normal wear tires on pavement.
[But if you get rear ended the tail lights more often than not get damaged. what happens if the lightbulbs were crushed in the accident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp6dh?context=5)|You'd be surprised how well the filament will hold up 
[How much fun is it, after you've investigated the skid patterns, debris, etc. to prove in court that someone was clearly lying about their speed, etc.?  Also, what's the craziest accident you've ever had to reconstruct, or the most challenging?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hobqv?context=5)|Challenging involves multiple vehicles usually. There was this one where a tractor trailer was coming down a ramp at a rapid speed while merging onto the highway, the truck flipped on its side and vehicles traveling on the highway collided with it. There was a ton of evidence marks and speeds had to be determined for three different vehicles.
[How did you get into that line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoaf2?context=5)|I started an internship while in college, liked it and stuck with it. 
[What is the most fucked up accident you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpe9c?context=5)|There was one where a farm vehicle was carrying a large wooden post horizontally and aligned with the horizon for approaching traffic (I hope that makes sense). He was driving on the side of the road and the wooden post was hovering above the lane of travel. A passenger truck drove through it and it seemed as thought the passenger who got hit by the post had literally exploded.  The farm owner was liable for damages.
[Do you work for a state, city or county agency?  How long was the course you had to take to become an accident reconstructionist (yes, it is not something you just learn ""on the job""\)?  How many years have you done this? and of course, worst accidents you've had to be on scene for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hox3w?context=5)|I work for an independent third party. I've gone through several courses. I have a BS in Civil Engineering and took a 2 week course in Northwestern University. I've been doing this now for 7 yrs. Worst accidents are usually the ones involving families and head on collisions. There was one where the truck driver was impinged onto a tractor trailer while it was on fire. He was still alive and communicating before he died. I get to read many pages of depositions where all the unpleasant details come out.
[Do you find that people driving larger (non-commercial\) vehicles tend to cause more accidents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hovcf?context=5)|That's a loaded question. Kidding. Well truck drivers are operating a machine about 16 times the weight of the average passenger vehicle and traveling at similar speeds. They carry more energy and have a larger tendency to be involved in accidents. Also their perception/reaction time is longer so they have less distance to work with.
[Do you ever analyze vehicles that were struck by a train? If so, does that involve different or more complex analysis than car-on-car collisions?  What's your hourly rate? Does it change for serving as an expert witness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7p0?context=5)|A train decelerates much much slower than tires on pavement. Investigating an accident involving a train requires permission from the railroad companies as well as research and evidence documentation. Were there cross bucks and gates? Lights? As far as methodology, it can be analyzed as a conservation of momentum case.

I am not from that state, but I am a member because I took a course with them. Accident Reconstruction associations are generally reputable; most of them are made up of ex-police officers.
[So, my dad is a Marine Corps lifer.. and for a good portion of his career as a military police officer he doubled as an accident investigator. For a long time, he had a sawed in half tire filled with cement and a chain hanging out of it that lived in our garage. I assume it was some homemade instrument he used for teaching himself about tread marks.. I dunno. Anyway, during this particular part of his career I was conveniently learning how to drive. He decided one evening to show me pictures of some investigations he had been working on in an effort to scare me into driving more safely. It worked. I got my own Red Asphalt lesson right in our living room. My question is... have there been any particular accidents that have really shaken you or stuck with you throughout your career? Do you feel you drive more carefully knowing things like how fast your car will continue to travel after you hit the brakes if you're going 80 down the highway?  *Edit* - I accidentally a word.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpjki?context=5)|That's called a drag sled ([Link to www.gazettenet.com](http://www.gazettenet.com/files/images/20100524-232949-pic-5669238.display.jpg))
 |Police photos of a really bad accident are not very pleasant, but I've become a little more desensitized over time. I imagine people in the medical field have to adjust similarly. Working around death certainly lets me know to live my personal life to the fullest. And I'm not perfect driver, but I abide by all driving laws and try to share the road as much as possible.

[Curious if you subscribe to the same sort of skepticism presented by the narrator in Fight Club when he's talking about analyzing accidents for the big corps. Do you feel there is that sort of jaded humanity-minimization element in the car industry, having seen their work first hand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htauc?context=5)|Well this element can be translated well into other fields like the food industry for example. It was striking to find out that there are economic analysis companies that will put a pricetag on how much a deceased person involved in an accident is worth, based on age, profession and expected lifespan.
[How do you feel working with cars in which people have died?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp62i?context=5)|It's strange to come across brain matter and other bodily fluids during a vehicle inspection; certainly not my cup of tea.

Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp3cj?context=5)|I believe an insurance adjustor commented on an earlier thread that most of insurance fraud is medical billing. People generally lie about how fast they were going.
[What percentage of accidents you've investigated actually involved fraud, e.g. people intentionally crashing into things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp76w?context=5)|This is a very low percentage. Fraud usually comes in the form of people claiming hail damage when a closer look reveals that the marks were done by small hammer or so.
[Why do you use the term accident, as opposed to crash or incident?  Some are quite clearly done on purpose.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoozz?context=5)|Accident and collision are interchangeable.

More and more forensic science is being shown to be lacking in accuracy, to put it nicely.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpfbj?context=5)|I'd have to say that experience is a major factor in this field. I work under people who've done it for over two decades and the amount of info they can deduct upon barely driving up to an accident scene is amazing.
[How hard it is to determine whether someone crashed their car on purpose or was just driving recklessly?  I assume some people would take out life insurance and try to off themselves driving into a bridge pillar at 220km/h.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp2w5?context=5)|We've only investigated a couple of suicides and they involved pedestrians jumping in front of big trucks. To determine approach, it helps to know the driver's tendencies and state of mind at the time of accident. This comes to light eventually.
[My girlfriend was stopped behind a car making a left turn and was rearended. Her rear axel was torn off and the car that hit her ended up under her jeep. She was pushed into the car in front of her with minimal damage. And there were no skid marks. The girl who hit her got off scot free and my girlfriend got points on her license and a fine for reckless driving. The judges and trooper were friends of the family of the girl who hit her. My question is... even though both insurance companies went to arbitration and the girl hitting my girlfriend was found 100 percent liable... how the fuck was the accident reconstruction information inadmissible in her court proceeding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hprhh?context=5)|Did your gf's insurance company hire an expert?

[Which car company do you work for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpkpc?context=5)|We're a third party company. We get hired by insurance companies, attorneys, car makers.
[What do you feel has been the most important case you've worked on? Have you ever felt as though you have been the main reason a certain case was decided for/against someone?

Has anyone ever threatened you or intimidated you because of your testimony?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsger?context=5)|We do a lot of visibility testing. In fact, we have these glasses with a camera dot on the center of the eyes. We get a hold of someone the same height to wear them in the driver seat and record different points of view. This tool proved important in a case where a truck driver didn't see a pedestrian crossing as he accelerated after being stopped and therefore collided with the pedestrian. The case settled for an undisclosed amount.
[Is there any make or model of car that you wouldn't buy based on some insight you gained from your line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uk?context=5)|Well I would just stay away from a vehicle like the mini cooper or anything that's so low and small that it may give you a disadvantage against a larger and more common vehicle, like a Ford F150.
[Is text messaging at the time of the accident frequently looked into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uk?context=5)|Over the past few years I've noticed more and more attorneys request phone records of people involved in accidents to see if they may have been texting or on the phone at the time of the accident.
[I drive a reconstructed vehicle which has previously been in an accident. How much more difficult would that make your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqzcu?context=5)|If your vehicle has a salvage title, chances are that after it was rebuilt, the airbags were not present. If these are not present, then there is no report filed by the module.  As far as analyzing the damage to your vehicle, we usually run a carfax report on the vehicles we investigate for that same reason.
[In a middle school math class, we had a police officer come in to give us an overview of accident reconstruction (specifically using skid marks and thugs to determine speed at an accident...many years ago do I don't remember much\).

How closely do you work with LEOs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqzcu?context=5)|We have a good working relation with the local Police department.
[I have always wondered this. With the increase in vehicle safety systems, such as 10 airbag equipped vehicles, preemptive brakes, pre tensioning belts and rollover sensors, are people surviving auto crashes better then vehicles without these systems in place? I drive a 98 Lexus ES300. Am i more likely to die in a collision in that vehicle versus a 2012 Lexus with more advanced safety features?

Obviously the more airbags you add the better. Side curtains make a vehicle safer. My boss switched from Ford to Nissan a few years back because Nissan offers side airbags.
[I'm currently taking a course on Traffic Theory (Criminal Justice degree\) and we just studied a major 3-scene crash that happened on I-43 near Sheboygan, WI, in 2002. 50 vehicles were involved, 39 people injured, and 10 people fatally injured.

[Thanks for doing the AMA your work seems very interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hs81a?context=5)|As far as tricks of the trade goes I can think of only a couple of things. A major tip I can share is that if you're ever involved in a vehicular accident, whether it's your fault or not, take a high amount of photographs and remember that everything you say initially will end up in a police document at one point or another. If the accident is severe enough, hire an attorney. We live in a litigious society.
[How much data is being recorded by the car?  How many of driving is recorded at a given time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsaq8?context=5)|This varies from  make to year of manufacture.

What variables are commonly used? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqvji?context=5)|We use a number of programs for different functions. PC Crash is a brilliant piece of software for simulation/animation of accidents. We also use AutoCAD and Sketchup video trial exhibits.
[Can you tell if someone's headlights or turn signal were on at the time of a collision?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqied?context=5)|Inspecting the filament int he bulb, if stretchted it's likely it was running hot (on) when the collision happened. This is known as hot shock. If the break of the filament is brittle or if it's undamaged, it's likely the lights were off. This is cold shock.
[Saw that you have a BS in civil engineering, and was wondering if this was a job you could get with any bachelors degree or if you had to be more specialized? I realize you went through some specific training, but did the engineering degree make it easier to be accepted into the more specialized training?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htxrs?context=5)|There are ex-police officers who do this, but generally an engineering firm will have more credibility because of a solid background knowledge of mathematics and physics. This job is suited for a civil (because of the transportation aspect of it) and mechanical (because of vehicular failures in brakes, engine, etc.) engineer. Yes, the engineering degree made it much easier.
[Personally, I have a bachelors and masters degree in music, but would like to switch careers for a little while (just burnt out of the music scene\).

Will taking that two week course at Northwestern help (I am right here in Chicago\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsudv?context=5)|It's usually the company who would pay for something like that, but if you can't get employment after a while, it may be a good investment to look into. I would recommend getting a linked in account and preparing a nice profile of your resume. Also, ""follow"" and join groups relating to this field; i.e. forensic engineering companies and accident reconstruction as well.
[Also, when you reconstruct accidents, can you tell by the angle at which the tire rutting departs from the roadway whether the driver was executing an evasive maneuver or just drifted off the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4i074o?context=5)|The heading angle of skids and how gradual the drift is can be helpful if there are pre-skids left, other wise only impact gouges tell whether somebody drifted onto oncoming traffic, etc.
[Did this change the way you drive somehow? What are the most common mistakes you've seen that have caused accidents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq2r9?context=5)|Well the nastiest accidents involve vehicles crashing at high speeds in opposite direction (head on collision). These tend to happen on two lane divided highways (usually about 75MPH speed limit). People drive tired, or are distracted somehow and go left of center.
[If you're still in Illinois, were you part of the investigation of the crash that killed 3 teens in Prospect Heights or had any insider info in that case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsa37?context=5)|No I was not.

I have even gotten letters in the mail trying to recruit me, I assume they got my info from the list of PE's in my state.  So is your field *really* short on engineers right now? Is this some sort of scam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hu6v9?context=5)|Well anytime multiple vehicles are involved, all attorneys will schedule vehicle inspections so that all experts involved are present at the same time. In my part of the country, there does not seem to be a shortage.
[Is there a way to get information on an accident that occurred more than 30 years ago?  Also, is it possible to use that information, should it conflict with an official story or confirm a suspicion, as evidence for wrongful death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqlzr?context=5)|The more time has passed since an event, the more difficult is to work with and to prove.

I am currently a senior (c/o 2013) in college pursing majors in Philosophy and Political Science and a minor in Computer Science. I had initially planned to go to law school after graduating, but after spending two years working as a paralegal, I realized law is not for me, but Computer Science, in fact, is.

As I am so far into my degree program already (24 credits stand between me and graduation at this point), I have settled for minoring in Computer Science and keeping my original majors. I realize that a minor in CS will not get me anywhere employment-wise, so I am looking into applying to and enrolling in a “transitional” Computer Science master’s program aimed at people moving into CS from a non-technical field.

I have a few questions related to my situation:

* Will potential employers look down on me for having an undergraduate background in a non-technical field, or will the fact that I’m pursuing graduate education entirely trump that? 

* What can I do over this last year of undergrad to make myself an attractive candidate to potential employers despite my non-traditional background? I doubt I’ll be able to get a relevant internship since I’m only a minor and not a major, so what sorts of personal projects should I be looking into buff up my resume? Any ideas on networking to make contacts in the field?

* Am I being fatalistic to assume that I won’t be able to find work in the field until I complete my master’s and thus have a bona-fide CS degree or will I be able to job hunt with any degree of reasonable success once  I have a CS master’s in progress?

* Is there anything else I should know that I’ve failed to even touch upon?

Thanks for the help!"

I am applying for the Human Resources Internship position within your company as posted on www.internships.com. With the knowledge I have of working on deadline, handling numerous tasks at one time, and my capability to successfully manage duties independently, I know my experience will be an asset to this position.

 

In a previous position, I worked as a Work Study Assistant within Penn State’s Human Resources Development Center. In this position, I worked closely with HRDC employees in researching and compiling data for upcoming campus-wide programs and presentations. I often worked with multiple computer documents simultaneously, proofread and edited various documents, and prepared our facility for upcoming public presentations. I also performed general office duties including filing, copying, faxing, and assisting with project work. I developed the ability to handle assigned tasks in an independent fashion, and consistently returned finished work to my superiors in a timely manner.

 

In addition, I am comfortable and skilled at working in an office setting, and have a mind for details and organization. I am very talented in working with technology, and I am proficient in the Adobe and Microsoft Office programs, and can work on either a Windows system or a Mac.


I am always willing to put in that extra time in order to ensure a more perfect product; I am able to withstand a stressful environment, and remain productive and level-headed. I am a hard worker and quick to learn, and would greatly value the opportunity to intern at your company.

 

I am happy to answer any questions regarding this letter or the attached résumé. I look forward to speaking further with you at your convenience!

 

Sincerely,

 

Herpina"

szabq,1,2012-04-30,My Story On Religion (Fixed),[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/szabq/my_story_on_religion_fixed/,"When any of the people in my life ask me why I stopped being a Christian, I always say ""It's a really long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised Christian. When I got into High School is when I really cranked up the Jesus juice though. I became a part of First Priority (A Christian group at my school). I even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. I was 100 percent in. You see, the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""The Love of Christ"". When I got done with High School I did not really know what I wanted, I was always interested in Psychology and Sociology so I though maybe a Therapist. 
*So I left my hometown to discover what it was that I wanted out of my life. That's when everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, I loved that family as if it was my own) In the town I moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. Well I had a sit down with the Pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me). He asked me If I would become the ""Youth Leader"" for the High School Youth Group. I, of course, accepted thinking this Is what god had planned for me. If it was, god is a cruel bastard. Don't get me wrong, I loved the kids I was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast. I got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. All these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them, and i did my best to help. Then the fateful day came. You see, I had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that. I held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. 
*My pastor came to me and asked how devoted I was to this group and these kids. I, of course, said that I was completely devoted, so he told me that god had a plan for me. I should have asked ""Why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not. I asked what iI could do. He then told me that I had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"". He said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all I had to do was do this internship. Afterwords I would be a Pastor. Well, I had not gone to or taken any college classes and I was really excited about it. A Pastor, now there is a job I can be proud of. So I was swept up and within a month I was enrolled. Then they paid my first months rent and I was set to go. I had my ""interview"" which was a joke. They gave me a tour of a church I had already been to and talked up the program, then told me I was in. Well, on my first day I felt like a fish out of water. 
*I did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than I ever was to mine. They basically lived there. Not to mention the man that was in charge of it all, Pastor Dan. He was a real life, grown up bully. He made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man (who was a 50 something year old man) I was there within my church. I should take a minute to explain my church situation. You see, there are these things called ""Chain Churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state, but they all answer to the same Head Pastor guy in a bigger city. Well, the church I was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where I attended the internship. In the internship, it was myself plus another guy and we drove the 50 miles, four days out of the week to be at the church by six o'clock. Immediately, for some reason, Pastor Dan began making my life more difficult and made petty jokes about my fingers (I have two missing fingers on my left hand from an accident). It was an awful experience, but I kept going cause at the end of the day all I wanted was to help these kids. Well, as you may have guessed, the church stopped paying my rent and food. With the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm), I could not find a job. The Pastor from the church I was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man I was at the internship with. 
That is when it got really bad. You see, the family that I was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave. I was 20 by then and I had a circle of friends that I was very close with and not all of them went to my church, with some no church at all. I want to pause here again, I can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane. They would be the ones who I would complain to about the emotional torment I endured because of Pastor Dan and the others at the internship. They were amazing and I could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. Back to the story! If I were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family I was staying with would lock me out. Sometimes I would stay with friends. Sometimes I would stay in a car, and a couple times I stayed in my old house (It had not been rented out yet, and I still had the key). To some that seems reasonable, but the thing was, even if they were awake they would not come to the door to let me in. Sometimes the acceptable time to come home was 9, sometimes it was 8, sometimes it was even after dinner around 6. I had no way of knowing when I came home whether I would have a place to sleep or not. Meanwhile back at the Legion of Doom (I had to), the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of High School. 
*Now, out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me. I will always respect them for that. The others, were not so accepting. Once again, I felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church. For Pastor Dan had been sending my Pastor letters and emails about my dismal performance at the internship. To be fair, I was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did, Pastor Dan would have some petty comment to say to me. So I just gave up. Fast forward about two months and I was living with my parents in my old house from high school. I still had to find a way to Ludington (town with church without internship) every weekend ( Because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). After the first year of the internship, I had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in (Ludington). 
*So I moved back up with yet another church connection. After two days, their mind was changed. I moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. Needless to say it was an awful experience. I pushed through and tried to find a job where I did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. I had enough. I was fortunate enough to move in with one of the friends I mentioned before. I never did find a job in that town, but I lived rent free with that friend for almost a year before i moved back to my hometown with my dad. I left the church I stepped down from. Now, that is not how I became an Atheist, that is simply why I left the church. When I did, I researched the other side. Read Dawkins, read Sagan, read anything I could get on the ""World without the god glasses"". That is how I became an Atheist. I would have never done that if I never left the church though. You see, we had a strict reading list being a part of Church Leadership. It was not a list of books to read, it was a list of books not read. At the top of the list was ""The God Delusion"" by Dawkins. After I left, I immediately read it and realized why I was not supposed to. It makes perfect sense. I, someday, would like to thank him for writing that book as many former christians would. I hope someday to be able to do that.
So that is it r/atheism. I did not write this for sympathy, I wrote this to show people what I have been through in the name of religion. I still have lingering guilt and a sometimes crippling fear of hell (Even though i know its illogical), but I am 23 now, living on my own in a house and working to go to school in April of next year. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

I was really excited when I first heard the message. It was after 6 PM when I heard the voicemail, so I planned on calling back first thing Friday morning. But all night I thought about all the reasons why I wouldn't be good for this job. All the interview questions I have fucked up in the past. I think about all the other recent engineering grads from the nearby Ivy League school who probably got calls from this company, too and have much more technical and internship experience than me.

I woke up Friday and said ""OK, I'll call at 10 AM"". 10 AM came and I said ""OK, I'll call at 3 PM"". And then 3 came and went and I was just too afraid to do it. Now if I find the confidence to even do it tomorrow morning, I'm convinced that 2 working days just too much time to pass to return this call and the HR person will think I'm lazy and that I don't care.

I have a lot of trouble with ""selling myself"".

I'm 22, just graduated from college and am applying for engineering jobs. The process is stressing me out the past few months so much that I'm sabotaging myself. Last month, I scheduled a phone interview (for a different company) in advance, and then psyched myself out too much and then sat and watched my phone ring when the time came for the call.

Instead of trying to think of the good things I've done and spin my failures into positives, all I can think of are the things I've done wrong on projects in school and reasons why I would be a failure in the working world. All weekend I've sat here worrying about waking up Monday morning and being faced with having to return this call and how I can convince an HR person that I'm good enough for this job when I really don't think that I am.

I feel depressed for feeling depressed. What company wants to hire someone who feels so terribly about herself? I'm a pansy.

I'm afraid to talk to someone about this issue. Based on what I do, I look like someone who just doesn't want to help herself. I'm not worth being helped by others.

I don't have a Mom or Dad to call who can tell me I'm the best and give me a confidence boost. I'm alone out here and just can't get it together mentally by myself. I could skate by with this anxious/depressed cycle while in college classes and managed a good GPA, but interviewing and all of this stuff is making me face it head on. I'm really feeling stuck based on the logic my brain uses to respond to inputs. I need to re-train my brain but there's no time. I need to get my shit together and get an interview since my current job will end in December.

How the hell can I squash that nagging voice inside that says ""you can't do it""?

Thanks."

Please keep in mind that I'm 23, still living on a budget (my previous rent in Boston was $1600 for a 2BR/1Bath, so I paid $800 with some utilities), yet I'll take what I can find that's fairly decent.
I'll be going down to the city for a weekend in about 2-3 weeks, and I'll be able to explore a bit, maybe even start looking at places and surroundings.

Thank you in advance!"

",I_PISS_Bong_WateR,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syyjl/day_2240_officially_reached_the_half_way_mark_now/,"Background: Quitting for 40 days for an internship drug test. I may decide to quit longer at the end of 40 days if I feel it is beneficial for me. Regular smoker for ~3.5 years


So this weekend was just another weekend without weed, uneventful and stressful. I really could have used a bowl yesterday after having a very long day of moving! But at the moment I have no weed and my pieces are all clean and put up, probably for the best. I still think about smoking weed constantly but that ""withdrawal"" symptoms are no longer there. I am happy I am still keeping it going, but I wonder if the feeling of wanting to smoke will ever go away? I am still kind of tired all of the time, and my motivation has dropped a little bit (I always considered weed as my motivator). Hopefully I can find something else to fill that void.


This is BY FAR the longest break I have ever had since starting smoking. After looking back on it, these 22 days kind of went by fast...hopefully motivation for others! I still have a ways to go but I know I can finish, and maybe continue longer !! 

I am here for any questions or guidance for anybody! Stay sober!!"
syyhi,330,2012-04-29,Drop Dead Gorgeous,longgonedarlin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/syyhi/drop_dead_gorgeous/,"We had two rules growing up.

One, always say thank you and you're welcome.
Two, never put yourself before others.

Being twenty years old and an intern at the largest modelling agency in the city, please and thank you didn't tend to get you very far. To tell the truth, the second rule really didn't either. 

I worked on the 15th floor, at beck and call to one of the costume designers. This woman was, to put it frankly, a straight bitch.

I remember one day I called my mother, crying, because the woman was so vile. My mother said, 'remember what I told you', and other comforting words, but those two rules really stuck with me.

I had my hands full with coffee and drafts on my way to work on a Monday morning, trying to keep my mother and I's conversation in my head. I hit the 'up' button on the elevator, and people poured in. The elevator itself had a ten-person limit. I somehow squashed into it with seven others. A young man, another intern, jumped on before the doors closed, when the heavy weight limit alarm went off. 

Everyone groaned, knowing someone would have to get off.

I looked at the man who had just got on, and he looked ready to cry. He must be late, I thought to myself. On an ordinary day, I would have forced him off, but I just couldn't do it, not with my mother's words ringing in my head.

'Never put yourself before others.'

I opened the doors to the elevator again, and hopped out, knowing I could just wait for the next one. I smiled at the guy, and he smiled back.

""Thank you,"" he said.

""You're welcome,"" I said. 

My faith in humanity restored, I didn't notice how strange it was that the weight limit for the elevator to be a person off.

I reported it to the maintenance man who nodded and said he'd check on it.

Later that evening, I flipped the news on and was shocked to see my place of work on the television screen, 'breaking news' in red scrolling beneath it.

I had heard that one of our models had gone missing that weekend.

Apparently someone had thrown her body into the elevator shaft.

No wonder the weight limit was off.

sywx6,4,2012-04-29,Any advice for someone looking to be a Database Admin?,herdyderdy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sywx6/any_advice_for_someone_looking_to_be_a_database/,"I'm graduating in about 6 months with a CS degree, and I've taken a couple elective classes that are heavy on databases/data streaming. These were by far the most interesting classes to me. If possible I'd like to get into DBA work or some kinda of database work as soon as possible when I graduate. All I can find though are job listings for people with 5+ years of database experience. I've only been looking in Portland, Oregon, however so maybe this isn't the greatest place for tech jobs (I'm planning on moving somewhere else when I graduate anyway). 

 I have about 6 months of experience in programming from an internship and a short contract job. Would these help me get a DBA position? "
